### Aajonus Provides Data and References In Support of Bacteria and Viruses

1. Pigs and monkeys can be kept too clean.
2. Bacteria and virus are naturally present in the company of degenerative tissue but are not the cause of degenerative tissue. They are the cleanup-crew for degenerative tissue.
3. As part of her doctoral studies in Toronto, Canada, Dr. Sara Arab injected verotoxin (bacterial byproduct) from E.coli directly into human astrocytoma (malignant tumors of the brain) that had been grown in mice.After a single injection, within 7-15 days both the tumors and their blood-vessels completely dissolved.
4. Joel Weinstock, a gastroenterologist who heads a research team at University of Iowa, asked six patients with intractable inflammatory bowel-disease to quaff worm-eggs in a liquid solution, specifically the eggs of Trichurissuis, a whipworm (parasite that looks like a whip) normally found in pigs. Within about two weeks, five of the six patients went into remission - for up to five months.
5. Jon Monroe, Director, New Science, tried in a project “to avoid diseases caused by viruses. The assumption was that viruses were pathogens and should be avoided.” But each of the subjects became depressed. With the reintroduction of virus, the depression-symptoms disappeared along with the return of colds and flu.
6. Monroe learned that “viruses can carry information from one individual to another and from one species to another. They are in reality, pathways within the environment for all living things to share critical information.
