### HEALTH OR DISEASE, DO WE HAVE A CHOICE?

by Aajonus Vonderplanitz

The medical profession is finally taking a closer look at alternative therapies for cancer and other diseases. Why? In spite of trillions of dollars in research and high-tech tools, medicine fails miserably. Diet is one factor being considered.

Nutritionist Dr. Aajonus Vonderplanitz is someone to whom a few important doctors are paying attention. The famous Dr. Robert Atkins, M.D., author of many best
selling books on diet and nutrition, said of Aajonus work and book entitled We
Want To Live, Revolutionary! This is an exciting book. An important
book. Aajonus was given 3 months to live after he was diagnosed and treated
for the deadliest cancer Multiple Myeloma (cancers of the blood and bone).
That was 30 years ago. Now, he looks at least 20 years younger than his age
61, muscular, radiantly healthy, doesn't exercise and has the clearest blue
eyes. His book tells how he and thousands of others reversed their diseases
and achieved mental clarity with diet. Unlike most nutritionists who focus on
nutritional supplementation, Aajonus is one who has concluded from his
experience that diet is everything and supplements are toxic. The foods he
suggests make most medical doctors hairs stand on end. But his suggestions
have reversed most diseases, consistently.

"We are made up of countless trillions of microbial life forms,
including bacterial, viral and cellular. We know that we have to eat to feed
and care for all of these life forms in our body. Food builds, grows,
regenerates, lubricates, soothes, cleanses and fuels us, along with
sleep and sunshine. Knowing this, how do we choose the best food to build,
grow, regenerate, lubricate, soothe, cleanse and fuel us? First, we
must look to other animals that eat correctly, instinctively, and are without
degenerative disease. Animals who have lived their entire life without
degenerative disease ate all of their food raw. In clinical tests by Dr.
Francis M. Pottenger, Jr., M.D., animals fed raw foods had no degenerative
disease, but animals that were fed cooked and processed food developed all of
the diseases that plague mankind. Nomadic North American natives, including
the Eskimo, mainly ate completely uncooked raw meat and ate plenty of raw fat,
and lived without degenerative disease. Archeologists have discerned that as
Native Americans began cultivating instead of hunting, relying on grain and
fruit, they developed bone diseases, including dental decay. Then when
whiteman brought them processed and cooked breads, sugars and alcohol, Natives
developed all of the diseases that "civilized" mankind suffers, including
heart diseases, cancer and diabetes. Before Britains, Germans, Russians and
Americans colonized in Alaska, the Eskimo did not have kettles in which to
cook their food. They never heard of sugar or bread. They ate their food raw,
which was 99% animal (fish, Caribou, seal, etc.). They lived free of
degenerative diseases until the 1860's, when dental decay first appeared.
Dental decay occurred only in Eskimos who lived in whiteman's colonies, eating
breads and sugar. The first case of cancer among Eskimos was in 1934. Like
dental decay, cancer appeared only among the Eskimo who mainly ate whiteman's
breads and sugars and cooked more. So, eating raw food is primary to living
without disease. Secondly, we must consider the make up of our
gastrointestinal system - the part of our body that digests and prepares food
into substances for building, growing, regenerating, lubricating, soothing,
cleansing and fueling us. Our intestine is 2 1/2 times shorter than most
herbivores (animals who mainly consume vegetation, such as cows, deer and
sheep). We have only one stomach while herbivores have 2 - 4. Herbivores have
nearly 60,000 times more enzymes than humans to disassemble cellulose (plant
fiber) to obtain the fat and proteins from vegetation and grain. Basically, we
don't digest vegetables and grain well; we are not herbivores. Our
gastrointestinal tract is very dissimilar to birds who eat a lot of grain
(seeds) and have very short intestine. We also lack their gizzard. We cannot
properly digest grain for regeneration and healing. Our intestinal shape is
like some frugivores, some primates, who mainly eat fruit. However, when
humans eat a lot of fruit they incur demineralization, including bone
deterioration, and dental decay. Also raw fruit over alkalinizes the
intestines, as do whole raw vegetables, destroying proper protein and fat
digestion, and destroying our ability to combine many foods. Unlike pure
frugivores and herbivores, we mainly have an acidic digestive tract, including
acidic bacteria, that facilitates digestion of animal products. If humans eat
too much fruit and/or whole vegetables, they lose more and more the ability to
digest food in its raw state - the state of unadulterated vitamins, enzymes,
minerals, fats and proteins. Then there is the omnivore, such as the pig, who
eats everything. Our digestive tract is similar in size and action to a pig's.
Finally, there is the carnivore, such as cats and dogs, who mainly eat meat.
Our digestive juices are most similar to the carnivore. In their stomach the
hydrochloric acid concentration is 15 times greater than a humans so that they
digest meat in 10 hours accommodating their very short intestine. However,
humans produce an equal amount of hydrochloric acid throughout the stomach and intestine combined, allowing raw meat and other raw animal products to digest
in 16 hours in our much longer digestive tract without putrefaction. (Cooked
meat takes 24-36 hours to digest poorly, never digests without toxicity, and
often putrefies.) Why, you ask, then, are we told to mainly eat grains and
vegetables? It seems to have started a long time ago. The most plausible
explanation is that a major transition had to occur when nomadic man decided
to settle in one place. After consuming most of the animal life around their
dwellings they had to eat something else. Rather than leave their homes,
migrate to where more meat was and rebuild a village, they found ways to
utilize vegetation and seeds (vegetables and grain). They learned that cooking
broke down cellulose and allowed their digestive tract to utilize more
substances from grains and vegetables. The price of cooking, however, created
other problems. Cooking destroys enzymes and vitamins, alters fats and
proteins into toxic substances, such as, lipid oxides. Lipid oxides and other
toxins that result from cooking food are disease producing and carcinogenic,
especially when collected in the body for 20 - 60 years, depending upon a
person's individual health. Cooking, therefore, causes toxins to accumulate in
the body and nutritional deficiencies, eventuating into diseases of all kinds,
depending upon an individual's strengths and weaknesses. Disease is the
collection of toxins, both natural (for instance, bodily by-products, such as
dead cells, lactic acid, urea, and poisonous plants) and unnatural (for
example, chemicals, including cooked and processed food), caused by
malnourishment and environmental pollution. Today people eat mainly grain
products (bread, pasta, cereal, etc.) and vegetables because they are less
expensive than meat (all flesh food, including fish, fowl, beef, lamb), eggs
and dairy products. Another reason is that science and medicine blame many
diseases on people who eat much red meat, dairy, eggs and, generally, fats.
However, fat-free diets have caused a startling increase in degenerative
diseases in the past two decades. Non-meat diets slow healing and
regeneration. Science and medicine keep missing the bottom line regarding
health and well-being. And the media parrots the misinformation to us, the
public. Why do they miss the point? Science and medicine blame Nature for
disease. They are afraid of Nature. However, no wild animal has degenerative
diseases unless their raw food supply is altered or eliminated or poisoned.
Science and medicine blame "harmful" microbes for disease instead of blaming
the poor environment that gestates and harbors "harmful" microbes. Actually,
those microbes are beneficial and necessary toward removing disease and
potentially diseased conditions. Like vultures, crows and worms, these
microbes prevent the environment from becoming a gaseous toxic waste dump;
they dissolve and/or eat the decay. Eliminating vultures, crows and worms is
dangerous to the environment for most life on earth. Eliminating microbes,
such as, E. coli, salmonella, campylobacter, forces decaying tissue to remain
in the body, and the body gets sicker over time. Blaming microbes for disease
is the same as blaming vultures and crows for the decaying carcasses that they
find and eat. We don't have to be afraid of bacteria. Eating diseased animals
means that we eat toxicity that comes from animals fed processed food,
hormones, antibiotics and chemicals. The blame should issue not on bacteria
but on feeding us diseased animals, like Mad Cow, and cooked processed and
chemically poisoned food stuff. Next, we need to determine the appropriate
quantities of fat, protein, vegetable juice and fruit to consume in order to
achieve better health. This always depends on the individual but, we can make a very good general approximation with the information in this article. I have
said that tremendous quantities of raw fat are important for optimal health.
Fats are the most utilized nutrient in the human body. Fats are formed into
white blood cells (antibodies), into lubricants to protect all cells, into
solvents in conjunction with alcohol formed from fruit to remove all sorts of
toxic substances, into the greatest and strongest energy possible, and into
body heat to keep warm from the cold or into body coolant to keep cool from
the heat. The healthiest tribes, like the Eskimo, consumed fat as 60-80% of
their caloric intake. They endured the coldest temperatures. The Samburu
tribes in Africa consume 60-80% fat to endure very hot temperatures. Neither
Eskimo nor Samburu suffered any heart maladies as long as they ate their
natural diet of raw meat and fat without sugar or bread. Proteins in the form
of meat are necessary to build and regenerative cells throughout the body. Red meat - beef, buffalo, venison, lamb, etc. - quickly regenerates and develops
most glandular tissue and muscle. White meat - squirrel, rabbit, chicken,
turkey and other fowl - more easily build and regenerate connective tissue,
skin, and tissue in general. Seafood - wild and nonfarmed - more easily
builds, regenerates and reconstitutes nerves including brain. Fresh raw
unpasteurized vegetable juices are important for optimal health because they
are the only nontoxic vitamin, enzyme and mineral supplementation. Pill and
powder supplements are only 2-12% properly utilized and are 88-98% waste to be
eliminated using vital nutrients. Supplements may be used as emergency
medicine but they mostly decrease health rather than promote well-being. Most
pill and powder supplements create a toxic high that gives unhealthy energy,
as caffeine does. Fresh raw unpasteurized vegetable juices alkalinize the
blood without alkalinizing the acid parts of our digestive tract. We need the
vegetable juices to replace all of the vitamins, enzymes and minerals lost,
and to manage toxicity resultant from years of eating cooked food. It is
important to restrict the quantity of high carbohydrate vegetables juices,
such as carrot and beet. Carrot and beet juices raise the blood sugar level
too high, only to drop and leave us fatigued, sleepy, irritable and depressed.
A suggested, balanced vegetable juice mixture per cup would be 6 ozs. celery
juice, 2 ozs. parsley or spinach juice, and 2 ozs. carrot juice. A little
fruit provides carbohydrate needed to properly utilize fat for energy and
solvents. Our bodies make a certain amount of alcohol from fruit. Over-eating
fruit causes the blood sugar level to soar and the pancreas to overwork to
lower it. Eating too much fruit, even when raw, often gives a manic-like
energy that drops quickly and leaves us fatigued, irritable, sleepy and
depressed. I have found that it is wise to eat fruit with some form of fat to
slow the fruit in digestion, preventing it from being utilized as a stored
blood sugar (glycogen). For the reasons above, I have also found that it is
wiser to eat the whole fruit (except rind) and rarely consume fruit juices.
Considering all of the above, an optimal diet would be all organically grown
raw food consisting daily of one piece of fruit or one salad a day, 1 pound or
more of raw meat (red meat, and/or seafood, and/or fowl), 1/2-2 lbs. of raw
fat (cream, unsalted butter, unsalted cheese, eggs, coconut, avocado, oils
cold-pressed below 96F.) especially raw eggs, raw milk and coconut, and 1-4
cups of raw vegetable juices. This type of diet, which I call the Primal diet,
has reversed 95% of all types of disease where medical treatment was declined.
It has been difficult for people to reverse disease after they endured medical
drugs, surgery and radiation. In such cases under present studies, reversal
rate after medical treatment with my Primal diet is 20-40%. We do have a
choice about how healthy we are, and will be, and if we will enjoy life
without degenerative disease. 

How healthy do you want to be, and do you want to live disease-free?
