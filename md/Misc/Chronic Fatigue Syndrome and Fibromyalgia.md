### Chronic Fatigue Syndrome (CFS) and Fibromyalgia (FM)

by Aajonus Vonderplanitz

Two factors cause the rampant, modern progression of afflictions such as cancer, diabetes, osteoporosis, obesity, heart disease, CFS and FM. The first factor is eating cooked and/or processed food that is devoid of live nutrients and full of the toxic byproducts of cooking, pesticides and other chemicals. (If you are interested in the names and research on those toxins, see my new book [The Recipe For Living Without Disease](/the-recipe-for-living-without-disease))

The second factor is environmental pollution. The industrial and chemical revolutions have created over 6,000 bizarre foreign chemicals that our bodies have not succeeded in processing as food or air. Toxic accumulations within our bodies cause more deterioration. Some chemicals cause immediate death, but most cause the gradual degeneration that leads to poor-quality health. The dithiocarbamates are a group of fungicides including mancozeb, metiram, zineb and ziram which have a metabolite called ethylene thiourea (ETU.) This breakdown product is a known endocrine-disruptor, carcinogen, mutagen and teratogen, and can become concentrated during processing and heating. In other words, if you cook a vegetable that has been sprayed with mancozeb (the most common,) you will be increasing the amount of this dangerous metabolite. In New Zealand, over 60% of the 138 samples of fruit and vegetables analyzed for dithiocarbamates in the latest total diet survey contained dithiocarbamates. The levels are worse in the USA.

In the 1860's, dental decay first appeared among the Eskimo people, occurring only in Eskimos who lived in white man's colonies eating breads and sugar. The first case of cancer among Eskimos occurred in 1934. Like dental decay, cancer appeared only among second- and above generations of Eskimos who ate breads, sugar and cooked food for nearly a century.

Eskimos lived as long as we do, with the same percentage of people exceeding the age of 100 years. Eskimos who ate their normal raw diet enjoyed teeth so strong that they chewed on bones during evening congregations. Osteoporosis only occurred in Eskimos who ate cooked, refined foods. If you placed average civilized humans of the 21st Century in the Alaskan environment and required that they live as the primitive Eskimo did, most would die within one winter.

Disease originates from within the body because of the destruction of cellular integrity by toxic food and/or pollution. Our bodies remove, repair, rebuilt and regenerate from toxicity with the help of microbes that become alive and active at the time of cellular degeneration, causing fermentation and other forms of decomposition. Microbes are beneficial, some for cleansing, some for maintenance and others for regeneration. None are the cause of disease. Mycoplasma-fermentation is one such microbe that is often found in CFS/FM-suferers.

The treatment of symptoms, rather than the causes of disease, has proved to imbalance body chemistry and has filled our bodies with more toxins. Most often, those toxins cause loss of quality of life and more disease. The foundation and structure of modern medicine is disease, not wellness. Humanity suffers from disease because we do not focus on rational cure and prevention.

Today's medical science tries to prevent microbes, rather than pollution, from entering our bodies or spontaneous internal microbe-activity. It attempts to cleanse Nature's ubiquitous microbes from the body, rather than cleanse us of toxins. Medical therapies annihilate our cells, rather than nurture us with the liveliest, nutrient- and bacteria-rich, raw food. Nurturing is the wisest approach to the prevention and reversal of disease if we wish to maintain and/or restore the highest quality of a fully enjoyable, rich life, even if we live in simplicity. I suppose that because we are a warring society, we chose to blame microbes as invading forces and do battle rather than nurture. Nurturing would require a vast change in our life styles. Modern medicineï¿½s justification for microbial wars is based on speculation and fear, not on objective and impartial science.

People have successfully utilized my Primal Diet exclusively to reverse and heal from CFS and FM. Of nearly 100 cases of CFS and FM that I have seen, all of the severe cases were extremely thin or trim before adopting the Primal Diet. Fat absorbs toxins and prevents toxins from damaging other cells. If we are thin, toxins are dispersed throughout tissues and damage and/or enter cells. Many times, toxins enter lymphatic, glandular, neural and bone marrow cells where there are high-fat ratios. When those areas are too laden with toxins, the body distributes the toxins to connective tissue and muscles. Cells are damaged and mutated, causing soreness and weakness. Cells cannot function properly. They often become fatigued and debilitated.

Heavy metal toxicity, such as mercury-poisoning from vaccines, often causes CFS and FM. Vaccines contain thimerosal, which is 50% liquid mercury. Mercury is one of the most toxic substances to the human body. Usually, the gradual accumulation of toxins that causes systemic toxicity is responsible for CFS/FM. However, one exposure to a caustic toxin can render people crippled with CFS/FM overnight. Note that even the 4% of CFS/FM-sufferers who did not reproduce cells showed indications of improvement on the Primal Diet. Diet is primary to proper cleansing of toxins and healing. Raw fat is the predominant factor in reversal.

The reversal of CFS and FM has occurred more rapidly in people who force themselves to get fat on healthy, easily digestible and utilizable raw fats. The best fats are raw eggs, unsalted raw butter and raw cream. Protein is necessary for fat digestion, assimilation and utilization, and proper healing. I have observed that eating at least one pound of raw meats with raw eggs, raw butter and/or raw cream daily facilitates the reversal of CFS and FM within 2 years in 96% of the cases in which I facilitated reversal and healing. The 4% that have had very slow progress fail to divide cells, that is, they do not reproduce cells to heal properly. If the cells cannot divide, they do not add live cells to their bodies. The toxins that have entered their cells have rendered those cells impotent and sterile. As cells die, they are not replaced and the body becomes even weaker.
