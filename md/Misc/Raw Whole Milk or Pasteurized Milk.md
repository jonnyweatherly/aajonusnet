### What to Consider When Deciding to Drink Raw Whole milk or Pasteurized Milk

by Aajonus Vonderplanitz, Nutritional Scientist/Nutritionist/Author

### Pasteurization - What It Does

Pasteurization alters and/or destroys proteins, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, natural antigens and many unknown
benefactors. When these nutrients/elements are altered and/or destroyed they become toxins requiring isolation,
neutralization, dissolution or fractionation and elimination. These processes become more difficult as aging occurs. The
minerals that are cauterized at pasteurization temperature often become glass-like and sharp, frequently lacerating liver, blood
and nerve cells.

In a body that is unable to produce quality mucus and other protective agents, lacerated cells is very often
the cause of allergies when drinking pasteurized milk. Pasteurized fats become lipid oxides which are known carcinogens. Pasteurized proteins foster tremendous accumulations of uric acid in many individuals, often causing gout, muscular and glandular fatigue.  Pasteurized dairy causes varying degrees of osteoporosis and dental caries. Many individuals produce tremendous amounts of mucus to eliminate the toxins from pasteurized dairy.

Pasteurized dairy frequently causes varying degrees of loss of concentration, loss of focus and loss of mental clarity.
Bacteria breeding in pasteurized dairy become mutant and foreign to the human digestive system, often causing severe
illness and sometimes death.

### Raw Whole Milk

Raw whole milk promotes quality tissue development, natural antibodies, and general good all around health. Raw whole milk, and, especially, raw cream promote calm and protected nerves. Raw whole milk helps isolate, neutralize, dissolve and eliminate poisons, including vermin and snake bites, and toxins. Raw whole milk prevents and reverses malnutrition. Bacteria breeding in raw whole milk promotes detoxification of accumulated toxins, mutant cells and decay, including reversal of cancer.

There has not been any scientific study done to prove bacteria grown in raw milk is deleterious or dangerous to health.
Numerous sickly, "high risk" individuals have reversed their diseases with the help of raw whole milk by its ingestion.
Infants and adults are generally healthier when raised on raw whole milk.

The choice whether to consume raw or pasteurized dairy seems obvious: raw promotes health; pasteurized promotes ill health.
Many details of the vitamins and minerals destroyed in milk by pasteurization can be found in THE MILK BOOK by W. C.
