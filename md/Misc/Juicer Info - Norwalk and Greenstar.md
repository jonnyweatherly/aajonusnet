The following is from Aajonus, in response to questions:

In about 1996, I took one bag from a Norwalk user and looked at it under an electronic microscope and compared it with a new unused bag. The old one (about 5 years old) had fragmented fibers, which means that plastic fibers broke into the juice. Our digestive acids do dissolve those fibers. It was easier to investigate the bags (I paid for the cost of one new bag only) than the expensive chemical tests that would have cost around $6k at the time, that would now cost about $9-11K.

If they claim that they upgraded the bags, I suggest you find one that has been used for at least 2 years and compare it with a new bag under an electronic microscope. If the used bag shows particularization, vomit with a little meat in your stomach. Particularize some bag fibers and put it in your vomit and see if your hydrochloric acids dissolves it.

I remember a test that was paid for by GreenStar about 10 years ago that showed Norwalk juices suffered damaging oxidation that shortened the life of the juice. Therefore, I do not think that Norwalk's paid-for analysis was complete. The juice from the GreenStar showed slightly longer bioactive enzymatic action than the Norwalk. The mineral content was a little more from the GreenStar because of the magnetic gears. Even though you get more juice from the Norwalk, it seems that what we get more of is water not nutrients with plastic particles.

Consider that when grinding the vegetables separately, there is more oxidation between the stages. If the pressing immediately occurs in the same hermetic environment as the grinding, then only when the juices pour from the spout is the juice exposed to oxidation.

Also, consider that the EMF exposure to the new GreenStar Elite is considerably lower than that of both stages of the Norwalk when you juice the way I suggested in my recipe DVD.

As I have stated many times, the water soluble fats are the most abundant and most fragile to oxidation. The test-analysis you read may have considered only the oil soluble fats.

Certainly you could add a oil such as coconut oil or olive oil but you would have less Vit. that would accompany the vegetable oils. If you added an animal fat to it, as I suggest for many people, it is helpful to prevent the nutrients from entering the fluid systems of your body too fast and losing those nutrients through the urinary tract.

If you juice the way that I showed in my recipe DVD, juicing time will not be significantly greater, only the cleanup-time might be, depending on your efficiency. The juicer will also last many years beyond 13.

appreciatively and healthfully,

From Aajonus in an earlier email:
> Juice is more vulnerable than fats but can withstand artificial temperatures up to 94F. If you are juicing the way I demonstrate in my recipe video, you will never have juice pressed above 94F especially with the new Elite GreenStar.
>
> There are several problems with the Norwalk: fibers from the bag break-off and get into juice; The pulp is exposed to oxidation when taking from grinding process to bag; and it filters out some of the food that contains fat, that is why you get the rush (most of the time it is not a healthy rush).
