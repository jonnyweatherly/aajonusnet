### Foreword

Aajonus regarded each person who consulted him as unique. When someone
consulted him, their discussion was private. The iris photos belong to the
person. The transcript and iris photos herein are permitted by the person
himself for the purposes of information and education. Aajonus did not teach
iridology as such however one can learn from what he saw and what he said.

Here is a transcript of an actual Iridology Consult Aajonus gave to a client in 2013. The exact photos he analyzed during the consult are shown at the top.
Right eye at the top, Left eye below that.


### RIGHT EYE

### LEFT EYE

### The Iridology Consult

A: The sclera of the eye; the white, relates to bone marrow, remember when I
said the red and white blood cells mature there, and once they’re mature they
enter the bloodstream. It’s supposed to be a pinkish white, and you can see
yours is a bluish grayish white. Lots of aluminum and tin in your bone
marrow. And that obstructs the cell’s ability to develop properly, so as much
as you have in the bone marrow, probably is obscuring about eighteen percent
of your energy level. Right off the bat.

B: Yeah?

A: Yeah. And if you’ve got that laptop sitting on your lap and charging those
with that EMF field, that metal in your bone marrow is going to double it.
Double and triple. Every cell that’s created during that period.

B: That why I fell asleep while I was sitting there?

A: Yeah, and that’ll charge them and then they won’t be able to develop
properly. Yeah, so, it just reduces your ability to have more energy. When you
divide each eye between twelve and six o’clock the outer half of each eye
applies to the outer respective quadrant of the body. The inner half of each
eye applies to the opposite inner quadrant of the body. So, it’s just the insides
cross over. So, the “R” means right eye, so this is the outer right side of the
body, inner left. Left eye, outer left side of the body, inner right. So, the insides
just cross over, just like the frontal lobes cross over. The lightest color in the
eye is what the color of the eye is supposed to be. So, we have powder blue in
a few places here. So, all these fibers are supposed to be light blue fibers with
dark blue in between, not gray, charcoal gray. This means you’ve got metals
everywhere in your body. Especially in the intestinal tract. So, your food’s
being poisoned all the time. All day long, every time you eat. That’s why I want
you to use cheese that we talked about.

B: Right.

A: Cheese, eating that cheese can pull it out.

B: Okay.

A: I tell the relative health of the body by the consistency of fibers. Here’s a
very consistent fiber. In density, strength, and starts from the beginning here
at the autonomic nerve belt and goes all the way out to the edge. You can’t see
the edge because you’ve got too much lymphatic waste out here and too much
lymphatic congestion. Should be a dark blue, sharp ring around here with the fibers, light blue fibers, fading off into the dark blue. And you see, you can’t see
any of yours. Your vacuum cleaners are full bags.

B: Yeah.

A: You need to empty the bags. And that’s a hot tub.

B: Okay.

A: Your fibers are pretty good, so it shows a lot of good cells alive. You’ve got a
lot of deformities in here from vaccines and stuff your mother took while you
were inside or stuff that was in her body, but nothing that causes too much
impairment. Like this is a mutation, this is an unusually, incredibly good fiber.
And the others are not. But this is caused by a vaccine here; you’ve got all that
mercury in there, and formaldehyde, and aluminum. The aluminum in the
sclera looks blue; the aluminum in the iris looks like a silver lavenderish color.
So, all that silver lavenderish color going through there is all aluminum. And
this black stuff is mercury. Thin, it’s not even thin here, it’s very intense right
there. Two of your vaccines got into your bronchials, and two got into the
lung, this is the upper lobe of the lung, middle lobe, lower lobe. Pretty good. I
mean, you withstood a lot. Forty-seven years old, most people don’t have this
many cells alive in their lungs. But even though you’ve got a lot of cells alive,
your lymphatic system is jammed. All the nodes and glands are just too full.
They can’t clean up anymore.

B: Of oils, you mean? What we were talking about?

A: Plastic, yeah.

B: Plastic, right.

A: As much as you exercise, you wouldn’t have any oils, you wouldn’t have any
congestion. Only way we get them is having plastic oils.

B: Yeah.

A: They wouldn’t exist. You wouldn’t see that at all, all you’d see is these light
blue fibers going out into dark blue. That’s it. You wouldn’t see any of this
tarnished stuff and impacted lymphatic system. It just wouldn’t appear. But
trans fatty acids cause it. And you just can’t clear little balls of plastic.

B: When you see people, when you can physically see yellow around their
eyes, does that mean that they’re?

A: Not necessarily. If it’s foggy like this, yes.

B: Yeah.


A: Yellow means that there’s a lot of penicillin in the body, okay? So, you’ve got
penicillin in your lymphatic glands. Penicillin, even though it’s not a good one;
it has no shutoff valve because they’ve sterilized it, penicillin comes from
cheese and it’s a good thing.

B: Okay.

A: It’ll help break down stuff.

B: Right.

A: But it can’t break down plastic. Penicillin does not break down plastic. Now
I’m not saying getting a penicillin injection is good, it isn’t. Because they’ve sterilized it.

B: Right.

A: And it doesn’t react the way it should. See, molds, fungus’s when they are
alive, they act and they’ll be active for a period of let’s say three months. They
go dormant three months. Active three months, dormant three months.
Penicillin sterilized, there’s no off switch. So, you have the waste products.
Remember what I said about fungus, their waste products are twenty times
that of bacteria and parasites and cause itching and dryness. You need a lot
more fat for that. So, it has a tendency to dry people out when it’s constantly
working. Anyway, that lung, see all this is dead cells that are collecting. Waste
you’re not able to get rid of. So, it’s just collecting because your lymphatic
system has no more room in the bag. Take a look at the right rib cage. Again,
metals everywhere. Some of these fibers are very thin because of the
injections in the right arm. You can see how thin this one gets. A lot of thin
stuff here. Here you’ve got mutations where you’re crossing around, where
energy will spin around. If you have a lot of those like you do, that causes
twitches, you just get uncomfortable sitting still so, you do stuff like that. To
discharge that energy that just spirals around, spins around in there. Usually
when people get on this diet, after about six or nine months, all that goes away
because the body’s intelligence increases and the toxicity lowers so that the
body doesn’t get confused and takes care of rerouting stuff. So, all that stuff
right now causing all that jitteriness in your right side over here will be
discharged. This, again, is heavy lymphatic congestion in all the glands and
nodes. Right now, this is called a rosary because of beads; that’s all you need is
the Catholic Church in your body to remind you.

B: Right.


A: And you do. You have that rosary that’s around. It’s better than a belt. When
you have a belt it’s even jammed up in the passageways in the lymphatic
system. So, you haven’t jammed up all of your passageways yet. Some of them
are. So, this is the entire rib cage from here all the way down to here. And then
this is the right arm here, and you can see the damage here. Yeah, weakened
fibers from injection, damaged and broken. Heavy mercury and aluminum in
this area here, just ate a hole in your tissues. And then this is the gall bladder.
And you can see how fine those tissues are. Those are also damaged. And this
is the liver. A little stronger, but you’ve got lymphatic waste there. And some
of those fibers are rather thin. And this is the pancreas here. And the right
testicle, you can see you’ve got scar tissue in that testicle. That pancreas is
okay. It was damaged a little bit here from vaccines. And then this is the rest of
the groin area and, of course, the lymphatic system is completely blocked.

B: What’s the scar tissue in the testicle from?

A: Had to have been probably penicillin.

B: Oh.

A: ...because it’s kind of a burn. This is the right leg and you got one shot as an
infant way up here. That’s this right here. Probably a tetanus shot. I don’t
know if you had pneumonia or whatever it was. With infants they give them
tetanus shots. If it’s a bad cold or if it’s pneumonia or bronchitis, something
like that, they’ll give a shot. And some of it moved over and damaged your shin- your knee, just a little bit. That’s not bad. But you have a ton of scar tissue
here. Going right down just slightly to the left of center. So that’s built up in
there. That was probably because of an injection. Although it didn’t open like
this one, you didn’t try to keep the mercury from going into the cells, you built
it in scar tissue around. This looks like it infiltrated all those cells. And rather
than creating a lesion like these did, it just damaged all the tissue all the way
down. So that can cause a little tightness in this leg all the way down. Just
make you slightly less agile than you should be. Then we move over to the
inner left side of the body. This is the left adrenal gland; you can see the
mercury poisoning in there. And all the damaged scar tissue and the belt
around it. And this is the left kidney. And some damage there, some of that
mercury leaked down into the kidney. But it’s still okay. Heavy lymphatic
congestion. The lymphatic system isn’t blocked in the foot and ankle from
about mid shin; you see where the scar tissue stops? That’s about mid shin
down; very little lymphatic congestion. But all the way from mid shin, all the
way up, heavy lymphatic congestion, the worst lymphatic congestion. All your
lymph glands in here are jammed. So that’s going to make your legs weaker, you’re going to tire more easily, because you’re not cleaning out the lymphatic
waste or the byproducts of metabolism, the lactic acid. And you’re going to
break it down slower. Of course, being in the heat and the sun and perspiring
and exercising helps, but unless you get those plastic balls to melt and get it
out of the body, you’ll never be high efficiency. You’re just going to get slower
and slower as you get older. Now we know what to do and you’re never going
to get old, okay? Wipe it out, and you can just exercise like crazy your whole
life. And I can see that’s what you like, you have a lot of activity rings.

B: Is this something that would have been present when I was young as well?
You know, a teenager?

A: Well, it depends on what your mother ate.

B: Yeah, I just, because, sometimes when I feel drained, I think about it and it’s
like, you know I wonder if I’m just lazy because I felt this when I was a kid.

A: No.

B: I wonder if I’m just a lazy individual.

A: Your mother was born in the forties, right?

B: Yeah, right, forties. Yep.

A: Okay. That’s when all that started. The canned foods and all of the
hydrogenated oils. Margarine. All of that came out at that time. So of course,
she was loaded up on it. So, when you were born, she passed it on to you. She
was probably eating it when you were born or gestating, and then you were
fed it. So, it’s been there a very long time. Okay, you have one, two, three, four
five, six, seven, eight activity rings. Athletes have seven to fourteen activity
rings. So, you’re on the low side of the top athletes. On this diet when people
get on this diet, the low athletes are the top athletes. So, what that means is
these rings that pass through here tell me that you produce one hour of
activity hormones daily. So, you have to have eight hours of activity minimum
in the daytime. If you’re in anxiety, you have to exercise. If you don’t, you’re
going to express it in anxiety and that makes people miserable.

B: Yeah.

A: Yeah. Friendships go to hell and everything just goes to hell.

B: Yeah.

A: When you’re letting it out that way. And having a lot of fat on you calms that
too because the body can always arrest excess in fat and then bring it out
when it needs it. When it starts using that fat into energy, you’ll even have more bursts of energy. But when you have no fat in your tissues like you do,
you know, you’re just too lean. You know.

B: Want me to show you my fat?

A: That’s nothing, that’s nothing! You should have seen Schwarzenegger
before he would exhibit. He had rolls.

B: Yeah?

A: Fat everywhere. He looked like a wrestler! I mean, a strong healthy
wrestler. And then he would get really weak. When he was exhibiting. because
he goes six weeks without eating hardly any fat. You get lean. And he was
nasty when he was like that.

B: But what about these performance athletes you see and they’re lean, you
know?

A: Well they don’t last very long.

B: Yeah.

A: They burn out in their late thirties and they’re gone. They’re all dried up.

B: Yeah, that’s the typical lifespan of an athlete. What did you say about eight
hours?

A: You need eight hours of activity daily.

B: Okay. So, if I’m sitting at a desk most of the time.

A: You’re going to be in trouble.

B: Yeah?

A: You’re going to be antsy. So, you better exercise. Activity just means being
busy. Moving around, doing things. Eight hours of that. If you don’t do that,
when you do exercise you better do three, four hours. Three hours a day
about. Until you’ve released it all. If you haven’t released it all you’re going to
be in anxiety.

B: Well, I’ll tell you, the first thing I’ve noticed being on this diet, I had just a
tension, a muscle tension from here down, I went to see doctors and massage
therapists and this and that for at least eight months to a year. And, after my
first detox it went away and it hasn’t come back since. And I feel more relaxed.
Almost to the point where I’m not used to it, you know. I kind of miss being,
you know.

A: You don’t want to be that way because you’re not as dexterous.


B: Yeah, well

A: Up in that right shoulder, you’re talking about the left, but that right
shoulder you got all those spirals. We’re going to find them on the left too and
you were just generating too much energy. All your life you have. Now it’s
time to be more focused and more agile. You’re going to be better. I’ve got a
champion, martial artist, who’s like sixty-seven now and when he started on
the diet about eleven years ago, he was coming in about anywhere from thirty
fifth to fiftieth place. That’s good for a world competition.

B: Sure, sure.

A: And his heart rate, can you imagine doing twelve thousand jump ropes in
one hour?

B: Aw, man.

A: Okay. Twelve thousand and four hundred jump ropes in one hour. You
know, but his heart rate; when he finished, his heart rate he’d logged it all
these years and you can see his heart rates about 181 averaging and lasts that
way for almost ten minutes and took slow to go down. A year after he was on
the diet, within two and a half minutes I think it was he charted, his heart rate
was down to 110. His body, the heart rate, everything could handle the
toxicity and just lowered that quickly. He came in fifth place that year.

B: Oh, wow.

A: Ever since then he’s come in third to first place. The last three years, first
place. And he’s fighting kids, he went into a lower division to fight them too,
and he won all of those too. He’s fighting kids twenty-five years younger than
he is.

B: [laughs]

A: And beating them. And that’s what people do on this diet. It’s phenomenal.

B: Yeah.

A: So, you’re going to have a whole different sense. And he used to be that, you
know, hyperactive and jittery. Now he’s just calm and he’s deliberate.

B: That’s the thing, when I’m intense I’m not thinking clearly, so is that what
you’re saying?

A: Yeah. When you’re thinking clearly and you’re deliberate you’re going to
have much more dexterity.


B: Yeah. I took martial arts for several years and that was always the problem
in the sparring was, once the mind started racing it was difficult, yeah.

B: What do you use for your laptop when you don’t have a desk.

A: I just have a separate little fold up stand and I put that on it and then the
keyboard is on my lap, not the laptop.

A: Okay, you can see the adrenal gland is full of mercury and aluminum and
formaldehyde there. So that’s a little complication. This is the left side of the
urinary bladder and you have some spiraling there. That kind of spiraling
happens in the toxicity in the mother while you’re gestating. But again, that
nervous bladder will relax once you get the fats in the system a little better.
And this is the left side of the back and look how much waste product is
building up in there. You must use your arms a lot. So, all that waste product,
all the dead cells, your back is full. Everywhere. And your lymph glands,
you’ve got a lymphatic belt here. Not even the rosary, it’s just jammed. So that
means all of these lymph glands, everywhere on the left side are jammed.
Okay, so we have all that congestion, all at the left side of the back. All the way
up, you have a spiral there up in the shoulder on the left side. That’s the one
you were talking about. See that big spiral?

B: Okay.

A: It just sends the energy spinning. It’ll cause tightness as debris collects and
all that lymphatic congestion is there too. In fact, that’s a little shrunken
because the lymphatic glands should be way out here. When they’re inside,
that means they’re smaller than they should be. So that’s a slight deformity.
But it’s just right there. Right here, this area, they’re shrunken. And then they
go back into the proper place again so. And you can see they’re all beaded up
here. So very shrunken right there at that shoulder. And then this is the left
breast area. And fibers are pretty good. Lymphatic waste collecting there and
some lymphatic congestion. This is the trachea and it’s good. Larynx, a little
scarred. Did you have your tonsils removed?

B: Uh, no.

A: I see a lot of scar tissue there. Say “Aaaah...”

B: Aaaah....

A: Boy, they are almost nonexistent. They’re just red. Look like they’re just red
inflamed things.

B: I used to get a lot of sore throats when I was a kid.


A: Yeah. But you have no gland there. It’s just flat red. So, you’ve dissolved
them.

B: The tonsils?

A: Yeah. Tonsils are small lymphatic glands. They’re little hard lymphatic
glands that protect, you know, the brain. And yours aren’t there.

B: How does that happen?

A: Well, yours are just deteriorated. Whatever you got, antibiotics or
something went in there and just dissolved them, so. But, because they’re still
red there, they can regrow.

B: Hm.

A: ...because it’s not scar tissue. You have scar tissue there. But you have no
gland.

B: Would singing deteriorate them?

A: No.

B: No? Okay.

A: Singing would help them, strengthen them. And that’s another thing. If you
feel high anxiety and you don’t have the energy to exercise, sing. Twenty
minutes of singing is an hour on the treadmill.

B: Yeah.

A: If you don’t have a good voice, pass out some earplugs.

A: And then up here, this is the left eye and you’ve got some congestion in there
but it’s okay. But heavy lymphatic congestion and lymphatic waste all up in there.
This is the inner left quadrant of the brain. And a lot of toxicity there, also
collecting and jammed. The outer right side, outer right quadrant of the brain, is
much better here, not as much lymphatic congestion. You do have some scarring
here in the nerves going to the brain. The pupil relates to the stomach and that’s
supposed to be a flat dark black, and this should be a clean line around here; all
this is mercury. Tattooed into your intestinal tract. Plus, you have a Crohn’s radius
here. Which means that’s what people who have Crohn’s have. I’m not an MD
diagnosing Crohn’s but Crohn’s is when you don’t create enough mucus and your
own digestive acids and bacteria eat away at your intestines and they become thin.
And then they tear and you get leaky gut. And usually you have joint problems
because the joints become the digestive areas of that leaky gut. So, yours looks like
only first stage here in your ascending colon, transverse to here. Little bit worse in
the transverse. Over here in the small intestine on the left side it looks like second stage and there are four stages. That haze over here! See how there’s no haze here?
There’s a haze over here. That means that your lymphatic system is keeping your
lymph, your neurological and blunt fluids clean by only about fifty percent. This
should be as clear as this is but it isn’t, it’s foggy. And all of that in between is
black so you put almost all of the mercury from your vaccines in your intestinal
tract. So, you need to do that cheese. At least every twenty minutes. Just pull that
out as fast as possible. because that’s what limiting you the most.

B: One thing about the cheese; except for when you’re doing meals, right? Then
you’re waiting a period before you do the cheese again?

A: Every twenty minutes, yeah.

B: But if I just had a meat meal, you know, and it’s twenty minutes, then I skip the
cheese, right? And maybe do the cheese twenty minutes after the meal, before and
then after? Right? Or am I doing it with?

A: Well, you’re going to do it with, too, with this kind of mercury in your intestinal
tract and stomach.

B: Well, so...

A: I’m going to give you a diet.

B: Oh, okay.

A: So, let’s take a look at the other eye. Okay, let’s start with the lung here. You
have lots of spiraling stuff here too in this lung. Not as much damage as far as
mercury damage collecting in the bronchials like you did in the other but you have
a lot of dead cells collecting. And remember, dead cells collecting is moving
toward cancer because the cancers just collecting dead cells. So that lung is going
toward cancer. But, just collecting dead cells, cancer’s not a bad thing. I’ve been in
and out of it eight times in my lifetime. And you get through it as long you don’t
attack your body. You know, even though I attacked it the first time, I let them
attack me, I still recovered only with the grace of that man. Young fellow who
turned me onto the carrot juice and milk. And you have heavy lymphatic glands,
congested glands here, lymphatic waste. So, you just need to clear that. This is the
heart; your right ventricle is much better than your left. Your left is a little thin, but
that’s okay because that’s where the blood passes out. You need the stronger on the
right side so that’s a pretty good heart. Slightly larger than it should be but that’s
good for an athlete. This is the right rib cage and now you can see that these are
more accordion-ed. That’s because the pupil’s so large. When it’s contracted, like in the other eye, these are straighter.

B: Okay.


A: But that doesn’t mean anything.

B: Okay.

A: ...because the fibers should accordion when they’re contracted.

B: Okay.

A: But you can see this lymph rosary ring you have here too, almost going into a
belt in some areas. This is the left arm here and you can see the injection spots, the
damage going down, some weakness in that elbow, a lot of weakness in that left
elbow. And then this is the spleen and that spleen is not very good. A lot of
dissolved tissue in that spleen. So that holds your excess red blood cells in case
you have a bleed, you’ve got your excess red blood cells to replace it, instantly so
you’re not anemic. This is the left testicle right here. Heavy mercury and damage
all the way down that area. And then this is the left leg and heavy damage here in
that left leg. You see these fibers just crisscrossing and very thin. So that left leg on
the outside of that left leg it’s quite weak in here. Make up for it in the fibers over
on the inside of that leg. So that’s making up for it here on the right side. This is
down the center, and this right side, it’s very very weak. All of that’s weak. Then
we go over to the inner right side of the body. This is the right adrenal gland, right
kidney. Some damage in that kidney. Adrenal gland is very good. The right side of
the urinary bladder’s pretty good. But you’re collecting all this waste, you know, it
should be sharp light blue fibers with dark blue in between so you’re just collecting
all that matter. Because your lymphatic glands are just jammed. So, this is the
lower right side of the back, here, this is about the waist right here. All that waste
is just collecting everywhere in the back just like it did on the left side. Well, it’s a
little cleaner here on the upper side of the right side, not near as much waste as you
were in the lower. This is about the shoulder blade here and this is a trapeze right here - up here.

B: Okay.

A: So that’s rather clean there, from your shoulder blade up to here. Except in the
lymphatic system, this is all jammed. In fact, this is the most jammed area you
have is right in here. These lymph glands. And this is the right thyroid gland.
That’s pretty good, and still you have all that lymphatic congestion out there.
Trachea has a lot of debris but strong, larynx is okay on that side. And you have
some mercury there, that could have been responsible for dissolving some of that
tonsil. Then we have the right eye here and that looks pretty good. And this is the
inner right quadrant of the brain. Lot of waste products collecting in the brain but
good fibers all the way around. Scarring here from penicillin. Little bit of it in
cerebral meningitis here on the right side. So, you might get a nasty flu or
pneumonia coming up, dumping. If you do the cheese and do the hot baths it’ll mitigate it. But just when you have, you know, symptoms of pneumonia you do not
lie down at all, any time. Because the gravity pushes the lungs shut and when the
lungs are detoxing like that, or the body’s detoxing to the lungs, the lungs only
have about a third of their normal strength so you’ve got the gravity pushing on
it...[mimics a wheeze] ...you feel like you can’t breathe and then you go to the
hospital and then they screw you up. So, you just sleep sitting up like this and the
gravity pushes the lungs open. So, you get right through the pneumonia. Passes
through like in two, three days.

B: Well I just had a really nasty head cold.

A: Well, you’re probably going to get another.

B: Yeah?

A: Yeah. because it’s still going on.

B: Well, and I’m still coughing, when I lay down, every time I start coughing.

A: Yeah. Don’t lie down all the way.

B: Is that what you’re talking about though, same thing?

A: Yeah. For a while, don’t lie down. When you’re coughing like that, that means
your body’s dumping the poisons. And you’re not pushing it out properly. Your
lungs are collapsing a little bit. Coughing keeps them open.

B: And during that have what?

A: Milkshakes.

B: Milkshakes?

A: Milkshakes, yeah. You need the mucus.

B: Okay. But like egg milkshakes, right? I drink a lot of milk.

A: Well, it’s gotta be eggs and honey and the extra cream.

B: Right.

A: Yeah.

B: But I mean, reduce milk during those times?

A: No.

B: No?

A: No, you need the milk to help clear the stuff.

B: Yeah.

A: If you’re eating pasteurized, then you’re going to be in trouble.


B: Okay.

A: ...because then you’re going to create a lot of mucus just to get rid of the milk.
The damaged milk product. This is the outer left quadrant of the brain and it looks
pretty good. You have a lot of heavy lymphatic waste in the brain there, that’s
probably causing your headache more than this is. And then the pupil, again,
relates to the stomach and all that green in there is industrial solvents like the
formaldehyde in the vaccines and all this mercury tattooed around your intestinal
lining. You have the Crohn’s radius here too. All that mercury and all throughout
the intestinal tract. So, the intestinal tract starts where this autonomic nerve belt is,
that keeps the brain in touch with the body and vice versa. From there to the pupil
is the intestinal tract. You have the Crohn’s radius there which is all scar tissue.
And then here you have mercury in all the areas where you don’t have scar tissue
in the intestines. So, you’ve got two big problems. Mercury contamination in your
intestines and other contamination, but mainly mercury and then your lymphatic
congestion. So, you need to take those hot baths. In fact, if you could just sleep in
one. Get a hot tub, sleep in your hot tub. That’s what I used to do. Sleep four, six
hours. Hot tub.

B: How does that relate to, you know, when you did the quick test, the skin test? I
was zero.

A: Yeah, but then that means you have it in your muscles.

B: Yeah. How come I don’t have it in my skin like most everybody else?

A: ...because you’re perspiring it out but you’re not cleaning out all the waste out
of it. And, you know, you are perspiring enough but you’re somewhat dehydrated
in that area. If you’re dehydrated, you’d have more of it under the skin instead of
in the muscles, because it causes more fatigue in the muscles if it doesn’t get it
under the skin. And it’s staying in the lymphatic system. You know, it’s just
jammed all the way around.

B: I’d like to put a hot tub; I’d like to dig one in the ground.

A: Yep.

B: But if you’re not using chlorine, how do you, you know.

A: Just use a sand filter.

B: But what about mosquitoes?

A: Well...

B: I had a body of water, just you know, for my neighbors. And in fact, if you’re
sitting in it and you’re getting, you know...


A: They can’t stand hot water. Hot water will kill them.

B: So, if it’s kept hot.

A: Let me see your hands. Okay, very good blood red cells, especially on the right
side. Poor white blood cells. That’s because you don’t have enough fat. Hand
reading is inside the cell, Iridology is outside the cell. So, you’ve got metal
everywhere, mostly tin, inside the cells, mostly mercury outside. So, it’s a little
more poisonous. Still good red blood cell production. Poor white blood cell
production because you just haven’t been eating enough fat. Inside, the cells look
pretty good. Digestive tracts are good even though there’s heavy tin everywhere.
The brain and the cells, they’re mostly toxic. So, you just need to eat a lot more fat.
Let me just test this. Relax, let your hand go limp in mine. The left teste is pretty
good. The left adrenal gland is very good. And relax. The left side of the pancreas
is hard, but still okay. Left thyroid, very poor, the parathyroid is very poor. Tonsil
area very poor. See, if you had tonsils that were full, you’d have a mound like this
here. So, relax. The right teste is pretty good. The right adrenal gland is very good.
The right side of the pancreas is okay. It’s about probably sixty-two percent active,
that’s good. Right thyroid’s good, parathyroid is very good, tonsil area poor. I’m
going to suggest a diet for you. Since you have so much mercury in your digestive
tract, I’m going to ask you to eat, three tablespoons of cheese the first thing in the
morning, one tablespoon of butter with that. Just get that down. And then about ten
minutes after that I’d like you to start with eggs. About seven minutes apart. And
have four to five of them. If you’re going to be active in the morning early, then
have five eggs. If you’re not, four eggs will be fine, seven minutes apart. And
you’re just going to need that time.

B: Oh, each egg seven minutes apart?

A: Yeah, seven minutes. You have one and seven minutes later you have another.
Just keep doing it that way.

B: Okay.

A: I just don’t want your body, because you start putting a lot of food in when you
have signs of Crohn’s and then the poisons are going to dump into that food and I
don’t want poisons to dump into that food. Just giving you the cheese and the
butter to handle that poison. So, I don’t want to stretch the stomach and I don’t
want to stretch the intestines. I just want the eggs to fall in behind each other. So,
they’re not bulking up. Okay? And I don’t want you to bulk up with anything. I
don’t want you to hog anything fast. I want you to eat slowly. Even your meat
meals, a little bit more slowly. I want you to grind everything. So, you don’t have
to make digestive juices to help break down large particles of food. Okay?


B: Alright.

A: So, after you have your eggs, let about twenty minutes pass and then have two
cubes of cheese, ten minutes after that have your first meat meal. Should be a cup
and a quarter minimum. That’s a half a pound of meat.

B: Okay. Now if I’m feeling full before I’m done with that, keep going? Or?

A: Keep going. You keep going, absolutely.

B: Okay.

A: And I’d like you to have at least two tablespoons of butter with it. If you want
to get more girth, then have three tablespoons of butter with that.

B: Okay.

A: And then about twenty-five minutes after you finish that meat meal have two
cubes of cheese. Ten, fifteen minutes after that have two and a half to three
tablespoons of cheese and two and a half teaspoons of honey. So, then for the next
two and a half hours I’d like you to have cheese every twenty minutes, and then
sipping milkshake or milk, and sport formula in between. You need two
tablespoons of vinegar, remember I said one to two tablespoons of vinegar in a
sport formula? You need two to help break up this congestion. Also, in your sport
formula, I’d like you to add one half cup of pineapple into it. And lower half a cup
of one of those five basic ingredients. If you’re using tomato in it, you know to
have more energy as an athlete, that’s the one I want you to lower to put the
pineapple in.

B: Okay. Half a cup, so this is per quart. Right?

A: Yeah, per quart. Yeah, so you’re just putting half a cup of the pineapple in in
place of, you know, a half a cup of one of those three cups of five ingredients. Up
to five ingredients, but a minimum of two. So, that’ll help start breaking down that
lymphatic congestion. The vinegar and the pineapple will help do that. The
pineapple will also work in the intestinal tract to get rid of that scar tissue. But I
need it to go in small amounts throughout the day as you sip that sport formula.
Now you can have two sport formulas a day if you’re in a hot tub a long time, just
keep sipping it. But no more than an ounce a minute.

B: Okay. What about during a workout?

A: Same thing, just sip it.

B: Milk or sport formula during the workout?

A: Do both. Sip one and the other, one and the other. Keep your cheese going too.

B: Okay.


A: Yeah, on this diet, this food is simple.

B: Right.

A: Your body doesn’t have to stop to digest because there’s no enzymes and
vitamins in it, you don’t have to rob the body. So, for the next two and a half
hours, you’re going to eat cheese and sip, cheese and sip. So, it’s like cheese, ten
minutes later sip. Cheese, ten minutes after that sip. Every ten minutes.

B: Got it. Okay.

A: Try to do that.

B: Yeah.

A: You’ll move a lot faster. If you don’t do it while you work out then at least
every thirty minutes.

B: Okay.

A: So, it’s thirty minutes you have the cheese, ten minutes after that you sip.
Twenty minutes after that you have cheese. I’d rather it be closer, tighter,
especially while you’re exercising. Then after that two and a half hours you have
two cubes of cheese, then ten minutes after that your vegetable juice.

B: Okay.

A: I’d like you to have about twenty-four ounces, but only a sip a minute.

B: Okay.

A: It’s going to take you about twenty-five minutes to drink that juice. You do
whatever you’re doing, take a sip. Go do what you’re doing, sip, do you what
you’re doing.

B: Okay.

A: Treat it like tea or coffee. And, I would only want you to have one juice a day.
And that’s it.

B: Okay.

A: Okay? And I’d like that juice to be thirty-five percent carrot, thirty percent
celery, and about twenty five percent cucumber puree, and ten percent cilantro.

B: Okay.

A: And I want to put an egg or two in that juice.

B: Okay. Don’t juice the cucumber? Puree it?


A: No, you’re pureeing it. Peel it and puree it. You have a lot of collagen to replace
because of the damage in the lymphatic system.

B: Okay.

A: The cucumber gives you pre-collagen; precursors for collagen. So then for the
next two hours after you finish the vegetable juice, you have the cheese and
sipping. So, after about five hours after you finish that meat meal, you’re going to
have two cubes of cheese, ten minutes after that you’ll have your fruit meal.

B: Okay.

A: And the fruit meal, I’d like you to have dark berries. Stick with dark berries. I’d
like you to have half a cup of pineapple, half a cup of blueberries, blackberries, or
boysenberries or a combination of them. And three tablespoons of lime juice, one
tablespoon of lemon juice, tablespoons of coconut cream and one and a half to two
tablespoons of dairy cream.

B: This is all blended together?

A: All blended together.

B: How do I do the pineapple? Is it pureed or juiced?

A: Puree it.

B: Okay.

A: Yeah, all the fruits, never juice fruit.

B: Okay.

A: So, have that five days a week. Two days a week, have a custard. And the
custard recipes are in both books.

B: Okay.

A: But take a little ginger root, fresh ginger root and grate a little ginger root into
that. And some of your milkshakes.

B: Into the custard and the milkshakes.

A: Yeah. Not enough to really be strong, but enough just to give it that taste
because it stimulates peristalsis.

B: Okay.

A: And after peristalsis is stimulated, that’s a detoxifier. Fruit’s always a
detoxifying meal. Your one detoxifying meal a day. And then the cheese that
comes in behind is going to start collecting it as you freed it up. So, for the next
four hours, even five hours, it’s cheese and sipping, cheese and sipping. And then after that, top of the fifth or sixth hour, then you have two cubes of cheese and then
ten minutes after that your second meat meal. Same as the first, butter with it.
Twenty-five minutes after you have the cheese and ten, fifteen minutes after you
have the cheese and honey again. And then until you go to bed it is cheese, sipping,
cheese, sipping.

B: Okay.

A: During the middle of the night, I’d like you to have three tablespoons of cheese,
and two teaspoons of honey, and a half a cup of milk. So, you don’t have to wait
after having the cheese and the honey to have the milk. Usually you do. In fact, I
want you to have two to three ounces of milk after you have the cheese and honey,
the other two times after your meat meals, but I want you to wait about ten minutes
before you have the two, three ounces milk. But in the middle of the night you
have the milk right on top of the cheese and honey.

B: Okay. I have a slight farsightedness to the point where I have to wear contacts.
How can I remedy that?

A: Put egg white in your eye in the morning and put butter in your eyes at night.

B: Okay. What about carrot juice and cream?

A: It can help. But your lymphatic system isn’t cleaning, that’s your problem. Your
problem isn’t that the cornea’s damaged.

B: So, with this, it will also improve eyesight?

A: Yeah. Absolutely, yeah.

B: Okay. I have a skin fungus right here. It’s been there for a long time. Usually
I’ll get a pill but.

A: Don’t

B: Right.

A: Just put some butter on the area.

B: Not apple cider and water?

A: [snickers] You’re going to dry it out and make it worse.

B: Well I just read that in your book, or that’s how I understood it.

A: That’s in the bathtub.

B: Okay.


A: That’s to clean off the dead cells. To dissolve them. If you put vinegar right
directly on there and leave it on there, you’re going to dry out your skin so bad you
will itch worse.

B: Okay.

A: Twice as bad. Then you may end up with the hives.

B: Okay. This was a golf ball about a week ago, I got a little bursitis here.

A: The bursa was swollen?

B: Yeah, yeah.

A: That’s your lymph system not working.

B: Well, I smashed my knee and, you know.

B: The hot tub. Where do I figure this out?

A: Do you have a house?

B: Yes. I have a backyard.

A: Are you going to stay in the house a while?

B: Maybe, maybe not.

A: Then there are two ways to do it. If you want it to be portable then you could
get a wood one and plant it in the ground with some kind of that thick milled
plastic they put for ponds. Put it around that. Don’t make a cement one if not
staying long term.

B: Right. I don’t plan on making the cement.

A: So, you can have a wood one, a cedar wood one, buried in the ground with a
cover on top and just leave this much out of the ground. So, you know, your rain
water doesn’t pour into it.

B: Okay.

A: If you have a tendency to flood then you might want it a little higher. But just
have a cover for it.

B: Okay, does it matter if it’s in the sun, not in the sun?

A: Well, in the sun’s better. You know, you can take the top off in the sun and it’ll
even condition the water a little bit better.

B: Well, in the backyard I have two large trees in the backyard so that’s always a
problem for sun.


A: Then you definitely need to cover it, because your water’s going to get full of
sap.

B: Right.

A: If there’s a tree back there. So just keep it covered.

B: Okay.

A: If it starts getting a little stinky, but it shouldn’t, put a sand filter on it. That’s
what I did with mine. Built a little house next to it and I put a three-hundred-pound
sand filter on it. That’s for a swimming pool

B: Right, okay.

A: And you know, for twelve years I never changed the sand once.

B: Just the sand?

A: Just sand. Keeps water crystal clear but lets the algae grow, in the hot tub. The
algae pull the metals out of your body and helps your body.

B: But the sand is like the stuff you buy at the pool store, right? The silica.

A: Well, you don’t want to get all the silica sand. You do it in layers. Down at the
very bottom, the three hundred pounds is about this big. And you get a heating
unit. But you build it in a heat condensed one. Because it gets cold out there. So,
like a little house for it. Your pump, your heater, your sand filter. So that you keep
the heat in there. And also, if you have built a little gazebo that’s a tear down
gazebo, like the gazebos they have for hot houses? Tiny ones. You can have that
and just open up when you’re in there doing it and you can have all kinds of plants
around it and you’re in a jungle and you get all the good air, all the oxygen from
the plants and that steam is feeding them and they’re feeding you and it’s a
fabulous environment.

B: What would you do for a deck? Materials wise?

A: If it’s out of the ground, you’re going to spend five times more heating it.

B: Yeah, I mean, what are we going to have around the hot tub?

A: Oh, I’d just use cedar or redwood or something.

B: Yeah, something like that? Okay.

A: Unless you want to use some kind of a plastic, that’s fine. It’s less wear and
tear, I mean, you’re not going to be sitting on it. You can also get one of those
plastic hot tubs that you can just bury in the ground, too, but you need to let the sun
beat on it for about fifteen days before you get in it. To cure the polymers in the plastic. And then you can just put a plastic one in, that’s even easier to pull out
than a wood one.

B: You’re talking about, uh, a preformed hot tub? Plastic in first, then the hot tub?

A: Well, they have prefab plastic ones and they have prefab wooden ones. Depends
on what you want.

B: But what you’re saying is let it sit in the sun for fifteen days to let the polymers
come out of the plastic of the hot tub itself.

A: Right, and that sand filter works very well. What you do is put, you have three
different sizes of rocks. Big rocks, then you’re got medium rocks, and then you’ve
got small rocks, then you’ve got regular sand, and then silica sand on top.

B: Okay, that’s in the filter. So, it’s more than the sand.

A: That’s what you do, yeah to get the best effects, yeah.

B: Is that what’s typical for a sand filter?

A: It isn’t typical anymore because people don’t like to go through all the process
of getting one rock and putting it on top of another but that’s the old way. And
that’s the way they use in India and jungles and stuff like that.

B: I can get that on the internet or?

A: Just go to like Home Depot. And you get your different size of rocks and you
go to their building department and they have the silica sand there and the regular
sand used for cement. But wash them. I use pails like this and I’ll wash the sand
and I’ll wash the rocks until most of the murkiness is out of them.

B: Okay, right. Just like you would do for an aquarium, I guess.

A: Yeah.

B: Since I started this diet, I get cramps in my feet and in my hands and sometimes
my calves. My hands like if I’m trying to twist a cap off of a jar, my hand will stay
like this, cramped.

A: You’re having too much fruit. Not enough fat.

B: Okay. I don’t eat a whole lot of fruit. Maybe a banana a day.

A: If you’re not eating it with fat, you’re going to cause an over sugar reaction in
your tissues.

B: I was usually doing it with an avocado.

A: Well that should be okay. Did you eat the avocado first?

B: Probably not.


A: Okay, that’s the problem. Always eat your fat first if you’re not blending them
together because the fat will buffer that sugar. The sugar gets into the tissues, it’s
going to create cramping. The other thing that causes cramping like that, is the
body trying to throw the lactic acid, the byproduct of metabolism, out your skin
and if it’s blocked it stays in the muscles and causes the cramping. Those are the
Charlie horses.

B: Okay. I read on the internet, you know all the sudden getting cramping, and
everything that came up was you’re not eating enough carbs. So, it had me
worried.

A: Just the opposite, yeah.

B: I want to raise some tomatoes and so forth. Do you have a source for heirloom
seeds?

A: Yeah, there’s quite a few on the internet.

B: Any heirloom seed is good?

A: Yes, always go for heirloom.

B: I can trust any heirloom seeds?

A: No, there are companies, let me tell you. All those are bought up by Monsanto
which is ninety percent, there’s only ten percent left. But you’ll see their ads on
there, they’ve been in business a long time. I get them and I buy them for my
places when I go to Thailand and I take boxes of seeds with me.

B: Okay. And is growing in pots okay? Or is it better in the ground?

A: Well, either way, as long as your pot’s ceramic and not highly fired. Clay pots.

B: Because I’d like to be able to bring them in in the winter time, being in Chicago.

A: If you have your hot tub, around a gazebo, there you go! You can grow year-
round. So, your hot tub is growing your food as well as making you healthier.

B: Right. The only problem is the consistent sunlight, just because of the trees in
the backyard.

A: You don’t need consistent sunlight. Like in Finland, they don’t get direct
sunlight, but a lot of indirect sunlight, but still everything grows.

B: Okay. And then where do you source soil from? Initially?

A: Well, try to go out to one of the farms and haul some in. See if you can get
some, somebody’s digging up something somewhere, get some top soil.

B: Okay.

A: Okay.

B: Okay, thanks very much.

A: You’re very welcome.
