PREFACE
Ancient Chinese medicine said: “Sickness is due
 to stagnation or blockage”
 .
 It has been stated that all mammals in nature live 7
 times their growth rate. That is 7 times the time it takes
 them to reach maturity. For man, that is 147 years,
 considering maturity is 21 years.
 This begs the question: Why are most persons passing
 away or are unable
 to live and act normally or are in a
 state of disability around the age of 68 to 75 on
 average? Could they be dying prematurely?
 The Hunza tribe of the Hunza Valley in the Himalayan
 Mountains is a well-known example of persons living
 well beyond the age of 80 and having an active life. The
 average lifespan of these Indians is about 100 years.
 Many live to 120. One report said one Hunza Indian
lived to 160.
  Research in 2008 revealed that in a remote island in
 the Philippines beyond Mati, up in the mountains, a
 truly primitive Indian tribe was visited and studied.
 The island was about 14 by 6 miles and was
mountainous. This was a risk as it is illegal for a white
  man to go there. This visit was achieved because an
 Indian from this tribe left it and came to the city to live.
 The researcher made friends with this Indian and the
7

 Indian escorted him to the tribe regardless of the law.
 The Indians in this tribe have never been off the island.
They wear self-made garments and live in huts. They
  are nomadic and like to travel around the island and
live in different groups.
  They live on a diet of primarily raw coconut, raw fish
 and a small amount of fruit such as mangoes and
 bananas. Shimmying up a palm to get a coconut is a
 daily activity. They are full bodied and thick. The
 shaman was met who looked about 43 years old and
 was 82. The Indians there who were about 80 had thick
 white teeth with no receding gums.
 dark, almost purple. They did not brush their teeth.
Their gums were
  They had perfect teeth alignment with large jowls. If
 something got stuck in their teeth, they would get it out
 with bark or a stick. They had no illnesses. They do not
 have children unless the whole tribe agrees. When a
 child is born,
 he/she
 is treated as the child of everyone
 in the tribe. It is as if the whole tribe acts as the mother
 and father of the child. There were about 200 Indians
 on the whole
 island. They did have injuries from
accidents. When they die, they just go to sleep and do
 not wake up. The older Indians there are said to be 120
  years old or older.
 It is interesting to note that the diet these Indians lived
 on since birth contained no breads, pasta, grains or
 processed and packaged foods. They ate no frozen
 meats or frozen foods and no bottled or canned foods.
 They have never had any form of injections, vaccines,
8

 refined sugar, refined salt, no antibiotics and no
 medications of any kind.
Considering this information, one can say there is
  something here demanding further investigation if one
wishes health and longevity of life beyond the age of
  about 70 years.
 We live in an industrial age where toxic chemicals
 abound. They are all around us. Many processed foods
 contain preservatives and flavoring additives such as
 aspartame and phosphoric acid which are essentially
 poisons. They are found on our farms that are treated
 with pesticides. GMO foods are by definition altered
 physically and chemically. ‘Modern’ farming practices,
 such as using synthetic fertilizer, are utilized to
 produce crops. There are chemicals in our air from
 chemtrails and automotive pollution. The list goes on.
 Could it be that such toxic chemicals from numerous
 sources are contaminating the cells in our body and the
 cell’s reproductive process is also so contaminated,
shortening our lives? Could it be the lack of the body’s
  ability to cleanse itself of toxicity which clogs
body’s normal activities and functions? Is it that
 lymphatic system is not functioning properly to
  clean out the toxicity?
 Or could it simply be the lack of
 circulation to remove the dead cells when
 cells
 duplicate and these dead cells form areas prime
 for cancer growth? Or could all these factors combined
 be the reason for shorter lives? What is the cause of
 what could be considered premature death?
the
the
9

 Experience shows that the lymphatic system is not
 generally addressed or treated by the medical
profession.
Yet this system working properly is key to
   health. It is a vital part of our immune system as is the
appendix and tonsils. The benefits of hot baths, hot and
 cold therapy or hydrotherapy are to increase the body’s
  circulation and blood flow allowing nutrients into those
 areas of circulation blockage so that cleansing and
 healing can occur much more efficiently. It is well
 known and has been used as a therapy for thousands of
 years of history in many countries around the world.
 Heating up in a sauna and rolling in the snow or getting
 into a cold shower after a steam bath are common
 examples of hot and cold therapy in use today.
 Extensive research has been done regarding hot water
 therapy and its use to detoxify the body. It has been
 taken to the next level and redeveloped into a powerful
 health therapy. This is a brand new development in
 recent years. When done properly, it is a very powerful
detoxification and purification procedure that can
  improve health and extend life. This is a natural
healing method with no medication whatsoever. This
 new development is not broadly known and is
  presented in its entirety in this book.
 Since the advent of hydrogenated oils, heated vegetable
 oils, trans-fatty acids, deep fried foods, etc.,
 such oils
 are not soluble in the body at the body’s ordinary
 temperatures. Such oils crystalize and harden in the
 body. They become stored in the body’s veins, arteries,
10

 lymph system and other areas causing many body
 problems such as illnesses, diseases and lymphatic
congestion.
  This book was written in the spirit of addressing such
health issues in a total natural healing approach using
  no drugs, no medication, and no chelation therapy. This
 is a simple and logical approach to get the body to a
 high temperature long enough so that the hardened
 crystalized fats and oils and other toxicity stored in
 those fats (i.e. heavy metals, etc.) soften and become
 fluid. In this state they can be drained or escorted out
 of the body via the sweat glands, pores and digestive
 system.
Over many years, numerous tests and evaluations have been done concerning the information as laid out in this book using an empirical approach.
 Many successes
 have been recorded. To some health
 enthusiasts this
 approach is the only workable method of truly
 purifying the body of such bad fats and stored toxic
chemicals in the lymphatic system.
  The information in this book can also be used for
persons who just want a more health-giving hot tub or
 pool. If you don’t want conventional pool chemicals
  (chlorine for instance) in the water of your hot tub
 and/or pool, there is specific technology contained
 herein on how to obtain the purest water available to
 soak and swim in. Such a water filter system brings the
 water to a level of drinking water purity or as close to
11

 that as one can get. This has been proven to be very
 beneficial in many cases.
Also contained in this book is information on how to
  build your own wood hot tub
 system and hot tub.
and maintain the filter
  Note: Considerable technological study and
 research
 has gone
 into the development of the
 information as presented in this book. To keep things
 simple, it is being presented in layman’s terms.

 Chapter One
THE HOT TUB IS THE BEST SOLUTION
THE BODY AND BAD FAT
 Growing up in the world today one is bombarded with
 chemicals and toxic oils (heated well above body
 temperature) in processed foods, packaged foods, fast
 foods, cereals, cooking oil from an aerosol can, deep
 fried foods and so on. These oils, such as hydrogenated
oils, are used as a preservative for shelf life of the
  product.
You may ask “But what happens when these oils and
  preservatives get into the body? Can the body properly
 utilize and digest them? Can they easily get out of the
 body once in there?”
 The simple answer is
 NO!
 They stack up and store in
  the body and cause a myriad of health issues over time.
 This time factor is about 5 to 20 years before the health
15

 issues really start to show up. Treating these with
 medication and hoping for the magic pill or quick fix is
just more toxicity. Research has shown that chelation
  therapy does not work to remove toxicity. (See
chelation therapy in the glossary of this book.)
  The body in general has a difficult time digesting oils in
 a large quantity. If ingested in large quantity (more
 than about 4 tablespoons per day), the good oils mostly
 just pass through. The good oils are ones that the body
 can digest and utilize the nutrients of, such as truly cold
 pressed olive oil (not heated above 96 degrees F.) or
 coconut oil that is not heated above 112 degrees
 Fahrenheit at any point of its processing. Fresh raw
 avocados can be properly digested in large quantities.
 Most all other oils on the market are heated up to 120
 to 140 for shelf life which moves them over into the
 category of hydrogenated oils. Certain brands of flax
 seed oil and sunflower oil used to be processed at or
 below 96 degrees. But these oils have been off the
market for some time. They can be made at home with
  a special press that makes oil from seeds. The
temperature needs to be monitored during this process
 to ensure 96 degrees F is not exceeded.
  Almost all coconut oil on the market today is heated
 for shelf life well above 112 degrees F which kills the
 natural bacteria and enzymes necessary for proper
 digestion. (112 is noted as the highest temperature
 coconut oil can still be considered raw due to SE Asia
16

 coconut trees living abundantly at such peak
 temperatures.)
Hydrogenated oils, when they dehydrate, turn into a
  kind of plastic. They have a similar molecular structure
to plastic. They are dehydrated or dried when in foods.
  Margarine and other oils as soy, corn, palm, and canola
 are all heated and they can’t be properly digested as
 they are not soluble in the body. They harden and store
 in the body. The body can’t get rid of them through the
 skin or digestive tract at normal body temperatures.
 They clump together and they will block the pores even
 if you perspire. The hottest the body can get with
 extreme exercise is 100.1 degrees Fahrenheit and this
 is not hot enough to deal with the trans-fatty acids.
HOT TUB USE TO GET RID OF THE BAD FAT
 Research has shown that lymphatic congestion has
been caused by hydrogenated oils such as margarine,
  vegetable oils, flavoring additives, soy, safflower oils
 and roasted peanut butter. Such oils crystalize and
 harden and combine. They are not a fluid at body
 temperature. One can’t dissolve and expel them from
the body without raising the body’s temperature to a
  high degree for a certain length of time. The body’s
 temperature can be safely raised up to as much as 102
degrees F by soaking in hot water ranging from 105 to
 110 degrees F. The hotter you can stand it the better.
 17

 105 is the minimum temperature necessary to affect
 the lymph system drainage.
It takes some time to heat the crystalized and hardened
 fats so they melt and dissolve. Research has shown it
  takes about 45 to 50 minutes to get deep enough into
 the lymph glands and nodes to the point where the
 toxic fat can start to melt. With a 1 hour soak you get an
 actual 10 minutes of dissolving the bad fats and
 cleaning the lymph system. This 10 minutes of
 dissolving amounts to about one-one thousandths of an
 inch dealt with. You keep at it layer by layer and after
 some time you have detoxified and purified your
 lymphatic system and will achieve very good health
 benefits.
 It is vitally important that the water that is used for the
 hot tub soaking is as clean of toxic chemicals as
 possible. It needs to be as close to drinking water
 quality as it can be. Like soaking in a natural hot spring
 – totally clean fresh water. Our city tap water abounds
 in chemical toxicity. This toxic water can be made clean
 through filtration. This is explained in detail later in the
 book.
 The ideal soak time is 90 minutes for best and fastest
results for a hot tub or hot bath session. If you add
  eating good fats as part of this process, it will help
 speed the procedure. Some toxins that migrate to the
digestive system are absorbed or bind molecularly with
 those fats and are escorted out of the body via the
 18

 digestive system.
 Sauna, infrared sauna and steam baths do promote
circulation and are healthy but only for short periods.
  A steam bath is recommended for only 10 minutes. A
 sauna for 15 to 20 minutes - depending on how hot the
 sauna is. After that, the heat gets in and damages the
 lungs; you stop absorbing oxygen and know you need
 to get out of there before you pass out.
 Long exposure of such high heat in a sauna or steam
 bath can damage the eyes, mucous membranes, the
 lungs, bronchial tubes (air passages), throat and ears. If
 you're naked,
 it can damage
 and the urethra (the urethra will heat up inside). It can
the vagina and the penis,
  damage the vitamins and enzymes and other nutrients
 under the skin and in the skin.
 In a sauna or steam bath, even if you set the
 temperature to 110 degrees research has shown, it is
 estimated, you would need to be in the sauna/steam
 bath for about 8 hours to get the same result as you
would in a hot tub for 90 minutes. This is due to the
  insulation factor of the air against the heat. The water
in the hot tub is directly against the skin and the heat
 penetrates into the body far better.
  In a hot tub from 105 to 110 degrees Fahrenheit, you
 can stay in for as long as 12 to 15 hours and even go to
 sleep if you so desire! Such extended hot tubbing has
been done successfully by many persons. But normally
 19

 speaking 90 minutes is a good run of it.
 For the normal person, one gets hot and needs to take a
break. This subject of taking a break from the hot water
  and cooling off is discussed later in this book.
 When in a sauna to perspire toxins from the body, it is
 best to shower and rinse toxic perspiration every 3 - 4
 minutes so that any perspired toxins are not
 reabsorbed into the skin
 where
 they may eventually re-
 enter the body.
 When showering using municipal city water that has
 fluoride and is chlorinated, it is best to have filters
 installed that will eliminate these chemicals. Research
 has shown that chlorine vapors (chloroform) gradually
 weaken and damage the blood, lungs, thyroid and
 brain.
 Steam baths are the least desirable form to extract
 toxicity from the body via perspiration. The steam
 burns mucous membranes, including those in the lungs,
 bronchi and sinuses. But if you so choose to use them
for short periods, use good clean mineral water to
  produce the steam. Do not use municipal water which
contains chlorine, fluoride, etc.
 AFTER THE HOT TUB SOAK
 Do not just rest or go to bed or be sedentary after your
hot tub soak. Be active so that what has been melted
 20

 that has not already gotten out of the pores fully but is
 still in a melted state can get circulated and pushed out
of the body more. This is a critical time for best results.
  You will continue to sweat for a while. This is good.
Dress in warm comfortable clothes and take a walk or
 do some light exercises or stretches if you so desire for
  at least 30 to 45 minutes after the soak.
NOTE REGARDING THE SPLEEN
 One of the jobs of the spleen is to regulate the body’s
 adaptability to cold and hot temperatures. It removes
 red blood cells from the blood stream to thin the blood
 and cool the body. It also adds red blood cells to the
 blood to thicken the blood and heat the body. People
 who do not have spleens should ease into hot bath or
 hot tub and drink more fluids immediately prior to
 entering the hot water.
WARNING REGARDING BEING UNDERWEIGHT
 A person who engages with this hot tub cleansing
 program as suggested should be about 10 to 15 pounds
 overweight or have a 20 to 25 percent minimum body
 fat (which is normal for most people). It has been found
 that those that have less body fat than this do not have
 the necessary fat to absorb excess toxicity that is being
21

 extracted. Metal toxicity that is released such as
 mercury, thallium, cadmium or lead, etc. can circulate
and damage tissues without the fat there. With the
  body fat in place there is no problem at all.
DO NOT BE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HIGH HEAT LEVELS
 The body has its own cooling system. It cools the body
 by 3 degrees Fahrenheit minimum. Even in the hot
 water temperatures as discussed, the body may heat up
 to about 102 under the skin. This is not uncomfortable
 but one is hot. At this temperature the hot water is
 doing a good job cleaning the lymphatic system and
 body. If you take your temperature under your arm, the
 thermometer will read almost as hot as the water. If
 you take your temperature from your rectum or mouth,
 it may read as high as 102. One does need to know
one’s own limitations and listen to the body and
 approach these temperatures on a gradient.
 WHAT THE HOT TUB PROPERLY DONE CAN DO
The body has collected the bad fats and lymphatic
  congestion over a period of about 5 to 20 years or
 more. Proper hot tubbing over a period of time can
 detoxify and purify the lymphatic system of the bad fats
22

 and other toxicity (such as salt and metals) that are
 clogging it and causing it not to function properly.
Ninety percent of toxins are said to leave the body
  through the skin as perspiration and evaporation. A
properly functioning lymphatic system is necessary for
  this to occur.
 In a very large number of persons it has been found
 that the skin is blocked with lymphatic waste (trans-
 fatty acids) and congestion that must be melted and
 moved with heat. This is why the hot tub is the best
 solution to handle this blockage and to get the
 lymphatic system back to a proper operational
 condition.
 Once this is accomplished, normal sweat and exercise
 should keep the body clean of toxicity provided of
 course that one is not ingesting or breathing more
 toxicity that will again clog up the lymph system and
 body.
 In summary there are many other benefits of a hot bath
or hot tub such as: relaxation, headache reduction,
  helping your heart by reducing blood pressure,
increasing circulation and blood flow, easing muscle
 pains, boosting production of serotonin, and with salts
  in the water or Epsom salts the magnesium helps to
 reduce inflammation, the heat relieves cold and flu
 symptoms, helps to fight off viruses, steam from a hot
 bath can help relieve stuffy noses and congestion, it
 helps your breathing, stimulates metabolism, reduces
23

 menstrual cramps by bringing blood to the area, burns
 calories and can boost self-confidence.
Examples of detoxification / testimonials
1.
  A man age 63, who was not leading an active life
 but sitting around a lot like a couch potato, stated
 that he virtually has no energy. He did the hot
 tubbing 90 minutes a day minimum for three
 months at 110 degrees F. After three months he
 was still complaining of being tired and having no
 energy. He was directed to simply stop the hot
 tubbing for 3 weeks to see how he felt. At the end
 of the three weeks he was a different man. He had
 melted everything out and just needed to cool off
 his body and let it recover. His energy fully
 recovered and he started a new business working
 14 to 16 hours per day for years after. When he
 reached age 76 – 77 the following his success was
 ended.
2.
 “It has been a year and a half since finishing
treatment for Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. I have
  remained cancer free since.
“My routine, almost daily, includes 15 to 60
 minutes soaking in my glorious hot tub. I climb
  the stairs, flip the top open that covers and
 protects the tub, swing my legs onto the bench,
 and lower my body into the water. Initially my
 experience is to think, ‘Oh my, this is hot.’ And
 then as I immediately acclimate, I experience a
24

 ‘high’ that is truly ineffable. In the hot tub, my
 nervous system remains calm while I treasure
each moment listening to the sounds of nature
  around me. There is research supporting
longevity by being aware of the benefits of healing
 modalities to help the nervous system remain in a
  calm state. The hot tub is one of these methods
 for me.
 “I know my hot tub ritual has played an important
 role in my recovery and continues to improve the
 quality of my life in many other ways. My energy,
 organs, digestion, heart, mobility, and cognitive
 functions have all continued healing and been
 strengthened from this self-care I gift myself.
 “This life-affirming hot tub system has
 contributed to improving and enlivening my spirit
 emotionally, physically and spiritually.
 “I am forever grateful to John Reed for his
 wisdom, support and expertise knowing how to
build a hot tub system with the proper filters that
  eliminate the use of toxic chemicals.”
  Thank you, John. Lovingly, Bonnie

3.
 A man age 50 had muscle soreness and chronic
 fatigue but not severely. He experienced chronic
sinusitis and could hardly breathe through his
  nose at all. Working a normal work schedule, he
was able to hot tub at 104/107 degrees
 Fahrenheit for 40 minutes per day t
wo
to three
    days out of
 week, for 1.5 to 2 hours.
 Results after 11 months were: Increased energy,
 generally feeling much healthier and no longer
 feeling the need to do hot tubbing. His sinusitis
 went into remission and he could breathe
 normally through his nostrils.
26

 Chapter Two
HOT TUB WATER ADDITIVES
SUGGESTED ADDITIVES TO THE WATER
  To improve the hot tub experience some additives can
 be put into the water.
 A key one is salt. This can be Celtic Sea Salt, Himalayan
 Salt, unprocessed sundried Sea Salt or Epsom salts.
Ordinary table salt should not be used as it is highly
 processed with minerals taken out. It has chemical
  additives such as iodine and chemicals to prevent it
from clumping.
  The salts helps to detoxify the body. Epsom salts help
 reduce pain and inflammation. Salt is not a “must have”
 ingredient but is nice and makes for a better
 experience.
27

 Unpasteurized apple cider vinegar is for nourishing the
 skin and it helps prevent muscle cramps and eases
bruising. It also helps to neutralize any remaining
  toxicity from the water.
Clay. Recommended is Terramin clay from California.
  The clay helps to soak up toxicity coming out of the
 body and keep the water clean. It adds a nice feel to the
 water, making it like a natural hot spring.
 The mix for a hot bath of about 50 gallons (the size of
 an old claw foot tub) is one half to one cup of Epsom
 salts and 2 to 3 tablespoons of apple cider vinegar. If
 other salts are used, only about 2 tablespoons are
 needed. Clay can be one half a cup. A cup of milk or
 coconut cream can be added too for a bath to help keep
 the skin from drying out from the city (not fully
 filtered) water. A hot tub with a proper filtration
 system would not need milk or coconut cream. Also a
 hot tub is not drained after each use and the milk or
 coconut cream would get sour and smelly.
For a 5’ x 5’ hot tub which is about 700 gallons, you
  would add more ingredients proportionately.
For example:
1. About 1 cup of organic apple cider vinegar.
2. 2 cups of Terramin Bath Clay.
    28
You can get info on this clay and purchase it from
 California Earth Minerals. It is also sold on

Amazon.
3.
HOW TO MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN A HOT TUB
  About one quarter to one half cup of Celtic Sea
Salt. This helps the pH balance in the water.
  Much more if Epsom salts are used.
 For a rectangular or square tub, multiply length by
 width by depth x 7.5. This gives you the volume in
 gallons.
 For a round hot tub, the formula is radius squared x pi
 (3.14) x depth x 7.5.

 Chapter Three
HOT TUB VERSUS HOT BATH
SPECIAL BENEFITS OF A HOT TUB
 Anyone interested in this program can use a hot bath or
 start with a hot bath. They are readily available to most
 everyone. However, due to the size and heat retaining
 qualities of an ordinary bathtub, they are far from ideal
 for this program. They can be used of course but they
do take more time and work to get the same result.
  First, most persons can’t get their whole body under
water in a bathtub all at one time. This reduces the
  speed of progress of the program by at least 50%
 considering only half your body is in the tub at a time.
 One half is heating, the other half is not being treated.
 Getting one’s entire body in the hot water gets the
fastest results.
  Second, the water is constantly changing temperatures.
31

 Even if one starts out at a high temperature, say at 108
 degrees F, after about 20 minutes that temperature
sinks down to about 103 or 102 degrees F and now it is
  time to take a break to get the bathtub back to 105 at
least. To do this simply drain about 2 inches of water
 from the tub. Then grab a pail. Insert the cold water
  that is first coming out of the faucet into the pail so as
 not to cool the bathtub water even more. Once the
 water is hot, fill up that 2 inches to bring the bathtub
 water back up to about 108 degrees F. Then get back
 into the tub to continue your soak.
 Upon actual test, this takes about 3 to 7 minutes to
 complete this process. Considering it needs to be done
 every 20 minutes on average, you would have do this
 several times for a 90 minute soak which is not
 convenient.
 Research has shown that the most one wants to take a
 break from this hot water therapy is 2 to 3 minutes. If
 one takes a break longer than this, the melting of the
hardened fat process starts to reverse. This can extend
  the time needed to get the fats properly melted to a
fluid state so they can be eliminated.
 The best option has been to let the water out while you
  are in the tub. Then your time out of the tub to fill it
 back up with hot water is less. Staying in the bathtub
 during the re-fill is not comfortable as you may get
 burned by the hot water coming into the tub with you
 in it.
32

 Considering these factors, let’s take a look at a proper
 hot tub set up compared to the bath tub set up.
A hot tub has a heater and pump circulating water
  through the tub keeping the tub at a constant set
temperature within about 2 degrees. You can set it to
  the temperature most comfortable for you. There is no
 having to take a break unless you wish to cool off for 2
 to 3 minutes. A hot tub pump can be programmed so
 that at a particular time of day it will be ready to go at
 your desired set temperature.
 With this, all you need to do is show up at your
 scheduled time and get in. On the other hand, the bath
 takes time to fill and get it to the right temperature, add
 ingredients and get in it. A hot tub can be set up to be
 at the ideal temperature 24/7 if you wish so that you
 can go in at any time you please.
 For a hot tub, you add the ingredients just one time
 normally when you fill the tub with water. You can get
 your entire body into the hot tub all at once.
Bath tub water is discarded after each use. With a hot
  tub, the water is filtered and used for up to two months
before a need to change the water. You will save water
 by using a hot tub.
  Thus a properly set up hot tub is most convenient and
 effective and worth the investment.

 Chapter Four
HOT AND COLD THERAPY AND COOLING OFF
COOLING OFF
 Most people embarking upon a program of hot tubbing
 or hot and cold therapy are not accustomed to being in
 such heat for long periods at high temperatures. It
 takes a bit of getting used to. Even when you are “used
to it”, one does get hot and needs to cool off in order to
  continue.
 Methods of cooling off are:
 Cold dip pool. This is my favorite and works the best
 for me. There are several options for this. One is having
an ordinary pool near your hot tub. Or another “hot
  tub” that is a dedicated cold dip pool. Or having a
 bathtub available with cold water in it waiting for you
35

 when you want a break.
 One can use the ambient temperature for the cold
water which works adequately. Or one can set up a way
  for the water to be set at a particular temperature like
50 or 60 degrees F. Some Turkish bath spas have cold
  dip pools that get down to 50 or 48 degrees F.
 One can jerry-rig an ordinary water cooler used for
 drinking to cool the water for a cold dip tub. Plumbing
 needs to be done from the water cooler through the
 cold dip pool. This is a makeshift set up. Another
 option is to purchase a water cooler machine that is
 designed for a cold dip pool/tub. A separate pump
 would be needed to circulate the water and a second
 filtration system. Since you are in the cold dip pool for
 only 2 minutes at a time, having a very thorough
 filtering system (as recommended for the hot tub
 soaking) is not vitally necessary but it is ideal.
 Another method is to have a large bowl or bucket of ice
 water nearby and have a few hand towels in it. You take
the ice cold towel and put it on your head and neck.
  Immerse your wrists into the ice water for up to 2
minutes with your hands open. Open hands allow the
 heat in your hands to dissipate more efficiently than
  with a clenched fist. The whole body may start tingling
 or chilling to the brain and then your bones. This is a
 manifestation of sudden increased circulation and is
 nothing to be concerned about. Store bought ice packs
 designed to be on the skin can work in this way too like
36

 the ice water towels. However they start warming
 quickly and need to go back into the freezer to be able
to be used again.
  A shower is another method of cooling off.
 A bathtub or an old fashioned “claw foot” bathtub can
 be used for
a
 cold dip. The older ones are less
 expensive than buying a smaller, additional wood tub.
 If you get an old used claw foot tub, ensure you get the
 original finish on them that is baked on. The ones that
 are re-finished have a different coating which expels
 toxins into the water. Perhaps this is not a big deal
 when used as a cold dip as you are in the tub for a short
 time, but if used for a hot bath the re-finished bath tubs
 should not be used. Architectural salvage places carry
 claw foot bath tubs often. Or you may find one off of
 Craigslist, Offer-Up or FB marketplace. The old claw
 foot tubs are made from cast iron and are very heavy.
 Therefore they have very good insulation qualities that
 new bath tubs often do not have.
The maximum time to spend in the cold dip pool for
  best results is 2 minutes. One can extend this to 3
minutes being out of the hot water. If one is out of the
 hot tub much more than this, the
softening
fats begin to
    harden again. This of course is counterproductive of
 your goal to melt the bad fats and expel them out of the
 body via the pores.
 Once you do the cold treatment a few times, your body
 will acclimate to the heat better. Then you will be able
37

 to stay in the hot water for longer periods.
 When one is soaking in the hot water, it can cause one
to experience weariness. And it may seem to take
  forever for a little time to pass. One solution for this is
to find something to take your mind off the heat. This
  can be a movie or reading material or a video game
 perhaps. Many things can be used to do work and keep
 one’s attention off the hot water and increased body
 heat.
HOT AND COLD THERAPY
 This set up of a hot tub and cold dip pool highly
 facilitates the ability to go back and forth many times
 for hours. This activity moves out of the realm of just
 hot tubbing for our purposes and into hot and cold
 therapy. This is a very healthy option to have!
 There are several books and writings about the benefits
of hot and cold therapy and there are several ways to
  do it. It is known as an excellent way to help the body
 circulate and increase blood flow for health and
 healing. It is invigorating! The Japanese have been
 doing it for hundreds of years up to temperatures of
107 to 115 for the hot water.
  Contrast therapy is a powerful form of hydrotherapy
 often used by Athletes. One immerses a limb or the
 whole body into hot water for a time and then
38

 immediately into ice cold water. Contrast therapy can
 help move the lymph fluid quickly and efficiently
throughout the body and reduce inflammation. This
  kind of pumping of the vascular/ capillary system
boosts the blood flow of the body causing one to feel
 invigorated and alert. See “Hydrotherapy” in the
  glossary.
 Natural hot springs are wonderful. But you need to
 check the temperature for them to qualify as a
 lymphatic cleansing hot water therapy.
 A popular doctor in California who cured cancer as well
 as other ailments successfully with herbal treatments
 considers hot and cold therapy a key element in his
 treatments. This is Dr. Richard Schulze. And he says:
"If you ask me what was the most POWERFUL Healing Method, that helped my patients RECOVER from their CANCERS, it was HOT and COLD Water Therapy. You can't get Blood to move in and out of different areas of the Body with ANY Therapy that even comes CLOSE to the POWER of Hydrotherapy!! The 2nd CLOSEST thing for circulation would be to take Habanero Cayenne Peppers. It's the ONLY Herb that I know, that you can eat and it will make your Face red with Blood. Habanero Cayenne Pepper and Bodywork are GOOD for Blood Flow, but Bodywork and Habanero Cayenne Pepper, as GREAT as they are, are still a JOKE compared to the POWER of Hydrotherapy!!"

 Chapter Five
DIET SUGGESTIONS TO FACILITATE DETOXIFICATION USING A HOT TUB
DIET SUGGESTIONS
 Pineapple contains a high level of bromelain that will
 help break down dead cells and it eats away at and
 neutralizes toxicity. It is like a natural dissolving agent.
 When eating pineapple with the raw fats (raw butter,
raw cream & fresh raw coconut cream) you have a
  healthy food that helps to neutralize and absorb the
 toxicity under the skin. Once neutralized, the toxins are
 then dispelled from the body via the sweat glands.
 Coconut cream mixed with some fruit gives you the
best solvent or dissolving agent that dissolves toxicity
  in the lymph system. When you add raw egg to the mix
 it works even better.
41

 Coconut cream and pineapple are very helpful to help
 break down the bad fats or lymphatic waste under the
skin. This food combination assists the detoxification
  procedure when using the hot tub. But the food can’t do
the job alone with a lymph system that is compromised.
 The body will never eliminate lymphatic waste
  properly without hot water therapy. It takes about 45
 minutes at 105 degrees steady temperature for the
 body to start eliminating the lymphatic waste.
 One recipe is: One quarter cup to one cup of unripe
 pineapple with three to six tablespoons coconut cream,
 one to three tablespoons unsalted raw butter and one
 to two tablespoons raw dairy cream. One can vary it
 and add things like ginger and/or turmeric (both of
 which help circulation) and unheated honey (never
 heated above 93 degrees F) which aids in the digestion
 of fats and protein.
 The bromelain in the pineapple helps to prevent the
 melted lymphatic congestion from hardening as much
when the body temperature later normalizes after
  getting out of the hot tub.
Raw dairy (raw milk, raw butter and raw cream) can be
 found by contacting representatives of the Weston
  Price Foundation in your local area. The website
 address is https://www.westonaprice.org.
 Hydration drinks that are very good during and after
 the hot tub soak can be made in a blender containing
42

 any of the following:
 cucumber; tomato; watermelon; whole raw milk; fresh
raw liquid whey. Use about 3 cups of any of these
  mixed to your desire.
 Remainder of the ingredients which are good are:
1 tbsp. raw apple cider vinegar 2 tbsp. lime juice
2 tsp. lemon juice
2 tbsp. raw coconut cream
2 tbsp. raw dairy cream
1-2 tbsp. unheated honey (optional)
      2-3 raw eggs (Chickens that are not fed soy products
 and pastured produce the healthiest raw eggs.)
  Blueberries or blackberries can also be added as
 desired.
 Water can be added to your liking
  one half to one cup.
A good hot day hydration drink if you have a
  vegetable juicer is:
50% Cucumber 20 % Celery 20% Tomato 10% Parsley
—usually about
    43

NOTE ON RAW MILK AND RAW DAIRY
Whole raw milk is a food from nature that contains all
 the necessary enzymes and good natural bacteria for
  proper utilization and digestion. It can reverse and
prevent malnutrition. Raw whole milk contains natural
  antibodies. It promotes the detoxification of
 accumulated toxins, mutant cells and decay. It
 facilitates digestion, helps tissue development and has
 been found to help the reversal of cancer. Raw cream
 promotes calm nerves and protects the nerves. Raw
 cream also nutrifies the nervous system and brain.
 Raw butter soothes and cleans the cells. These are all
 very healthy foods.
 Kefir or clabbered milk made from raw milk is a natural
 process. It is this process from which cottage cheese
 and yogurt are made and whey is obtained. If anyone
 has any difficulty digesting raw milk, it is easier to
 digest as kefir or with a small amount of unheated
 honey mixed in. It is very rare that anyone has
 difficulty digesting truly raw milk.
 Raw milk can be obtained from a variety of animals:
 cows, goats, sheep, camels and water buffalo. These
have all been available in the US in recent times. Each
  has its own variation of nutrients. Cow milk is the most
 common and abundant. Goat milk is next in line for
availability. Cow milk takes the longest to digest. Goat
  milk digests faster and sheep milk even faster. Sheep
 milk is high in vitamin C. Camel milk is a better milk to
44

 consume if you are in a dry , arid climate.
 There are claims that raw milk cause sickness. This has
never been proven. There is no scientific study in
  existence that proves that raw milk is dangerous to
health. The book entitled “The Milk Book” by Dr. W.C.
  Douglass provides information about the vitamins and
 minerals that are destroyed in milk by pasteurization.
 The fats in pasteurized milk become lipid oxides which
 are known carcinogens. Only pasteurized milk
 putrefies.
 WATER
 Quality water suggestions are spring water brands
 provided in glass. It can be obtained sparkling or not.
 Mountain Valley Spring water is a good one. In many
 areas of the US there is a service where Mountain
 Valley Spring water can be delivered to your door in 5
 and 2.5 gallon sizes at about half the cost of what is
 charged in the stores. Some areas of the US have other
 spring water available in glass. Water in plastic of any
 kind is not recommended as tiny plastic particles can
be leached into the water.
 A natural sparkling mineral water gives you the
  hydrogen peroxide effect of breaking down toxins. It
neutralizes and separates them so it is good to add it to
  the hydration drinks or drink it by itself.
45

 If you have a well, well water is good as it does not
 contain the chemical additives that most city water has.
The water must be from a deep well that gets water
  from the aquifer. In Florida for example the aquifer
ranges from 90 to 270 feet deep depending on location.
 If you do not already have a well and would like one,
  you can have one drilled for you by a company that
 provides this service. Shallow wells that do not reach
 into the aquifer are just as toxic as the chemically
 treated city water if not worse. Such wells that do not
 obtain water from the aquifer are used solely for
 irrigation and not recommended for drinking by the
 local municipalities.
 Deep well water
 does
 need to be filtered as there are
 commonly toxic substances that you do not want in
 your hot tub soaking water, such as radon, arsenic,
 iron, manganese, nitrates, hydrogen sulfide, etc. It is
 normal for a well owner to have his well water tested
 yearly to ensure such items are being properly filtered
out.

 HOW TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN
 YOUR OWN WOOD HOT TUB

 Chapter One
 WATER FILTERS AND FILTER MEDIA.
 HOW TO GET THE CLEANEST POSSIBLE
 WATER TO SOAK IN
HOW TO GET CLEAN WATER FROM CITY WATER
The whole point of having the cleanest possible water
 to soak in is that soaking the body in water that
  contains toxic chemicals or toxic minerals can be
harmful to the body. These elements will get into the
  body via the pores. If the chemical is strong creating
 vapors, as can be experienced with chlorine from city
 water in the shower and public pools, the vapors can
 get into the body via the sinuses and lungs when
breathed. These chemicals once inside the body can
  cause damage to cells, kill cells, create dead and toxic
49

 cells that store in the body creating a toxic
 environment. This condition is one where healthy
circulation is inhibited and such growths as cancer
  (tumors) can grow and thrive. One swim in a chlorine
pool won’t do much harm. It is the accumulation effect
 and soaking for hours that can cause such conditions.
  Municipal city water is known to contain the following
 contaminates: aluminum, arsenic, copper, iron, lead,
 pesticides, herbicides, uranium, ammonia, barium,
 cadmium, chloramine, chlorine, chromium, fluoride,
 bacteria, viruses, mercury, perchlorate, radium,
 selenium, manganese, PFAS (complex chemical
 compounds) and silver. Not only that but according to
 Associated Press investigation in 2008, tiny amounts of
 pharmaceuticals were found in 24 major cities water
 supplies including bisphenol-A, antibiotics, opiates,
 hormones and mood stabilizers.
 In 2004 Prozac was found in the river system and
 groundwater used for drinking in Britain. In the USA
(2004) the Environment Agency concluded Prozac was
  in the water table and is a concern. Chlorination of the
water neutralizes only about 50% of such
 contaminates. Boiling the water does not remove these
  contaminates. Very thorough filtration is the best
 answer.
 In 2007 I worked with Aajonus Vonderplantiz to
 develop a filtering system that would provide drinking
 quality water (or as close to that as one can get) for hot
50

 tubbing. The filter system is designed to eliminate toxic
 chemicals from the city water supply so proper hot
tubbing (detoxification and purifying the body and
  lymphatic system) can be done.
In a nutshell, what was worked out was a three stage
  filter system in the sequence as below:
1.
2.
3. Sandfiltration.
The application of these can be as follows: Paper cartridge filter in one filter housing.
 Paper filter which gets down to 5 microns of
 filtration. This was the first stage of the filter
 system as the paper itself has toxic properties
 being chemically produced itself.
 Coconut activated carbon filter media. This is a
 common filter media for drinking water.
    The activated carbon can have its own filter housing or
 be combined with the sand in a large sand filter. Most
 sand filters filter from the bottom to the top, so the
 activated carbon would be on the bottom of the filter
and the sand on top.
  Organic Coconut Activated Carbon was used and is
 recommended.
It is really as simple as that. This is the 2007
  technology.
 In recent times other filter media have been developed
51

 that gets down to 1 micron of filtration. This is
 Activated Filter Media (AFM) which is defined later in
this chapter.
  There are tips and tricks about how to best set this up.
One is that in the sand filter it is good to have ordinary
  pea gravel (wash the dirt off the pea gravel first very
 well) up to the point about level to where the filtering
 rods start pushing out the water up the filter. This
 makes for easier flow of the water through the filter
 media. It also saves on filter media as below these rods
 no filtration is done.
 If you are using clay in the hot tub water and a paper
 filter, it is good to have a three way valve installed to
 bypass the paper filter temporarily. The clay will clog
 the paper filter after a short time and you will need to
 change it far too frequently. When you change the hot
 tub water (discussed below) you use the paper filter to
 thoroughly filter the fresh batch of water going into the
 hot tub. Filter the new water about 4 to 5 full cycles. In
other words, all the new water is filtered at least 4 to 5
  times using all 3 filters. Once this batch of fresh water
is filtered in this way, then bypass the paper filter with
 the 3 way valve and use the activated carbon and sand
  filter for normal filtration. This provides good filtration
 for the period before the next change of water and
 saves on having to change the paper filter about every
 3 months. The paper filter will last about a year when
 this is done.
52

OZONE
Ozone is a gas. Ozone molecules have 3 oxygen atoms
  unlike the oxygen in the air that gives life to the planet
 which has 2 oxygen atoms. Thus, ozone is an oxidizing
 agent. It oxidizes virtually everything and this is not
 good in many aspects. It can turns oils into oxidized
 substances which are very toxic. The EPA has set
 standards for outdoor air quality to protect public
 health and ozone is one element that is monitored and
 controlled as breathing it can cause health problems.
 Ozone used in water treatments does not clean the
 water of chemicals.
 It is a biocide and destroys bacteria
 and viruses and keeps the algae from growing. We are
 concerned with eliminating toxic chemicals.
 Hot tubs normally have a cover which is used to
 insulate the hot tub and keep the water hot when not in
use to conserve energy. Algae won’t grow without
  sunlight. Thus, there is no reason to be concerned
 about algae in your hot tub if you have a cover for it.
 Aajonus had a concrete hot tub open to the sunlight and
 algae grew abundantly. It was about half an inch to an
inch thick. It was like a silk lining and felt very nice.
  Algae is not harmful as the pool chemists insist (in
 order to sell their chemicals). Algae in lakes is common
 and normal.
53

Ozone generators for a hot tub or pool are not recommended. Nor are ionizers. They create the situation of dissolving tissue when you bathe or soak in the water as well as the other factors as noted above.
POOL SALT CHLORINATORS
 Salt chlorinators for pools provide a way to get
 nontoxic chlorine in the pool. These are
 electrical
 chlorinators. You put in rock salt which is basically sea
 salt. It is not cleaned or sterilized like table salt (Table
 salt has chlorine added to it.). The system sends an
 electrical charge through it and it converts some of the
 salt into chlorine that is a non-chloroform vapor type of
 chlorine.
 Most pool services that service salt chlorinated pools
 do it differently which is not healthy. They normally
 use commercial salt provided by pool stores, not rock
salt. When testing the water for pH and chlorine levels
  if the salt by itself does not reach their chemical
 standards, then they add regular chlorine
etc.,
to the pool. This chlorine gives off chloroform vapors and
contaminates the pool with the toxic type of chlorine. They use tablets or packets of chlorine in powder form which is called “shocking” the pool.
 Needless to say shocking the pool is toxic and ruins
 your salt chlorinated pool water. The pool service
companies have standards they are ordered to follow
 54

 to kill bacteria and keep algae from growing. They have
 insurance liabilities and are not concerned about a
healthy pool per se or a 100% salt chlorinated pool
  using rock salt. It is best to learn to do it yourself using
rock salt or untreated natural sea salt and not use the
 pool store salt. It is not difficult at all once you are
  trained on it and it will save you money.
 If you have a pool and hot tub combination you can
 filter the pool water in the same way as the hot tub for
 cleaner pool water. Using the AFM and Healthy Home
 System pool filtration system, you will not need a salt
 chlorinated system and won’t get algae.
 If you are still concerned about the chemicals in the hot
 tub or pool you can get lab tests done to determine the
 chemical toxicity of the water by testing for each
 chemical one at a time.
MORE ON POOL FILTRATION AND CLEAN POOL / HOT TUB WATER
 Recently a new filter media came on the market called
Activated Filter Media (AFM) which is 3 stages (fine,
  medium & coarse) of ground glass and can be used in
 an ordinary sand filter housing. It filters down to 1
 micron. AFM is currently being used with other
 products and the combination is promoted to be an
 excellent product for clean fresh non chlorine pool
55

 water and whole house water filtration systems.
 AFM can be used by itself with salt chlorinated pools or
as a stage in hot tub water filtering system. The name of
  one company that is currently marketing this product
and product line is Healthy Home Systems from
  Clearwater Florida.
AFM has a life span of up to 10 years when backwashed about every 3 to 6 months. Usage plays a role in how often the filter media needs to be backwashed.
 I have not tested AFM as of this writing. Considering it
 filters to 1 micron and is glass which does not leach out
 any chemicals, it is very promising.
 KDF Filter Media
 KDF
 stands for Kinetic Degradation
 Fluxion.
 KDF
®
 filter media. It
 is a high-purity
 formulation of copper-zinc granules which uses a
 process called oxidation-reduction (redox) reaction.
 KDF media exchanges electrons with contaminates
 changing them into harmless components.
The KDF filter media was not widely known about
  when Aajonus and I were involved with designing
 filters for hot tubs in 2007. Later in 2012 he did
comment on KDF as a valid filter media as it reduces or
  removes many heavy metals out of the water.
 One key factor with KDF is that when used in a
56

 sequence of filtering
 before
 it can extend the life of the activated carbon
significantly. This is important as the normal life span
granular activated carbon,
   of KDF is about 6 years before needing to be replaced.
Activated carbon is said to last about 1 year before
 needing to be replaced. Therefore using KDF first, the
  activated carbon’s lifespan will extend. Regular
 backwashing can also extend the life of all filter media.
 There are several types of KDF tailored to specific uses.
 KDF 55 medium mesh is designed specifically
 removing
 or reducing chlorine and water-soluble
 heavy metals. It controls scale, bacteria and algae even
 in hot water. Specifics include removing or reducing
 contaminants such as chlorine, bacteria, heavy metals,
 nitrates, nitrites, aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, copper,
 iron, nickel, zinc, lead, chromium, barium, hydrogen
 sulfide, mercury, radon, magnesium, calcium carbonate,
 bacteria, algae, fungi, and selenium.

 or
There are other types of KDF. These are
KDF
-C coarse
    mesh and KDF–F fine mesh. They do the same thing
 but are for designed for applications that do not apply
 to hot tub and pool filtration.
57

 ACTIVATED CARBON
  Activated carbon is also called
 is misleading and confusing. They are not the same
activated charcoal
 which
 thing although similar. You do not want activated
  charcoal or charcoal as filter media. Only activated
 carbon. The activated carbon has been heated or
 otherwise treated to increase its absorptive power. The
 'activation' process strips or removes the
 previously
 absorbed molecules. It is used
 to purify liquids and
 gases in a variety of applications including municipal
 drinking water, odor removal and industrial pollution
 control. Its source materials are carbon-like materials
 such as coconut shells, nutshells,
 coal
 , peat and wood.
 Chlorine molecules bind with carbon molecules. So it is
 good to remove chlorine from water.
 The recommended activated carbon to use is from
 organic coconut shells.
 Activated carbon’s life span on its own is about 1 year
depending on usage. If KDF is used before activated
  carbon in sequence the KDF will extend the life of the
 activated carbon.
SAND
 There are many types of sand on the market for sand
 filters. What is not recommended to use is sand from
58

 the beach or child’s play sand as this sand is not filtered
 or designed to be used in a filter.
#20 Grade Silica Sand is effective at filtering out debris
  as small as 20-40 microns.
Aqua Quartz and Palmetto are brand names of silica sand. There are other brands on the market.
Sand filter media is said to last 5 to 7 years.
ZEOLITE
  Natural
 widely
zeolite
 occurs in volcanic rock.
 Zeolite is
  used
 in domestic and commercial water
 purification and softening. Chemically,
 zeolite acts as an
 ion-exchange and separates molecules and only certain
 sizes and shapes can pass through. Zeolite is not sand.
 It reportedly has absorbing qualities double of that of
 silica sand. It removes ammonia from the water and is a
 much finer filter than silica sand and filters down to 3
microns.
 Zeo Sand is a brand using Zeolite. Its life span is the same as silica sand which is 5 to 7 years.
DIATOMACEOUS EARTH
 Diatomaceous earth
 pool filters and filter media are not
 59

 recommended. DE has a use in killing insects. Once
 eaten by the insect, it cuts insects apart and shreds
them from the inside out. DE is not recommended to
  use as a dietary supplement in any way. DE filter grade
type is high in crystalline silica and
Thus dealing with the filter media can be dangerous
toxic to humans.
    without personal protective equipment.
WATER FILTER HOUSINGS
 A sand filter housing can contain just about any type of
 filter media. Hayward sand filters have served me well
 for many years and I have had no problems with them.
 I do suggest that they be covered by a canvas tarp or
 something to protect them from the sunlight and rain.
 When they are left out to the elements, the label
 showing the function options to select by the hand
 shifter fades. Also the rain can rust the little screws
 holding things in place on the filter control housing.
 One can build an enclosure for them like a little house
 or “dog house” or have some other cover for them.
 There are several brands of sand filters on the market.
 The larger filters do not require changing the filter
media as often.
 60

BACKWASHING
Backwashing is flowing the water in reverse to clean
 the filter media and purge out sediment collected in the
  filter media over time. It “refreshes” your filter media.
This is normally done when the hot tub water is
  changed (about every 2 months depending on use.)
 You do it until the water is clear as can be seen from
 the sight glass on the sand filter. It starts out turbid and
 you continue to backwash until the water is clear. This
 extends the life of the filter media and provides cleaner
 filtered water.
 To perform this task, you make water flow adjustments
 on your filters and backwash one filter at a time. You
 put the first filter you want to backwash on the
 backwash setting or backwash mode. The other filters
 you put on recirculate. The water will run in reverse
 taking the water from the hot tub and pumping it out
 through the filter system backwards to the drain line of
 the filter and out to the ground.
 Once the water is clear through the sight glass of the
 first filter, then rotate to the next filter putting the
 second filter on backwash and the others on
recirculate. Repeat until all filters have been
  backwashed and the sight glass of each shows clear
 water flow. You may need to add fresh water to the hot
tub to get each filter fully backwashed.
  The owner’s manuals of the filters have backwash
 instructions. They also have instructions for installing
61

 the filter media. The procedure for adding filter media
 to the filter is reversed for changing the filter media.
SUGGESTED FILTER SYSTEM DESIGN
1. AFM
2. KDF
3. ActivatedCarbon 4. Sand.
 Considering all the info contained herein, I recommend
 the following sequence of filtration:
     I consider with this up to date filtering technology and
 adding Terramin clay to the water with salt and
 vinegar, one would have very clean water and a hot tub
 as close to a natural mountain hot spring as one can

 With this system in place and proper backwashing
 being done, it is expected that the filter media will last
 quite some time. The sign of dirty filter media is when
 you change the water in the hot tub after backwashing
 and the water is still a bit turbid. Then it is time to
change some filter media. With this system one could
 change the activated carbon every 2 years, the sand
  every 5 to 7 years, the KDF every 5 to 6 years and the
AFM every 8 to 10 years.

is a large
round
 usually 4 feet deep
 or more used for hydrotherapy, relaxation or pleasure.
 Some have powerful jets for massage purposes. Our
 purpose is extended to detoxification.
A historical note - hot tubs were generally made from
  marble and the
hot
 stones were added to raise the
 water temperature. Today there are marble and stone
 bath tubs or soaking tubs available. Some higher end
 homes have large stone hot tubs which are custom
built.

OFURO
A (

) is for 1
       or 2 persons. These bath tubs are found all over Japan
  in houses, apartments and traditional Japanese inns
 ryokan
[ree
 -oh-kahn]) but are now usually made out
  of a plastic or stainless steel. The sides are generally
 square rather than being sloped. Some have rounded
 ends. If you can get one large enough it is possible for a
 normal size person to get his/her whole body into an
 Ofuro at one time. The Ofuro is set up like a bathtub.
 One can customize one as a hot tub if desired,

ACRYLIC SPA
Acrylic spas (also made from fiberglass) came about in
 the 1960s. In
the mid 70's,
spa
shell manufacturers
    created the first somewhat portable
 spa. They did this
 by installing a cabinet around the shell and adding
 framework to hide the equipment under the wood
 skirting making it a self-contained unit. These units
 today are mass produced and do not hold much water,
 normally being only about 2 to 3 feet deep. Some are
 round like a tub but most have slots molded for a
 person to sit or lie down.
 These are not recommended for our detoxification
 purposes. First, they have the pump and heater near
 where you soak, so you are bombarded by EMF. The
 fiberglass or acrylic may leach into the water although
 this has not been tested. If you ever try to use one for
 the long soaks needed for detoxification you may find
 that they are uncomfortable due to the pre-molded
 permanent seat slots. There is not much room to move
 around or stretch out and relax. If well taken care of, it
 has been my experience they have a lifespan of about 4
 to 8 years. The acrylic shells have a potential to crack.
Exposing the shell to the sun speeds their wearing out
 which will increase the possibility of them cracking and
  leaking.
Most are designed for ease of use, just buy it – the
 company that sells it to you will deliver it – get it placed
 68

 and plug it in to 110 volt mains. But as mentioned
 above, the pump and heater need to be re-located due
to the EMF. There is a trade off with using 110 volts. It
  can be more convenient than running a 220 line, but it
takes twice as long to heat up the water using an
 electric heater. No power is saved using a 110 volt
  system.
One advantage to them is due to the smaller amount of water acrylic spas use and the fact they are normally well insulated for an electric heater set up, they do not cost much to power compared to a wood hot tub heated with an electric heater. A wood hot tub with triple the amount of water heated with natural gas costs about the same to heat as an electric acrylic spa.
A wood hot tub properly built and cared for will last 15 to 20 years. A marble or stone hot tub will of course last almost forever unless damaged.

BLOW UP PLASTIC HOT TUBS & METAL SOAKING TUBS
 These types are not recommended. The plastic tubs
 would leach into the water. The metal tubs would have
 tiny metal particles or metal ions leach into the water.
FREE HOT TUBS
It is common for these acrylic hot tubs to get used up or someone bought it for a fad or on impulse and they no longer want it. They place it for sale on the
 fact that often these are junk and damaged. They are
used market
 for a small price or for free. One must be alert to the
  very difficult to move. Thus the owner is happy to give
 it away to avoid paying $300.00 or so for someone to
 come and take it away. Some good ones can be found
 on the used market that do work fine. I have found
 these are few and far between. If you get one, it needs
 to have the pump and heater re-located far enough
away from the soaking area so you are not affected by
  the EMF when soaking.
TYPES OF PUMPS AND HEATERS
The natural gas heater is the most economical by far.
 71

 Next in line is propane and last is the electric heater.
 The cost of running these depends upon: how long it is
run, how hot, the ambient temperature, how far the
  plumbing is from the heater to the hot tub, if the
plumbing lines are insulated or not and the insulation
 qualities of the hot tub.
  I have used Pentair pumps and natural gas heaters and
 done well with them. I have had very poor results with
 Raypack electric heaters. I have had good success with
 Hydro-Quip electric heaters. There are many brands
 on the market to choose from.
 Wood fired or wood burning heating systems for hot
 tubs are hot tubs with a wood fire in a metal box in the
 water that heats the water through conduction.
 Another type of wood fired hot tub is having nearby a
 wood burning stove. The water is run through
 plumbing to a heat exchanger that is heated by the
 wood burning stove. With these, it is extremely
 difficult to maintain a constant temperature and they
are therefore not recommended. Wood burning
  heating is very labor intensive in regard to starting and
maintaining a fire and cleaning up the ashes.
 There is no specific pump or heater exclusively for hot tubs. Pool heaters and pumps are simply adapted for hot tub use.
The money savings with natural gas is worth the installation time and cost. Electric heaters are the easiest to install but the cost of running them can be 5
72

times or more than a natural gas heater.
When gas heaters are not in use, carbon deposits can start to corrode the interior cabinet and will cause you problems. This is why it is a good idea to start your heater and run for at least 5 minutes at least once a month.
 With natural gas heaters, the higher the BTU rating, the
 faster the hot tub will heat up. A 100,000 BTU heater is
 plenty for a hot tub and raises the temperature about 7
 to 10 degrees per hour. The market is always changing
 with pool heaters and pumps.
 Pumps vary depending on horse power and size of
 piping. I have had good success with Pentair Veriflo
 pump. It is run on 220 volts and is designed to save as
 much as 90% on electricity compared to regular pumps
 and is very quiet. It has 2 inch PVC plumbing going in
 and out. It is also programmable. Heaters are designed
 not to work without water flow. Therefore having a
 programmable pump is very convenient as you do not
then need any kind of programming with the heater or
  any other part of the system.

 Chapter Three
BUILDING A WOOD HOT TUB
INTRODUCTION
WOOD SELECTION
t comes from the heart or middle of the tree. This wood
has the straightest grain with no knots. It stays the straightest and is resistant to warping.
  Most companies that sell hot tubs also sell hot tub kits
 that you assemble yourself. Most are made from
 Western Red con heart cedar. Con heart means i
 I researched buying a hot tub kit versus buying the
 wood and making my own hot tub from scratch using
 Western Red cedar con heart wood. I found that the big
companies buy wood in large wholesale quantities and
  a single guy buying can’t compete with that price. It is
 easier and cheaper to buy a hot tub kit and assemble it
yourself.
 75

 Another option is to purchase a ready built hot tub
 from one of these hot tub companies and have a trained
person do the installation for you.
 Both redwood and cedar have the best swelling and wood rot resistant properties of any wood which makes them the best choice for a hot tub. The con heart vertical grain wood is less likely to naturally bend or warp and should last 15 to 20 years.
popular in the late 70’s to early 80’s the planet was running out of redwood so laws
were enacted to protect the redwood trees. Cedar then became the wood of choice for hot tubs.
Other types of wood can be used to build a wood hot tub. Douglas fir was used commonly in the past for making ships. White oak and pine can be used as well. Alaska cedar is reportedly a harder wood than Western Red Cedar and lasts 20% longer.
 Redwood hot tubs are not sold by companies anymore
 as when hot tubs got
 The wood selected must be kiln dried with vertical
grain. Kiln dried wood expands making a water tight
  seal when you add the water to the tub. The metal
straps that surround the hot tub are bound tight with
 the dried wood as it is assembled. However, it is the
  swelling that creates the seal. It can take 4 to 6 days for
 the wood to expand out fully and become water tight.
 Leaking is normal until this process is complete.
Knotty wood should not be selected for a hot tub. It can
 76

 be used if the knot is only partly on the surface of the
 wood and does not go all the way through the board. If
the knot goes all the way through you will get trouble.
  The knots may not swell very well and may also warp
after a few years. A knot can leak after a while and
 even rot out or pop out in which case you will have a
  hole in your tub. The repair of a hole is not practical.
 Perhaps the stave can be replaced. It is better and
 easier to just pay the extra money and get wood with
 no knots.
FOUNDATION
 Concrete is best. The foundation needs to be level and
 solid. A 4 inch pad of concrete is standard and
 recommended. This is the standard thickness of a
 driveway. You do not need steel mesh or re-bar for a 4
 inch thick concrete pad.
You can mount a hot tub on a wood deck but it would
  probably need reinforcement to hold the weight of the
 hot tub and water. A 6x4 hot tub with water weighs
 about 6200 pounds. Thus, the wood deck weight
 bearing capabilities would need to be evaluated to see
if reinforcement is needed.
 77

CONCRETE FOUNDATION ALTERNATIVES
If you do not have or do not want to build a concrete
 slab for your hot tub there are other options. One is
  railroad ties. Space them every 12 inches or 14 inches
on center. You can place them on gravel or just the dirt.
  Realize if you place the ties on the dirt they will
 eventually rot out from the dirt moisture even with the
 creosote coating.
    Another option is to use a 6 to 8 inch gravel bed upon
 dirt.
  Partial underground hot tubs I have found not to work
well. The wood gets wet and can stay wet next to the
  ground. The wood can’t breathe well and dry out well.
 This causes the wood to rot out much faster than its
 usual life.
78

WOOD HOT TUB KITS AND DATA ON BRANDS AND BANDS
 Each hot tub manufacturer that sells pre-built hot tubs
 or hot tub kits to assemble has their own proprietary
 method of adjoining the staves and putting together the
 hot
 tub. Each
 company by their own design is vying to
 be “the best and only” but in actual fact, all they are
 doing is trying to make it so a table saw is not needed
 for the last stave. Many people don’t have a table saw
 or are not trained to use one. I have found to get the
 best results the last stave is
 always
 a custom cut
 needing a table saw. The angles and width are different
 on the last stave for each hot tub. There is no way
 around this really for the perfect fit. Yet the hot tub
 companies do try with their methods and often they do
 work fine.
 Each hot tub company sells steel rings or hoops that
 surround the hot tub and hold the tub together. This is
similar to a wine barrel. I have used a few types over
  the years. They all work fine really. Thus, if you are
building your own tub from scratch, just get the hoops
  you feel are the best from one of the companies. If you
 buy a kit, the hoops or rings will come with the kit. The
 companies I have worked with are Robert’s Hot Tubs in
 northern California; Snorkel Hot Tubs in Seattle
Washington; and Northern Lights in Canada.
  Another hoop/ring option is a silo distributor.
79

 Another is to get 2 to 3 inch metal strips the length of
 the circumference of the hot tub with threaded bolts
welded into them. Or get a 90 degree edge with a bolt
  hole on each end of the hoop. Then insert a nut and bolt
to tighten. The welding can be done by a local welding
 shop. Another option is a cable; form loops at the end
  and secure them with clamps. Then use a turnbuckle to
 tighten them. A plastic shield should be placed around
 the turnbuckles to protect the wood while tightening.
 There are many varying designs.

  tub. If you wish a 5 foot tall hot tub, the angle is the
 same but the stave is longer of course and it will hold
 more water.
BASE SUPPORT OF TUB
Procedure
Decide on size of the hot tub you want to build
1. Procure the materials and tools
 They can be simply 6x6 or 4x6 pressure treated beams.
This supports the floor of the hot tub and they rest on
  the concrete slab or other foundation.
   83

2. 3. 4.
5.
Get the angle for the staves from the grid that you
 will use for the cuts
  Set up your table saw using the protractor so you
can cut the staves to the correct angle
  Use less expensive wood for a test cut. Adjust the
 angle as needed so it is exact as per the angle laid
 out in the grid
 Bevel cut all the staves using the table saw and
 the angle of the staves per the grid except for 1
 stave which you will cut last. You are cutting this
 bevel on both sides of the stave.
 You are making a custom sized trapezoid. It is
 this angle that forms the round tub by putting all
 the pieces (staves) together.
  Trapezoid:
 84
6. Using the table saw and dado blade, notch all the staves to accept the floor. Measure 3 inches up

from the bottom of the stave and make the notch there. The notch is to be 5/8th of an inch deep. Make the width of the notch 1/16th to 1/8th less than the width of the floorboard so it can fit tightly around the floor.
   7. Clean any burs and edges off the staves and keep them dry.
85

8. Collect up the floor boards and square them off with the table saw so they fit very tightly together. Just trim off like 1/16th of an inch or a saw blade width on the edges to do this. You want these boards totally flush with no gaps.
9. Set up your drill with the jig to drill holes in the ends of the floor boards to accept the dowels. The jig is used to ensure a square hole is drilled. Set it up to drill a hole in the center of the floorboard edge.
10. Drill the one dowel hole 3 inches from each end and two others spaced in between so there are 4 dowels total. You will need to measure accurately both sides of each of the floorboards which are to fit to themselves using the dowel holes. You want them to align easily when assembling and be flush with each other. If there is a bit of wood
11. Lay out the floor boards.
12. Drill each dowel hole 1 & 1/8th deep in each floor
board that will be connecting to each other.
13. Insert the dowels and using a rubber hammer, gently drive the floor boards together.
14. Once the floor boards are tightly together, using

 form the circular floor.

the 1 x 3 nominal wood, secure the floorboards to themselves using 1 & 5/8th inch screws. You will need to cut the 1 x 3 to size. Space these evenly across the floorboards. Be careful to not drill through the whole floor board, (but you should not be able to with that size wood and screw.)
15. This will be the bottom of the floor.
 16.
 Draw the circle for the circumference cut. For a 6
 foot tub, measure 3 feet into the floor boards
now assembled and find the center. Take a nail
  and put it into this center just enough to hold it
 in place. Take a string and create a noose in it.
87

 Put the noose around the nail. Mark out 3 feet
 from the center and attached a marker to the
string. Then draw your line. This is for a 6 foot in
  diameter hot tub. A larger or shorter diameter
would have a different measurement
 accordingly.
 17. 18. 19.
20.
 Now that the line is drawn, carefully make your
 circumference cut with a jig saw. Make sure your
 jig saw is properly set for a 90 degree cut.
 With a light sander such as an orbital sander or
 by hand, chamfer both edges of the floor to aid in
 the attachment of the staves.
 Flip over the floor and place it on the support
 4x4 or 4x6 beams and get it even and supported.
 The floor should have about 2 inches of working
 room on the sides to allow for the stave
 installation.
 Install the staves one at a time using the rubber
 hammer to secure them in place. Use the blue
masking tape to hold them together as you go
 along. You may also need some kind of brace. Do
  not pound the staves in completely at first; this
 will help to snug up the staves to each other as
 they come together at their angles. Once you
 have installed several staves, go back and pound
 them in completely. Make sure you pound the
 staves in sideways as you go along. Repeat these
steps as you go along.
 88

 21.
 The final stave is a custom cut as the angle is
 dictated by the width and it is bound to be
 different. Measure at the bottom both inner and
 outer angle with a protractor. Re-measure and
 cut a test piece to fit. Set this mock stave in place
 and if the angle and width are correct, then cut
 the final stave with the proper wood. If not, re-
 measure and adjust until you have the correct fit
for the final stave. Then install.
 22.
RING INSTALLATION
Make your cut for a drain in the floor if you are
 going to install a drain.
 For a 4 foot tall hot tub, the first ring is set directly at
 the edge of the floor where the staves meet the floor.
 89

 Tighten them snugly.
 The second ring is at 12 to 14 inches from the bottom
of the floor.
  The third ring is set at 44 inches or so.
 The forth ring is placed near the top, about 6 inches
 down from the top. I recommend 4 rings for a 4 foot tall
 hot tub and 5 rings for a 5 foot tall hot tub.
 Stagger the lugs of the rings so they are not all in a row
 going up the hot tub.
 Tighten the bottom ring as well as you can. Take the
 rubber mallet and pound on the ring to tighten the
 wood staves into the floor even more. Then re- tighten
 the ring again. Repeat.
 Continue on up without the mallet on the upper rings.
 Then start again at the bottom until the rings are about
 as tight as you can get.
PLUMBING AND PLUMBING CUTS
Once the rings are installed on the hot tub, now is a good time to measure for the plumbing holes and cut them. You will have 2 intake holes a minimum of 3 feet apart and about 3 inches up from the floor. If they are closer than 3 feet apart it is a safety hazard as the suction can potentially drown someone. The water
90

inflow hole should be higher on the wall of the tub about 3 feet up from the floor for a 4 feet tall hot tub. Cut the plumbing holes so it is tight fit for the fitting and secure with silicone waterproof sealant.
If you desire to install jets, more holes will need to be cut for this additional plumbing. You will need to obtain
 91

a design or plan for the jets and work out where the holes for the jets will go. If you get a hot tub kit from a hot tub company, they can provide installation instructions for the jets. They should also have a jet diagram and other information to assemble your hot tub.
 It is a good idea to install couplers on both sides of each
 filter so that the filters can be removed easily for
 changing the filter media in the future.
 Flex (flexible) PVC can be obtained from your local pool
 store. Ordinary hardware stores do not normally carry
 Flex PVC.
 Basic plumbing knowledge is required for the
 installation of PVC plumbing for the hot tub pump,
 heater and filters.
     Sunlight (UV)
will
make
PVC
brittle over time. It is
 recommended that the pipe be protected
 from
 ground
sunlight
 exposure for permanent above-
  PVC
 pipe installations. The easiest way to do
this is by painting the pipe. A water-based paint
  designed for exterior use is best.
BENCHES
To measure for the bench, take the wood to be used and lay it on top of the tub. Go under it and scribe the angle along the inner edge. Cut the marked line with a
92

jig saw. Save the pieces. Measure and get the height you want for the bench. Then make blocks or ledger pieces to support the bench from the scrap pieces you have. These ledgers will be about the width of a stave or a bit smaller. Measure and mark where you want the supports to go. Mark the screw holes for mounting the ledger blocks. Do not screw into the seam of the stave. Have the screws for the support blocks for the bench lined up to be at least one inch away from the seams. Pre-drill the holes in the ledger blocks. Set the ledgers into place using a level and screw them in. Install the bench on top of them and counter sink the screws holding the bench in place. Use stainless steel or deck screws that are waterproof. Be sure the screw is not too long when installing the ledger blocks. Do not penetrate the wall of the hot tub with the screw. Allow at least 5/8th of an inch minimum space to the outside wall. 3/4 of an inch is plenty to secure the block and this is half the width of the 2 x 6.
93

  Repeat for more benches of different heights as
 desired. The diagram above is for one bench the same
size for the entire tub. I recommend smaller benches.
  Perhaps two benches of different height about 2 to 2.5
feet long. This allows for space with no benches so
 there is more leg room.
 94

SANDING
Sand along the top lip of the tub very well so there is no
 chance of splinters. Sand all around the tub as needed.
 STAIRS
There are a variety of ways to get in and out of the hot tub. Simple wood stairs are good. There are a few different designs and preference that take a role in this decision as well. Pre-made stairs are available from most companies that sell hot tubs which are easy to assemble or you can design and build them yourself.
SHELVES
 Many hot tub companies sell shelves to attach to the
 outside of the hot tub. These come in very handy for
 setting drinks on them or placing a monitor to watch
 movies. But be
 very careful
 when placing electrical
 components near a hot tub as if the wires get into the
water with you in the tub you can get shocked or even
  electrocuted to death if the 120 volt mains get into the
 water.
95

96

 Chapter Five
HOT TUB COMPONENT SET UP
SEQUENCE OF COMPONENTS FOR PLUMBING
 The plumbing sequence is: pump to filter system to
 heater to hot tub and return to pump.
 The filter goes before the heater so you don’t plaque it
up with dead cells coming off your skin. The vinegar
  will help keep the sea salt from corroding the heating
 element.
 Due to the electromagnetic fields (EMF) created by the
 electric heater and pump, it is healthy to have these at
least 4 to 8 feet away from the hot tub where you are
  soaking. You can check this with an EMF meter. Being
 near EMF above 3 milligauss for extended periods of
 time is not healthy for the body. The other side of this is
that the shortest distance from the pump and the least
 97

 amount of piping twists and turns makes the pump's
 job easier and is less expensive to operate. The length
of the piping should be as short as possible.
  The plumbing to use is PVC schedule 40 whether 2 inch
or 1.5 inch. You can use schedule 80 for runs coming
  directly out of the heater if you wish. Schedule 80 is
 designed for higher temperatures. But schedule 40 is
 designed to handle up to 140 degrees F and works fine.
Be sure to install check valves in the plumbing so water is not allowed to backflow into the hot tub.
JETS
 The jet bubbles in a hot tub are fun and have a
 massaging effect but they are not necessary for the
 purpose of lymphatic decongestion and detoxification
 soaks. They cost additional money and installation
 labor and they are noisy. If you want to watch a movie
or relax reading, etc., they can be a distraction due to
  the noise and water agitation.
SWELLING PROCESSING AND SEALING THE HOT TUB TO WATER TIGHT
 When starting out the swelling process to water seal
 your tub, use about 6 to 8 inches of water (hot water if
98

 possible) and let it sit for a few days. Fill it back up to 6
 to 8 inches if it leaks too low during this period. Keep at
this until it no longer leaks out and the wood is swelled
  at that level. This will save a lot of water compared to
filling it up to the top and letting it all leak out. Once
 this first 6 to 8 inches is sealed, then fill the whole tub
  to the top. It will take about 4 days for the swelling
 processes to complete at which point the hot tub is
 water tight.
 Hot water causes the wood to swell much faster than
 cold water.
A drain in the floor of the hot tub must be properly installed or it may leak. Without a floor drain you won’t have that risk but getting all the water out of the tub requires a different procedure. The method used to evacuate the water from the tub with no drain is to pump most of the water out using the drain lines of the filters (you can backwash at the same time). You then use a wet/dry shop vacuum to suck out the last bit of water (about 4 inches). Do not run the pump without water as you may damage the pump. Thus, you need to monitor this process and shut off the pump before it starts to suck air from the water inlet lines. You fill the hot tub with water using a garden hose. It is suggested to change water every 6 to 8 weeks if you are using the hot tub daily.
 NEVER apply any type of wood sealer or wood
 preservative to the inside or outside of your tub. Leave
99

 it unfinished and natural. These products may by
 harmful to your health. They may also keep your tub
from sealing properly. The wood is best preserved by
  keeping the outside dry and allowing it to breath.
Keep water in your tub at all times. Water causes the
  wood to swell, which is how the tub seals. If the tub is
 allowed to dry inside, the boards will become loose and
 the tub will leak. If you must drain the tub completely
 and leave it dry for a period, be sure to re-tighten the
 stainless steel bands before refilling.
 If after all these steps, the tub still does not seal water
 tight one remedy is to put sawdust into the water. The
 sawdust works its way into the tiny crevices and helps
 to seal the tub. You can also use clear 100% silicone
 adhesive around the bottom of the tub where the floor
 meets the staves if desired. This decision to use the
 silicone would need to be done before you put in any
 water when the wood is dry. Some hot tub companies
 recommend this and it is included in their assembly
instructions. I have always been able to seal a hot tub
  when properly built using only sawdust as needed.
HOW TO EXTRACT TANNIN FROM THE WOOD OF A NEW HOT TUB
 Newly harvested wood soaking in water will expel
 tannin into the water. The water looks like dark tea. If
100

 you soak in it, your skin takes on the color somewhat
 and it gets into your body via the pores. This is not
recommended. Some wood has this issue more than
  others. If you have an excessive amount of tannin
coming into your hot tub water, it is recommended you
 do a treatment to get it out before taking long soaks in
  your hot tub. The majority of the tannin can be
 extracted from the wood by getting about a gallon of
 soda ash (available from a pool supply store) and
 putting it into the water and letting it sit for a couple of
 days. Then rinse it all out. This pulls out the majority of
 the tannin from the wood. Once this process is
 completed, fill the hot tub with fresh water.

OTHER INFORMATION ON HOT TUBS
HOT TUB TRANSPORTATION
 To move your built hot tub you would first (obviously)
 drain out all the water. Then get about 5 or 6 guys to lift
 it onto a truck. Another option is to get it onto a pallet.
 Then using a forklift and pallet, put onto a truck. It is
 similar to moving a piano. Taking out the waterlogged
 seats is also helpful as this cuts down on the weight of
the hot tub.
 Disassembling it and reassembling it would require
  drying of the wood before rebuilding. The drying of the
 wood could take 3 months or more in a hot and dry
 climate with the wood properly stacked so it does not
 warp. Or it could be taken to a place there they kiln-dry
 wood and have them dry it. Once fully dry you would
 have to re-build the hot tub. It is easier to move it built.
103

 When you have the hot tub into its new position, you
 will need to re-tighten the bands and re-seal it as the
staves will shift during moving.
 CLEANING
 Empty the tub of water. Use organic apple cider vinegar
 as a cleaning solvent. Pour it on the inside walls of the
 hot tub and scrub with a brush and rinse. Vacuum with
 a wet/dry vacuum or simply drain it out if you have
 installed a drain in your tub and rinse it out. You can do
 this a few times if necessary. Ordinarily it is done once
 every time you change the water.
WINTERIZING
 If you live in a climate where it gets below freezing for
any length of time you need to ensure your hot tub is
  programmed to keep warm and not freeze.
The other option is to turn off your system. To do this
 you must drain the water out of all filters, the heater,
  plumbing lines and pump. Open up all the valves to the
 pump and heater and drain plugs of the filters. Then set
 the filters to “winterize”.
 If your climate is below freezing and power goes off or
 the pump shuts down, you have about 2 hours to get
104

 the pump and heater working before the cold will
 freeze and damage your system. If you can’t heat the
system in about 2 hours then you must drain the
  system quickly so that it does not freeze and damage
the equipment. The freezing water will expand and
 break or crack the plumbing pipes and housing of the
  pump. It may also damage internal parts of the heater.
 It is a very costly mistake!
 Low water level can also shut down the pump
 unexpectedly.
 During the winter, the water must stay at 65 to 70
 degrees F minimum to avoid freezing.
SAFETY
 There are rules and regulations regarding pool safety
 which also apply to hot tubs. It is best to simply know
 and follow these rules for your local area.
Hot tubs and cold dip pools should be fenced in and
  kept out of the reach of unsupervised children. One
 simple solution is to get a hot tub cover that locks. A
 lock is a normal requirement when you purchase a hot
 tub cover. Check your local municipality on the
regulations but having a locking hot tub cover and the
  hot tub in a fenced yard may be all you need.
 There are safety factors for safe hot tubbing.
105

 If you build your own hot tub following these
 instructions, purchase your own heater and pump, etc. ,
and do the installation yourself, you do so at your own
  risk and responsibility.
Soaking in a hot tub above 104 degrees F. is considered by some US regulatory groups as unsafe. No proof exists that this is actually dangerous for a healthy person. No laws have been established to enforce hot water temperatures for anyone. Today in Japan many bath houses have water temperatures that go up to 113 or 115 degrees F. They use the higher temperatures for short soaks. Up to 107 degrees F is standard for the hot springs (onsen) in Japan for long soaks. The Hammam for Turkish hot baths (steam room) average 113 degrees F. Saunas and other steam rooms reach much higher temperatures. Saunas are typically 150 to 195 degrees F. For our uses with the hot tub and our own research for the hot water detoxification, 110 degrees F is our high limit.
In the USA, pool heater companies are regulated to
  have the thermostat high level set at 104 and are not
allowed to have markings on the thermostat that go
 above 104. Such regulatory groups purport that in 106
  degree F water or above heat strokes are a possibility.
  Yet they provide no
evidence that such has ever
 occurred as a direct result of soaking in hot water at
 106 degrees F or higher temperatures. A heat stroke is
 a very extreme condition and no one I know doing hot
 tubbing as suggested in this book has ever come close
106

 to such.
 Such regulatory groups also state that there is a
possibility of even 104 degrees F water causing fetal
  damage during the early months of pregnancy and a
pregnant woman should not soak in a hot tub in
  temperatures above 100 degree F in general. Other
 warnings include that the elderly, obese persons and
 persons with a history of heart disease, low or high
 blood pressure, circulatory system problems, or
 diabetes should consult a physician before using a hot
 tub. Persons using medication should consult a
 physician before using a hot tub since some
 medications may induce drowsiness while other
 medications may affect heart rate, blood pressure and
 circulation.
 Some pool heaters used for hot tubs may not go higher
 than 104 or 106 degrees at its highest thermostat
 setting. I had a Pentair Mini-Max 100 (100,000 BTU)
 with an analog thermostat that went as high as 112
degrees F. (This model is no longer made.) The heater
  you purchase should be tested to see how hot it gets. If
the heater you have does not heat to the desired 110
 degrees F it will need customization for it to do so. One
  simply needs to install a thermostat that will allow the
 heater to heat the water to the higher temperatures. A
 mechanical contractor or HVAC contractor is trained on
 how to replace or install a thermostat in a pool heater.
 Anyone can get 110 Degrees F hot water in a bathtub
107

 from the home hot water supply. Hot water heaters for
 the home can go as high as 150 degrees F. Most home
tap water is set at about 115 degrees F.
  Prolonged periods of exposure to high water
temperatures can raise internal body temperature and
  this is what we want for detoxification. It will occur
 when soaking in temperatures from 10
When done correctly, this is healthy for detoxification.
5
 up to 110.
  Research and experience show these temperatures
 when dealt with responsibly are totally safe.
It is smart and recommended that you know your body and introduce yourself to hot tubbing as laid out in this book gradually. Test the waters. Listen to your body and intuition in terms of how hot you want the water to get and for how long. Normally, the more one gets used to the hotter temperatures the more enjoy and desire them. Then 104 degrees F seems almost cool!
For me personally, I like to start at 108 to 109 F. And take short cold dips to keep me going. The first time I heated up hot and jumped into a cold dip pool I got dizzy and my heart started pumping fast with the shock of the temperature difference. To me this is a blessing! It felt great! To others who are perhaps fearful of this level of physical exertion, then perhaps this high level of circulation and health approach is not correct for you.
 An unhealthy person may have issues with their body’s
 ability to regulate temperature. This also applies to
108

 children. High body temperature can affect people
 differently. Too much heat may result in nausea,
dizziness or fainting. Just as if you were out in the sun
  all day at 93 degrees F (or higher), one can get
dehydrated or get exhausted when not dealing with
 such conditions correctly. For example drink enough
  fluids to stay hydrated; take a break from the heat, etc.
 One must understand such things and be prepared to
 prevent uncomfortable conditions and know how to
 deal with them if one overdoes it. This is just common
 sense.
Until you become familiar with your body’s reaction to hot water immersion at various temperatures, you should limit your hot tub time and temperatures. Once you get used to it make your judgements accordingly.
 The manufacturers of pumps and heaters provide their
 own safety recommendations and installation
 requirements. All electrical hook ups are to be done in
 accordance with NEC standards and ideally such work
should be performed by a licensed electrician. The gas
  lines as well should be installed by a licensed person
who knows the local codes and requirements to do a
 standard and safe gas line installation.

 HOW TO TEST THE ACCURACY OF A THERMOMETER
Many thermometers do not register a totally accurate temperature. They can be off by a 10th of a degree to as much as 3 degrees. The way to test the accuracy of a thermometer is to place the sensing probe into fresh (not salted) ice water using mostly ice. Water freezes at 32 degrees F. The ice water won’t get to an exact 32 degrees as the ice is melting. But the thermometer reading should get pretty close to that. If your thermometer is too far off, you should get a more accurate one as desired.
ASSISTANCE
 Hot tubs deal with water, plumbing, electricity and
 natural gas or propane. A pool contractor should have
the knowledge and license to install a hot tub for you in
  all aspects or hire sub-contractors to do the work. But
 this may not be the case in all areas. In this case one
 would need to get someone trained in each trade
separately.

 Glossary:
 Appendix:
 the appendix acts like a library for any
 poison that has ever entered your body and is a record
 of how your body needs to respond to it. It is part of the
 immune system. For example, tiny traces of all the
 snake bites, bee stings, etc. are stored in your appendix
 like an indexed library. Let’s say you get bitten by that
 same snake again, your body will know instantly by
 going to the appendix for data what remedy or anti-
 bodies are needed to deal with that poison. Then the
 body activates that remedy within twenty to thirty
 minutes. For those that have had their appendix
 removed when that same poison enters the body again,
 the body’s chemistry must re-evaluate the poison
newly to respond and this process can take up to 36 to
 40 hours.

sweetener in the world yet dangerous. Researchers in
  Italy concluded that rats exposed to varying do
 ses of
 aspartame throughout their lives developed leukemia,
 lymphomas, and several other cancers. It is hidden in
 many common foods and beverages.
 When your body
 processes aspartame, there's a part of it that gets
 broken down into methanol. Methanol is toxic in large
 quantities. Once this methanol is in your body, it is
 converted into formaldehyde, which can wreck your
 DNA and sensitive proteins. A few of the disorders that
 can be caused by aspartame are birth defects, cancer,
 diabetes, emotional disorders, epilepsy, and seizures.
Bevel:
using a water well.

  a slope from the horizontal or vertical in
 carpentry and stonework; a sloping surface or edge.
 Carbonation added:
 made by chemical synthesis. A
chemical reaction created with sodium carbide or
 another chemical. It is a chemically produced c
arbon
   dioxide and is toxic. This type of carbonation causes
 radicals or free radicals, resulting in mineral and
 oxygen deficiencies and sometimes
 it can cause a headache.
114

 Chamfer:
 to "ease" otherwise sharp edges. A sloped or
 angled corner on an edge.
 Chelation therapy:
 the use of chemicals to attract
heavy metals such as lead, cadmium, mercury, and
  plaque from soft tissues such as organs, veins and
 arteries in order to be eliminated them from the body.
 Research of over 200 cases has shown that the body
 does not discard most of those toxins attracted. Yet the
 added chemicals of chelation and the heavy metals and
 plaque so attracted re-store in the body in other areas
 such as the lymph system, skin, connective tissue,
 bones and bone marrow. Therefore, chelation therapy
 is considered as harmful to the body as chemotherapy.
  Chemtrails:
hemtrails refers to the theory that
 governments or other parties are engaged in a secret
 program to add toxic chemicals to the atmosphere from
 aircraft in a way that forms visible plumes in the sky.
Various different motivations for this spraying are
  speculated, including reduction of life expectancy,
sterilization, mind control or weather control.
 c
These chemtrails are clearly visible in the sky and
  remain in the atmosphere for hours until dissipated.
 These are not the same thing as contrails at all. (See
 contrails in this glossary.)
 Laboratory examination of chemicals found that they
 are sourced manufacturing wastes from military

 industry and bio-warfare substances. Several
 laboratory analyses revealed the composition of
chemtrails as:

Coconut Cream / Coconut Milk: an opaque, milky- white liquid extracted from the grated pulp of mature coconuts. It is a traditional food ingredient used in Southeast Asia, south Asia, Oceania, and east Africa. One can make this at home with a twin gear juicer after harvesting the white coconut meat from a mature coconut. Any sold in stores i.e. in a can or jar on the store shelf, has been heated, processed and has additives and is devoid of natural bacteria and enzymes vital to its proper digestion and utilization. Fresh coconut cream per research of over 3000 cases was found to be the most effective cleansing fat when fresh and raw. It is water soluble and easy for the body to utilize.
If you do not wish to make your own coconut cream, fresh raw coconut cream can be obtained from a company in Missouri called “Original Living Coconut”. The website is of the same name.

 Conduction:
 the process by which heat or electricity is
directly transmitted through a substance when there is
  a difference of temperature or of electrical potential
between adjoining regions, without movement of the
  material.
 Contrails:
 33,000 feet above the earth’s surface and

 or laying down on the grass with skin contact on the
 ground or by sitting, working, or sleeping indoors when
 connected to conductive systems that transfer the
energy from the body into the electrical grounding
  system of the home.
119

 EMF:
 Electro-
 agnetic
 ield radiation. EMF produces
 waves of protons and neutrons that exchange and
change the molecular structures of most biological
  substances within the EMF range. Such effect creates an
imbalance in the electron/proton balance of the atoms
 which can alter the molecular structure and behavior of
  the cells. They are measured in milligauss or gauss. The
 strongest is an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)
 machine that uses about 75,000 milligauss. Other
 sources are common electronics in a modern home at a
 much lower level in the range of 3 to 150 milligauss.
 Electric ranges produce EMF that can potentially alter
 the biological makeup of the food cooked using an
 electrically powered range or cook top. Personal
 exposure to electromagnetic pollution should be
 avoided. Earthing is said to help cure EMF effects in the
 body.

 Heatstroke
 is a condition caused by your body
 overheating, usually as a result of prolonged exposure
 to or physical exertion in very high temperatures.
 Experience shows that no one has ever experienced
 heat stroke from hydrotherapy even with temperatures
 exceeding the highest recommended temperature of

 Hydrogen peroxide effect:
 with naturally sparkling
 mineral water, there is a “hydrogen peroxide effect” or
 an antibacterial effect. It bleaches a

  not so toxic. The carbonation will increase the oxygen
level of the blood. When it gets to the intestines it turns
  into nitrogen and when it goes into the blood it turns
into oxygen. This natural carbonation also helps to
 dissolve kidney stones. Therefore, naturally carbonated
  water is a good additive to any beverage, juice or to
 drink by itself. Check the label to confirm it is naturally
 carbonated water. Ordinary hydrogen peroxide at any
 strength should never be ingested.

Hydrotherapy means to treat or heal using water. This
  can be internal or external.
 another form of hydrotherapy.
Exercises in the water is
There are various
  applications. External ones
include
hot water such as
    soaking in a hot tub or
 spa. Another is hot and cold
 water such as hot tub and cold dip pool. There are also
 saunas, steam baths, showering in cold water and
 soaking one's feet in hot water or foot bath. Heat
 compresses and ice packs are another example.
 Temperatures vary. An internal example is colonics.
 Common things treated with external application are
 high blood pressure, anxiety, aching joints, sore
 muscles, inhibited circulation, inflammation and
 lymphatic congestion.
 A similar therapy or a version of hydrotherapy is called
 ontrast bath therapy.
 This is where one immerses a
 limb or the whole body into hot water for a time
 followed by the immediate immersion of the limb or
 body into cold ice water.
c
Contrast therapy can help flush lymph fluid efficiently
 throughout the body, thus reducing inflammation. The
  pumping mechanism it creates in the vascular /
 capillary system of the body also helps boost the
 amount of nutrient-rich blood circulating around the
  body and can help you feel invigorated and alert.
The
 time spent in the hot and cold water can vary
 depending upon the doctor’s or physical therapist’s
122

 recommendations. Athletes often use contrast therapy
 for minor sprains, sore muscles and inflammation from
injuries.
 Ineffable:
too great or extreme to be expressed or
   described in words.
 Lipids:
 various organic compounds which are fatty
 acids that are insoluble in water. They include
 fats
 , oils,
 steroids, waxes, hormones, and certain components of
 membranes. They function as energy storage molecules
 and chemical messengers.
 Lipid Oxides:
 the oxidation and degradation of

  Lymphatic Congestion:
lymphatic system causing the lymph system to be
oxicity accumulated in the
  jammed and to not function properly especially the
 nodes and glands. (See the definition of the lymphatic
 system below.)
t
123

 Symptoms of Lymphatic Congestion are muscle and/or
 bone soreness, skin problems such as psoriasis and
eczema and chronic fatigue.
 a
Lymphatic system:
web network similar to the
   nervous system and cardio vascular system. The
 difference is that the lymph system has nodes and
 glands. The nodes can be as small as a BB pellet or from
 0.25 to 1.5 inches. In other terms, the glands can be the
 size of small marble up to the size of a thumb. When
 inflamed with toxicity they can expand to a larger size.
 How the lymphatic system works: It takes in waste
 inside the glands and nodes. A solvent is created by
 bacteria to break down the cell and with the lymphatic
 fluid the waste is neutralized. The lymphatic fluid
 contains high concentrations of alkalizing minerals
 such as calcium, magnesium, phosphorous and
 potassium. These minerals help to neutralize the
 acidity and makes a liquid. This liquid mixture is then
transferred into the connective tissues. These
  connective tissues are mostly under the skin. The next
step is for your body to perspire the fluid containing
 the toxicity out through the skin. However, if the
  lymphatic system is deficient or blocked, its job is
 impaired and it is not going to neutralize the toxicity.
 Then when it transfers into the connective tissues and
 is perspired to the skin, the toxic non-neutralized fluid
 damages the skin in the form of rashes, acne and hives.
124

 The lymphatic system when working properly
 neutralizes toxins and reduces toxins to smaller
substances that can be eliminated. They are eliminated
  via the pores, tear ducts, mucous membranes, vagina,
bowels, ears via ear wax and the urinary tract but
 mostly the via the skin.
  The lymphatic system is key to health by helping the
 body get rid of dead cells and other toxicity this is vital
 for health and longevity.
 Manganese:
 a mineral found naturally in the
 environment, it is one of the most abundant metals on
 the earth’s surface, in air, water, and soil. It can be
 found in groundwater and surface water from natural
 sources or as a result of mining and industrial
  discharges.
Manganese is an essential nutrient at low
 doses, elevated levels are a health concern.
 Milligauss:
 a unit of measurement of the density of a
magnetic field. According to present-day alternative
  scientists 3 milligauss is the limit for health. They have
observed that any EMF above 3 milligauss alters the
 molecular structure of animal cells.
  Driving a modern vehicle exposes the driver and
 passenger in the front seat to approximately 35-100
 milligauss of EMF when the engine is on. This has
 shown to create hyper-activity or fatigue. Some have
 experienced soreness in their legs where the EMF is
125

 highest. Pilots are exposed to EMF from 100-200
 milligauss during their flight. Many pilots have
reported that they fly only a limited amount due to the
  brain fog and fatigue they experience.
 Naturally carbonated:
 he water source or the well
 has carbon dioxide gas that is just above the water
 level. The water is extracted by a pipe an
 d another
 pipe extracts the carbon dioxide above the water level.
 Then it is mixed together into a bottle. If a label reads
 “natural carbonation added” or “naturally carbonated”,
 or “naturally sparkling”, the carbonation is natural
 from the well and has a high level of healthy
 electrolytes. It helps oxygen absorption. Brands of
 naturally carbonated waters are Gerolsteiner, Perrier,
 San Pellegrino, Apollinaris, San Faustino and Raml
 osa.

 Onsen:
 (in Japan) a hot spring, or a resort that has
 developed around a hot spring. The temperatures of an
onsen range from 122 degrees F to much higher. They
  are intended for short soaks of about 10 to 15 minutes.
An onsen often
has
baths of varying temperatures so
  one can work his/her way to the higher temperatures
  and rotate.
 Perchlorate:
 chemical compound containing the
 perchlorate ion. The majority of perchlorates are
 commercially produced salts. They are used mainly as
 oxidizers for pyrotechnic devices and to control static
 electricity in food packaging. According to US studies,
 perchlorate has found to cause harmful
 effects on
 human health, one being disrupting the functions of the
 thyroid gland and potentially leading to a reduction in
 the production of thyroid hormone.
a
 Phosphoric acid:
 a corrosive acid used as a rust
inhibitor and in etching metal. It is used as an
  ingredient in home cleaning products and is com
 added to soda and other processed foods and
monly
 beverages to give them a tangier flavor or makes the
  flavors more intense. It also acts as a preservative as it
 slows down the growth of bacteria and molds that
 would otherwise grow rapidly in a sugar-rich beverage.
 Phosphoric acid uses in food and drink are legal in the
 US as approved by the FDA and it is allowed in
127

 processed cheeses and other dairy products to adjust
 their pH levels. Scientific research suggests the
following health dangers from phosphoric acid: Lowers
  bone density, decreases bone mineral levels, kidney di
sease, kidney stones, hypocalcemia (too little calcium in
 the blood) impair the body’s utilization of vital
  nutrients such as iron, magnesium and zinc, increases
 body acidity and damages tissues. Side effects are
 chemical burns, diarrhea, stomach cramps, irritated
 and burning eyes and skin, irritated nose, throat and
 lungs, nausea, wheezing and coughing and vomiting.
 Poison:
 toxic substance that causes an impairment,
 illness, injury or death if taken into the body. A small
 amount acts as a stimulant (somethi
 ng that speeds up
 the activity of the body). A larger amount can act as a
 sedative (causing sleepiness or calmness) and when a
 very large amount is taken or is concentrated and
 potent enough, it can kill the body.

w

 little to no detoxification the organs don’t work well.
 Some parts of the body’s functions shut down. The
wrong thing to do is treat symptoms with medication
  which is just more chemical toxicity producing more ill
side effects for the long run. In ordinary old age where
 a person has difficulty doing normal functions such as
  walking, performing ordinary tasks and who exhibit
 chronic aches, pains, soreness, limited range of bodily
 movement, poor circulation, etc. the actual cells alive in
 the body have been vastly reduced. Such symptoms
 indicate that the person has approximately 30%
 percent of his/her cells alive in the body. People
 normally die when they have only 22% of the body’s
 cells alive. Research indicates that anyone dying before
 the age of 138 is suffering from such conditions.
 Detoxification and a healthy diet of no chemicals is vital
 for such a life span.
 PFAS / PFOAs
 PFOSs:
 substances
Per- and polyfluoroalkyl
: a family of man-made chemicals that
   contain fluorine, carbon, and other elements. These
chemicals have been used since the 1940s and are
 found in a variety of products including firefighting
  foams, household products such as non-stick cookware,
 food packaging, stains of various types, water
 repellants, carpets, liners in canned foods, upholstery,
 etc.. Two of the most studied PFAS chemicals are
 perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and perfluorooctane
 sulfonate (PFOS); some of these chemicals were phased
/
129

 out of production in the USA. Yet, as many as 3,000
 other PFAS chemicals still are used in a wide variety of
applications. These chemicals resist degradation
  meaning they accumulate in the environment and in
the human body and animals to a high degree over time
 and can remain in the body for up to 8 years.
However,
   according to Dr. Edward Howell and Frances Pottenger,
 toxins often are transferred to new cells for up to 5
 generations. Thus, they could remain in the human
 body for as little as 40 years for people who are on a
 diet rich in raw fats and proteins. For a person who
 eats a poor diet these chemicals can store in the body
 for their lifetime.

to 2/3rds a cup of berries or as desired. Raw meat and the raw fat from raw meat also aid in detoxifying radiation poisoning. An active circulator system (cardio vascular exercises) and hot water therapy as laid out in this book also help in the detoxification of radiation.
 Serotonin:
 is the key hormone that stabilizes our
 mood, feelings of well-being, and happiness. This
 hormone impacts the entire body. It enables brain cells
 and other nervous system cells to communicate with

 Tonsillitis
 : reddened and swollen tonsils and throat,
 with some or all of these symptoms: difficulty
 swallowing, coughing, hoarseness, headache, fever,
 earache, nausea, vomiting, sinus congestion, discharge
 and swollen lymphatic glands throughout the body.
 See “Tonsils” in this glossary.
 Tonsils
 : two oval-shaped pads of lymph tissue at the
 back of the throat above and behind the tongue. One on
 each side. The tonsils are the extension of the
 lymphatic system which cleans the body. They are very
 large lymphatic glands that protect the mouth, brain
 and thyroid from direct contamination from toxic
 substances introduced through the mouth. Tonsils
utilize fatty cells, either white blood cells or lymphatic
  cells to harness toxins. They neutralize degenerative
brain cells by eating dead red-blood cells and by doing
 so they keep the blood clean and efficient. Tonsils are
  supposed to
 erupt to break down toxins so the body can
 discard the toxins and they help fight body infection. It
 is preferable to keep your tonsils. When damage to
 tonsil tissue occurs, discharge of toxins throughout the
 surrounding tissues results, causing throat and mouth
133

 rashes and swelling.
Toxic:
i
nvolving something poisonous relating to or
   containing a poison.
 Trans-fatty acids
 are manufactured fats created
 during a process called hydrogenation, which is aimed
 at stabilizing polyunsaturated oils to prevent them
 from becoming rancid and to keep them solid at room
 temperature. They may be particularly dangerous for
 heart health and may pose a risk for certain cancers.
 Hydrogenated fats are used in stick margarine, fast
 foods, commercial baked goods (donuts, cookies,
 crackers), and fried foods.
  Trapezoid:

quadrilateral (a four sided figure) with 2
 parallel sides.
 
 Turbid:

  Whey:
 ember little Miss Muffet eating her curds
 and whey? Whey is
 the watery part of milk that
 remains after the formation of curds. Let raw milk sit
 out at room temperature for a few days and it
 separates into curds and whey. Curds are used for
 making cheese and cottage cheese and the whey is
 considered a byproduct. However it is a good food and
 has several uses. Whey has protein and other nutrients
 that are healthful. Whey can be efficiently absorbed
 into the body in its raw liquid state. It also is a blood
 thinning food. Powdered whey protein powders have
 all the enzymes and nutrients destroyed during the
 processing of the liquid whey into a powder by heating
 and dehydrating.

 About the author
 John P. Reed
 , severely affected by leukemia and
 dying, sought out natural remedies to cure himself
 through dietary nutrition and hot and cold therapy.
 John researched water filtration systems with
 renowned nutritionist
 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 with the
 purpose of having the cleanest possible water to use for
 hot and cold water therapy. The result was clean,
 drinking water quality water to soak in. The harmful
 level of toxic contaminants such as chlorine, fluoride
 and other toxic substances as found in city water
 supplies were filtered out.
With diet, persistence, time and applying the principles
 of the newly discovered hot water therapy, John was
  fully cured of his "incurable" disease.
Being trained in carpentry and as an electrician, John
 137

 designed and built his own wood hot tub system. John
 then designed and built hot tubs for others. John's
valuable experiences and the
new discovery
of healing
    using specific hot water temperatures are revealed in
this book.
