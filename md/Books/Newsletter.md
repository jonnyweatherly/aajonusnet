Soy Toxicity In Poultry Meat And Eggs; Ask your grower to select better feeds.
by dr aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition (Remedies to remove soy toxicity is in last paragraph)
   Many poultry feeds contain antibiotics, hormones, arsenic and toxic soy protein. The reasons that arsenic is used in feed are to keep insects and rodents from eating feeds, and as an antibiotic. Antibiotics are used to suppress symptoms of and hide diseases. Hormones and soy proteins are used to hasten and increase growth. All of those compounds are toxic and dangerous, causing diseases, including cancer, heart, osteoporosis and diabetes. I covered Arsenic in my accompanying article "Arsenic In Poultry Meat And Eggs; Another Cancer Connection". Here, of course, the topic is soy.
Soy must be treated to alter natural substances in it that cause sickness or death to poultry and humans when eaten. The beans must be bathed in acidic baths and heated at extreme temperatures. Then they spray­ dry it with nitrates to produce protein powder, and add artificial (chemical) flavorings, MSG, preservatives, sweeteners and other synthetic ingredients to trick the pallet of poultry and humans to eat the toxic matter. According to Dr. Jonathan V. Wright, MD, nitrates have been known for decades to cause cancer, yet the FDA allows them in many foods. Soy contains many
phytoestrogens, IGg and trypsin inhibitor that have caused cancers and inhibited growth in hundreds of animals. There are many websites that site toxicity and tests utilizing soy chemicals. Search: "Soy toxic".
Poultry, especially chicken fed high ratios of soy protein to increased meat and egg production, taste unappetizing. The more soy in the feed, the blander and oddly unappealing is the taste. Fifty years ago, the population would have rejected eggs and poultry meat that tasted like that. Poultry grown on mainly corn and other grains is rich and healthy­tasting, as well as health­giving.
Very often, poultry meat and eggs that are labeled organic are fed mainly soy, such as Rosie Organic Chicken. It is not only a misnomer, it is an outright advertising fraud. Even though the soy that is fed to its chickens was organically grown, when the soy is processed with chemicals and used as feed, it fails to be organic. Rosie "Organic" Chicken feeds its chickens up to 75% chemically­treated and processed soy.
To get your poultry and eggs producers to grow tastier and healthier meat and eggs, I suggest that you write to them, give them this information and ask them

 ThePrimalDietNewsletter ­ page
to feed their poultry raw meat scraps (fresh or rank ­ poultry love rank raw meat because they are omnivorous scavengers) for protein, and corn and other grains for delicious, flavorful and healthy meat and eggs. If they need a good mineral supplement to make eggshells stronger, suggest that they add a little Terramin clay (www.terramin.com) to their feed.
To gradually remove soy byproduct toxicity from within the body, I suggest eating a combination of 2­3 ounces coconut cream, 1­inch cube no­salt­added raw cheese, 1 tablespoon unheated honey, 2­3­inches section of unripe raw banana and 1­3 raw eggs. Eating enough raw meat daily helps remove body­stored soy­ protein toxicity.

Arsenic In Poultry Meat And Eggs; Another Cancer Connection;
Avoiding arsenic in poultry and eggs, and how to remove arsenic from the body by dr aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Many laboratory tests have proved that arsenic causes cancer even at low levels currently found in our environment. Also, evidence suggests that arsenic contributes to other diseases, such as diabetes, heart, and decline of mental function. Humans are exposed to arsenic directly from its natural occurrence in the earth’s crust but arsenic is mined and then used commercially. Drinking water, rice, and playground equipment are a few of the daily exposures to cancer­ causing arsenic. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finally lowered its long­outdated arsenic drinking­water standard by five­fold in 2001.
Arsenic contaminates many of your favorite foods, including rice and chicken, intentionally. In this article, we focus on chicken meat and eggs. For many decades, chicken farmers have been feeding chickens arsenic to hasten and increase growth and conceal symptoms of disease at youthful stages of chicken development. Of the 8.7 billion American broiler chickens produced each year, at least 70 percent have been fed arsenic. Some of that arsenic remains in chicken meat; the following chart shows how much by brand and cut.

Benzene, Cancer and Soft Drinks Connection ­
The FDA continues its harmful­to­the­public relationship with industry; How to remove benzene from the body
by dr aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
(Suggested remedy in last paragraph.)
Benzene is listed as carcinogenic by the US Food & Drug Administration (FDA). FDA and the beverage industry have been aware of the fact that sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid together form benzene in soft drinks since at least 1990. They even debated about how much a drink's exposure to heat could exacerbate the benzene­problem. There was discussion about reformulating soft drinks to reduce benzene to safe drinking­water levels but nothing was mandated. The FDA set no maximum limit for benzene in soft drinks.
Recently, a concerned industry whistle­blower paid
for independent testing and discovered that some soft drinks still contain benzene levels considerably above the limit allowed in water. The story was reported in February 2006 by a BeverageDaily.com investigation. Consequently, FDA re­opened its investigation of the benzene­issue.
An FDA chemist and the US soft­drink association stated that some soft­drink firms might not know of the potential for sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid to form benzene in drinks. Anyone who believes that any multi­billion­dollar­yearly industry is not aware of everything about the chemistry of its products is naive.

 ThePrimalDietNewsletter ­ page
The chemical reaction of sodium benzoate and ascorbic acid help create the zing and addiction that appeals to soft­drinkers. The soft­drink industry does not want to stop using it in some products even if it causes or helps cause cancer in its customers.
Industry and FDA continue to assure us that consumers are not at immediate risk from drinks containing benzene at the levels found in soft drinks to date. Science, rather than speculative belief, shows that there is immediate harm to soft­drinkers. FDA has knowingly allowed consumers to drink carcinogenic benzene for 15 years and kept those who needed to

For people who consumed soft drinks and want to
remove any bodily storage of benzene before it could cause cancer, I suggest that they drink 1­2 cups of raw mixed vegetable juices of only 90% celery and 10% cilantro once daily around noon­time for 5 consecutive days. I suggest that they eat 1 tablespoon of no­salt­ added raw cheese and 1 tablespoon of unsalted raw butter or avocado about 20 minutes after drinking the juices. I suggest that they repeat that process every 10 days for 2­6 years, depending on how much soft drinks they consumed.

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from cooking or industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi- monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies.

The first article for this issue was motivated by two questions that frequently are asked of me: Will we have an Avian flu epidemic?
Should we be afraid of an Avian flu?
FLU - Viral Tools Improve Health;
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition (Remedies are in the last few paragraphs.)
  Influenzas, also called flu, are primarily viral. Colds are mainly bacterial. As I stated in my books and as you will find in any notable biochemistry book, VIRUSES ARE NOT ALIVE. What the biochemistry books will not explain is that viruses are protein-constructs that disassemble and/or dissolve organic and inorganic structures and particles. Those books lead us to believe that viruses are radical protein structures that indiscriminately destroy cells, causing disease. However, viruses are highly specific solvents produced by cells. The body resorts to viruses when the inter-cellular tissue structures are very contaminated with non-bioactive chemicals. The non-bioactive chemicals can be any thing from processed food to industrial waste. In such cases, the tissues are so contaminated that our bodies natural janitors, bacteria, fungus and parasites, are poisoned to death. The body has no alternative other than to produce and utilize non-living solvents –
viruses - to disassemble and/or dissolve industrial toxin-damaged tissues and the toxins that caused them. Supporting that serious diseases are the result of industry, U.S.-government employed anthropologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson in his book Cancer – Disease of Civilization, states that he found cancer did not exist in primitive tribes. Cancer is caused by industrial chemicals, processing and waste. Viruses are ultimately the only tool we have to cleanse ourselves of industrial toxicity. Oncologist Don Morris at Calgary's Tom Baker Cancer Centre said, "It's common to hear that cancer patients who pick up a virus get a regression of their disease."
Viruses do not multiply. When added to fertile petrie dishes that sustain cellular life, not one additional viral protein structure appears. Only when cells are added is there multiplication of viral protein structures. That is because petrie dishes are not the proper environment for cells. Also, the solutions used

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
in petrie dishes that sustains cellular life, are sterilized and toxic, causing intercellular damage that requires viruses to cleanse and maybe even destroy the natural cellular life in the unnatural petrie dishes. In a sterile environment, cells cannot use their normal detoxification-methods that are bacterial, fungal and parasitical. Therefore, viral waste should be expected in petrie dishes containing live cells. Cells produce viruses for self-cleansing in a sterile or industrial toxic environment.
Now that we understand viruses a lot better, I will broach the latest daily medical media hype causing most people to worry about a foreboding, impending AVIAN flu. Although there has never been a killer flu in history, they say it is an impending reality that will find us and kill or maim us. I perceive many of you thought as you read that last sentence, “What about the Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 in which millions of people died.” Let’s look at it. Considering only one factor inspires understanding that reality: It was the first time that a flu vaccine was internationally offered by pharmaceuticals. Millions did not die of the flu; they were killed by the flu vaccine. According to researcher R B Pearson who witnessed the Spanish flu “epidemic”,1 few people died who received natural therapies during that period. Seventeen of twenty people died employing medical assistance, especially the vaccine. The vaccine was the epidemic.
When I was heavily researching vaccines through the 80’s and early 90’s, I began where anyone might. I studied everything I could on Louis Pasteur’s work. I was shocked to learn, and it is not well known, that not one of Pasteur’s laboratory animals survived vaccination. At the time, and as it is today, many physicians wholeheartedly believed in forced immunization. They seemed to ignore the fact that everyday people were exposed to every natural and industry particle. Daily people were naturally inoculated and building resistance, unless they were overdosed or on very poor diets.
What was different in 1916-18 was that the pharmaceutical industry, spearheaded by super- wealthy, supposedly philanthropic, Rockefeller and Carnegie, wanted to prove vaccines worked. They envisioned pharmaceutical miracles and great profits. Like Pasteur, they claimed to believe that vaccines would cure many ills. The Spanish flu vaccine took its toll. How philanthropic were Rockefeller, Carnegie and the injecting physicians? Did they
accept responsibility for millions of deaths from their vaccine, or did they blame the Spanish flu? Rockefeller, Carnegie and physicians everywhere knew that if their vaccines were to blame, they would be legally liable. Pharmaceuticals funded the cover- up stories written by doctors and writers quoting physicians. They claimed the first recorded killer flu epidemic had finally fallen upon the human race and they were there to fight it with their vaccines. Without any evidence, they claimed that the vaccine prevented millions of deaths. The flu-vaccine failed people but profited Rockefeller and Carnegie. Probably, those responsible believed that it was an important experiment and the casualties were worthwhile. They probably assumed that as pharmaceutical technology progressed, vaccines would ultimately prove helpful to mankind. Has advanced medicine proved flu-vaccines?
Canada's first attempt to prove that flu-vaccines are effective failed miserably. Canadian researchers at the University of Ottawa used their universal free flu vaccine as the proving ground beginning in 2000. It cost Ontario taxpayers more than $200-million. The researchers published in the journal Vaccine that the average monthly incidence of flu virus jumped over the first five years of the program. "All we do know is rates haven't decreased, and there has been a lot of money spent," said professor Dianne Groll who led the study. "The program was designed to reduce the incidence of flu, and this hasn't yet happened." A faulty plan of the research structure is that it did not measure the extreme and unusual cases that affect the vaccinated compared to the unvaccinated.
Viral truth:
Viruses are extremely specific solvents to
disassembling and/or dissolving exact cellular structures, in many cases preventing cellular death and rendering cells only temporarily nonfunctional. If we were to compare cells to a mechanic, the mechanic finds the specific problem part or system, chooses specific tools (viruses) and removes the specific part of the machine and replaces or fixes it. When viewed from a short-sighted perspective, viruses look destructive. However, if viewed long- term without medical intervention, viruses prove to be beneficial. They provide our bodies with the cellular ability to regenerate themselves. Viruses completelychangeatleastevery72hours.Thecell allows itself about 72 hours of detoxification with a

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
specific virus or set of viruses. Then, it will produce a different virus or set of viruses for different cleansing. The medical and scientific communities identify that as viral evolution. Yet, they know viruses are not alive. Any flu vaccine that is produced is specific to a virus that was obsolete six to eighteen months prior to distribution of the vaccine. Big pharma knows that. If they know that then the vaccine business is a racket all about money.
Nothing in science supports the THEORY that viruses leap from creatures to man. How can viruses leap when they are not alive? Every animal has viruses that disassemble or dissolve similar tissue- structures but putting them in the category of contagion is the same as saying laundry soaps are contagious. The theory is preposterous. Those theorists should be hired only by Hollywood to write inane B-class horror stories.
Does anyone remember the dreaded impending SWINE flu of the mid 1970’s? For about one year several times daily, parroting the pharmaceutical and medical industries, media warned us of the swine flu that was leaping from the supposed-dirtiest of creatures, pork, and was going to kill us unless we all received the vaccine. President Ford received his swine-flu vaccine on national TV to prove its safety. Guess who was our vice president? Rockefeller. His pharmaceutical company received $7 billion dollars of U.S. citizens’ hard-earned tax dollars that funded the government-sponsored national assault on the dreaded impending swine flu epidemic of the century. Does anyone remember the death toll? The standard yearly estimate of 30,000-50,000. Does anyone remember why the government-sponsored program disappeared 2 weeks after the free vaccines were initiated?
The government swine-flu escapade was exposed by national consumer advocate Ida Honorof and Dr. E. McBean, PhD, ND. Ida was syndicated in hundreds of national radio programs. She and Dr. McBean filed a lawsuit against President Ford, VP Rockefeller, the Surgeon General and the US Government for creating and sponsoring the dangerous flu-vaccine. Honorof and McBean predicted that thousands of elderly and children would die as a result of the vaccine and that the Swine flu epidemic was a hoax. The media and medical professionals were ready to prove them wrongornot.Honorof’sreputationwasimpeccable so the media covered the story many times daily for
weeks. During the two weeks of giving the “free” vaccine, approximately 2,300 people died within days after receiving the vaccine. Because of media exposure, the vaccine program was stopped.2 And guess what? There was no Swine flu epidemic that killed millions of Americans. Guess who is still paying for the storage of the $7 billion of swine flu vaccine? The tax payers. Why are we storing it?
Will it be relabeled Avian flu vaccine? If you think that is preposterous, consider this: In the mid and late 1960’s, AZT was a new herald chemical for fighting cancer. A year later, it was banned by the FDA as too toxic. Then in the 1980’s, it was pulled from pharmaceutical vaults and prescribed for AIDS patients. There was no research proving or disproving efficacy of AZT with AIDS patients but pharma needed to make a profit from its flop. The FDA approved it. Nearly every AIDS patient who received AZT died and pharma made a grand profit.
Finally, to the point:
Since flu are a natural response to bodily toxicity,
and viruses are created by cells to self-cleanse, we should not focus on stopping flu. Stopping flu causes the accumulation of toxicity and waste that would lead to severe diseases. If we focus on helping our bodies virally detoxify with diet and lifestyle during each flu, we will rid our bodies of some of the dangerous disease-causing waste. There is no other rational approach to influenzas.
If we believe and analyze the observations of Dr. Weston Price and similar researchers, we can safely assume that cooked food causes no more than 10% of diseases. Industrial toxicity, even in our modern technologically sanitary world, causes 90% of all diseases, and their chronic and fatal extremes. If we believe and analyze the work of Dr. Francis Pottenger, MD and Edward Howell, we can also safely assume that in such a toxic world, a near 100% raw-food diet that is heavy in fat is disease- preventative and disease-reversing.
With over 30 years experimenting and utilizing different raw-food formulas, I derived two regimes that work most effectively to insure proper flu- detoxification, waste removal and regeneration. They are the same for colds, pneumonia and most intense detoxification. Note that Colds and flu are the heavy process of secreting and excreting the accumulated waste from prolonged detoxification. The detoxification may have lasted months to years. In

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
some cases, the secretion and excretion of detoxification-waste may take many months. We must conserve energy during such a radical elimination because so many nutrients will be utilized to harness the waste. Since raw eggs are the most easily digestible complete food, they should be the primary food consumed during flu.
My suggested dietary regimes for influenza are: 1/2 to 1 pound fowl daily
At about 3 PM, eat a grapefruit with either avocado or raw cream
At about 7 PM, eat 1/2-1 pound fowl or ocean- caught fish.
Immediately before sleep, consume 1 cup warm raw milk or raw kefir.
Once every 3 days, drink a green vegetable juice consisting of 85% celery, 5% carrot and 10% parsley first thing in the morning, followed 30 minutes later with the first egg.
Either regime, or alternating them daily, should be followed until symptoms have subsided and normal functions resume.

Chemtrails - Defending Ourselves With Diet Until We Can Stop Them.
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
(Remedies are in
Since I sent my announcement about chemtrails, I received many replies asking if the Primal Diet prevents diseases that normally result from contaminants in chemtrails, mainly aluminum and barium.
Firstly, let’s look at the diseases that have been reported to be caused by those elements. ALUMINUM affects the Zeta potential, that is the ability for nutrients to suspend in whatever liquid- medium that transports them. In our bodies, those mediums are blood, neurological and lymphatic fluids. If our bodies do not have the proper nutrients and ability to contain and neutralize aluminum, our blood would be affected. We could find our abilities

to utilize oxygen and remove carbon dioxide impaired. That could leave us: 1) short of breath even though inhaling and exhaling fully, 2) with lowered energy, 3) feeling imbalanced and thirsty, 4) sleepy and lethargic, and 5) generally unsatisfied.
If our bodies do not have the proper nutrients and ability to contain and neutralize aluminum, our nervous systems would be affected. We could find our abilities to think and remember slower than normal. That could leave us: 1) more forgetful, 2) unable to maintain perspectives, 3) faulty organizational skills, 4) attention deficit, and 5) thinking in tangents.
If our bodies do not have the proper nutrients and

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
ability to contain and neutralize aluminum, our lymphatic systems could be affected. Our abilities to cleanse and heal could be impaired. That could leave us: 1) sore and bruised, 2) fatigued, 3) easily burned and less able to acclimate to higher temperatures with irritable skin, 4) dry skin, and 5) sensitivity to light.
BARIUM salt is an alkaline earth metal that is toxic in mammalian systems. “They are absorbed rapidly from the gastrointestinal tract and are deposited in the muscles, lungs, and bone. The barium that is excreted is primarily eliminated in feces. At low doses, barium stimulates muscles and at higher doses affects the nervous system eventually leading to paralysis. Acute and subchronic oral doses of barium cause vomiting and diarrhea, followed by decreased heart rate and elevated blood pressure. Higher doses result in cardiac irregularities, weakness, tremors, anxiety, and dyspnea. A drop in serum potassium may account for some of the symptoms. Death can occur from cardiac and respiratory failure. Acute doses around 0.8 grams can be fatal to humans.”1
The FDA and EPA have done extremely little to monitor the effects of barium because the medical profession uses it so freely as a contrast for x-rays, and the military industrial complex is responsible for so much of it being released into air, water, land and consequently food. If barium were linked with diseases that result from barium toxicity, lawsuits would most likely flood the legal system. However, diseases resulting from barium toxicity are less than diseases resulting from mercury or thallium toxicity. Mercury is listed by the FDA as the most toxic element on Earth; a neuro-toxin. Yet, mercury is used in most injected medicines and amalgam dental fillings. So who is the FDA protecting? Obviously, pharmaceuticals, medical professionals and the military industrial complex.
Now let’s consider ways of preventing metallic toxicity. There are several ways that the body captures, contains and discards metallic substances: 1) ionic attraction, that is, bio-linked units of minerals and other complex nutrients that attract and attach to free-radical metallic minerals, such as barium and aluminum, 2) lipids, that is, fats that envelop free-radical metallic minerals, and 3) white blood cells that ingest or envelop free-radical metallic minerals.
Firstly, we must always consider that when a food is heated above 104° F, bio-links are disassembled, forming free radicals that must be reassembled if they
are not to cause complications in our bodies. Therefore, raw foods are the only foods that do not tax the body. Raw foods also give our bodies more nutrients to correct imbalances, such as those created by metallic toxicity.
Secondly, let’s consider the raw foods that give us minerals for ionic attraction, fat to produce lipids, and protein and fat for breeding white blood cells. The most concentrated food in minerals is no-salt- added raw cheese. Because cheese is a dehydrated food, it is not digested and utilized well for cellular health even when cheeses are raw. Our bodies work very differently with cheeses than raw milk. Because cheeses lack most bio-active links that are in raw milk, the body utilizes much of it as sponges that attract and absorb toxins, including free-radical metallic minerals.
The most digestible and utilizable fat and protein are in raw eggs that can help us more easily breed white blood cells, and supply lipids to envelop free- radical metallic minerals. Avocado and butter supply the body with plenty of fat for appropriate lipid- production. However, the most aggressive fatty nutrients to dissolve and envelop free-radical metallic minerals are obtained in raw coconut cream. An animal fat, such as butter and/or cheese, usually should be eaten with coconut cream to insure that enough lipids are available to escort the toxins out of our bodies.
In extremely toxic situations, I have witnessed that some people’s bodies utilized cooked starch when eaten with plenty of raw fat, to capture, contain and eliminate free-radical metallic minerals. However, generally those people had less energy and experienced more fatigue, unless they were high- adrenaline-producing individuals.
Another food that offers our bodies nutrients to attract and contain free-radical metallic minerals is cilantro. It is best always to consume raw fat when eating cilantro or drinking cilantro juice. Also, consider that eating or drinking too much cilantro can cause our bodies to detoxify old storages of free- radical metallic minerals. The result of a too- aggressive metal-detoxification is irritability, fatigue, constant nausea, vomit, diarrhea, headaches, joint pain, and other symptoms. Therefore, I suggest that cilantro be eaten or drunk in very small quantities, no more than 2-3 tablespoons daily.
The free-radical metallic minerals that cause so much disease are poisons even when absorbed in

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
small doses. The greatest feat of our bodies is to control the damage caused by daily absorption of free-radical metallic minerals and prevent them from storing in our bodies where they would continue to damage us. The Primal Diet may seem magical to most people but whether it will prevent a particular body from succumbing to the diseases from our pollution-filled civil world is not assured. The Primal Diet is the best defense that I have encountered and observed.
Now, we have to stop governments from spraying
toxins in our air in the name of and guise of anything, including whether modification.

Diarrhea-based Detoxification Hotel By Medical Doctors And You Thought Aajonus Was Just A Little Nuts
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
(Suggested remedy in last paragraph.)
A novel new 40-million-US dollars health clinic is being constructed at Phuket, Thailand, reported The Phuket Gazette April 2, 2006. It will be the world’s first detoxification hotel consisting of 150 rooms specializing in state-of-the-art diarrhea-based treatments. I kid you not.
Dr Somchai Hongnamsakul of Johns Hopkins University told a press conference that the facility would offer patented self-induced diarrhea regimens. Explaining the new therapy, Dr Hongnamsakul said, “The word ‘detoxification’ is widely used these days, but much misunderstood. Some spa treatments touted as detoxifiers, such as aromatherapy and oil massage, actually have no clinically proven detoxifying effect whatsoever. Diarrhea, on the other hand, is nature’s most potent detoxification strategy. Its purgative effects on the human system are indisputable,” he said. “Induced diarrhea can also be an effective tool for weight loss. It is our considered belief that it may also be useful in treating people who exhibit anal- retentive behavior. Right now we can see no end to the number of uses of the therapy,” he said.
Guests at the detoxification hotel (termed “detoxotel”) will be treated from 3-14 days. Each guest will receive comprehensive tests to determine which of many known diarrhea-causing bacteria matches the patient’s needs, and the precise dosage. The doctor stated that detoxification initializes when
the bacteria begin to multiply in the digestive tract and the body naturally tries to expel the toxicity. “We have an effective biological agent for just about anyone, including the most well-traveled people who have already become immune to the bacteria responsible for Montezuma’s Revenge, Bangkok Belly and many other strains known to cause diarrhea. We will be able to administer effective antibiotics for any of the strains we use, allowing us to bring the treatment to an end in a matter of hours, if necessary,” Dr. Hongnamsakul said. He admitted that an aggressive public relations campaign would be needed to overcome negative preconceptions about diarrhea.
“We understand that many people harbor negative ideas about diarrhea, but our aim is to change that. When people see just how luxurious our open-plan bathroom designs are, with marble tiles, built-in plasma screen TV connected to 57 cable channels, and even a mini-bar, they’ll soon come to realize that a week with diarrhea can actually be an enjoyable experience,” he said. He claimed that their SID method is far more effective than other detoxification strategies, such as fasting. “Fasting can detoxify the system, but it takes too long – and most people just don’t have the required self-control to refrain from food for that long, which, in many cases, is why they need detox in the first place. Unlike at fasting resorts,

which charge guests hundreds of dollars a day without having to provide them with meals, our facility will allow guests to eat as much as they want – it won’t make any difference. They will be able to order from room service with our discreet staff serving them on specially-designed toilet serving trolleys. And our cuisine will be second to none. We plan to bring in some of the world’s top chefs from Europe.” Guests at the facility will be monitored regularly by licensed physicians to ensure they do not suffer dangerous side effects. (End of report.)
Firstly, I have nothing to do with this new detoxotel. It is owned and will be operated by licensed medical doctors. Through my books, you know that I consider diarrhea the second best natural method of quickly dumping toxins. The first, of

course, is vomit. In vomit, we do not lose so much fluid and nutrients. Vomit is mainly poison-laced mucus and digestive juices. Vomit is created when our bodies use our stomachs as the elimination point.
I do not know anything about those doctors' knowledge of detoxification but vomit and diarrhea are most often byproducts of detoxification that occur other than in the digestive tract. When focusing a therapy to induce diarrhea, only the intestinal tract is likely to be detoxified. However, whether experiencing diarrhea or vomit, the safe and practical remedy to reduce vomit and diarrhea is eating no- salt-added raw cheese, not taking antibiotics. Antibiotics damage digestive abilities and cause a myriad of other side effects, such as Chrone’s disease, chronic fatigue, eczema and psoriasis.

Dental Hygiene, Causes of Decay and Reversal, and Re-enamelization
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition (Remedies are in the last 2 paragraphs.)
   Dr. Gerard F. Judd, Ph.D., Professor Emeritus, Chemistry, stated that 30% of American youths ages 8-10 have no cavities, and 100% of Ugandan youths ages 6-10 have no cavities. Ugandan youths have 3 times better teeth because they do not consume processed acidic foods, have no fluoride in their drinking water, have regular meals rather than sipping acidic drinks all day, such as soda pops, have more calcium and phosphate in their diet, and have fewer dentists to cause more damage to teeth. However, dietary causes are only part of the picture. Industrial chemicals cause most decay.
What are other acidic compounds that damage teeth, causing tooth decay? Tooth cavities are caused by abrasive unnatural acids and gum secretions composed of heavy metals and combinations of industrially produced byproducts and toxins. We absorb industrially produced byproducts and toxins, including heavy metals from our air, water, food and medication. Many of those toxins are absorbed from medication, food additives and preservatives, pesticides, herbicides, industrially produced fertilizers in food, and cleaning compounds. Cooking causes free-radicals. Cooking destroys the natural
bonds of bio-active organic vitamins, enzymes, minerals and other nutrients that help to grow plant and animal tissues. The destruction of those bonds releases the metallic minerals as free-radicals. Free- radicals often cause severe cellular destruction, mutation, and cellular death.
Our teeth are very affected because of their proximity to our brains. Our brains and nervous systems use large amounts of metallic minerals to transmit and relay electricity and light for neurological functions. Consequently, the brain and nervous system contain very large quantities of metallic minerals. Since we live in a polluted environment and eat cooked food, our brains and nervous systems contain very large quantities of destructive free-radical heavy metals and chemicals that magnetize to those metals. Our bodies try to discard (detoxify) those compounds that are stored in the brain and head mainly through gums, tongue and salivary secretions.
One of those toxins, fluoride, is hailed as preventing tooth decay. There is much misinformation about fluoride. Fluoride is harmful not only to teeth but the entire body. It has been

The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
 linked with 114 ailments. The mechanism for destruction of enzymes by fluoride has been proved by x-ray studies showing that hydrogen bonds are broken by fluoride. Also, fluoride is a neuro-toxin. Dr. Judd stated that if the forecast of 80% dental improvements with the use of fluoride were true, by age 13 each American would have only one cavity. However, dental literature stated that Americans aged 7 average 13 cavities, 25% of Americans over 43 have no natural teeth and the rest average 32 cavities, and 42% of Americans over 65 have no natural teeth and all of the rest have cavities in all remaining teeth.
Fluoride is the smallest negative particle on Earth. Fluoride particles are so small and intensely negative, they interfere with the hydrogen bonds that hold enzyme coils in place. Fluoride particles destroy enzyme molecules at very low concentrations, around 1-3 parts per million. Those enzymes are often 3,000 or more times smaller than fluoride. The effect is ruinous, destroying at least 83 enzymes.1
Our bodies are always trying to counter the damage that we do to them. Most often, our bodies utilize great quantities of calcium and other minerals to absorb and neutralize the abrasiveness of toxic compounds mentioned above. When those compounds combine with calcium and other minerals, the combination too often dries and adheres to our teeth. That is called plaque. If the calcium and other minerals do not completely neutralize those abrasive compounds, the plaque will damage enamel on our teeth. Once dentine is compromised, often cavities result.
Plaque-prevention also prevents gum pockets. Gum pockets form as the caustic chemicals in plaque that irritate and inflame gums, push the gums away from the teeth. Tooth pastes that contain fluoride damage protein molecules that normally adhere gums to teeth. Fluoride interferes with the enzyme adenosine diphosphatase that normally delivers phosphate to calcium on teeth surfaces. Drinking water with fluoride added causes the same problems.
The medical establishment disseminates scientifically incorrect information about dental health, stating that bacteria causes tooth decay. Bacteria cannot damage the enamel (calcium hydroxy phosphate) and never cause tooth decay. Bacterial
decay of the enamel is impossible because bacteria require carbon and hydrogen to live. Myriads of animal remains show that teeth and bones are resistant to earth-bound organisms. As I stated above, tooth decay is caused by toxins in our food, environment, medicine, cosmetics, chemicals and bad diets. Likewise, our increasing inability to restore severely compromised enamel (cavities) is the result of our extremely toxic food supply, environment, medicines, cosmetics, chemicals, and diets. If our bodies are healthy enough and we feed them properly, our bodies will generate bacteria to consume damaged dentine and sub-dentine cells. Bacteria act as janitors and consume the damaged tooth cells so that our bodies can replace them with healthy dental cells. Remedies for preventing and reversing tooth decay and gum pockets are stated at the end of this article.
We would not have cavities if we ate properly and rinsed toxic acids from our teeth regularly. Even rinsing the mouth with a little milk or other liquid after eating could help. Toothpastes all contain glycerin that coats teeth with a sticky film that takes approximately 25 washes to remove it. That film prevents teeth from re-enamelizing. Consuming food high in calcium and phosphate, such as milk, increases the probability of re-enamelization of teeth, but only when they are clean.
We cannot stop the flow of caustic toxins that are detoxified from our brains through our mouths but we can prevent caustic plaque from adhering to and damaging our teeth. We should regularly brush and rinse abrasive compounds that adhere to our teeth as plaque. Often, it takes about 72 hours only for those compounds to harm our dental cells. Brushing our teeth thoroughly at least once ever 3 days prevents caustically acidic plaque that causes cavities. Where toothbrushes do not reach deep in our gum pockets, we should rinse with a dental water-pick, removing the minerals and toxic compounds from gum pockets where minerals begin to dry and adhere to our teeth, becoming plaque.
A water-pick mixture of 1 tablespoon each of raw apple cider vinegar, lemon and coconut cream strained through a thoroughly rinsed, clean and damp white t-shirt stirred into a naturally sparkling mineral

The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
 water, such as Gerolsteiner and San Pelligrino, and jettisoned on to teeth and under our gums helps remove fresh plaque. Plaque usually becomes difficult to remove after 3-7 days. Therefore, it would be wise to water-pick with that mixture once every 3- 7 days. Experiment and see how long plaque takes to dry solidly and adhere to your teeth to the point where brushing followed by water-picking does not remove the plaque.
Strengthening our teeth and gums is easily done by consuming 1-1.5 tablespoons of no-salt-added raw cheese with 1 teaspoon unheated honey twice daily.
That combination should be mixed together in the mouth. That mixture should be eaten at least 15 minutes from other foods. It is more effective after a meat meal but it is effective whenever we eat it. Eating 2 tablespoons of pineapple with 2 tablespoons no-salt-added cheeses twice weekly helps knit the gums back to the teeth.

Fermented Vegetables; the Good, Bad and Stinky
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
There are many advocates, such as Sally Fallon, for eating fermented foods, especially vegetables. Let’s consider the fermentation process. Fermentation is the bacterial and enzymatic process of decomposing food. It is a form of pre-digestion. Considering that we are not equipped to digest cellulose (vegetation) properly, fermentation allows us to digest more of it. However, since there is little protein or fats in vegetation, it is not part of an optimal diet for us whether fermented, raw or cooked. Eating raw or fermented vegetables regularly is not balanced.
The GOOD: Occasionally eating fermented vegetables supplies bacteria and enzymes to help our
bodies detoxify and eliminate old cooked vegetable residues and byproducts, including all of the crystallized vegetable oils that cause hardening of arteries and heart.
The BAD: Eating raw vegetables or raw fermented vegetables with raw meat causes neutralization of the acidic bacteria and digestive juices for proper digestion of meats, eggs and dairy.
The STINKY: Eating fermented vegetables on a diet with raw eggs and raw meat often causes offensively odorous gases.
Many people think that because I do not exercise, I am against exercise. Contrarily, I am an avid advocate of activity and exercise. I do not exercise because my body does not produce the many hormones that require me to be active. Most people produce hormones that must be utilized by activity, including exercise. Usually, I can gage an
individual’s activity level by the number of activity rings in her/his irises. The more activity rings that a person has, the more active, including exercise, s/he must be. Usually, 1 activity ring equals one hour of activity or 1⁄2 hour of exercise daily. Amongst iridologists, those activity rings are commonly called “stress rings”. Usually, I call them “worry circles”. I
Exercise; the Good, Bad and Beautiful

 call them worry circles to remind people that if they are not active enough, they will utilize those hormones in anxiety, worrying about anything or everything. There are two doors from which to choose: Activity or Anxiety. Which do you choose? The GOOD: People who utilize their activity hormones in activity, with or without regimented exercise, will be calm and happy if they are on an optimal diet and can digest and absorb proteins properly.
The BAD: People who produce activity hormones and do not utilize them in activity, whether regimented exercise or busy everyday activity, often are never satisfied for more than moments, are easily irritated or impatient, and usually cannot make relationships balanced enough to be happy, especially intimate relationships. People like that produce more
conflict in their lives, take more short cuts that compromise ideals and are likely to cause more pollution in their lives. Contrarily, excessive exercise can utilize hormones that were intended for other pleasurable activities such as sex, and leave a person impotent. Excessive exercise can make a person too thin. Very thin individuals are likely to store their toxins intra-cellularly because they have no extra tissue/muscle fat in which to store toxins. That can mutate DNA and RNA, dry the vascular and lymphatic systems, and gradually create many diseases, more often strokes or heart attacks.
The BEAUTIFUL: This is entirely aesthetics and has nothing to do with good or bad. Excessive exercise causes very large or very thin bodies that are appealing to some and ugly to others.
Medical Terrorist Propaganda about Inflammatory Breast Cancer
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
The recently introduced "Inflammatory breast cancer (IBC)" scare is a creation of the pharmaceutical/ medical companies and is hysteria-creating. It is another terrorist attack on women’s minds via their breasts. When cancer begins to reverse, it becomes inflammatory by nature of the solvents rendered by dying cancer cells. Those solvents dissolve the
surrounding dead cells (mummified cells) that constitute approximately 95% of every tumor. When any cancer becomes inflammatory, it is the process of reversing. In other words, the body is finalizing detoxification and should begin healing. Ignore the misinformation regarding IBC and spread the word to your loved ones and friends.
The FDA Approved 5 Viruses for Food Treatment
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Reports state that the 5 viruses destroy one specific rare bacterium known as Listeria monocytogenes. Several writers claim that the viruses eat the bacteria. However, viruses are not alive. Viruses are specifically combined and organized proteins that dissolve specific parts of biological structures, whether cellular or bacterial. Several reports called them phagocytes, which is a misnomer and gives readers the impression that virus are alive and eat.
Pity they can claim so much without proof, even logical proof.
There is danger by placing those viruses in food. Those viruses may disassemble intestinal bacteria and act much like antibiotics which destroy digestion, absorption and utilization of nutrients.
The tests studied for FDA approval were conducted over a short 5 years and were extremely limited in scope. That is far too little time and too narrow a

 view to know any long term effects to the digestive tract and digestion. Food manufacturers plan to spray those viruses on cold cuts, sausages, hot dogs, sliced turkey, and chicken. Notice that all of those foods are either blanched or completely cooked. Bacteria mutate and become diseased when they eat cooked food. That is why all bacterial food epidemics were from cooked food not raw. The rhetoric has been that the contaminated food was not cooked enough. If you read Chapter 31 in my book The Recipe For Living Without Disease, you will see that all of the bacterial

food epidemics involving dairy were all from pasteurized dairy products, not raw. That applies to meat products and associative bacterial food epidemics. Additional rigid and rigorous testing should have been applied because those viruses were attenuated and man-made, not natural.
Primal Dieters do not have to worry about those viruses because the foods they are treating are not part of our diet. For those of you who waver from the Primal Diet, I suggest that you avoid prepared meats from any source, including delicatessens and airlines.

- Thomas Jefferson
Please sit calmly, and gradually absorb the information below. It is not meant to cause panic. I intend to give every reader insight into their future health probabilities by viewing present agriculture, business, political, medical and social trends. I hope to inspire everyone to oppose legislation and regula- tions that set trends, portending future disease for all of us.
Firstly, I focus on big chemical industries’ apparent long-term goal to control all agriculture and food supply throughout the world through govern- ment and fear-based propaganda. Some people may call it conspiracy but their rhetoric addresses it as reasonable safeguards. However, the safeguards have little or nothing to do with safeguarding our health.
Are their safeguards instituted to protect their profits and control consumers? To glimpse the broad perspective on how big chemical/agribusiness appears to be accomplishing world food control, we must look at our present beliefs, habits and environments that suppress us into the beliefs they want us to accept as ours.
In the USA one-hundred years ago, everybody who had food to eat expected rather good health, especially if they lived in small towns. The diseases we have today were rare. At that time, the greatest fears were freezing and starvation. Most other deaths occurred during cold seasons from gradual nightly carbon monoxide and tar poisons from burning wood or coal in fireplaces, wood stoves and ovens where

houses, cottages or shacks were closed, poorly ventilated or non-ventilated. That created lung toxici- ty that caused frequent flu and other respiratory diseases.
In major cities, many diseases and deaths were caused by the same indoor pollution plus smog from silversmiths and blacksmiths every few blocks. Rarely was there a sky-high smoke stack that pumped the smog high into the sky, diluting the toxic particles. Also, many factories, homes and buildings used coal-burning furnaces that vaporized mercury into the air. Heavy metal poisons were constantly in the air as they are today but they were held in concentrations in households and narrow streets. When animals are exposed to such air-pollution as coal dust and vaporized mercury, many develop pulmonary diseases like the Black Plague. Vessels for eating and drinking usually were made of poisonous metals, adding to the toxicity that caused diseases of the times.
Factually, What Causes Diseases Today?
We are conditioned to believe that germs are the cause of most of our many diseases, that those “germs” are “pathogenic”. It is 99% myth, superstition and false. Animals exposed to all of nature’s microbes do not get diseases. We develop disease from accumulation of industrial pollution, including vaccines, medication, processed food and household compounds just as they did 100 years ago.i However, we have 60,000 more industrial chemicals than we had 100 years ago.
Animals in the wild constantly expose themselves to microbes. They lick their and each other's feces and “germs”, including strangers, and never get diseases. The superstitions that we are fed daily by the pharmaceutical, medical and opportunistic bacteria-phobic industries through academia and media, especially television, would lead us to believe that nature is inherently designed to harm and kill us. Academia believes, and indoctrinates us to believe, that most anything from academia and science, even though ideas, laws and formulas change, is truth and the only rational reality. Academia teaches us that science and business are most important but teach us nothing about ourselves and our health. Academia
teaches us to revere and accept everything that medicine says is right.
Note that all medical procedure manuals are sponsored and financed by big pharmaceutical houses. Nearly since the inception of the FDA, FDA officials have had ties with big pharmaceutical houses.ii Many of them accepted high-ranking and high-paying positions in pharmaceutical houses after leaving the FDA.
Is The Push To Medicate, Our Greatest Demise?
The priests of our modern industrially and technologically advanced societies are mostly doctors, media, government officials and academic teachers. They lead and govern present-day witch hunts and inquisitions such as vaccine and medication worship. Vaccines are the most disease- causing single agents of modern times, including penicillin. All vaccines have been produced and marketed after the diseases had run their courses. If we look at graphs that depict peaks and valleys of people affected, for instance, by polio, we see that polio was at its lowest, virtually gone for the two years prior to the polio vaccine's release. However, in the year following government-sponsored but citizen- paid polio vaccinations, the incidences rose and peaked considerably. Suspiciously, all recording was halted by government mandates. Now, only voluntary reporting exits. Few people report it because it is a waste of time. Almost nothing is done about it.
All vaccines require time to grow, manufacture, package and market. Sometimes it takes 2-3 years to make vaccines but at least 12 months. Always, the diseases for which vaccines are marketed have gone dormant prior to release of the vaccines. The disease is over and gone except for a few minor cases. Because there is no major epidemic reported by the medical industry of that disease, the medical industry takes credit for eliminating the disease. However, it was already gone. Big pharmaceuticals and their doctors, especially those of Center For Disease Control (CDC), constantly program us to believe that even though the disease is not present, we will risk our lives if we fail to be injected. The media and academia parrot that rhetoric even though there is no scientific proof that the diseases will return and that any vaccine is effective, ever. Results from recent

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 8
Canadian studies proved that flu vaccines were
useless.iii
Take for instance, the Rh-negative-blood factor that pharmaceuticals claim causes birth defects. There is some evidence that more birth defects result in women with Rh-negative blood. The medical establishment, educated, promoted and paid by big pharmaceuticals, created a vaccine to prevent deformities in children from women with Rh- negative factor. However, there is no science that that vaccine is effective. My ex-wife Mary has Rh- negative blood, had the vaccine immediately after giving birth to our son Jeff but her second child was born with severe defects. She lacked hip bones and died at 12 years old. Now, we must ask, since the vaccine was ineffective, did the vaccine cause the deformity like many vaccines cause the very disease they are intended to prevent, or was it her Rh- negative blood?
In today’s TV-educated world, we do not fear the real threat to health and happiness. In fact, we embrace the very causes of disease and unhappiness -- that is chemical pollution -- as if it were our savior. Dangerous concentrations of elements exist in nature but not in abundance unless we mine them, such as uranium, mercury, lead, arsenic, cadmium and lye. Ninety percent of all modern diseases are caused by chemical pollution. Seventy percent of that 90% is from medical poisoning such as vaccines that inject 50-76 quadrillion molecules of mercury in us from EACH vaccine, even many of those that now claim to be mercury-free. Since pharmaceuticals have reduced mercury in vaccines from 76 quadrillion molecules to 50-56 quadrillion molecules per vaccine, the FDA allows them to call their vaccines mercury-free. Obviously, the FDA is not protecting us but protecting the profits of pharmaceuticals.
Penicillin invades our bodies with sterilized grain- mold that causes severe damage to our nervous systems and intestinal tracts. Penicillin has caused the quality of life to immeasurably decrease along with saving lives. However, it saves lives by filling us with such an alarming toxicity that the body stops detoxifying old dangerous toxins previously stored in our systems to try and stop the poisonous penicillin contaminants such as carcinogenic aflatoxins. They cause adrenaline rushes that give us a false sense of
better health. Even though sterilized, penicillin molds rise from their graves and become active in 9-18 months. Those molds destroy much of the bacteria responsible for normal healthy functions, especially primary and necessary digestion. If we cannot digest properly, malnourishment results causing varying degrees of deformities and diseases.
We Have Incredibly Advanced; To Where And What?
We did not have many diseases in the USA about 400 years ago. That was long before big industries became the norm and made our country and people economically rich and gradually unhealthy. It is fiction that the average life-span 100 years ago was approximately 37 years of age. From 1973 through 1976, I traveled all over North America on my bicycle. My robed, bearded and long-haired appearance at the time disturbed people. I was often asked to keep moving. When I slept in graveyards, people usually did not disturb me, probably because I looked like images of Jesus. I frequently slept in graveyards. In those hundreds of graveyards in rural areas, dates on gravestones recorded that many people lived very long lives just as we do today. However, in cosmopolitan cities, the average lifespan revealed from gravestones was much shorter.
In our pollution-filled environments, in and outside of our homes, work, play and travel places, if we did not have air-condition and heat, peoples’ lives would be much shorter. We have more disease in America than most of the third-world countries combined. Many diseases that dominate poor third- world countries now are diseases that immediately followed mass vaccinations paid by the USA and British governments, such as AIDS and Ebola. At least 27 African countries are now run by the World Bank because those countries sunk into debt to the USA and British governments for medical aide.
Think about the implications. Why would those governments donate nearly $3-billion dollars in vaccines and paid-personnel to inject 125-million Africans when they do not take care of the health in their own countries? Why did AIDS and Ebola rise like the plague immediately after those smallpox vaccines? According to a few concerned doctors, like Dr. Leonard Horowitz, DMD, MA, MPH, the

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 8
vaccines created the diseases.iv, v Chemical evaluation of both diseases in tissues of sufferers showed that the disease was grown in substances and had the same chemical agents that only exist in vaccine-developed diseases.
Following the injected pandemic, affected countries were offered exorbitantly expensive ineffective medical aide from the USA and British governments. Those countries accepted the medical aide -- which they would and were never able to repay. Consequently, the USA and Britain now run those countries through their banking system, the World Bank. USA and Britain have almost complete control of what happens in those countries’ governments, resources and industry. The most likely scenario is that the surviving people will not be able to stop that foreign control because the new puppet governments killed most of their free-thinking aware and educated individuals, or robbed them of their wealth. Is that a reuse of the age-old war and control of people through poisoning?
Will We Have Good Food That Creates Good Health?
Now that we have a glimpse of probable modern reality, let’s look at how big chemical and agricultural companies pave their way to dominate the world’s food supply through their financial and political influence and strong-hold on most government individuals, including judges.
Monsanto created GMO crops that produce pollen, like any other plant, but they are not like other plants.vi When a farmer buys and plants the patented GMO crop, he agrees that he will not save seeds and will purchase Monsanto’s seeds for every new crop. When the last crop is tilled into the soil, the next crop will be eating the decomposed GMO plants. That will insure that the GMO genes will be found in any succeeding crop even if non-GMO crops are planted on that land later.
Additionally, pollen wafts to nearby fields that grow non-GMO crops and those crops are contami- nated with GMO-crop genes. Monsanto has sued farmers for those infected crops. Monsanto sued a Canadian farmer who grew only non-GMO-crops.vii A neighboring GMO crop’s pollen wafted into his
canola crop and altered it. In court, the judge (Cana- dian) ruled in favor of Monsanto. Most little farmers cannot afford to defend themselves against Monsanto so they sell their farms or turn their farms over to Monsanto, and quit farming. Monsanto investigators, not government investigators, inspected the farmer’s land and crops, without his permission or warrant, to gather their "evidence." The farmer spent years fight- ing, and eventually lost because the Canadian Supreme Court sided with Monsanto and eliminated justice for small farmers. The legal battle cost the farmer and his wife huge legal fees, rights to their ex- isting seed that they had developed over years and tremendous anxiety. They lost their freedoms associ- ated with their land, crops, human rights and dignity.
Monsanto’s GMO disease-resistant crops have proved less disease-resistant and require more chemi- cals than natural crops. Many scientists have proved that GMO plants produce new chemicals that, when they or the produce of those plants are eaten by hu- mans, they cause allergies.viii Why is our govern- ment, especially the Bush Administration, pushing for GMO acceptance on our dinner plates? Why has the Bush Administration threatened the European countries that have completely rejected GMO crops and food with lawsuits and embargos if they do not accept our GMO crops and food?
Have Monsanto And Dow Threatened Our Meat Supply, Too?
Imagine a similar scenario with animals. However, since sperm is not airborne how could Monsanto, Gulf and Western, and Dow create such a monopoly with farm animals? They could create diseases and call them Mad Cow, Mad Sheep, and bird flu with medicines, such as de-wormers that are coated on the animals’ spines or in their feed. They could pay writers, doctors and politicians to fabricate, exaggerate and publicize the potential harm to the public and thereby create terror and even panic in the masses. They could claim that to prevent a pandemic, millions of animals must be slaughtered. They could deny testing as an unnecessary delay and danger to the public, that it will infect all herds and flocks in weeks. They may claim that the disease is restricted to a particular area for now. They may claim that they found one or two animals in surrounding herds or flocks that have the disease and they, too, must be

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 8
slaughtered. Yet there is relatively no scientific evidence that the disease is communicable. They could restrict the slaughters to small farmers who cannot afford legal means to stop them. Does any of that scenario sound familiar? Consider the cow herds, sheep and recent bird-flu/chicken-flock slaughters? What would they do next?
Monsanto could offer the world its genetically modified (GM) animals that they claim are disease- free and disease-resistant.ix They could convince government employees, including politicians, academics and the general public to believe that to be safe, all animals that are not genetically modified are serious disease-causing risks to the world. The government is demanding micro-chipping all farm animals by 2008 so that they will know the location of everyone one of them.x Gradually, all non-GM animals may be seized by the government, slaughtered and disposed. All that would be left is GM livestock. Consequently, Monsanto gets royalties worldwide on all livestock-breeding as long as there is a One World Government. Monsanto may require that when you buy and breed Monsanto’s patented animals, you must sign a contract to pay royalties on any and all meat, eggs and milk produced from their genetically modified animals. Additionally, they may get deep-pocket politicians to levy a royalty and tax on all meat, eggs and milk produced by their genetically modified stock. Then you get the puppet USDA to open offices in other countries to spread their dominant perspective on other countries and impose unconstitutional authority on the world. Sound crazy? This year, United States Department of Agriculture opened offices in several foreign countries.xi
Along with Monsanto, there will be other companies claiming that they have clean risk-free animal products that could allow for the extinction of natural animals. They claim that they are healthier and superior animals than natural. Several companies, financed by USA government’s NASA, grow meat in laboratories from animal tissue without the whole animal, without blood, breath or exercise.xii Several companies are growing chemical food such as genetically modified antifreeze that is a chemical copy of a fish protein that is now a part of ice cream.xiii FDA is about to approve cloned animals and their milk and meats.xiv
Are We Facing Outlawing Natural Farming And Legislatively Imposing Only Chemical Farming?
If you were a cut-throat big chemical agribusiness company, would you want to rid the world of natural farming and require chemical farming? How in the world would that unlikely and crazy idea be accomplished? You could gradually condition people to distrust nature and natural farming through medical, political and media avenues. You could attack the most used natural fertilizer: manure. You could blame feces for causing diseases because of something in feces. E.coli are ubiquitous in all feces in every creature on earth, so you call it “pathogenic”.
However, in reality, E.coli, found in the final stages of intestinal tracts, is responsible for the finite digestion of amino acids that are specialized enough to nurture our brains and nervous systems. E.coli is responsible for releasing from food and synthesizing B Vitamins. If you use viruses and chemicals on food to destroy E.coli, what do you think will happen to the E.coli in our intestines? (See article below regarding the FDA’s approval of six viruses that will be used on food to kill bacteria.) Pharmaceutical companies have been claiming for decades that their chemotherapies restrict damage to cancer cells only; but most often, the quality of people’s lives who receive chemo-therapies diminishes greatly.
To gain world dominance and profits, what do you do next? You could blame one little girl’s death on E.coli that fertilized an apple field and got into her raw apple juice (the Odwala incidence of November 1996). Would it matter that it is impossible for E.coli to multiply enough to cause HUS kidney disease in raw apple juice? Obviously, not. Now you have defamed the most revered American fruit, the apple that is in American apple pie. People begin to worry about eating apples and drinking apple juice. They imagine that they have to kill everything; burn and kill to be safe.
In reality however, the little girl’s kidney disease (HUS) that doctors claimed killed her was likely caused by the antibiotics she received from her doctor. Last month, five children were reported to have been infected with E.coli 0157:H7 in California.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 8
Only the two children who received antibiotics suffered kidney damage (HUS). Antibiotics such as Cipro have caused HUS-like kidney disease in laboratory animals.
Even though no laboratory tests with animals have proved E.coli causes HUS, they blamed the rare strain of E.coli. They labeled it “0157:H7”. That strain rarely occurs in nature. In fact, I was unable to find it and had to obtain my experimental dose from a university. HUS has only occurred in Petri dishes with control–bred strains of 0157:H7, hormones and kidney tissue but not in animals in their natural environments. Because many feed-lot herds are fed processed food and injected with or fed BSE- hormone to increase milk production, the 0157:H7 may only be found in those unnatural animals.
In the Odwala incident, health officials and a cola conglomerate supported and encouraged the mother of the dead girl to campaign in congress against raw juices and cry for pasteurizing all fruit juices. Did the conglomerate cola company plan to buy Odwala juice company while it was under attack for the little girl’s death? It did buy it and the cola company gained a the largest natural juice company in America at a distressed price, and gained shelf life for its new juices, without regard for nutrient value. A federal law was passed to prevent interstate transport of raw juices and most states adopted it. All commercially available juices that are pre-made must be pasteurized or cooked. You can only buy fresh raw juices from a juice or health-food store bar. All of that resulted from one little girl’s death blamed on raw apple juice that was not scientifically logically responsible for her death. Can you imagine the money and power behind laws being passed on one incident with a large cola company taking over the largest natural juice company in America?
Now that everyone believes that raw natural fruit juices can be dangerous, deadly dangerous, what’s next? You could continually reaffirm and instill in the masses the belief that chemicals are beneficial and nature with is various ubiquitous creatures and micro-organisms is deadly dangerous. You publicize every little incidence of so-called food-poisoning. You create unheard of contaminated-food incidences and publicize them until you have robbed people of any faith remaining in the good of nature. Those who
remain steadfastly trustful of nature and its microbes will be seen as dangerous-to-the-masses cult fanatics. They probably will be derided the same as any one who rationally and intelligently questioned and refuted any illogical official story. You continually condition the public to fear nature, blame many incidences of food-poisoning on E.coli. You blame every animal in nature for disease: Rats, cats, swine, dogs, and even bunny rabbits (rabies). You blame them for diseases that actually man has created and developed from his pollution. Then you blame E.coli for contaminating one of the most revered vegetables on the planet, spinach. It is even considered as the food that enables the super-powers of the well-known Popeye cartoon character. Oops, all of a sudden Popeye’s dead from eating spinach.
Let’s cut to the point. The future of this scenario is: Since we have been conditioned to think that E.coli can contaminate the healthiest of foods, we believe it would be wise to outlaw manure as fertilizer. Monsanto and Dow would come to the rescue with their chemical fertilizers, proclaiming that only they are safe and clean of dangerous nature. Government officials would rule no more manure- fertilization for crops. With a One-World-governing body such as the EU and Codex, the entire world would have to follow that rule. Monsanto, Gulf and Western, and Dow rule! For the rest of modern civilization, we get only dangerous GMO food that is toxically grown.
Have We Lost All Reagan-&-Schwarzenegger-like Tough Guys?
Why are all of the macho guys running and hiding from the ridiculous Hollywood B-movie scenario that a few micro-tiny bacteria could take over an organ or bodily system and maim or kill us? Have we lost courage? Have individuals from the pharmaceutical and medical schools of thought made wimps of most everybody? Why are we taught to fear certain natural bacteria that have not proved to cause disease in animals or humans even though regularly exposed to them? Why are we taught to fear bacteria and brave chemically poisonous vaccines that are full of diseases grown on animal tissue, or eggs, that are then sterilized and mixed with mercury, aluminum, detergents and formaldehyde? Why are we taught that those chemical soups are our saviors from many

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 8
diseases and have them injected into ourselves? Why do most people accept that they must trust and embrace chemicals that are known to cause serious diseases in many animals and humans to protect us from micro-tiny natural bacteria? The most important question is, why do we believe it when it does not make logical, rational or common sense?
CONCLUSION
If we continue to believe the chemical, agribusi- ness, medicinal and pharmaceutical propaganda based on fear and panic, we will be forever poisoned by them. The only way we can gain true immunity is to be exposed naturally the way humans had been for millions of years. However, under the circumstances, is the immunity theory valid. Maybe almost everything in nature is in symbiotic relationship with us. Maybe we suffer with because we abuse nature with chemical agriculture, and cooking and process- ing toxins into our food.
Sadly, the reality is that if we want to live healthfully in this modern age, we must buy land and farm it primitively. We should support any and all farmers and organizations that fight for our rights to non-chemical, non-GM food. We must contact our government representatives and oppose legislation that endangers our lives. We must demonstrate against any business and politician that controls and owns government representatives and policies.

FDA Rules That Six Viruses Used For Treating Meat Are Safe For Human Consumption
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
   Firstly, we should know that only three of 67 of Louis Pasteur’s experimental animals survived his im- munizations. Flash forward to the present. In the typi- cal medical paradigm of, 'let’s introduce the very bac- teria that cause diarrhea and vomit to build immunity on our food', the US FDA approved six viruses to be used on meat to be sold to the public developed by the company Intralytix. The viral soup was designed to be sprayed on ready-to-eat meat and poultry products, in- cluding sliced ham and turkey. The viral soup, devel- oped in a preparation of the very bacteria the viruses are supposed to kill, is purified and called bacterio- phages. The name means bacteria-eaters. That is a misnomer because viruses are not alive and cannot eat. They do not have a nucleus.
The viral soup is meant to kill strains of the Liste- ria monocytogenes bacterium that are not commonly found in food. It is another unproved expression of the vaccine theory that says: Even though we poison you with our viral soup, we do it for your own good to prevent possible disease. Consider what this soup real- ly is. Viruses are not alive. They are solvents that dis- assemble compromised cellular tissue. The six viral solvents were added to the soup of L.monocytogenes bacterium in an unnatural Petrie-dish-type environ- ment, immersed in a synthesized serum and eventually the bacterium cells died. Now was it the environment and serum that killed the bacterium cells or was it the viruses?
The FDA was concerned that the virus preparation could contain toxic residues associated with the bacte- ria but not the viruses themselves. The FDA said that tests did not reveal the presence of such residues, and believed that small quantities were unlikely to cause health problems anyway. However, the viral solvents were not questioned. We know that in most chemical reactions that stem from laboratory exploration, muta- tions and unnatural incidences occur because of un- natural chemicals involved in the tests. Has the FDA asked all the right questions? No. Have long-term studies been accomplished? No.
Caroline Smith DeWaal, director of food safety for the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a con- sumer advocacy group that is basically funded under that table by the food industry said that, “The FDA is applying one of the toughest food-safety standards which they have to find this is safe. They couldn't ap- prove this product if they had questions about its safe- ty." Should we believe that? We know that the FDA has approved at least 118 drugs that proved to be very destructive to the human body. Many of them were re- called. Cipro should be one of them but they have not recalled it.
Intralytix first petitioned the FDA in 2002 for li- censing the viral soup to be used as a food additive. It has since licensed the product to a multinational com- pany that intends to market it worldwide. Intralytix plans to seek FDA approval for another “bacterio-

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 5
phage” product to kill E.coli bacteria on beef before it is ground. Oops, there go the E.coli in our bowels and, consequently, most of the nutrients for our brains and nervous systems.
The viruses are the first to gain FDA approval for use as a food additive. It is believed that the bacterium the viruses target can cause a serious infection called listeriosis. Listeriosis is believed to affect primarily pregnant women, newborns and adults with weakened immune systems. In the United States, CDC estimated 2,500 people become seriously ill with listeriosis each
  ____________________
year. Of those they estimate 500 die. Looking at the statistics, the FDA will subject approximately 270 million people to the potentially dangerous viral soup to protect 500 people from death. Like vaccines for adults, the viral soup should only be sold for personal use by those who want to use it, not the rest of us.
There is nothing that ensures that the viral soup will not destroy our digestive bacteria. Will they put it on raw meats? Regularly ask your meat grocer if the store subjects its meats to any chemicals, including viruses at the source or within his company.
Are We Going To Continually Pay For The Medical Mass Poisoning Of Our Neighbors And The Human Race?
Bob Kadlec and his former boss, Senator Burr, have lobbied for the creation of a new agency, BARDA, headed by an individual empowered to spend billions of taxpayer dollars developing experimental drugs and vaccines behind closed doors with no public oversight. Whenever the Secretary of Health gives the green light, those experimental drugs and vaccines can be forced on American citizens. The Senate passed bill S. 3678 on December 6, 2006. That is a bill critics warned us, because of the dangers of 'secret vaccine production', could grossly affect the American public. Will you be one of those guinea pigs? The House could approve it any day unless we call our representative in Congress.
The millions of Americans who will become the U.S. government's guinea pigs will have no legal recourse if they are injured. Kadlec and Burr made sure of that when they helped ram Bioshield Two (Biodefense and Pandemic Vaccine and Drug Development Act of 2005) through Congress in the middle of the night without public knowledge.
BARDA is a bad idea, especially since the BARDA czar sitting in back rooms with drug company execs will have access to hundreds of
millions of taxpayer dollars but their activities will be
       _________________________
exempt from FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) requests from the public to find out how that money is being spent. Nobody but the BARDA czar and his boss, the politically appointed Secretary of Health, will know just how toxic those experimental vaccines and drugs might be before they are forced on citizens in the name of protecting the public health and national security.
For more information on the plans that bi- partisan supporters of authoritarian biodefense legislation have for America, read the letter NVIC sent to Bob Kadlec in November 2005 at www.nvic.org (Under News & Features on homepage, click on "Liability Shield Given to Pharma).
If you want to voice your opinion about plans to create BARDA so drug companies can develop experimental drugs and vaccines in secret, it is important for you to immediately write, email and fax your Congressperson at their Washington, D.C. office and their home office in your state. If you oppose the legislation, ask for public hearings in both the House in January 2007 before any legislation is passed. Go to www.house.gov to find out how to contact your federallegislators.

Top Aussie Doctor Says Pick Your Nose And Eat it
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
Australian doctor Professor Friedrich Bischinger said that people who pick their noses with their fingers were healthier, happier and probably better in tune with their bodies. I would have to agree simply because we will breathe better and get more oxygen.
Dr. Bishinger says that our fingers are much better able to reach the nooks and crannies of our nostrils than with handkerchiefs, keeping our noses much cleaner.
However, his advice goes further, “...eating the dry remains of what you pull out is a great way of strengthening the body's immune system.
"Medically it makes great sense and is a perfectly natural thing to do. In terms of the immune system the nose is a filter in which a great deal of bacteria are collected, and when this mixture arrives in the intestines it works just like a medicine.
  _____________
Until my next issue, I wish you happiness along with radiant health.
To help change food policy and allow raw food, including raw dairy, to be commercially available nationally, please send donations to:
"Modern medicine is constantly trying to do the same thing through far more complicated methods [such as vaccines], people who pick their nose and eat it get a natural boost to their immune system for free."
However, consider that most of the pollution that the body discards into the nostrils contain the most contaminated free-radicals from the brain. The body already experienced an arduous process of neutraliz- ing those toxins and encapsulating them into mucus. Probably, it would be far better to flick the bugger from your finger or wipe it into a handkerchief.
Understanding the reason why children eat their nose-pickings will allow us to remedy and stop them from re-poisoning themselves. Like nail-biting, mucus-eating is usually caused by a mineral or protein deficiency. If the child were to eat 1 tablespoon raw no-salt-added cheese with 1-1 1⁄2 teaspoons unheated honey, mixed together in the mouth twice daily, s/he could remedy such deficiencies and bugger-eating.

Quinton; Just Another Marketed “Magic Bullet” Or Real Health Boost?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
 I have been asked about my views on a product called Quinton. For over a year, I have said that I know nothing about it, and had no opinion except to suggest that people who try it be careful and cautious. In these modern, fast-communication times, many people promote products based on very little experience and hopeful wishes. They postulate work with which they have not experimented enough to know any long-term results, not even a mere two years. I am leary of any product that is marketed. The only way people hear about my work and books is from the experience of others. It is growing daily because the Primal Diet works, not because it is marketed.
An old but newer product to the USA is Quinton. It is collected ocean water that is diluted with spring water and bottled in glass ampoules, glass bottles or aerosol containers. The marketers claim that it cures many things. They state the theory of Rene Quinton that the basic plasma of everything has the same mineral value as ocean water and that we should therefore ingest it, inhale it and inject it. Celery juice has the same mineral value but should we inject diluted celery juice into our blood plasma, making it 10% of our blood plasma? We have a digestive tract for a purpose and that is to deconstruct and
restructure substances (food) appropriate for the human body, and especially our individuality. I think injecting anything into our blood plasma is asking for real trouble.
Firstly, consider that ocean water for humans is toxic. It has been documented since at least Galileo. It is known that it creates diarrhea in drinkers of it. It causes irrational thought and behavior. Sailors have been recorded to have become insane by regularly drinking it in small amounts trying to ward off dehydration. In the small amounts and diluted form that Quinton produces, it is probably less toxic but still toxic. However, proponents claim that is debatable. Let’s consider two real-life experiences; the only two that I have observed from afar who have taken it for at least one year. I have reports from 4 other people that said it seemed to have some positive effects for about 5-7 days but then nothing for another 2-10 weeks. Then they stopped.
A less-than-two-year consumer of Quinton claims that his chronic constipation has been relieved where as my Primal Diet (PD) did not relieve it. Herein, I will call him Peter. Peter admitted that he NEVER did the diet as I instructed but claims my diet did not relieve his constipation. His version of my PD resolved most of his problems that were suicidal

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
depths of depression, inability to gain weight, never satisfied and no energy. He claims that it did not correct his skin problems and did not give him the super energy level of which he dreamt. I reiterated that for you to see the irrational conclusion drawn by Peter’s thought process that even though he did not follow my PD, he claims it did not resolve his problems.
Whether following my instructions would have alleviated Peter’s constipation is not the issue in this article. I have met several people who did my Primal Diet 100% as I instructed and complained of constipation. (See article on constipation below.) I have never claimed that the PD relieves skin problems because skin is the main dumping ground of many toxins that cause acne and rashes. Many claim that their reason for not following the diet 100% is eating so much food and getting too fat. However, that is my intention, expressed in all of my writings. Fat protects living cells including those that are constantly dividing, giving more life to our bodies and preventing cellular mutation and deformity. Eventually, that equates to more strength, health and energy. We are so toxic that we need an abundant amount of fat to protect us from the toxins within us and outside of us.
I consider that Peter’s consumption of Quinton (diluted ocean water) was not enough pure ocean water to cause diarrhea but enough to cause regular bowel movements. The fact that Quinton prevents Peter’s natural state of constipation does not mean that Quinton is beneficial. The fact that he has a lot more energy does not mean that Quinton is beneficial. Coffee and speed raise energy levels but are not beneficial. I remember when I was a fruitarian, I was wild with energy. It took me 6.5 years to realize that that energy in itself was not always beneficial. The side effects of that diet included the deterioration of my entire body including bone. Even my thought processes were hyper and erratic, inconsistent and often impulsive. My personality was very positive but I was easily moved to anger if opposed, unless my controls were engaged fully.
I observed, and many people came to me and told me that Peter’s personality and integrity have greatly fallen in the last year and asked me what is wrong with the PD. My response has been that everyone has their version of my PD and his is not working for him. During the last year, Peter has had Quinton
intravenously injected several times to equal 10% of his blood plasma. Has it created the observed and reported irrational thinking, irritability and resentful feelings that Peter now frequently exhibits? If it is, is the increase in energy and easy bowel movements worth the reduction of mental clarity and unpleasant and rude personality? Also, if it is, what is it doing to his system long-term? Another symptom that I have noticed in Peter is less blood circulates through his skin. When he was doing a closer version of my PD his skin was always flush with blood and pretty good nutrients. Within the last year, his skin became watery, pale and thicker. At one time, it was extremely dry. After seeing his skin like that for about 3 months, finally I mentioned it to him and he got angry and denied my observation. However, when I saw him several weeks later, his skin was much improved but still did not have the blood circulating in the capillaries as it had for the 4 years he had consumed more of the foods I suggest on my PD.
The other person that I know who regularly consumes Quinton, I will call Tom. He exhibits the same symptoms as Peter, including less blood moving through his skin. However, Tom is much more controlled in his thinking and personality. His life is easy and the fact that he is not under stress as Peter is, is likely to account for his greater control. He does exhibit other symptoms of severe delipidation (tissue-fat deficiency) and hyper activity and sometimes hyper personality. Considering that Tom was a very slow and more cautious thinker in the previous 4 years that I knew him prior to Quinton, those changes are not indications of better health. Tom had the same severe dryness that Peter had for the same length of time that Peter did. They are good friends and Tom advises Peter on his dietary habits. They are exploring dietary phases together.
Let’s consider the ill-effects that salt water has had on the human body. It thinned mucus fibers that protect the membranes, causing cellular destruction and solidification, decreased digestive abilities and absorption, loss of brain fat and myelin erosion, caused insanity, irritability, irrational aggression and violent behavior, and sometimes caused allergies. I equate my early evaluation, although very inadequate, of the results of Quinton with that of the praised research of isolated Vitamin C in the form of l-ascorbic acid by Linus Pauling. They seem to create

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
the same harmful symptoms although some so-called beneficial changes may result from consuming them.
Considering all of the “good” research for Quinton and the disparity of results observed about Peter and Tom, who continue to take it, tells me that Quinton research is not predicated on holistic truth. The argument that we all were evolved from the ocean and we should make it part of our diet and blood is a shallow, flawed and weak argument. The proof is in the pudding. I can look at all of the favorable science that the marketers of Quinton produce and still come to the conclusion that Quinton may be just another harmful product marketed for profit. If you are following my Primal Diet to some extent and taking Quinton, consider the side effects that I mentioned. If your experience is more favorable, please write your experience and let me know. Include your dietary
practices for better analysis. I have seen several of my past clients developing the same symptoms, especially the loss of blood and fats to the skin when I have seen them at our weekly food club over the last year. A few of them looked so sallow and malnourished, I wondered if they were taking Quinton. I do not give them advice because they have not asked me for it.
My conclusion is that people want magic bullets. I find that truth is often better realized by studying anecdotal evidence. Science almost always particulates life into non-living non-holistic compartments; such as Vitamin C l-ascorbic acid research. Particulate-science makes very good points but leaves out everything it refuses to consider. What do you accept as truth?
What Is Constipation And How Do We Resolve It?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Constipation is the inability to defecate. That is caused by several differing circumstances in cases where no tumors or other tissue obstructions exist: 1. the body digests and absorbs all of the food consumed and discards no waste, or 2. feces dries in the bowel and peristalsis is unable to move feces through the sigmoid colon and rectum. In the first case, constipation is the wrong term but that is what it is called. It usually occurs in people whose bodies are starved for nutrients. I have known several people who had one or two small bowel movements weekly for the first 2-3 months on my PD. I experienced rare bowel movements for weeks after fasting (in those days that I misguidedly thought that fasting was beneficial). In the second circumstance, where fecal matter dries in the colon, it is caused by several circumstances: 1. eating cooked food where everything has been fractionated into none bio-active couplings, 2. a fat deficiency from not eating enough fat, 3. eating concentrated mineral foods without enough fat, such as drinking milk that lacks enough cream or eating cheese alone, and 4. lacking proper levels of E.coli.
E.coli deficiency is the most common cause of chronic constipation on my PD. E.coli require an acidic environment to thrive and propagate. E.coli
deficiency has many causes: 1. long-term vegetarianism or fruitarianism where the diet is too alkaline (too many fruits and vegetables) and not enough animal products (e.coli in the human body feed best on animal proteins), 2. toxicity in the bowel that poisons E.coli colonies (medications, pesticides, preservatives, additives and most chemicals, including chemicals formed by cooking). When 1 & 2 above were combined, such as long-term vegetarians who ate lots of soy products, especially soy chips, recovering from chronic constipation while eating my PD can take 10-20 years. Often E.coli have been severely mutated and the bowel is constantly poisoned by the body dumping its detoxified stored toxins into the bowel.
I offer several short-term remedies in my book We Want To Live that are for emergencies only. To help build strong colonies of e.coli, I suggest eating high meat as described in my book The Recipe For Living Without Disease. However, if the colon is constantly subjected to detoxified stored or fresh toxins, E.coli colonies will constantly diminish. In such cases, I suggest that sufferers make a mixture of 3-4 tablespoons unsalted raw butter, 2 tablespoons of raw cream, 2 tablespoons coconut cream (if coconut cream is not available, substitute another 1

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
tablespoons raw cream), and 1⁄4 teaspoon unheated honey. Immediately prior to sleep, place ingredients in a 4-ounces jelly jar, close lid tightly, immerse in bowl of hot water (no hotter than your hand can tolerate for 4 seconds) and let stand for 5-10 minutes. When mixture is tepid, use an enema bulb syringe to inject it into your rectum while kneeling on all fours. Hold it inside and sleep, do not evacuate it. The H2O
from the creams will keep the sigmoid colon moist while the fats coat the feces, preventing it from drying. Any excess fat will move up the colon and protect and partially nourish E.coli colonies. That routine can be utilized every 1-5 days as necessary for sufferers of chronic constipation.
E.coli Are Responsible For Nourishing Our Brains And Nervous Systems
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
E.coli are predominately found in the final stages of digestion in the bowel. E.coli digest proteins and fats into finitely small molecules that feed and nourish our brains and nervous systems. They are responsible for producing massive amounts of B Vitamins to calm and soothe our brains and nervous system.
People who enema and take colonics to remedy their constipation, continue the vicious cycle of devastatingly low colonies of E.coli, causing malnourishment of their brains and nervous systems. That may express itself in several symptoms, such as mild anxiety and loss of mental acuity.
How Much Energy Should I Expect To Experience?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
That is the big question that depends on how poisoned your body is and how well it will function, including how much much quantity of hormones your body produces for physical energy. There are many factors to consider. Eating meat normally increases the body’s ability to produce hormones for physical activity, such as adrenalin and testosterone. Eating red meat is said to produce more than eating other meats. However, I have seen people who are too acidic eat red meat and become sleepy after eating red meat. Most often, those people have more energy when they eat poultry or wild-caught ocean fish with red meat, and/or mainly eat poultry or wild-caught ocean fish. For people who have been long-term vegetarians or fruitarians with a great deal of toxins within their bodies, energy levels may often be erratic and inconsistent. They may require years of patience until their bodies recover properly to have high energy levels. The same may be required of people
who are chemically sensitive because their bodies are so toxic with industrial chemicals. Often, their bodies utilize most of the hormones they produce to bind with and control the toxic chemicals that are constantly poisoning their bodies instead of utilizing them for physical energy. This was a major problem for me after radiation and chemo therapies.
Some times digestion is impaired and a loss of energy results. In such a situation, I suggest making 1 blended mixture of 1 cup good drinking water and 1 cup unheated honey each day for 1-2 days only. For that 1-2 days, I suggest that you eat 1 raw egg Rocky style (or Aajonus style of sucking the egg out of the shell) every hour, and 30 minutes after each egg, sip a little of the honey water mixture (1-11⁄2 tablespoons). Because eggs require only 13-26 minutes to digest, that brief diet allows the body to focus all of its time on balancing digestive environments and other tasks.

Some people have expressed disappointment that I have not published my research. That always confuses me because I thought that my books did that. If they mean, why I have not published the details of my animal experiments, I tell them that I lost license for it because I failed to make a contract of ownership with the laboratory I PAID to do the research. When the owner untimely died, his family took over the lab. They demanded and I refused to pay them $200,000 + for the details of those results. I did not realize that a laboratory could make the argument that like Microsoft, using Windows does not give you ownership of Windows. However, my argument is that the work that I do on Windows belongs to me but arbitration said that the lab's claim was worthy of litigation. Money, money and time, time. To me, it still does not make sense that if I paid almost a million dollars over 11 years for those experiments that the license for them belongs to the lab. I will tell the results without specifics on each animal experiment in my next book. However, the proof of my information is in the pudding. Call it anecdotal or whatever, the diet works exceptionally well with up to 31 years of applying it, even for those who did not follow it as I best suggest.

My Research And Experiments Questioned

Vaccines, All Harmful Or Some Beneficial?
Several years ago I forwarded this interview by the present propaganda about Avian flu and the reporter Jon Rappaport to my email list. Because of soon to be government-sponsored vaccine for it, and

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
the HPV vaccine mandate for teenage girls, I am resubmitting it to you. If you are interested in this type of reporting, you could subscribe to Jon Rappoport’s website: www.NoMoreFakeNews.com
Jon Rappoport’s Interview with Ex-vaccine Researcher. Dr. Mark Randall is the pseudonym of the retired vaccine researcher who worked for many years in the labs of major pharmaceutical houses and the US government's National Institutes of Health. He has been reluctant to speak out, even under the cover of anonymity. However, with the current push to make vaccines mandatory, with penalties like quarantine, he decided to break his silence. He lives comfortably in retirement, but like many of reporter Jon Rappaport’s long-time sources, he has developed a conscience about his former work. Dr. Randall comments about the heads of the medical cartel and their goals of depopulation, mind control, and general debilitation of populations for control.
http://www.whale.to/w/rappoport.html
Q: You were once certain that vaccines were the hallmark of good medicine.
A: Yes I was. I helped develop a few vaccines. I won't say which ones.
Q: Why not?
A: I want to preserve my privacy.
Q: So you think you could have problems if you came out into the open?
A: I believe I could lose my pension. Q: On what grounds?
A: The grounds don't matter. These people have ways of causing you problems, when you were once part of the Club. I know one or two people who were put under surveillance, who were harassed.
Q: Harassed by whom? A: The FBI.
Q: Really?
A: Sure. The FBI used other pretexts. And the IRS can come calling too.
Q: So much for free speech.
A: I was "part of the inner circle." If now I began to name names and make specific accusations against researchers, I could be in a world of trouble.
Q: What is at the bottom of these efforts at harassment?
A: Vaccines are the last defense of modern medicine. Vaccines are the ultimate justification for the overall "brilliance" of modern medicine.
Q: Do you believe that people should be allowed to choose whether they should get vaccines?
A: On a political level, yes. On a scientific level, people need information, so that they can choose well. It's one thing to say choice is good. But if the atmosphere is full of lies, how can you choose? Also, if the FDA were run by honorable people, these vaccines would not be granted licenses. They would be investigated to within an inch of their lives.
Q: There are medical historians who state that the overall decline of illnesses was not due to vaccines.
A: I know. For a long time, I ignored their work. Q: Why?
A: Because I was afraid of what I would find out. I was in the business of developing vaccines. My livelihood depended on continuing that work.
Q: And then?
A: I did my own investigation.
Q: What conclusions did you come to?
A: The decline of disease is due to improved living conditions.
Q: What conditions?
A: Cleaner water. Advanced sewage systems. Nutrition. Fresher food. A decrease in poverty. Germs may be everywhere, but when you are healthy, you don't contract the diseases as easily.
Q: What did you feel when you completed your own investigation?
A: Despair. I realized I was working a sector based on a
  
 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page collection of lies.
Q: Are some vaccines more dangerous than others?
A: Yes. The DPT shot, for example. The MMR. But some lots of a vaccine are more dangerous than other lots of the same vaccine. As far as I'm concerned, all vaccines are dangerous.
Q: Why?
A: Several reasons. They involve the human immune system in a process that tends to compromise immunity. They can actually cause the disease they are supposed to prevent. They can cause other diseases than the ones they are supposed to prevent.
Q: Why are we quoted statistics which seem to prove that vaccines have been tremendously successful at wiping out diseases?
A: Why? To give the illusion that these vaccines are useful. If a vaccine suppresses visible symptoms of a disease like measles, everyone assumes that the vaccine is a success. But, under the surface, the vaccine can harm the immune system itself. And if it causes other diseases -- say, meningitis -- that fact is masked, because no one believes that the vaccine can do that. The connection is overlooked.
Q: It is said that the smallpox vaccine wiped out smallpox in England.
A: Yes. But when you study the available statistics, you get another picture.
Q: Which is?
A: There were cities in England where people who were not vaccinated did not get smallpox. There were places where people who were vaccinated experienced smallpox epidemics. And smallpox was already on the decline before the vaccine was introduced.
Q: So you're saying that we have been treated to a false history.
A: Yes. That's exactly what I'm saying. This is a history that has been cooked up to convince people that vaccines are invariably safe and effective.
Q: Now, you worked in labs. Where purity was an issue. A: The public believes that these labs, these
manufacturing facilities are the cleanest places in the world. That is not true. Contamination occurs all the time. You get all sorts of debris introduced into vaccines.
Q: For example, the SV40 monkey virus slips into the polio vaccine.
A: Well yes, that happened. But that's not what I mean. The SV40 got into the polio vaccine because the vaccine was made by using monkey kidneys. But I'm talking about something else. The actual lab conditions. The mistakes. The careless errors. SV40, which was later found in cancer tumors -- that was what I would call a structural problem. It was an accepted part of the manufacturing process. If you use monkey kidneys, you open the door to germs which you don't know are in those kidneys.
Q: Okay, but let's ignore that distinction between different types of contaminants for a moment. What contaminants did you find in your many years of work with vaccines?
A: All right. I'll give you some of what I came across, and I'll also give you what colleagues of mine found. Here's a partial list. In the Rimavex measles vaccine, we found various chicken viruses. In polio vaccine, we found acanthamoeba, which is a so-called "brain-eating" amoeba. Simian cytomegalovirus in polio vaccine. Simian foamy virus in the rotavirus vaccine. Bird-cancer viruses in the MMR vaccine. Various micro-organisms in the anthrax vaccine. I've found potentially dangerous enzyme inhibitors in several vaccines. Duck, dog, and rabbit viruses in the rubella vaccine. Avian leucosis virus in the flu vaccine. Pestivirus in the MMR vaccine.
Q: Let me get this straight. These are all contaminants which don't belong in the vaccines.
A: That's right. And if you try to calculate what damage these contaminants can cause, well, we don't really know, because no testing has been done, or very little testing. It's a game of roulette. You take your chances. Also, most people don't know that some polio vaccines, adenovirus vaccines, rubella and hep A and measles vaccines have been made with aborted human fetal tissue. I have found what I believed were bacterial fragments and poliovirus in these vaccines from time to time -- which may have come from that fetal tissue. When you look for contaminants in vaccines, you can come up with material that IS puzzling. You know it shouldn't be there, but you don't know exactly what you've got. I have found what I believed was a very

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
small "fragment" of human hair and also human mucus. I have found what can only be called "foreign protein," which could mean almost anything. It could mean protein from viruses.
Q: Alarm bells are ringing all over the place.
A: How do you think I felt? Remember, this material is going into the bloodstream without passing through some of the ordinary immune defenses.
Q: How were your findings received?
A: Basically, it was, don't worry, this can't be helped. In making vaccines, you use various animals' tissue, and that's where this kind of contamination enters in. Of course, I'm not even mentioning the standard chemicals like formaldehyde, mercury, and aluminum which are purposely put into vaccines.
Q: This information is pretty staggering.
A: Yes. And I'm just mentioning some of the biological contaminants. Who knows how many others there are? Others we don't find because we don't think to look for them. If tissue from, say, a bird is used to make a vaccine, how many possible germs can be in that tissue? We have no idea.We have no idea what they might be, or what effects they could have on humans.
Q: And beyond the purity issue?
A: You are dealing with the basic faulty premise about vaccines. That they intricately stimulate the immune system to create the conditions for immunity from disease. That is the bad premise. It doesn't work that way. A vaccine is supposed to "create" antibodies which, indirectly, offer protection against disease. However, the immune system is much larger and more involved than antibodies and their related "killer cells."
Q: The immune system is?
A: The entire body, really. Plus the mind. It's all immune system, you might say. That is why you can have, in the middle of an epidemic, those individuals who remain healthy.
Q: So the level of general health is important. A: More than important. Vital.
Q: How are vaccine statistics falsely presented?
A: There are many ways. For example, suppose that 25 people who have received the hepatitis B vaccine come down with hepatitis. Well, hep B is a liver disease. But you can call liver disease many things. You can change the diagnosis. Then, you've concealed the root cause of the problem.
Q: And that happens?
A: All the time. It HAS to happen, if the doctors automatically assume that people who get vaccines DO NOT come down with the diseases they are now supposed to be protected from. And that is exactly what doctors assume. You see, it's circular reasoning. It's a closed system. It admits no fault. No possible fault. If a person who gets a vaccine against hepatitis gets hepatitis, or gets some other disease, the automatic assumption is, this had nothing to do with the disease.
Q: In your years working in the vaccine establishment, how many doctors did you encounter who admitted that vaccines were a problem?
A: None. There were a few who privately questioned what they were doing. But they would never go public, even within their companies.
Q: What was the turning point for you?
A: I had a friend whose baby died after a DPT shot. Q: Did you investigate?
A: Yes, informally. I found that this baby was completely healthy before the vaccination. There was no reason for his death, except the vaccine. That started my doubts. Of course, I wanted to believe that the baby had gotten a bad shot from a bad lot. But as I looked into this further, I found that was not the case in this instance. I was being drawn into a spiral of doubt that increased over time. I continued to investigate. I found that, contrary to what I thought, vaccines are not tested in a scientific way.
Q: What do you mean?
A: For example, no long-term studies are done on any vaccines. Long-term follow-up is not done in any careful way. Why? Because, again, the assumption is made that vaccines do not cause problems. So why should anyone check? On top of that, a vaccine reaction is defined so that all bad reactions are said to occur very soon after the shot is given. But that does not make sense.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page Q: Why doesn't it make sense?
A: Because the vaccine obviously acts in the body for a long period of time after it is given. A reaction can be gradual. Deterioration can be gradual. Neurological problems can develop over time. They do in various conditions, even according to a conventional analysis. So why couldn't that be the case with vaccines? If chemical poisoning can occur gradually, why couldn't that be the case with a vaccine which contains mercury?
Q: And that is what you found?
A: Yes. You are dealing with correlations, most of the time.Correlations are not perfect. But if you get 500 parents whose children have suffered neurological damage during a one-year period after having a vaccine, this should be sufficient to spark off an intense investigation.
Q: Has it been enough?
A: No. Never. This tells you something right away. Q: Which is?
A: The people doing the investigation are not really interested in looking at the facts. They assume that the vaccines are safe. So, when they do investigate, they invariably come up with exonerations of the vaccines. They say, "This vaccine is safe." But what do they base those judgments on? They base them on definitions and ideas which automatically rule out a condemnation of the vaccine.
Q: There are numerous cases where a vaccine campaign has failed. Where people have come down with the disease against which they were vaccinated.
A: Yes, there are many such instances. And there the evidence is simply ignored. It's discounted. The experts say, if they say anything at all, that this is just an isolated situation, but overall the vaccine has been shown to be safe. But if you add up all the vaccine campaigns where damage and disease have occurred, you realize that these are NOT isolated situations.
Q: Did you ever discuss what we are talking about here with colleagues, when you were still working in the vaccine establishment?
A: Yes I did.
Q: What happened?
A: Several times I was told to keep quiet. It was made clear that I should go back to work and forget my misgivings. On a few occasions, I encountered fear. Colleagues tried to avoid me. They felt they could be labeled with "guilt by association." All in all, though, I behaved myself.I made sure I didn't create problems for myself.
Q: If vaccines actually do harm, why are they given?
A: First of all, there is no "if." They do harm. It becomes a more difficult question to decide whether they do harm in those people who seem to show no harm. Then you are dealing with the kind of research which should be done, but isn't. Researchers should be probing to discover a kind of map, or flow chart, which shows exactly what vaccines do in the body from the moment they enter. This research has not been done. As to why they are given, we could sit here for two days and discuss all the reasons. As you've said many times, at different layers of the system people have their motives. Money, fear of losing a job, the desire to win brownie points, prestige, awards, promotion, misguided idealism, unthinking habit, and so on. But, at the highest levels of the medical cartel, vaccines are a top priority because they cause a weakening of the immune system. I know that may be hard to accept, but it's true. The medical cartel, at the highest level, is not out to help people, it is out to harm them, to weaken them. To kill them. At one point in my career, I had a long conversation with a man who occupied a high government position in an African nation. He told me that he was well aware of this. He told me that WHO is a front for these depopulation interests. There is an underground, shall we say, in Africa, made up of various officials who are earnestly trying to change the lot of the poor. This network of people knows what is going on. They know that vaccines have been used, and are being used, to destroy their countries, to make them ripe for takeover by globalist powers. I have had the opportunity to speak with several of these people from this network.
Q: Is Thabo Mbeki, the president of South Africa, aware of the situation?
A: I would say he is partially aware. Perhaps he is not utterly convinced, but he is on the way to realizing the whole truth. He already knows that HIV is a hoax. He knows that the AIDS drugs are poisons which destroy the immune system. He also knows that if he speaks out, in any way, about the vaccine issue, he will be branded a lunatic. He has enough trouble after his stand on the AIDS issue.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
Q: This network you speak of.
A: It has accumulated a huge amount of information about vaccines. The question is, how is a successful strategy going to be mounted? For these people, that is a difficult issue.
Q: And in the industrialized nations?
A: The medical cartel has a stranglehold, but it is diminishing. Mainly because people have the freedom to question medicines. However, if the choice issue [the right to take or reject any medicine] does not gather steam, these coming mandates about vaccines against biowarefare germs are going to win out. This is an important time.
Q: The furor over the hepatits B vaccine seems one good avenue.
A: I think so, yes. To say that babies must have the vaccine-and then in the next breath, admitting that a person gets hep B from sexual contacts and shared needles -- is a ridiculous juxtaposition. Medical authorities try to cover themselves by saying that 20,000 or so children in the US get hep B every year from "unknown causes," and that's why every baby must have the vaccine. I dispute that 20,00 figure and the so-called studies that back it up.
Q: Andrew Wakefield, the British MD who uncovered the link between the MMR vaccine and autism, has just been fired from his job in a London hospital.
A: Yes. Wakefield performed a great service. His correlations between the vaccine and autism are stunning. Perhaps you know that Tony Blair's wife is involved with alternative health. There is the possibility that their child has not been given the MMR. Blair recently side-stepped the question in press interviews, and made it seem that he was simply objecting to invasive questioning of his "personal and family life." In any event, I believe his wife has been muzzled. I think, if given the chance, she would at least say she is sympathetic to all the families who have come forward and stated that their children were severely damaged by the MMR.
Q: British reporters should try to get through to her.
A: They have been trying. But I think she has made a deal with her husband to keep quiet, no matter what. She could do a great deal of good if she breaks her promise. I
have been told she is under pressure, and not just from her husband. At the level she occupies, MI6 and British health authorities get into the act. It is thought of as a matter of national security.
Q: Well, it is national security, once you understand the medical cartel.
A: It is global security. The cartel operates in every nation. It zealously guards the sanctity of vaccines. Questioning these vaccines is on the same level as a Vatican bishop questioning the sanctity of the sacrament of the Eucharist in the Catholic Church.
Q: I know that a Hollywood celebrity stating publicly that he will not take a vaccine is committing career suicide.
A: Hollywood is linked very powerfully to the medical cartel. There are several reasons, but one of them is simply that an actor who is famous can draw a huge amount of publicity if he says ANYTHING. In 1992, I was present at your demonstration against the FDA in downtown Los Angeles. One or two actors spoke against the FDA. Since that time, you would be hard pressed to find an actor who has spoken out in any way against the medical cartel.
Q: Within the National Institutes of Health, what is the mood, what is the basic frame of mind?
A: People are competing for research monies. The last thing they think about is challenging the status quo. They are already in an intramural war for that money. They don't need more trouble. This is a very insulated system. It depends on the idea that, by and large, modern medicine is very successful on every frontier. To admit systemic problems in any area is to cast doubt on the whole enterprise. You might therefore think that NIH is the last place one should think about holding demonstrations. But just the reverse is true. If five thousand people showed up there demanding an accounting of the actual benefits of that research system, demanding to know what real health benefits have
been conferred on the public from the billions of wasted dollars funneled to that facility, something might start. A spark might go off. You might get, with further demonstrations, all sorts of fall-out. Researchers -- a few -- might start leaking information.
Q: A good idea.
A: People in suits standing as close to the buildings as the police will allow. People in business suits, in jogging

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
suits, mothers and babies. Well-off people. Poor people. All sorts of people.
Q: What about the combined destructive power of a number of vaccines given to babies these days?
A: It is a travesty and a crime. There are no real studies of any depth which have been done on that. Again, the assumption is made that vaccines are safe, and therefore any number of vaccines given together are safe as well. But the truth is, vaccines are not safe. Therefore the potential damage increases when you give many of them in a short time period.
Q: Then we have the fall flu season.
A: Yes. As if only in the autumn do these germs float in to the US from Asia. The public swallows that premise. If it happens in April, it is a bad cold. If it happens in October, it is the flu.
Q: Do you regret having worked all those years in the vaccine field?
A: Yes. But after this interview, I'll regret it a little less. And I work in other ways. I give out information to certain people, when I think they will use it well.
Q: What is one thing you want the public to understand?
A: That the burden of proof in establishing the safety and efficacy of vaccines is on the people who manufacture and license them for public use. Just that. The burden of proof is not on you or me. And for proof you need well-designed long-term studies. You need extensive follow-up. You need to interview mothers and pay attention to what mothers say about their babies and what happens to them after vaccination. You need all these things. The things that are not there.
Q: The things that are not there. A: Yes.
Q: To avoid any confusion, I'd like you to review, once more, the disease problems that vaccines can cause. Which diseases, how that happens.
A: We are basically talking about two potential harmful outcomes. One, the person gets the disease from the vaccine. He gets the disease which the vaccine is supposed to protect him from. Because, some version of the disease is in the vaccine to begin with. Or two, he doesn't get THAT disease, but at some later time, maybe
right away, maybe not, he develops another condition which is caused by the vaccine. That condition could be autism, what's called autism, or it could be some other disease like meningitis. He could become mentally disabled.
Q: Is there any way to compare the relative frequency of these different outcomes?
A: No. Because the follow-up is poor. We can only guess. If you ask, out of a population of a hundred thousand children who get a measles vaccine, how many get the measles, and how many develop other problems from the vaccine, there is a no reliable answer. That is what I'm saying. Vaccines are superstitions. And with superstitions, you don't get facts you can use. You only get stories, most of which are designed to enforce the superstition. But, from many vaccine campaigns, we can piece together a narrative that does reveal some very disturbing things. People have been harmed. The harm is real, and it can be deep and it can mean death. The harm is NOT limited to a few cases, as we have been led to believe.In the US, there are groups of mothers who are testifying about autism and childhood vaccines. They are coming forward and standing up at meetings.They are essentially trying to fill in the gap that has been created by the researchers and doctors who turn their backs on the whole thing.
Q: Let me ask you this. If you took a child in, say, Boston and you raised that child with good nutritious food and he exercised every day and he was loved by his parents, and he didn't get the measles vaccine, what would be his health status compared with the average child in Boston who eats poorly and watches five hours of TV a day and gets the measles vaccine?
A: Of course there are many factors involved, but I would bet on the better health status for the first child. If he gets measles, if he gets it when he is nine, the chances are it will be much lighter than the measles the second child might get. I would bet on the first child every time.
Q: How long did you work with vaccines? A: A long time. Longer than ten years.
Q: Looking back now, can you recall any good reason to say that vaccines are successful?
A: No, I can't. If I had a child now, the last thing I would allow is vaccination. I would move out of the state if I had to. I would change the family name. I would disappear. With my family. I'm not saying it would come

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
to that. There are ways to sidestep the system with grace, if you know how to act. There are exemptions you can declare, in every state, based on religious and/or philosophic views. But if push came to shove, I would go on the move.
Q: And yet there are children everywhere who do get vaccines and appear to be healthy.
A: The operative word is "appear." What about all the children who can't focus on their studies? What about the children who have tantrums from time to time? What about the children who are not quite in possession of all their mental faculties? I know there are many causes for these things, but vaccines are one cause. I would not take the chance. I see no reason to take the chance. And frankly, I see no reason to allow the government to have the last word. Government medicine is, from my experience, often a contradiction in terms. You get one or the other, but not both.
Q: So we come to the level playing field.
A: Yes. Allow those who want the vaccines to take them. Allow the dissidents to decline to take them. But, as I said earlier, there is no level playing field if the field is strewn with lies. And when babies are involved, you have parents making all the decisions. Those parents need a heavy dose of truth. What about the child I spoke of who died from the DPT shot? What information did his parents act on? I can tell you it was heavily weighted. It was not real information.
Q: Medical PR people, in concert with the press, scare the hell out of parents with dire scenarios about what will happen if their kids don't get shots.
A: They make it seem a crime to refuse the vaccine. They equate it with bad parenting. You fight that with better information. It is always a challenge to buck the authorities. And only you can decide whether to do it. It is every person's responsibility to make up his mind. The medical cartel likes that bet. It is betting that the fear will win.

My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from cooking or industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi- monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!
LOBBYING IN WASHINGTON, DC FOR RAW MILK
I and two volunteers Jeff Slay and Lindsey Jacob will educate Senators and House of Representatives from July 15 through August 1, 2007. At sometime we will email you a request or two to fax your Senators and House Representatives about the raw-milk issue, giving your testimonial about benefits of raw milk and asking them to reopen our state boarders to allow raw dairy to pass from state to state. See the end of this newsletter to send donations to help us. Thank you! There was never any legislated federal law that raw milk could not pass state lines but Ronald Reagan issued an Executive Order (EO) outlawing it. Reagan was a friend of industry and an enemy of the people. He broke the unions and wrote many EO’s that continue to damage the public’s health.
DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS; CAUSES FOR MOST INTESTINAL DISEASES, INCLUDING COLIC, INFLAMATORY BOWEL SYNDROME (IBS)
AND CROHN’S DISEASE
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd, scientific nutritionist
   Utilizing my self-developed iridological analysis, I discovered that IBS and Crohn’s mainly have been caused by penicillin and vaccines. Penicillin infects us with fungus that is not natural to humans but is common in birds. Very often, penicillin travels to intestines, makes roots and lives there. Too often, it lives in the intestines and nervous system for a life time, unless we know how to gradually eliminate it. Penicillin fungus interferes with digestion and causes many intestinal problems and diseases. Too often, I have found that penicillin mold lives in our brains, causing many cognitive problems.
I know of only one way to naturally eliminate penicillin fungus without serious side effects. Blend together 5-8 tablespoons (depending on size of
person) fresh raw lime juice, 11⁄2-3 tablespoons fresh raw lemon juice, 5-8 tablespoons unheated honey, 5- 8 tablespoons raw coconut cream, and 2-5 tablespoons raw dairy cream. Add 3-5 ounces of raw milk or naturally sparkling water (such as Gerolsteiner) and stir gently. I suggest that that mixture be divided into 5 parts and consumed throughout the day for no more than 3 consecutive days, once every 3-4 weeks. That mixture is also a powerful antibiotic, only to be used in place of a pharmaceutical antibiotic. Wisdom has shown me that it is best to let detoxifications run their courses. However, if you are in fear or in panic about a detoxification (infection), that formula is most often

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 55§
very effective to reduce, slow or end increases in parasites, bacteria, fungus and virus.
In penicillin-fungal poisoning and other pharma- ceutical antibiotic-induced problems, food cannot be digested. However, we must eat to nourish our bodies and heal. The most easily and quickest digested food is raw egg. Most often, a raw egg digests in 16-23 minutes, after passing only a few inches into the small intestine. I have known digestively challenged people who have eaten raw eggs as 90-95% of their raw diet, drinking milk at bedtime and during the night. Other people and I have eaten up to 50 eggs per day without any side effect except dry mouth. Dry mouth is not remedied by drinking water. Apply- ing a mixture of 6 parts raw coconut cream and 1 part honey to our lips and a little in our mouths whenever they feel dry, restores fats lost in the mouth and face that cause dry and cotton mouth.
Eating mainly eggs allows the body to spend its nutrients and energy on cleansing and healing, not digesting food. (In the 38 years that I consumed raw eggs, I have never experienced a biotin deficiency. Also, I have never observed anyone else with a biotin deficiency even when they practically lived on raw eggs. Therefore, that should not be a concern.) Depending on the severity of illness and need for nutrition, a person could eat a raw egg every 15-30 minutes. The number of eggs to consume would be the number that prevents weight loss and/or promotes weight gain. Preventing blood over-acidity is necessary when on most animal-based diets. Therefore, while eating mainly eggs our blood usually requires green vegetable juices to keep it from over-acidity.
To counter the massive poisoning from vaccines with their content of mercury, formaldehyde, aluminum and detergents when injected, our bodies very often deliver some or much of those poisons to the stomach. Often our bodies store those poisons in the stomach lining. Gradually, our stomachs discharge those poisons a few molecules at a time into our food when food enters our stomachs. Those poisons are gradually absorbed, causing gradual poisoning of our intestines and nervous systems, and often on to the rest of our bodies, distributing dangerous free-radical molecules to our entire bodies.
Eating 1-2 sugar-cubed-sized amounts of raw no- salt cheeses 10 minutes prior to eating or drinking helps stop the gradual distribution of those chemical poisons throughout our bodies. Usually, cheese absorbs those poisons as they dump from our stomachs, preventing those poisons from being absorbed into our food and distributed throughout our bodies. I have observed that the body dumps poisons that have been stored in the stomach lining as soon as food enters our mouths and/or stomachs. Within 10 minutes of ceasing food consumption, our stomachs stop dumping the poison and will not dump again for about 35 minutes even if we resume eating after the 10 minutes have passed. Therefore, we have 25 minutes to eat or drink as soon as the 10-minutes wait-period ends. Eating 1⁄2-1 teaspoon coconut cream with the 1-2 sugar-cubed-sized amount of cheese enhances the containment of those poisons. For those who experience severe constipation when eating cheese, eating the coconut cream or butter with cheese helps prevent constipation.
TB TESTING FOR TEACHERS AND HEALTH PRACTITIONERS

Call around for a doctor who will administer the Mantaux II vaccine. It is injected into the skin, not subcutaneously, leaving a large lump in the skin. I have found that because of inexperience, most nurses do not know how to inject into the skin and “accidentally” inject it in under the skin. Then it is too late and none of the following can be done. Therefore, insist that the doctor inject it into your skin. When injected into skin the fluid is slowly absorbed from the skin into the body (blood,
lymphatic and nervous systems and local tissue), giving time to remove it. The injection leaves a very large-looking puncture in the skin.
Immediately after injection, leave the doctor's office. Have a raw egg and glass ready. Break the egg into the glass and whip white and yolk together vigorously. Suck the fluid from the lump at the enlarged puncture wound, and expectorate it. Lightly apply the egg on and within 2 inches around the

MERCURY IN FISH; DO WE ABSORB IT?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd, scientific nutritionist
I conducted a laboratory experiment in 1989 in which I planned to discover how much, if any, mercury stored in animal's bodies when they ate raw and cooked swordfish. I chose swordfish because it is considered to contain highest levels of mercury, and because it is my favorite-tasting fish. I wanted to know if I had been contaminating myself with that delicious tasting fish.
First, the lab technician placed ads for dogs and cats aged 11-14. We chose that elderly group because it is considered most susceptible to easy contamination and illness from all sorts of toxic sources, including food consumption. We obtained 8 dogs and 8 cats of various kinds. All appeared unhealthy.
To obtain a 30-60 pounds swordfish, I called several fishing boat businesses in Los Angeles and Ventura. After several days, I found 4 fishermen who promised to call me as soon as they, or one of their clients who was willing to sell his or her catch, caught a large-enough swordfish. After 5 days, I bought a 53 pound swordfish for the experiment. Seven cubes of swordfish equaling one pound were weighed, reduced1, tested and analyzed for mercury content. The mercury level was very high at 13.3 μg/g (probably because of all of the military and industrial waste from Oxnard and Ventura).
I divided the dogs and cats equally into 2 groups: Group A ate raw swordfish and Group B ate the same swordfish baked on a stainless steel grid. I joined Group A, eating nothing but raw swordfish for 5 days. Each portion was weighed proportionately to the size and weight of the animal and recorded so that we would know how much mercury each animal consumed.
All animals were equipped with catheters to collect their urine. All urine and feces were collected, bottled in glass, labeled with the name/number of the animal
1 Both analytical methods were used for each animals waste: 1) hotplate digestion, acid digestion of sediment, sludges and soils, and 2) manual cold-vapor (new, at the time, EPA adopted meth- ods in 1994); EPA Method 3050B, and 7470A, respectively. PA
and preserved in refrigeration without additives. Imediately after urinating, animals were allowed to exercise only on concrete because we did not want them eating any grass or dirt. Only 4-16 ounces of water were provided for each animal to drink, according to size and weight.
No food was consumed for the last 2 days of the 7- day swordfish-eating experiment. Group A (raw) showed excellent energy levels and calm dispositions throughout. Group B (cooked) showed fair to good energy levels with moments of erratic energy surges where they paced anxiously for up to 40 minutes.
After seven days passed, all urine and feces were weighed and tested in batches for each animal separately. Group B’s (cooked) mercury-results ranged from 1.1-1.64 μg/g. Group A’s (raw) mercury-results ranged from 12.25-13.03 μg/g.
ANALYSIS
Group B discarded in feces and urine only 8-12% of the mercury contained in the cooked swordfish that they ate. Group B retained 88-92% of the mercury contained in the cooked swordfish that they ate. (Some of the mercury may have exuded out of the skin, nails and hair).
Group A discarded in feces and urine 92-98% of the mercury contained in the raw swordfish that they ate. Group A retained only 2-8% of the mercury contained in the raw swordfish that they ate. (Some of the mercury may have exuded out of the skin, nails and hair).
When we examined the feces and urine from both groups under an electronic microscope, we saw that in Group B very few cholesterols (fats) attached to mercury molecules. In Group A, massive amounts of cholesterols attached and encapsulated mercury molecules.
CONCLUSION
Group B retained most of the mercury in the cooked swordfish and contaminated its consumers’ bodies with mercury (neurological toxicity). Group A

SUBSCRIBER’S QUESTIONS:
TOXIC CHEMICALS OUT-GASSING INTO OUR HOMES
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Hi, Aajonus, Yesterday when we spoke you recommended putting a corn dracaena in the bedroom to help with my lung issues. Will other varieties of dracaena (e.g. Warneckii, Marginata, Janet Craig etc.) work as well? It’s a matter of availability, size and aesthetics. Gordon
Aajonus: House construction involves many chemicals that out-gas, causing many problems, such as emphysema, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, allergies and severe chemical sensitivity. As the building-material toxicity collects in our bodies, we are likely to develop one or more of the above diseases. That largely depends on where in our bodies those chemicals store. In my books, I stated what is necessary to remove toxins from the body. Here, I share how to naturally remove those chemicals from the air in your home.
If your house, apartment or condo was built, remodeled, renovated or painted in the last 5 years, you can cure your house by placing 2-3 filament space heaters and an infrared generator in each room. Slightly open one or two windows in each room and hallway. Remove all electronic equipment and furniture. Turn on infrared generator, and heaters to highest heat. Let rooms cook slowly for 3-5 days. If water-based paint, 24 hours will do but any other paint and construction material will require 3-5 days to cure.
After curing rooms and halls, place fans in every room and hall, open all windows and doors fully and let ventilate for 2-3 days with fans on high.
You may cure one room at a time so that you do not have to remove all of the furniture from your home but be certain to keep the door closed and sealed to the room that you will cure. Afterward, any mild out- gassing that may occur can be neutralized by plants.
NASA and the Associated Landscape Contractors of America (ALCA) announced the findings of a 2-

years study suggesting that common indoor plants can help combat "SICK BUILDING SYNDROME". Common indoor plants in your office or home are not only decorative but NASA scientists found them to be useful in absorbing potentially harmful gases and cleaning air inside modern buildings.
Research using biological processes to resolve environmental problems on Earth and in spatial habitats has been performed for many years by Dr. Bill Wolverton, formerly a senior research scientist at NASA's John C. Stennis Space Center, Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. Based on preliminary evaluations, ALCA joined NASA to fund a study using about a dozen popular varieties of ornamental plants to determine their effectiveness in removing several key pollutants associated with indoor air pollution. NASA research on indoor plants found that living plants are so efficient at absorbing contaminants in the air that some will be launched into space as part of the biological life support system aboard future space stations.
Each plant type was placed in sealed Plexiglas chambers in which chemicals were injected. Philodendron, spider plant and the golden pothos were labeled the most effective in removing formaldehyde molecules. Flowering plants such as gerbera daisy and chrysanthemums were rated superior in removing benzene from the chamber atmosphere. Other good performers are Dracaena Massangeana, Spathiphyllum, and Golden Pothos. "Plants take substances out of the air through the tiny openings in their leaves," Wolverton said. "But research in our laboratories has determined that plant leaves, roots and soil bacteria are all important in removing trace levels of toxic vapors".
Plants in your home or office will improve the quality of the air, making them more pleasant places to live and work. People will feel better, perform better, and enjoy life more. Chemicals Used

Trichloroethylene (TCE) is a commercial product found in many industrial and home uses. Although over 90 percent of the TCE produced is used in the metal degreasing and dry cleaning industries, TCE is used in printing inks, paints, lacquers, varnishes, and adhesives. In 1975 the National Cancer Institute reported that an unusually high incidence of hepatocellular carcinomas was observed in mice given TCE by gastric intubation and now considers this chemical a potent liver carcinogen.
Benzene is a commonly used solvent and is present in many products including gasoline, inks, oils, paints, plastics, rubber, detergents, explosives, pharmaceuticals, and dyes. In tests, benzene irritated skin and eyes. It proved to cause mutagenic bacterial cells, embryotoxicity and carcinogenicity. Also, evidence shows that benzene may contribute to chromosomal aberrations and leukemia in humans. Repeated skin contact with benzene causes dryness, inflammation, blistering and dermatitis. Acute inhalation of high levels of benzene causes dizziness, weakness, euphoria, headache, nausea, blurred vision, respiratory diseases, tremors, irregular heartbeat, liver and kidney damage, paralysis and unconsciousness. In animal tests, inhalation of benzene led to cataract formation and diseases of the blood and lymphatic systems. Chronic exposure to low levels causes headaches, loss of appetite, drowsiness, nervousness, psychological disturbances and diseases of the blood system, including anemia and bone marrow diseases.
Formaldehyde is a ubiquitous chemical found in virtually all indoor environments. The major sources include urea-formaldehyde foam insulation (UFFI) and particle board or pressed wood products used in manufacturing office furniture. Many common household cleaning agents contain formaldehyde. It is used in consumer paper products treated with UF resins, including grocery bags, waxed papers, toilet and facial tissues, paper towels, stiffeners, wrinkle resisters, water repellents, fire retardants and adhesive binders in floor coverings, carpet backings and permanent-press clothes. Other sources of formaldehyde include heating and cooking fuels like natural gas, kerosene, and cigarette smoke. The most
widely reported symptoms of formaldehyde are headaches and irritation to mucous membranes of eyes, nose and throat. It is highly reactive and combines with protein, causing allergic contact dermatitis and asthma. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently conducted research demonstrating that formaldehyde is suspect in causing a rare type of throat cancer in long-term occupants of mobile homes.
Carbon monoxide is found in cigarette smoke and is produced by the incomplete combustion of fuel. Exposure to low levels can cause drowsiness and headaches.
Of the few plants tested, here are the top 10 plants most effective in removing formaldehyde, benzene, and carbon monoxide from the air: Bamboo Palm = Chamaedorea Seifritzii Chinese Evergreen = Aglaonema Modestum English Ivy = Hedera Helix Gerbera Daisy = Gerbera Jamesonii Janet Craig = Dracaena "Janet Craig" Marginata = Dracaena Marginata Mass cane/Corn Plan = Dracaena Massangeana Mother-in-Law's Tongue = Sansevieria Laurentii Pot Mum = Chrysantheium Morifolium Peace Lily = Spathiphyllum "Mauna Loa" Warneckii = Dracaena "Warneckii"
The most effective at removing formaldehyde were philodendron, spider plant, and golden pothos. Ger- bera daisy and chrysanthemum (mum) are common flowering varieties that were most efficient at remov- ing benzene. Peace lily and chrysanthemum were most efficient at removing trichoroethylene.
All plants produce oxygen by photosynthesis, in- creasing oxygen in their immediate surroundings. All plants utilize carbon while producing new growth and are effective at removing low levels of carbon monoxide, cleaning our air, including English ivy, Chinese evergreen, bamboo palm, snake plant (moth- er-in-law’s tongue), and the Dracaena Marginata, corn plant, and Janet Craig. Generally, one large plant per 100 square feet will clean air in an average home or office. More heavily polluted environments require greater concentrations of plants.

Hello Aajonus, Could you please consider the topic of this HPV vaccine for girls for a future newsletter on WeWant2Live.com? It is a travesty that governments are considering making this mandatory for school attendance. Thanks, Ross
Aajonus: Firstly, let’s consider the nature of HPV. It is a virus. It is without a nucleus and respiratory system. It is not alive and cannot be contagious.
Secondly, because of our much polluted life styles, most girls are contaminated with so much toxicity that the only method of cleansing their bodies, including the reproductive areas, is virus. Our normal janitors that are parasites, bacteria and fungus do not have much of a chance to survive in toxic bodies. Therefore, the body resorts to a viral detoxification (cleansing; calling virus an infection is a misnomer). Viruses are solvents/soaps made by cells. Those solvents/soaps dissolve toxic tissue and compounds in and around cells.
Thirdly, Merck’s tests do not prove that their HPV vaccine prevents any type of virus although they claim that it prevents partial HPV, and only reduced the incidence of believed/accepted-but-not-proved cervical cancer precursors by 17 percent. The partial- effective claims in Merck’s reports make all Merck’s claims outright suspect. However, if we understand the first and second considerations above, the third is an absurd consideration regardless of test-results (that appear to be contrived).
Any state official that adopts such a mandatory program is completely misled and ignorant of biological facts and the predatory, greedy nature of big pharma, or is simply an opportunist with interest in big pharma. They are dooming girls to reproductive and other diseases from the toxic substances that are in those vaccines. Power coupled with ignorance is dangerous to the public in our present industrial capitalistic political government.
The Beijing News and China Daily news reported this month that villager Jiang Musheng eats live tree frogs and rats to boost health. Sixty-six-years young Mr. Musheng stated that 40 years of eating live tree frogs and rats helped him avoid intestinal complaints and made him strong. He had suffered frequent
abdominal pains and coughing until age 26 when an old man suggested raw tree frogs as remedy. After only one month of eating live baby rats, up to 20 daily, and tree frogs, his stomach pains and cough were completely eliminated.

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from cooking or industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi- monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!
Is Raw Chocolate Made From Whole Raw Cocoa Beans Addictive Or Harmful?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition (Chocolate recipes at end of this article.)
   Very recently, I received an email condemning cooked, processed or raw cocoa beans as dangerous. The email claimed that it "greatly shortens [animals'] life span if it doesn't kill them immediately" when forced fed cocoa beans. All of that information was exaggerated and seems made-up according to my research. What animals were forced to eat raw cocoa beans that it "greatly" shortened their lives or immediately killed them?
Humans are animals. I know thousands of people who eat raw cocoa and not one has died or gotten sick from it thus far. The email claimed that no tribal people eat it yet Kuna Indians of Panama consume about 3 cups of cocoa brew daily. The email also claimed that aflatoxins (byproducts of molds), hair and rodent feces found in chocolate were highly toxic and would add to disease and early death. Aflatoxins are lowest in beans and highest in grains such as wheat, rye, corn, and peanuts. Therefore, it would be much more dangerous to eat breads, pastas, cereals, peanut butters and any manufactured grain product. The feces and hair issue is true of all almost all processed foods. Cooked and processed chocolate products are subject to industrial cooking and
processes. Whole raw cocoa beans used to make raw chocolate recipes are not intrinsically problematic when eaten in moderation.
The email claimed that raw cocoa caused the most problems and was extremely addictive. When I was a cooked-food consumer, I was addicted to chocolate, cigarettes, coffee, alcohol, and speed (methamphetamines). Because I was so ill with chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, angina and diabetes, I consumed chocolate, coffee and amphetamines and smoked cigarettes to produce energy. From all of that, by evening I was so jittery and nervous that I had to drink about a bottle of gin or bourbon nightly to sleep. On SAD (Standard American Diet), I had a very addicted personality and bodily need for all of those products in order for me to function.
Since I have been on my Primal Diet for many years, I have no addictions. I had many strong cravings because my body was deficient in many nutrients but I could eat several foods on my Primal Diet to satisfy those deficiencies. Since I have been making my homemade chocolate from whole raw cocoa beans blenderized with raw egg, raw fat (mostly unsalted raw butter and a little raw cream)

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
and unheated honey, I have not experienced any addiction to it. I have eaten the mixture about 10 times yearly for 2 years. That certainly could not be called an addiction. Usually, I eat it only when people make it for me as a gift. Even though I enjoy it immensely, I have not craved it but once.
I remember when, 38 years ago, I first began eating the same combination made with raw carob pods instead of raw cocoa beans. I craved it to the point that someone could have called it an addiction. However, since carob does not have any addictive chemicals in it, it could not have been an addiction. Consider instead that my body craved all of that butter mixed with some cream, protein in eggs and digestive enzymes in honey. When my body had had certain deficiencies satisfied intensely and repeatedly for about 3 months, the craving subsided. My skin, nerves and entire body were much healthier.
I discovered many times that when deficiencies are satisfied, intense cravings vanish. Most people who crave raw chocolate to the point of wanting it daily are people who are very deficient in raw fats and the egg-proteins and honey enzymes help to digest those needed fats.
Most beans are not directly physical health-giving substances for humans. The caster (from which caster oil derives) and soy are health-damaging, especially in their raw state. Even cooked, caster beans may cause death from eating them. Commercially, soy must be chemically processed and heat-treated to prevent sickness and/or death. Fermented raw soy products are not likely to kill anyone but they are cumulatively toxic to most people when mixed with salt. Raw cocoa contains flavonoids (antioxidants), strengthens blood pressure, heart and vascular system improving circulation, glucose metabolism and eye sight.
The email claimed that theobromine, caffeine and theophyline, raw, processed or cooked were "known to produce permanent degenerative alterations in cellular protoplasm." In micro amounts, raw theobromine, caffeine and theophyline stimulate creative thought processes and do not cause diseases. The only safe bean from which to get those are the cocoa when it is raw. Cocoa beans eaten excessively may cause hunger or nausea, demineralization that sometimes results in loosened teeth and pain in jaw and around teeth, acidic and sore tongue, headaches, hyperactivity, lack of focus and clarity plus insomnia. I have only seen those symptoms when people ate 1⁄2
cup or more daily for several days of the chocolate mixture, undiluted in milk, cheesecake or other recipe. Some people who over-ate raw chocolate became immune to those side effects and continued to overeat it, asymptomatically.
Most people on a raw diet could consume safely about 2 tablespoons of pure cocoa beans weekly blenderized with raw egg, 6 tablespoons of raw fat and some unheated honey without any harm. Eating it only occasionally, they might benefit with increased energy, mental activity and creativity as well as the physical benefits mentioned earlier.

If Most Published Medical Studies Are Biased and/or Corrupt,
Why Do We Still Believe Them? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Over the last decade, investigational studies found that doctors who participated in pharmaceutical-company-sponsored drug trials more often prescribed that company's drugs, and that clinical trials funded by pharma companies more often reported favorably for the drug. Many “scientists” failed to disclose their financial ties to the pharmaceutical industry and wrote biased and/or junk scientific determinations of trials that were published. In an attempt to harness such corruption, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) made its conflict-of-interest policy more stringent. (Journal of the American Medical Association July 12, 2006; 296(2): 220-221.) However, with the many ways to hide financial transactions, it is not likely to stop much of the medical/pharma corruption.
JAMA’s tougher policy seems to be a responsive twitch to the news that 13 authors of a published scientific paper about an antidepressant were paid by the manufacturer. The article stressed adverse health
effects on pregnant women who stopped taking the antidepressant. The lead author received funding from at least eight pharma companies. That was just one of many conflicts of interest that had been an issue for articles in JAMA.
Considering that all drugs are non-biochemical constructions of laboratory chemicals, they all create side effects, usually long-term as well as short. Consider that all hormone and hormone replacement drugs are made of laboratory chemicals. The so- called natural hormones are not natural at all. They have no relationship to hormones in our bodies. At best, the so-called natural hormones are made from hydrogenated vegetable oils that have the same molecular structure as plastic, and from chemically treated proteins, such as from soy. The only thing that was natural about them is that some of the ingredients were derived from food. However, after processing, they are far from natural and nothing is left but chemicals of varying toxicity.

Considering Chemotherapy As An Option For Cancer?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
I endured 3 months of chemotherapy that was the final straw that crippled me for many years. The 10- weeks radiation therapy cauterized my spine and caused Multiple Myeloma as well as spinal and back pain for about 25 years until I perfected my diet and was on it long enough to detoxify and heal sufficiently. As I have reported many times since the treatments nearly 40 years ago, I continued intermittently to detoxify chemo and radiation damage. Several times after tasting the chemotherapy during detoxifications, I had my saliva, vomit and diarrhea examined for the chemotherapy I was administered, AZT. All tests were positive for many of the compounds that constitute AZT. Those tests proved that my body still harbored chemo that was etched, burned and/or absorbed into cells within my body. Many doctors refuted my claims. Also note that a year after I received AZT, it was discontinued because it was determined to be too dangerous for cancer patients.
Finally, a UCLA study (Breast Cancer Research and Treatment September 29, 2006) showed that chemotherapy changes blood flow and metabolism in the brain. Positron emission tomography scanned brains of 21 women who had undergone breast cancer surgery 5-10 years earlier. Sixteen of the 21
had been treated with chemotherapy. Thirteen control subjects without breast cancer or chemotherapy were scanned. Scans were performed during short-term memory exercises, and while they rested. Since the study only focused on women who had had chemotherapy at a maximum of 10 years earlier, the study does not reveal that chemotherapy lingers for many decades after treatment, as in my case.
Rapid jumps in activity in the frontal cortexes and cerebellums of the chemotherapy patients indicated that they worked harder than the control patients to recall the same information. Also revealed in the study, women who underwent hormonal therapy as well as chemotherapy showed changes to their basal ganglia, where brain function bridges thought and action.
If considering chemotherapy, consider that science has not proved chemotherapy any more effective than doing nothing for cancer. Also, consider that the long-term effects from “trying” chemotherapy reduce the quality of life mentally, physically, emotionally and possibly spiritually.
Alternative therapies for cancer can be found in my books and in the article following about mice spermatogonial stem cells.
  Science has taken about 20 years since Playboy magazine issued its report on nutritional value and benefits of sperm to drop its public moral block and explore semen. At Howard Hughes Medical Research, scientists have been experimenting with stem cells from mice sperm. They found that those adult stem cells can morph like embryonic stem cells.
For those who may not understand what stem cells can do, I will give you a crash explanation. Stem cells are basically growth cells. Embryonic and adult spermatogonial and marrow stem cells can morph into any cellular structure within our bodies, from toe nails to heart cells, from bone to brain. Normally, adult stem cells cannot morph into any other cellular

type than those to which they are RNA/DNA-specific but spermatogonial (ScienceDaily – Howard Hughes Medical Research) and some marrow adult stem cells can with a little help, scientists say.
Occasionally, I experimented with sperm as a remedy for various skin maladies. Applied directly to skin, I have seen sperm revitalize skin, follicles, eyes and lips; I have seen it remove wrinkles slowly when applied once or twice weekly.
About a year ago, I was exposed to rat poison for several weeks without realizing it. I developed a tumor on the back of my left hand under the skin that grew rapidly to 1.6” diameter. I applied the following individually or in combination with 1-2% shrinkage of tumor with daily application: coconut cream, honey, lime and/or lemon juices, papaya and pineapple. I thought that since I consumed my Primal Diet for over 24 years, it should be dissolving quicker. I thought about all of the amazing changes that occur in stem-cell research and I wanted to try it with cancer. The only place for me to get fresh stem
cells was from sperm. Twice weekly, I used my sperm on the tumor and it shrunk by 3-5% with each application. Those results indicate to me that the sperm is unusually therapeutic. As nerve cells reproduce on the PD but not the SAD, I could reasonably conjecture that sperm developed on the PD may be exceptionally therapeutic.
I supposed that the quality of my sperm was excellent since I have been eating 99,9999% raw for 35 years and eating raw meat for 31 years. However, I do not know scientifically if the quality of spermatogonial cells is significantly improved by diet except that in a Petri dish, my sperm lived 1-5 days rather than 0-3 days. Ova may have the same properties but they would be difficult to extract.
A caution must be considered. Sperm may contain toxins, especially caustic metals that stored in the testes because testes are fat-rich. Our bodies normally store toxins in fat, wherever it may be found. If sperm smells metallic or like a hot old steam iron, I suggest that it not be used for therapy.
Until my next issue, I wish you happiness along with radiant health.

Theory; Why Mercury Is Not Absorbed When We Eat Raw Fish
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
   Question: I was interested in Aajonus' theory that we do not absorb the mercury from raw fish, but do with cooked fish. Why do fish which have eaten fish (raw) test high for mercury? Also, I have read stories of big sushi eaters complaining of mercury issues. Thanks,
Teresa
Hi, Teresa,
As I mentioned in my Spring 2007 newsletter,
there could be several reasons that mercury is not absorbed when we eat it raw. Usually, I do not like to theorize on reality because my theory could be wrong. Many people think because a theory is wrong, reality is also. Because the “roosters’-crowing- caused-sunrise” theory was wrong, the sun did not stop rising. With that said, here is my theory:
Little fish eat substances containing mercury. The bodies of those fish try their best to prevent damage from that mercury by depositing it in fat. Each fish that eats those fish further isolates and controls contamination and injury by producing more
complex fats. By the time it gets to our plate, it is so contained in that fat that our bodies either cannot digest it or our bodies are able to identify the mass and choose not to digest it. Either way, we do not absorb very much, if any, of the mercury.
When laboratories test anything, first they use solvents to dissolve the substance tested. When fish have been dissolved and tested, tests reveal the amount of mercury contained in that fish, but it does not evaluate how much damage the mercury may have done to the fish prior to fat-isolation.
As I said in my Spring 2007 issue, cooking completely fractionates those fat molecules and releases the mercury. Our bodies absorb the mercury. Therefore, eating cooked fish that is high in mercury contaminates us with mercury.
Your final statement that seems to give foundation to the probability that sushi eaters absorb mercury may not be such evidence. Consider that most human mercury-poisoning in our modern advanced society originates from vaccines, other injections and applying Mercurochrome and Merthiolate (liquid

mercury used as “medicinal” antiseptics). Until recently, the mercury from one injection equates to the mercury found in about 4,000 pounds of cooked swordfish. Most vaccines and other injections have the equivalent of the mercury found in 3,300 pounds of fish. I believe that our government blames fish- eating for most mercury-poisoning because they are
trying to distract us from the real cause: medication. The government is protecting the pharmaceutical and medical industries, not us. Is it intentional harm for profit and to maintain the status quo or is there a reason more sinister? That is for everyone concerned to investigate.
Question: I began eating raw meat a year ago, and I would say about 85% has been red meat, the rest fish and fowl. In Asheville there are some very nice local farms that sell grass fed beef, so I've been living almost exclusively on that. After listening to a presentation by Dr. Mercola, I was concerned about the iron levels.
Richard Kent
Hi, Richard,
Dr. Mercola speaks from a theoretical view rather
than empirical. That theory has little basis in reality. Several healthy tribes eat almost exclusively raw red meat and do not have iron problems. An iron problem can develop when eating a lot of cooked red meat because much of the iron is rendered “free-radical” because of the cooking process. Often, the free
radical iron can bind with bioactive iron and cause a bioactive iron deficiency and toxic free radical iron level. Also consider that much of the absorbed free- radical iron that is not properly isolated in fat rusts in the body. That further causes toxic excessive iron problems.
Also, if our bodies try to discard contaminated free-radical iron deposits, a high toxic iron level will show up in blood and possibly urine and feces. Raw meat-eating may help our bodies detoxify toxic iron deposits but does not cause toxic iron levels.
High consumption of red meat, however, could be a problem for hyperactive individuals who do not exercise enough because red meat often stimulates adrenaline production which can cause irritability and hyperactivity. In such a case, fish and fowl are preferable.
Question: The Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) is in the news a lot. Could you tell the newsletter subscribers what you know about this, such as what it helps detox, etc?
And if it is beneficial, where I can get some? :-). Ross
Hi, Ross,
Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus is a
type of staphylococcus bacterium that does not succumb to ampicillin and other penicillins.
Staphylococci are a natural part of healthy people. Usually, they are aerobic, meaning they live on the surface exposed to air. They can be located on the skin and in nasal passages. Like some varieties of salmonella, they eat dead skin and ultra microscopic skin mites.
If an individual suffers an injury involving skin, staphylococci may colonize to consume the massive amount of damaged and killed cells and waste. Then our bodies only have to neutralize and discard staphylococci waste, which is a fraction of the

Our Ubiquitous Microbial Friends

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
damaged and dead cell-mass that we would have had to dissolve and discard. Another result of no staphylococci is that after injury, our bodies would have to mummify many injured dead cells instead of dissolving and discarding those dead cells; the result would be scar tissue. If staphlylococci did not assist in that process, we would likely develop a massive scar. Because so many people eat toxic processed and cooked food and imbalanced diets, when their skin suffers injury, they are unlikely to detoxify and heal the wound(s) properly. That could cause staphylococci to feast for months or years at the site of the wound or anywhere else on the skin where dead cells are discarded. In warm and humid climates, staphylococci are much healthier. Unless an
injured person eats correctly, staphylococci may linger for years doing their job.
Regarding the issue of where you can obtain staphylococcus: They are a natural part of skins and mucous cells. They can breed easily from your dead skin. If you bathe with typical poisonous soaps and fluoridated water, you will not have many colonies of helpful staphylococci. The idea that people get sick from staphylococcal bacteria is nonsense. The problem is the injury, how toxic the wound is from foreign compounds, especially industrial chemicals, and whether we have the nutrients to properly cleanse the area of tissue damage and the waste of staphylococcus.
Question: I do not think that just this one article “Nice Shot”could change your mind about vaccines but what do you think.
Scott
Hi, Scott,
On October 10, 2007 The New York Times published an article by Gary Taxali reviewing the book Nice Shot by Jessica Snyder Sachs. The review was not really a review but hashing support for Sachs’ view that we should give our children flu shots. In his article, he berates parents for shunning flu shots for their children. He argues that we cannot become naturally immune to certain bacteria. He further argues that allowing particular sicknesses, such as flu and pneumonia, to run their course weakens children and makes them more prone to worse diseases later. He states, “health agencies have expanded their flu shot recommendations to include all children ages 6 months to 5 years in addition to adults over age 50, and anyone, child or adult, with a chronic condition like severe allergies, asthma or diabetes.” The rest of the article lays the ground to support it unequivocally.
To even consider that his arguments should be accepted as basis to get our children, or anyone injected with flu vaccines is nonsense. Viruses are not alive and always changing. Viruses that exist in one person are not the same in another, and viruses change completely within a person about 72 hours. Therefore, the idea that flu vaccines are efficacious is
absurd. It takes about 18 months to manufacture, market, promote and distribute one type of flu vaccine. Therefore, the vaccine is obsolete 18 months before there are plans to create a flu vaccine. If flu vaccines had any efficacy, they would have to be available within days of that particular virus being produced within our bodies. In either case, there is no scientific proof that flu vaccines create immunity from anything.
There is evidence though that vaccines are very harmful. Many people, especially children have severe reactions to vaccines, such as colds, flu, complete paralysis, hepatitis, pneumonia and death. Yet, Sachs and Taxali argue that to let pneumonia run its course is ignorant, idiotic, dangerous and irresponsible. Neither mentions all of the poisonous substances in all vaccines, such as liquid methyl mercury, aluminum, ether, formaldehyde and detergents. The quantity may vary but some or all of those substances are in all vaccines, including flu vaccines. What educated parent with knowledge about those toxins is going to believe the rhetoric from the industries that profit from vaccines, that flu shots are ultimately good for anyone, especially children?
How many of you would watch me dump a bunch of rotten eggs with disease into a blender with the neurotoxin methyl mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether and detergents, blend them and offer it to your children, elderly parents and you as a preventative for flu? Who would drink it and allow

their loved ones to drink it? Who thinks that we have better chances with microbes, with which humans have interacted for at least 4 million years, rather than a blatant soup of poisons? Natural immunity should always be our choice.
Until my next issue, I wish you happiness along with radiant health.

SUBSCRIBER’S QUESTION:
View on Medical Establishment
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
 How should we view medical establishment, include- ing in government?
Max
Hi, Max,
Understand that medical procedural manuals are
written by large pharmaceutical companies who have vested interests in everyone receiving drugs. All drugs are foreign chemicals that have side effects, usually gradually as they accumulate in the body. Doctors believe that microbes instead of chemical contaminants cause most diseases.
If that were true, humans would not have thrived for at least 4 million years. Now, most people do not thrive but linger through a long life with poor health. We have many more diseases than we had 100 years ago. We have cities of drugs and no cures. The world needs to get a grip on reality and face the fact that industrial pollution especially medical drugs cause most of our diseases. Health departments are run by doctors or medically biased people who continue the microbes-cause-disease myth that poisons our food
supply in the name of sanitation. They order us to contaminate our food with chemicals that kill helpful bacteria and poison our cells.
There are no natural microbes that cause disease. Vomit and diarrhea are not diseases but means to detoxify a poisoned condition, ultimately preventing disease. Every epidemic of food-poisoning is from a reaction to a food additive that mixed in a volatile way with manufactured cooked and processed foods. Microbes are never the cause of diarrhea or vomit. Example: One of my patients experienced many weeks of vomit and some diarrhea. I had one of her vomits chemically analyzed. In that mere 4 ounces of vomit was 3,000 times the toxic dose of thallium, which is many time the lethal amount of thallium.
Our bodies are marvelous creatures and should be trusted when vomit and diarrhea occur. We should not attack them with antibiotics and other medical nonsense because prejudiced minds tell us microbes are the cause. Many microbes are our janitors, not monsters that intend to kill us.

Most cutting boards are made of 1 to 1.5 inches strips of wood glued together, including bamboo. Many of them use formaldehyde-based glues. Cutting anything on those boards results in cutting the boards a tiny bit each time. Each time, tiny particles of wood and glue are released into your food. Wood is relatively indigestible but glues and the polymers that harden them dissolve in our digestive tracts, enter our body’s systems and poison us a little bit each time.
Ninety-five percent of all diseases are caused by gradually accumulating toxins until they cause enough damage, then symptoms of disease result. All glues are toxic even if they are glued with food-grade glues. “Food-grade glue” is a misnomer and fraud. here are no food-grade glues that are completely non- toxic. No one in their health-conscious mind would purposely add food-grade glue to meals.
Plastic cutting boards are made of many toxic compounds especially carcinogenic PCBs and dioxins. In the development of plastics, before plastics became useable as a household staple instead of metals and wood, plastics became moldy within 3- 12 months. Plastics were then unstable.
Industry created many carcinogenic chemicals to prevent molds from permeating and destabilizing plastics, and introduced known carcinogenic compounds into plastic to prevent molds. Plastics have created more pollution per weight and volume than any other widely used product, polluting our air, water, land and food. Cutting anything on those
boards releases those toxins into food and poisons our bodies.
Safe cutting boards would be boards made of one piece of hard wood. Such pre-made boards are available for grilling and flavoring while cooking. However, when used on raw food for cutting and preparing, they do not flavor food. It takes heating the wood to very high temperatures to release wood oils to flavor food. Such boards are usually no larger than 8 x 12 inches. The chain stores Sur la Table sell such grilling boards that are smooth on one side and rough on the other. Cutting should be done on the smooth side to prevent splinters from entering our food.
Another option would be to visit a hardwood or lumber store and obtain a board that is at least 12 x 18 inches on which to cut small and large foods. Often, hardwood and lumber yards will have scrap wood that will work wonderfully. Be certain that you get a hardwood, otherwise your cutting-board will dry and split and sometimes splinters will be a feature of your cuisine.
Cutting boards should be oiled every 2-3 months with safe eatable oil, an oil that has not been heated over 96° F, preventing them from cracking and eventual breaking. I use coconut oil on mine. However, olive oil is safe to use. It is best to give your board several coats of oil and one day to absorb the oil before using it.

Bruises, Injuries and Pain - Do We Apply Ice Or Heat?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Everyone everywhere advises that bruises, injuries and pain should be treated with ice to reduce swelling. Firstly, consider that swelling increases circulation of nutrients to the area to cleanse damaged tissue, including cells, and heal the area. What sense does it make to reduce swelling when reducing swelling reduces nutrients and consequently reduces cleansing and healing.
Most often, when swelling and nutrients are reduced by applying ice, blood clots and scarring
result. Scarring is dead mummified cells that are useless for creating energy and activity. Dead cells are dead bricks in the walls. Scar tissue reduces flexibility, agility and stamina. Most athletes who sustain an injury apply ice packs to reduce swelling and numb pain. They never heal properly and sustain multiple injuries to the same area. Many athletes’ careers end because of such improperly cleansed and poorly healed injuries. Besides poor diets, their careers are cut short by the application of ice packs.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
Applying HEAT is the best remedy for bruises, injuries and pain. Heat promotes relaxation of bones, cartilage, tendons, arteries, veins, muscles, nerves, connective tissue and skin, allowing even more nutrients into the area for increased and rapid healing. Heat also reduces pain that comes from pressure on the nerves in a tense area of the body, incurring swelling.
Once the area is heated, surrounding tissues relax and pain reduces considerably. Relaxing, stretching and expanding the space between tissues with heat, relieves pain. When applying heat, sometimes tendons, cartilage and ligaments take 5-15 minutes to relax and pain may temporarily increase until those tissues relax and expand. However, usually 85% of pain is relieved within 15 minutes of heat application.
However, if pain does not reduce to bearable, it is okay to apply ice for 1 minute or less without causing blood clots. Then reapply hot-water bottle. Alternat- ing heat and ice may be effective as long as the application of ice is less than 1 minute.
Since heating pads produce very high electro- magnetic fields that alter the molecular structure of
animal cells, heating pads should not be used. Microwave packs deliver radiation with their heat and alter the molecular structure of animal cells and should not be used.
The safe heating apparatus is a rubber hot-water bottle. Non-rubber, synthetic hot-water bottles have less integrity and easily burst, wetting couches, lounges, chairs and beds. Rubber hot water bottles last for many years. Since new rubber has a strong odor that many people think unpleasant, placing the hot-water bottle outside in the sun for about 3 weeks reduces or eliminates rubber odor.
The temperature of hot water bottles for contact with bruises, injuries and pain should not make skin feel burned. If you want to use hot-water-bottle heat throughout the night, heat will generate longer the hotter the hot-water bottle but wrap the hot-water bottle in a towel or flannel pillow case to prevent burn. Bruises, injuries and pain that receive heat will cleanse and heal properly and quickly without scar- ring if the diet is health-giving. If not on a health- giving diet, heat will still improve cleansing and healing.
My following testimonial gives details about what to do after a serious accident in a foreign country, including how to handle hospitals and doctors.
March 9, 2007, I decided to drive a heavy Harley Davidson motorcycle in a small town in Thailand. I had not ridden such a large motorcycle since 1968. I thought that I would be safe in a small town but a group of 5 tourists stepped into the street about 20 feet in front of me without looking first. There were no intersection, crossing, drive or other signs but they crossed the street carelessly.
There were cars on my right, so I could not pull to that lane and avoid hitting the pedestrians. Although I was traveling only 18 miles per hour, I did not have the experience to know how to avoid hitting them. I slammed on the brakes and skidded sideways toward them. The motorcycle fell onto the pavement on top of my right leg.
The bike did not have a leg bar to prevent injury, so when the motorcycle hit pavement, my leg was caught between the cycle and pavement. The cycle pulled my leg with it while the pavement worked opposite the momentum and pulled my thigh and hip away from my lower leg.
My right tibia was split from the knee to mid-shin. The backside of the tibia bone had a wedged space about 1/8-inch wide. Skin, muscle and bone were scraped by the asphalt from my right palm, wrist, forearm, elbow, upper arm, back, outside knee, lower leg, ankle and foot. I was lying on the street in excruciating pain for about 15 minutes.
The pain was relentless to the point that I thought my leg had been torn from me at my knee. It took me about 1.5 minutes after the accident before I looked to see if my leg was attached to my body. It was, but looked mangled at the knee.
Abrasions, Fractures and Breaks
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page
I refused to go to hospital. I paid a canopy-covered pickup taxi driver to transport me to my hotel. I cleaned my wounds with lime juice and coated them with coconut cream and honey. I did not have any gauze to cover and protect them so I left them open to air. About twp hours after the accident, the pain had not subsided. Normally, I would not have sought medical help but I thought that my knee had been dislocated because it was mangled and excruciatingly painful. I went to the hospital to have my leg realigned.
At the hospital, physicians refused to do anything until I had x-rays. I agreed to only two x-rays, top and outside views of the knee and connecting bones. After x-ray analysis, doctors said that they needed to reunite the two tibia segments and pin them together. Portions of the top of the tibia broke, splintered and logged into the femur joint concave. Doctors said that if they did not perform surgery and remove the fragments, I would never walk.
Tendons on both sides of my knee had been torn completely from the bone at opposite ends of each tendon, causing lumps the size of golf balls. Doctors said that they had to reattach them or I would never be able to lift my leg at the knee. The chief osteo- surgeon planned to cut the outside of my right leg from the ankle to the hip, including muscles, reunite the tibia and pin it with 6-10 metal screws, scrape the tibia bone fragments from the femur knee joint, reattach the knee tendons and stitch the leg incision.
They wanted to call in a plastic surgeon to graft skin from my buttocks and left thigh to my hand, arm, elbow and leg. Since my leg was not dislocated, I declined medical assistance, saying I was on a diet that could heal it without surgery. The main surgeon winced at my insane-to-him statement. I told them that if I could not walk in 6 weeks, I would return for their help. That placated the chief surgeon because he was certain that I would need help. I did not request nor did they offer to apply a cast.
I returned to the hotel and ate a slightly different diet regimen. Instead of enjoying several small portions of different unripe fruits for my once-daily fruit meal, to help bone-healing I made a mixture of 1 cup pineapple, 3/4 cup coconut cream, 1/2 cup honey and 1 cup raw milk. I drank some of that every 3-4 hours, eating about 2 tablespoons of cheese prior to each time I drank the mixture. That regimen helped cleanse and restructure my bones and naturally mend my tendons. Plus, I drank 1 quart of raw milk daily.
Because I was in the tropics and did not use air- conditioning, my meat intake was less than I eat while I'm in temperate climates. I found that most people need less meat in tropical climates if drinking enough milk. My girlfriend shopped and prepared my food for me, and helped tend my wounds.
For my abrasions where skin, muscle and a little bone were scraped from my right palm, arm, back, leg and foot, I gently applied lime juice for 3 minutes. That stung terribly. Without rinsing the lime juice from the wound, I gently applied a thin layer of coconut cream. That also stung. After that, I or my girlfriend gently applied a layer of unheated honey which also stung. We moistened cotton gauze with coconut cream and coated one side with 1/32-inch layer of raw butter to prevent my wounds from drying and gauze from sticking to my many abrasions. We loosely wrapped the leg with an Ace bandage.
I experienced severe pain regularly. Any movement increased pain. I used hot water bottles to increase circulation which increased swelling and ensured increased nutrient flow to injuries. The heat also allowed every thing to relax. Pain subsided but never disappeared. Sometimes I woke to such excruciating pain that I immersed myself in a very warm bath that relaxed my entire body and I could cope with the pain relatively easily. Many times I ate unheated honey/butter mixture to reduce pain. Other times, I ate about 2 inches of unripe banana with 2 tablespoons raw butter to reduce pain.
I urinated in bottles so that I would not have to travel to the bathroom. When I went to the bathroom, I traveled from my bed to the bathroom door in a wheelchair, and from the door to the toilet or bathtub with crutches. I had to sit at one end of the tub, lift my injured leg with my hands, place my leg onto the side of the tub, adjust my body, then lift my leg with my hands and ease it into the tub. For about 2 weeks, the pain was sometimes excruciating.
Several times daily, usually at night, I awoke moaning or screaming. Three times I cried. The only pain relievers I consumed were honey/butter mixture and banana butter combination that usually took effect in minutes. When experiencing excruciating pain, most of the time I immediately made the challenging journey to the bathtub then immersed myself in relaxing and pain-relieving warm water.
Because my right hip and buttock had sustained major bruises, I mainly lied on my left buttocks and

hip. I kept my leg raised with pillows, especially one under my knee to reduce stress at the knee. Having to sustain all of my body’s prone weight on the bed every minute that I was not in the bathtub, my left buttock and hip quickly became very sore. Because of that, for the first 2 weeks, I spent about 6 hours daily, 1-2 hours at a time in the bathtub with sea salt and 2 cups coconut cream that made my body buoyant, taking most of the pressure off my prone body and almost completely relieving my agony. Occasionally, I sat in my wheel chair for up to 30 minutes. After several weeks, I sat in my wheel chair up to 2 hours working on my computer at a desk.
Because raw milk was hard to get and coconut cream was very easy to acquire and cheap in Thailand, I used coconut cream. In the USA, I would have used raw milk in the bath instead of coconut cream.
An interesting phenomenon began the day after the accident. Gradually over the next 5 days, my large right thigh muscles considerably diminished to the size of my calve. From my ankle to mid-thigh, my right leg correspondingly hardened like bone that provided a natural cast, protecting my leg.
Baths and changing bandages
Within 10 days my tendons had completely re- grown and reconnected. However, my greatest pain continued to be at the points where the tendons had torn from my knee. Pain traveled from one injured sight to another. On the tenth day, I was able to leave the hotel and walked with crutches without exerting any weight on the leg. On the 12th day, I convinced the hotel owner that she could reduce the chlorine in the pool without causing algae problems to pool surfaces. She agreed and I walked at the deepest end of the pool where my body was so buoyant that my leg received very little pressure from my bodyweight.
After five days the water was green with algae without affecting the pool surfaces but the hotel

owner resumed full chlorine treatment. At that 16th- day, I was able to walk with crutches across the street and sandy beach to the sea. I walked about one mile in the sea twice daily at 7 am and 5:30 pm, about 1.5 hours each, exercising my leg. At that time, I had only about 19% body fat (I like to maintain 22-25%). From the accident, I lost about 15 pounds. Nineteen percent body fat was enough to make my body buoyant, reducing my body weight in water to about 1/4. I experienced pain but not severely.
Within 6 weeks, I walked on land without crutches with some pain mainly in the knee. After 6.5 weeks in that hotel room, I returned to the USA. I resumed my larger meat consumption and drank up to 1.5 quarts of raw milk daily. Within 2 months, my body fat level was up to 22%. If I had let the doctors commit surgery, they would have cut my leg from the ankle to the hip, cut away muscle, and severed connective tissue and other tendons to get into the knee socket.
I have seen many people with similar surgeries. The leg on which surgery had been performed is thinner than the other, with atrophied muscles and huge scars. Those people and others who have had less knee/leg surgery than was intended for me have not completely healed after 7 - 25 years. Since I refused surgeries, the only work my body had to do was cleanse and repair the damage, not recover from unnecessary invasive surgeries that cause 2-5 times more damage than the original injuries. The natural cast that my body seemed to form from my thigh muscles gradually softened and my thigh muscles returned correspondingly.
It has been one year since the accident. Although I cannot completely straighten my right leg at the knee, three weeks ago on a beach on Antigua island, I sprinted about 200 yards painlessly. If I run up steps 2 steps at a time, I experience a little pain in the knee. At my present rate of repair, my leg should be able to completely straighten within 4 months more.

How Do Electromagnetic Fields Affect Us?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition (Remedies are in the last 3 paragraphs prior to references.)
 We have made electricity an integral part of our lives. Because of it, we constantly bombard ourselves with electromagnetic fields (EMFs). EMFs emit waves of neutrons and protons that exchange and change the molecular structures of most biological substances within their ranges. Electromagnetic fields are measured in gauss. Scientists proved that animal cells exposed to EMFs above 3 gauss altered the molecular structure of those cells. In animal cells, EMFs created an imbalance in the electron/proton balance of the atoms, ultimately altering the molecular structure and behavior of cells. In too many circumstances, fragmentation of electrons occurred and the effects were similar to huge meteors striking Earth.
In my subjective and objective experiences, high EMF exposure caused various symptoms: tinnitus, hyper-allergic, hypersensitivity, soreness, hyperac- tiveity, ADD, ADHD, and even anger, joint soreness, muscle soreness or tightness and/or fatigue, insomnia, nausea and chronic fatigue. Radiation toxicity has many similar symptoms.
My awareness of EMFs dawned on me in 1993 after purchasing my first laptop computer at the same time that I moved into an old cottage house in
Venice, California. I began having pains in my hands, wrists and elbows that mimicked carpal-tunnel syndrome and early bone cancer. I recalled not getting carpal tunnel when I used my old manual typewriter on which I had typed and retyped 7 screenplays and 3 books. Typing on a manual typewriter put a lot of friction on the fingers and wrists but no one got carpal-tunnel. Plus, govern- ment, industry and media told us that EMFs do not cause carpal-tunnel or any harm.
I thought maybe I was experiencing another detoxifi- cation in my bones from radiation therapy I received many years before (that caused my bone and blood cancers). Were they returning? The pain continued for weeks. Before I decided on a remedy, I hired an environmental expert to see if something in my new home were toxic.
He arrived with several types of gadgets to measure radon, electromagnetic, electrical and radiation fields. He found one improperly grounded electrical outlet in my bedroom but it was too far from the bed to cause harm. After exhausting all possibilities with construction and location, he spotted my laptop on my desk and asked me to turn it on. He held his meter 1⁄4 inch above the keyboard.

The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 5 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 The meter jumped to 85 gauss over the F11 and F12 keys. When typing on the keyboard, my right hand and wrist received from 23-85 gauss, depending on hard-disk activity. My left hand received 23-50 gauss. Farthest point of lower gauss-registration was 7 inches from the bottom of the laptop.
He suggested I get a separate keyboard, plug it into the laptop and keep the top of the keyboard at least 6 inches from bottom of the computer. Skeptically, I bought and used a separate keyboard. Amazingly, within 2 days, all of the discomfort and pain disappeared. Several times during the next year when I traveled, I did not take my separate keyboard, thinking that the few hours that I would type on my laptop would not cause harm or pain. I was wrong. Within 1 hour, my hands felt a little swollen, slightly prickly with some joint discomfort. When I returned to using the separate keyboard, the symptoms disappeared within 48 hours. My present model of Acer laptop has a higher EMF field so I must keep the top of my separate keyboard 9.5 inches from the bottom of the laptop.
Epidemiological studies by Maria Feychting of Sweden showed that people exposed to high EMFs at home and work had 3.7 times greater risk of developing leukemia compared to people who were not exposed.
Other things we use for longer than 3 minutes at a time that can negatively alter our cells with very high EMFs are hair dryers, vibrators, electrical and radio clocks, electric blankets and pads including therapy pads, electrical shavers, water beds, vibration chairs and beds, fluorescent lights, microwave ovens, Jacuzzis and hot tubs, computer towers, exterior hard drives, backup units, printers, copiers, infrared and bluetooth mice, telephones especially cellular and bluetooth, electrical transformers and voltage regulators on anything including computer peri- pherals and laptops, sound equipment especially most speakers, and automobiles. Anything that is electrical including battery operated toys emits EMFs.
The EMFs in electrical cars including hybrids are extreme, especially in the driver’s seat from the pedals to 5 inches above seats. In certain hybrids where there is a large battery unit under the rear seat or trunk (Honda), EMFs in the back seats where we sit our children are worst. Also, cars with complex computer systems have extremely high EMFs, especially in the driver’s and front passenger’s seats. The more expensive a car, the greater are EMFs because of the computer techno-logy. In airplanes
with jet engines on wings, EMFs are extremely high all the way from the cockpits through the business sections; it is best to sit in rear of those planes. If engines are on tails of planes, it is best to sit several rows before and at wings.
Electrical transformers and regulators on electrical and telephone poles create EMFs that bombard areas up to 150 ft. (45 meters). Usually, such objects are found at rears of buildings, closest to bedrooms of houses and apartments. Many apartments and hotels have their own electrical transformers and regulators. Get an apartment or room away from those objects. In hotel rooms, high EMFs frequently will be found where beds and walls meet. Often it is an electrical clock but sometimes it is wiring in walls. Pull beds away from walls where EMFs broadcast. Worst EMF-emitters are MRIs.
Some of the highest EMFs to which anyone could be subjected are Magnetic Resonance Imagings (MRIs). The main magnet discharges 75,000 gauss; remember it takes only 3 gauss to alter the molecular structure of animal cells. The MRI antennas that aim at your bodies shoot 12,000-75,000 gauss into our bodies at every moment it engages. The exposure time required to complete an accurate image with MRIs depends upon the patient and patient’s tissues being imaged.
Each image requires about 260 bombardments of EMFs and radio waves with 3-seconds delay. With each bombardment, it takes approximately 3 seconds for the cells to regain an ionic state similar to what it was prior to each bombardment before another phase of imaging can occur. If they did not delay for 3 seconds, the image would be diffused in a glow of ionic bombardment and resultant disarray. With each EMF-bombardment, cells are slightly altered, most often negatively. Usually, a patient is subjected to MRIs for at least 20 minutes. Gross cellular alterations occur in 20 minutes and proper ionic balances may never be restored unless eating a proper diet and practicing several ionic-restoring actions.
Anyone who states that MRIs are safe in the majority of patients has not studied their effects on the mole- cular and atomic levels. They merely parrot the marketing rhetoric of institutions involved in producing and utilizing MRI technology. Their statements should not be believed or trusted. To compound MRI-EMFs’ effects upon cells, sometimes contrasts are used. Injecting or swallowing metallic minerals (toxic free-radical metallic solutions) helps generate a clearer image of blood and nervous

 systems and brain but further poison the body. Any statements that contrasts are safe are fraudulent.
Remedies
The 100% Primal Diet, I have observed, helps to gradually improve ionic imbalances within 6 months. Consuming a vegetable-juices mixture of 30% celery, 20% carrot, 5% cilantro, 5% parsley, 5% zucchini, and 35% cucumber puree helps facilitate ionic balances. To make this juice/puree mixture, first juice everything but the cucumber. Then peel and slice the cucumbers, and blend them in a canning jar with enough vegetable juices to fill the jar. Add a little honey for preservative and blend.
To decrease ionic restoration-time while eating the Primal Diet, two primary restorative therapies should be utilized: 1) daily lying on healthy ground for minimum of 40 minutes for 4-8 weeks, and/or 2) daily long baths in healthy water for a minimum of 40 minutes for 6-8 weeks. When lying on ground, a cotton, silk or wool blanket or towel may be used. Lying on sand such as at a beach or desert also helps to rebalance our ions. (If bathing in municipal waters, adding 11⁄4 - 13⁄4 cups raw milk, 3 T. raw apple cider
vinegar and 2 T. sun-dried sea salt will neutralize the many industrial toxins in municipal waters.)
However, even with all those therapies, the original and perfect ionic balances may never be completely achieved because our bodies have been bombarded by non-organic ions which have become part of our bodies.
I have been told by several electronic engineers that it would be as easy as using transistors instead of capacitors to remedy the high EMF problem. For most products, the cost per item would increase about 50 cents to $1.

EMF Meters
I suggest that people buy EMF meters.
( www.goodemfmeter.com )I use the Tri-Field meter because it measures 3 different fields: electromagnetic, electrical and radiation (such as measuring cell phone levels). I carry mine most everywhere because I travel so much. Many times I would have accepted hotel rooms that were extremely high in EMFs and I would have been bombarded throughout my nights and days. I measure hotel rooms and if EMFs are high, I asked for another room. If no other room is available, I change hotels.
      Subscriber’s question:
More Clarity On Food-borne Bacterial Contamination
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Hello Aajonus,
I am confused about the bacterial issue with
foods. If I understand you correctly, bacteria feeding on raw foods do not cause disease but they do when feeding on cooked foods. In laboratories, I have seen the damage that bacteria and fungus have done to cells, causing them to mutate or die. How is it different? Bruce
Hi, Bruce. There are several scenarios. First,
consider environment. Bacteria and fungi infused into a fertile Petrie dish exist in an unnatural environment. Unnatural fluids and solids fertilize Petrie dishes. There are no bio-generated, self-perpetuating and naturally flowing fluids present as in eco-life forms wherein bacteria and fungi live in harmony within bodies. Cells that divide and multiply in such an unnatural environment are altered/damaged/poisoned; they frequently degenerate and/or become mutant, distinguishably or indistinguishably.

The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 7 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 Certain bacteria such as many forms of salmonella and listeria are janitors that eat damaged cells, or particular parts of damaged cells trying to generate and maintain an ecologically sustainable environment that is their role in life. Many forms of salmonella and listeria are digestive aids.
In unnatural Petrie-dish environments, all byproducts/ wastes from cells and bacteria and/or fungi remain in the Petrie-dish solution. Contrarily, in our bodies, we absorb most of that as food. In Petrie dishes, there are no natural waste removal systems wherein the wastes can evacuate, evaporate or perspire. Only mutant bacteria that are chemically forced to survive will survive. They have little relationship to the natural forms of the same species of bacteria and fungi.
Many parts of cells or specific cellular tissues are damaged and require more janitorial bacteria, fungi or parasites to consume and help eliminate much more waste. Unnaturally toxic environments created by cooked and processed diets cause vicious cycles in which all cells cannot live healthfully but instead mutate or become diseased. The behavior, chemistry and habits of those cells change. The entire chain of life inside us becomes toxic and mutant, our cells, bacteria, fungi, fluids and tissues.
More thoroughly, bacteria and fungi that feed on cooked and/or processed “foods” become diseased quicker because most food cells of those substances are bio-inactive. Also, many cooked and/or processed foods contain additives and agricultural chemicals that poison and mutate the bacteria and fungi. Digestive bacteria feeding on cooked and processed foods release much of the toxic additives. Even their byproducts that are meant to be our food become dangerously toxic. Consequently, our bodies progress slowly or quickly toward diseases, depending on the health of each individual.
When raw foods pass through a creature’s body – natural environment – digestive bacteria eat much of the food cells. They and their non-toxic waste are healthy food. It is a symbiotic relationship that allows creatures to thrive healthfully. In such healthy environments, janitorial bacteria are active only in small colonies because there is no natural toxicity.
In an animal's body, if something such as food additives poisons cells, bacterial or fungal janitors will feed on the damaged cellular tissue. Often, white blood cells enter the digestive tract and eat the toxic chemical additives and suffer death. Very often, janitorial bacteria are termed “pathogenic” because
they seemingly feed excessively on human cells. However, the extent of cellular feeding always depends on cellular damage not the opposite.
E.coli is the main type of bacteria in the bowels and is responsible for eating and digesting the final stages of our food. Their byproducts/secretions/ wastes are the richest nutrients that feed our brain and nerve cells. E.coli are responsible for the release of most of the Vitamin B complex, including B12. Naturally occurring E.coli are never disease-causing. E.coli 0157:H7 is a man-made creature that exists and grows only in unnatural environments such as when feeding on cooked/processed food with chemicals that cause mutations.
Most often diarrhea and vomit that could be associated with food-poisoning are the result of additive and agricultural chemicals being released from the food and causing sickness. If blood and intestinal fat levels are high, many of the toxins will be bound in or by fat, preventing the need for diarrhea or vomit to eliminate the dangerous chemicals. Fats chelating with chemicals prevents cellular damage, unless they are phagocytes (living fat cells, such as white blood cells). If the fats that arrest the chemicals are white blood cells, the white blood cells will often be poisoned to death.
If blood and intestinal fat levels are low, many of those chemicals could be discarded through kidneys. If the kidneys are heavily damaged, then janitorial bacteria feed heavily on damaged kidney tissue. Although it may look as if the bacteria ate and destroyed the kidneys, it was the chemicals that destroyed the kidneys. The bacteria were simply doing their best to mitigate the damage by feeding and eliminating damaged cells or parts of cells, readying the body for replacement cells.
The bacterial, fungal and parasitical misconcep- tions disseminated by the medical industry are all indoctrinated into everyone by the pharmaceutical and medical industries that make fortunes on people poisoning nature’s janitors. Our educational institutions, government and media take their sciences for granted as true and parrot the rhetoric.
If you truly realized that food additives, industrial toxins and medicines caused 98% of all diseases, you would not make pharmaceutical, medical and food industries rich. They will continue to blame bacteria to confuse you and most people are likely to fall into their fraudulent fear-trap. People will continue to feed on their nutrient deficient, additive-poisoned

 foods and contaminate their bodies with toxic drugs as therapy.
Raw foods that are non-poisonous can never cause diseases even when naturally decaying. Remember that I had all of the vagus nerves to my stomach severed over 40 years ago for stomach cancer. Therefore, I have had no stomach hydrochloric acids to kill bacteria, fungi and parasites that entered my stomach in food. I have never gotten vomit or diarrhea as direct result of an abundance of bacterially rich food that is usually called spoiled or rotten. Sometimes I ate overly fermented foods that contained so much alcohol that I vomited and/or
Subscriber’s question:
experienced diarrhea. There were times when I ate too many glands, causing a detoxification into my stomach of old toxic hormones, like adrenaline that had stored in my body. Consequently, I vomited or had diarrhea.
About 99% of vomit, diarrhea and intestinal bleeding result from chemicals and not bacteria, even in cooked food. The medicine-related and food industries are not going to test for chemicals because they would be the culprits. If we eliminated chemicals there would be no medications or food additives. There would also be gross profit losses by the medical-related industries, The food industry would lose because of short shelf-lives of most foods.
  Since Gerolsteiner Naturally Sparkling Mineral Is In Plastic, What Should I Buy?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Hi Aajonus,
Gerolsteiner recently switched to using plastic bottles in my area. It used to be my favorite wa- ter for the occasional drink, but does not
seem to taste the same in plastic containers. In light of Bisphenol A research (http://www.efluxme- dia.com/news_Report_Warns_on_Serious_Health_Prob- lems_Linked_to_Bisphenol_A_16445.html) do you rec- ommend avoiding all plastic water containers and switching brands?
Thanks,

Gerolsteiner has stopped exporting water to USA in glass. It is still exporting water to other countries in glass. Maybe that German company does not like Americans.
I have not consumed any bottled water in 3 weeks. In the week preceding, I drank 1⁄2 cup of bottled Naturally Sparkling Apollinaris water. Presently, if I were to sip a little water, it would be Apollinaris. Others are San Faustino, San Pellegrino and Perrier.

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!
Subscriber’s question: Quality or Quantity?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
 Dear Aajonus, Many scientists, nutritionists and even Sally Fallon (who advocates raw milk and other raw foods) say that we need to eat cooked food. They say that cooking releases many nutrients that we cannot digest and assimilate otherwise. What’s your opinion? Rachel, Helsinki, Finland
Aajonus: Most academically informed people (I am reluctant to say educated), believe that cooking releases many nutrients and therefore we get more from our food by cooking some or all of it. Consider another theory: that we are able to digest exactly what we need to grow and remain optimally healthy when our balanced diet contains 99.9999% raw foods that meet our gastronomical needs.
I will try to prove my theory. Consider that our systems have developed over millions of years to digest, absorb and utilize all of those nutrients we require from raw foods and that any excess will result in decreased health, stamina, body development and clarity. Consider that such an excess will store in our bodies and cause biochemical and physiological changes that may not be optimal.
Compare the physiological structures of John Travolta, Blaire Brown, Kevin Costner, Steven Segal, and Mary Beth Hurt. I refer to them because most people know who they are and can easily rent their early and later movies. Compare each of them to how
they were in their 20’s, lean, muscular and relatively
medium-boned to now in their 50-60’s, very thick and full-bodied people. They do not have radically high fat levels but have concentrated tissues full of excessive minerals and proteins that are swollen and cauterized from cooked foods. Also, they have extreme water retention.
Considering only their present girth and not age, are they more agile and resilient now or when they were young and svelte? Are they more energetic and facile mentally and physically now or when they were younger? Why did they gain so much girth as they aged? Not everyone adds such girth with age but most people in the USA do, especially those born after World War II when processed foods became so prevalent.
We know that athletes who are svelte and muscular without being skinny are usually much more agile and quicker with excellent endurance. The only miraculous exceptions are people such as popular professional wrestlers; those relatively facile acrobats perform amazing feats but are rare individuals.
Consider that with our wealthier economy, we consume so much more cooked and processed food that we have become the most unhealthily obese civilization on Earth. Consider that on the balanced

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 5 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
Primal Diet, 95% of us have to force-feed ourselves1 to become obese. And, as soon as we stop force- feeding ourselves, 90% of us immediately begin to lose weight and girth. The other 10% do not because their bodies are in serious need of excessive fat because of extreme quantities of harmful toxins stored in their bodies. Are the celebrities I mentioned above thick now compared to their younger years because their bodies are protecting themselves from excessive stored toxicity as well as excessive minerals and protein from cooked foods?
Most people eating cooked and processed food have great difficulty being satisfied and want to eat a lot of food, unless they have certain digestive problems. Or, they may eat only to survive because they do not like food much. If cooking releases so many health-promoting nutrients, why are most people nutritionally unsatisfied, lack energy, are excessively thick and thick-skinned, obese and/or have diseases? Why do most people require caffeine, theobromine, stimulating drugs or nicotine to have energy? Why do most people eating a combination of cooked and raw foods shrink in height and their bodies distort with age?
Why, when I ate cooked food even though supplemented with some raw food, did I get so many diseases? Why, if cooked foods provided more needed nutrients, did my shoulders and chest not develop throughout my childhood and adolescence? Why, 2 months after I began eating raw meats (chicken, beef, fish, pork, snake and eggs) and 5 years of no cooked foods at age 29 did my shoulders and chest bones finally begin to develop and mature? Why did it only take my body one year of eating unfrozen raw meats to completely build and settle my shoulders and chest growths if raw food does not supply enough nutrients?
I have been eating 99.999999% raw foods for 36.5 years. During that time, I consumed no more than a total of 5 pounds of cooked food in the form of bread, air-popped corn or steamed rice with lots of raw butter. I have eaten raw meat for 32 years as of this month (September 2008). I am exactly the same height I was at 18 years young. All of my brothers who ate cooked foods supplemented with some raw foods have shrunk 1.5-2 inches. My father shrunk 2 inches by the time he was 62. When I am at the bottom of my travel-induced weight-loss cycle (once yearly traveling where I cannot get enough raw dairy), my waist is the same 30.5 inches as it was
1 Fat binds with and neutralizes toxins, therefore I ask people to force-feed themselves to gain excessive fat levels to harness and bind with toxins that are stored in their bodies. Excessive fat allows our bodies to cleanse faster, safer and more thoroughly with less symptoms. Resultantly, we heal faster, safer and more thoroughly.
when I was 18 years young. Because my shoulders and chest developed only 31 years ago, my chest is 6 inches larger and weight is 20 pounds more than when I was 18. My brothers have not seen anything below a 33.5-inches waist since they were 30 years young.
I do not advocate that we should have thin waists. In fact, I advocate we have large fat-filled abdomens so that we will have enough fat to protect us from toxins already in our bodies as well as those that enter daily from our toxic environments. What I am representing here is that it is fairly easy to lose the weight once we have detoxified enough to safely lose abdomenal fat and water retention. Still, because I live in a toxic world, I prefer to have excess fat on all of my body. Finally, science supports that fat people have some healthier indications than skinny people, especially healthier hearts (which was just the opposite of what the medical profession has been saying for over 50 years).2
After my unnecessary appendectomy the week of my 12th birthday, I began to grossly overeat. I was never culinarily satisfied eating predominantly cooked foods. Within months of that week in hospital, I became obese. My brothers ridiculed and called me Fatty Arbuckle.
Immediately after my 3rd Polio vaccine at 15.5 years young, I turned diabetic and developed angina (the vaccine caused those problems3). From 1.5 years young, I disliked most cooked starches such as pastas, noodles and breads until I became diabetic at 15.5 years. When I became diabetic, I began to eat massive amounts of cooked starches and lose weight. Literally, over night I went from despising pasta to eating several plates of it at one meal with 4 slices of bread. I stopped digesting, assimilating and utilizing most food over night. I became thin for the first time in my life. I still suffered fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue.
To have as much energy as my peers, I smoked 2 packs of cigarettes, drank up to 11 cups of black coffee and consumed benzedrine daily. To calm my body at night so that I could sleep, I drank up to 3 cups of alcohol, mainly hard liquor and consumed aspirin. The week of my 20th birthday, I began vomiting blood because of stomach ulcer. The alcohol and aspirin cause my stomach ulcer. Treatment for ulcer caused me to develop stomach cancer. For that, I received surgery and 10 weeks of

intense radiation treatment. From radiation therapy, I developed blood and bone cancers (multiple myeloma) within one month. Chemotherapy was then administered for the blood and bone cancers from which I developed lymphoma within one month. I refused any more therapies.
For the third time, I was told I was going to die within 3 months. An 18-year young African- American boy who was a volunteer hospice-worker coerced me into drinking raw carrot juice and raw milk. Those foods changed and saved my life. If cooked foods are nutritious, why did I recover from such devastated health when I stopped eating cooked foods? If we were not getting enough nutrients from a 98-99.9999% raw diet, why are thousands of us doing so much better now than when we were eating so much cooked foods supplemented with raw foods? Why do we have more indications of increased health than people who eat 60%, 70% or even 90% raw?
FINDING THE ANSWERS AND FINE-TUNING MY PRIMAL DIET
My progression throughout development of my diet was experimental. I did what worked and then suggested that others do the same. Everybody’s health increased. By December, 1982, my Primal Diet was 70% developed. I had yet to discover that eating too much high-carbohydrate fruit and juices was deleterious. I had yet to learn that great benefits resulted from eating certain foods, and at certain times daily.
I was so addicted to high-carbohydrate fruits, I could not envision my diet without lots of it. However, I occasionally felt extremely over- emotional. When I auditioned for commercials, TV and films, I could not help but revert to my childhood fears of being expected to read in front of classmates when I was autistic and could not comprehend written or spoken words. I was ridiculed and punished for not reading; actually for being autistically unable to read. Adrenalin soured in my body and I stood dumbfounded in fear of usual discipline/abuse. By 23 years young, I began using meditative techniques to counter and harness those experiences but I lost many parts that I should have gotten because my work looked emotionally pushed and/or restrained. While eating so much high-
carbohydrate fruit, I had difficulty creating balance behavior.
I knew that my adrenalin-charged states were not normal. I asked myself: What in my biochemistry caused those adrenalin-stupored conditions? Could I do anything about them? I noticed that I could easily become hyperactive and manic within 90 minutes after eating lots of high-carbohydrate fruits or juices. Until then, I had viewed those states as healthy high energy. Then I realized that because I could not control them enough, they interfered with what I wanted to achieve. I experimented with different eating patterns until I reached a point that I could control those conditions by 90%. I experimented endlessly. I began by reducing my consumption of high-carbohydrate fruits. I experimented with eating certain foods at certain times of the day.
By reducing my high-carbohydrate fruit intake from 30% of my diet to 5%, and eliminating high- carbohydrate fruit juices, my clarity and focus vastly improved. I could remain calm in most storms. That stage of my Primal-Diet development was realized and proved by experimentation (trial and error) on several hundred people by the year 2002. I listed the preferred eating schedules in my recipe book on pages 40-41. (With those suggestions, you may very well enjoy all of your life more, sooner than later.)
In 1999, I found other scientific support for my carbohydrate problems. Researchers at Columbia University found that glycogen byproducts (Advanced Glycation End-Products) produced many ills for humans even if our bodies made glycogen from raw fruits. However, I discovered that if our bodies made glycogen from raw proteins, the byproducts did not store, thus creating manic behavior or producing illness. It is my experienced and scientific conclusion that eating cooked food does not add anything to human needs, with one exception. That exception is cooked starch, such as rice, bread or pasta made with only water and yeast. It is useful for certain individuals at specific times to bind with excessive hormones or toxins when my raw Nut Formula is not effective. For more information about that, please read or re-read my books.
 
From my personal and objective experiences for 36 years with myself (such as I stated above) and thousands of people since I was made aware of it, my resounding answer is YES. I was first introduced to it by my nutritional tutor in 1971-2. He gave me 2 books and a report to study. The books were titled, Sugar Blues, and Sugar And The Criminal Mind. The report was from a 10-years study conducted by a Canadian university in 1950’s to ‘60’s. Tests were conducted because schools began having substantial student problems in 1950’s. It was suspected that consumption of high rates of processed foods ushered into the public with World War II-canned-food- rationing strategy.
All of the studies accrued and presented substantial proof that processed food and food-additives caused major mental and behavioral problems. They observed that children fed meals made from fresh and untreated foods had good dispositions and good grades. Those that ate processed foods with additives were moody, had difficulty concentrating and very often fair to poor grades. The Canadian report concluded that pesticides, herbicides and additives were the main cause of behavioral and aptitude problems. They found that certain man-made food- colors caused more behavioral problems than other additives. I could not find references to those tests however, do not fret, we have more recent examination of the food-behavioral link that was conducted in Wisconsin beginning in 1997. 4, 5, 6 It

was first reported in 2002 in Pure Facts by The Feingold Association to generate public awareness of the potential role of foods and additives in behavior, learning and health problems.
“Before the Appleton Wisconsin high school replaced their cafeteria's processed foods with wholesome, nutritious food, the school was described as out-of-control. There were weapons violations, student disruptions, and a cop on duty full-time. After the change in school meals, the students were calm, focused, and orderly. There were no more weapons violations, and no suicides, expulsions, dropouts, or drug violations. The new diet and improved behavior has lasted for seven years, and now other schools are changing their meal programs with similar results.” 7
Why hasn’t every school in America adopted a better diet for our children? Mainly because cola and junk-food companies donate money to school boards and governing school committees to ensure that their vending machines and processed foods are in school cafeterias and grounds. The answer is very clear, if we expect better behavior from our children, we should make certain that they are not polluted with bad food, additives and other chemicals that will disrupt their functionality and behavior. To disregard such truth is travesty to children and society, and living in denial.
"How is it that poor men's wives, who have no cold fowl and port wine on which to be coshered up, nurse their children without difficulty, whereas the wives of rich men, who eat and drink everything that is good, cannot do so, we will for the present leave to the doctors and mothers to settle between them."

     Subscriber’s question: Bad And Good Parasites, And Malaria? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Dear Aajonus, If I understand you correctly, you say Yet, you ate a deadly mushroom and there is falaria that there are no bad parasites, bacteria or fungus.

that cause Malaria. Can you reconcile those for me? Marianne, Gloucester, UK
Aajonus: Hi, Marianne, More specifically, my expe- rience and experiments proved to me that there are no dangerous microbes or fungi that naturally live in our bodies. However, there may be some very toxic man- made and/or genetically modified microbes that enter and live in our bodies through medical and environ- mental pollution. In healthy bodies, those man-made microbes are not likely to survive.
Our natural friends, such as whipworms (trichinosis and trichuriasis are misnomers), giardia, campylobac- ter, salmonella, listeria species, E.coli, gangrene, can- dida and many other microbes and fungi, are all in- digenous to humans. Most of those are janitors. Whipworm, campylobacter and E.coli are digestive organisms. In fact, E.coli are responsible for the final stages of digestion of protein and fats to finite forms that feed our brains and nervous systems. Plus, E.coli release 90% of B Vitamins from our food for us to enjoy better mental functions and more energy. Like all digestive bacteria, they eat our food and their wastes are our nutrients. It is the way of nature no matter how disgusting health-representatives and me- dia describe it.
Malaria is a detoxification through every part of our body because it is a cleansing of the blood stream. Malarial falaria (plasmodium parasites) are most of- ten generated in humid climates rich in oxygen. They are natural to ill health of severely contaminated red blood cells. Those parasites are janitors within blood cells and blood stream. Too frequently, people on high-carbohydrate diets develop malaria. Their diets do not help their bodies cleanse waste, so their bodies enlist exceptional microbes to help remove toxins/waste. Those microbes do not put the wastes/toxins that are red blood cells’ problems into sufferers’ bodies; natural microbes simply remove or- ganic waste. Why would you blame those microbes for the resultant toxic symptoms?
Byproducts from people’s stored cellular wastes cause malaria. Would people suffer more if people detoxified those wastes without plasmodium para- sites? Could it be that if the plasmodium parasites did not help them remove those wastes/toxins that people would get more serious diseases such as anemia or leukemia? Plasmodium parasites may enter liver, kid- neys and/or brain because toxic red bloods cells are
in those tissues. If they enter the brain, delirium or coma may result. If cared for properly without medi- cal procedures, people will recover completely.
There are several malarial parasites to help us clean red blood cells when we haven’t cleansed in another way. Plasmodium falciparum detoxification usually takes 7 to 14 days to run their course. Plasmodium vi- vax and ovale usually take 8 to 14 days (in a few cas- es it took several months). Plasmodium malariae usually takes 7 to 30 days. Those figures are some- what arbitrary and detoxification varies with each person. Symptoms of malaria infection usually are not dramatic, and can easily be dismissed as unim- portant. They are unimportant if people who develop one of those detoxifications eat properly. Those who do not eat a proper diet of healthful raw nutrients that includes lots of raw fat and some raw protein may suffer dramatic symptoms including tremors, deliri- um and coma.
Usually, malaria symptoms are flu-like and include: rigors, headaches, sweat, tiredness, myalgia of limbs and back, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, orthostatic hypotension, nausea, slight jaundice, cough, enlarged liver and spleen (sometimes not palpable), and vomit. Fever in the first week of travel in a humid area rich in oxygen is unlikely to be a malaria detoxification. Fever is always the body reducing detoxification and initializing a healing cycle. A healing cycle usually requires much rest and relaxation. That is the reason why so many people are lethargic during and following fevers for 1-20 weeks.
If experiencing detoxification symptoms, eating no- salt added raw cheese and/or clay will help draw poisons from blood into stomach and intestines rather than into liver, kidneys and brain. Eating plenty of raw fats - such as coconut (especially coconut cream), eggs, dairy cream, butter, butter and honey mixture, and avocados - will help neutralize the heavy wastes that occur during heavy detoxifications. Drinking 2 ounces of beet juice can help neutralize toxins by stimulating increased hydrochloric acid production. Eating some or plenty of raw eggs will help maintain protein levels without overloading the body with intense digestive processes, allowing the body more time, focus and energy to cleanse and heal. Eggs are the easiest food to eat; they digest in about 27 minutes.

Simply turn the dial to one of the magnetic settings and put the meter at the electronic gadget and slowly move the meter from the gadget until the reading is only 0-1 milligaus. That is the distance we must be from electrical objects to reduce harmful exposure to EMFs. When using computers, I suggest laptops over desktops. Laptops have much less EMFs but you have to use a separate keyboard and mouse that would be plugged into the laptop. Roller-ball-type mouses are non EMF-producing. Wireless and infrared mouses generate very high EMF-levels. I have not tested many headsets but headsets that I have tested all have magnets in earpieces that directly emit EMFs into ear and head. When you use the TriField meter, use Magnetic (0-3 range) and Radio

to test each at the ear piece. If you get a higher than 1 miligaus reading, get a tube ear piece to move the magnet away from your ears and head. Consider also, that EMFs may be generated into your home from power equipment outside homes, including electrical generators. If you have a high EMF-field in your home that remains relatively constant after you turn off the power in your home, EMFs are generated outside your home. Get the electric company, electrician or landlord to fix it. Or, I suggest that you move to another home.

The       Newsletter
October 7, 2008
I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

Subscriber’s question: How Toxic is Our Civilized World? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
 Dear Aajonus, In light of Bisphenol A research (http://www.efluxmedia.com/news_Report_Warns_on_Serious_ Health_Problems_Linked_to_Bisphenol_A_16445.html) do you recommend avoiding all plastic water containers? (Sorry, the senders name disappeared during a computer crash.)
Aajonus: Since pollution results from almost everything we do in modern society, we probably should ask: How toxic are we in our extremely toxic environments? Rather than selectively address compounds in plastics first, I will introduce discon- certing data that most people do not want to face or admit about overall disease-producing pollution at its beginning. I discussed in my books that even the basic act of cooking produces many chemical changes that cause environmental and body toxicity. Those chemical changes occur both in food and our environment.
It starts when we light a fire. Fire produces monoxides. Monoxides are poisonous to our cells. If utilizing flintstones to start fire, often flint dust is
inhaled. Flintstones contain metallic minerals that are not bio-actively or ionically bound, nor evenly distributed with bio-nutrients. When inhaled, flint dust causes destructive free-radical activity that is predominantly destructive on cellular levels. Even if we use the ancient wood-to-wood friction method to make fire, smoke disburses tars and monoxides into air we breathe. Monoxides arrest oxygen absorption and smother cells. Vegetable tars from burned wood harden and eventually crystallize in humans.
Now, consider a modern-day fire such as barbeque. We use poisonous lighter fluid, fabricated and chemically treated charcoal and sulfur matches or lighter. Charcoal contains mercury that vaporizes and we inhale it. Mercury is the worst neurotoxin on this planet. It dissolves cells, especially brain and nerve cells. The chemical structure of lighter fluids are: aliphatic petroleum (solvent used to ignite charcoal), denatured alcohol (methylated fermentation); butane (highly flammable, colorless, easily liquefied gas used in cigarette lighters and gas-flame grills); and
     
 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 2 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
naphtha (volatile flammable liquid hydrocarbon mixture used in wick type lighters and lamps). All of those are usually deadly to the entire body if swallowed, and deadly to many cells when inhaled. All of them add pollution to our environment. With those alone, we added a minimum of 26 man-made chemicals to our world that we are not properly equipped to live with optimally, healthfully.
Rachel Carson pushed Americans to question chemical “miracles” when she published Silent Spring in 1962, and legislation was passed to address concerns she and others raised about environmental toxins. By early 1970s, more alarms rang. DDT, the pesticide that was advertised to have saved American soldiers who fought in the South Pacific from malaria and been sprayed on millions of acres of cropland, was fingered as a killer of birds, especially the beloved bald eagle. Eggshells thinned by exposure to DDT resulted in fewer hatchlings that survived. DES, a drug believed to prevent miscarriage, was found to cause cancer in young women whose mothers took it during pregnancy; emergency hysterectomies saved many of the daughters' lives, but at a terrible cost. It was also responsible for many deformities including very small hands and genetically twisted uteruses.
PCBs, highly effective lubricants and insulators used in electrical capacitors, transistors, hydraulic fluids, plasticizers, inks, waxes and adhesives, were deforming and killing birds and fish. By 1971, Monsanto voluntarily stopped making PCBs. Each of these problems was seen as an isolated case; simply a few rogue chemicals had wreaked havoc, but havoc could be contained. We were lead to believe that we could stop chemical damage by scientific inquiring and goodwill.
The average person still thinks about chemicals as single entities because that is what we are taught, and that our system of federal regulation that decides on a case-by-case basis whether chemicals are safe enough to circulate in our world provides safety. What most people do not know is that only about 2,000 of the approximately 80,000 man-made new chemicals of the last century have been tested. Only a handful of those have been properly tested for health consequences.
By having introduced so many substances that did not evolve along with living organisms over hundreds
-
of millions of years, have we unwisely initiated changes in our biology that may be damaging them profoundly for convenience? How well do we enjoy those conveniences in states of weakened senses and ill health? How many people are satisfied, even with all of our endless gadgets and conveniences? Could it be that our lack of optimal health is the reason most of us are unsatisfied and want more and more? Are we unable to be satisfied because we are trying to achieve satisfaction from something other than health?
As a boy of 3-7 during the early and mid-1950s, I remember traveling through parts of Alabama, Tennessee and Florida when racism and segregation were strong and bitterness flourished among whites. It was so pervasive that African-Americans rarely ever contested whites. However, what I remember most is the joy of life that blacks enjoyed even under such suppression. I saw playfulness with considerat- ion and abandon, and it all seemed so natural.
Blacks young and old played outside their shakes in ragged clothing and crude handmade toys, if any, with such joy I could touch it but not understand it. We drove past them in our 1951 Packard sedan. We had luxury that the blacks I watched could never embrace for themselves. My family utilized all that modern medicine that the times had to offer, especially since my mother was a Certified Nurse. My father, who was an engineer and inventor, idolized technology. If he heard anyone say anything bad about technology, he entered rage. He yelled at anyone who suggested that harm resulted from it.
We ingested all of the modern canned processed foods and packaged processed cereals full of chemical additives that claimed superior nutrition and safer than from a garden. We did not know the fraud.
Rarely did my brothers and parents enjoy each other. My family quarreled and fought daily if not hourly. Those blacks I watched and adored could not afford many of the modern foods and conveniences. Overall, most of them ate from their gardens and looked so much healthier than most whites. Looking back on those events with what I know now about cooked and processed foods with myriads of additives, I understand why we were an unsatisfied and unhappy modern family, and why those “poor” blacks were rich with health in their poverty. They
 
 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 3 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
could not afford many chemically poisoned processed foods and were not contaminated as my family was.
The following study demonstrates that living a pure organic cooked processed lifestyle offers no protection: Toxic Nation: A Report on Pollution in Canadians This is a report of studies conducted by Environmental Defence (in Canada) which arrives at indications of excessive industrial toxicity levels in people. The results challenge much of the average health-conscious individuals. For instance, many vegetarians came to discover after years of eating vegetarian that vegetarianism caused much health deterioration. Average health-conscious individuals discover everyday that their faith in our “healthy” food products leaves us toxic.
In the Canadian study, children as young as 10 were found to have flame retardants, heavy metals, insecticide metabolites , organophosphates, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and stain repellents even when raised by health conscious parents. One 34-year-old mother who conscientiously selected mostly organic, biological food stuff discovered from the study that she had 36 toxic chemicals; the highest among the volunteers. Her 10-years-young son had 25 toxic chemicals in his body. A 24-years-young mother and her 10-years-young daughter had similar results, 31 and 24 respectively.
Three generations of one family of native-north- Americans from the Aamjiwnaang First Nation in Sarnia, Ontario were tested. The elder had 32 chemicals in his body. His son had 36, and his 14- years-young granddaughter had 20 chemicals. The elder Wilson Plain Sr. commented, "What's most shocking is my granddaughter has chemicals in her body that were banned before she was even born. Canadians have the right not to be polluted by these chemicals." I think that everyone in the world has a right not to be polluted except those who manufac- ture, distribute, sell and utilize them.
Rick Smith, executive director of Environmental Defence stated, "Pollution is now so bad in our country that the bodies of our children have higher levels of pollution than their parents. Our children are being poisoned every day by toxic products in their home, in their schools, and when they are at play."
-
Because of our adherence to low-fat diets - fostered, promoted, advertised and brainwashed by media rhetoric from food, agricultural and medical industries - our children have had little healthy fat to bind with toxins. Therefore children are at much greater risk from toxin-generated diseases.
A lifetime exposure to even low-level toxins ultimately degrades health when bodies lack fat. Some of the chemicals found in test-subjects’ bodies have been shown to harm development of children, cause reproductive disorders and cause cancer, and/or cause neurological problems.
The “biomonitoring” method used in the Canadian study which sampled human tissues and fluids gives us only a small sense of the various chemicals our bodies have absorbed and are absorbing through air, food, industrial products, soil and water. The study specifically tested for only 88 known chemical toxins of 80,000. Tests detected 60 of those 88 chemicals in 11 volunteers, including 18 heavy metals, 5 PBDEs, 14 PCBs, 1 perfluorinated chemical, 10 organo- chlorine pesticides, 5 organophosphate insecticide metabolites, and 7 VOCs. Forty-four various chemicals were detected in each volunteer, including 41 carcinogens, 27 hormone disruptors, 21 respiratory toxins and 53 reproductive/developmental toxins.
This study was the first Canadian measurement of PFOS levels (the key ingredient in Scotchgard, the 3M-made fabric protector that is in nearly every home) in people’s bodies. It is also an ingredient in “sizing” (chemicals used to protect and reduce stretching in materials while being cut and sewn). That means that we are absorbing PFOS from our clothes, bedding and home furnishings. Sizing remains in the fabric until many washes removes it. However, some of it remains in the fabric and every time we inhale or ingest a fiber of lint, our mouth, lungs, esophagus and stomach dissolve it and release it into our bodies. Even organic fibers may contain sizing. Some producers tout the label organic which only means that the fiber was grown or raised organically but does not mean that the fabric was not subjected to chemicals during processing.
A First Nations leader from northern Quebec found that he had the highest levels of mercury and persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as PCBs
 
 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 4 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
and organochlorine pesticides. That reaffirmed other studies indicating that many chemicals migrate through air and water currents and other climatic conditions.
PCBs were detected in all volunteers including those born in the early 1980s even though PCBs were banned in USA in 1970s. However, results revealed higher levels of PCBs in older volunteers in comparison with younger volunteers; for example, between 12 and 14 PCBs were detected in samples from volunteers aged 60 and older, while an average of 5 PCBs were detected in subjects aged 25 and under. Those results are similar to equivalent studies done in the U.S. and Europe.
It was reported on April 9, 2006, at a conference examining air quality from sources such as coal, motor vehicles, and residential oil-emitted metals such as copper, zinc and vanadium that these were present in the air at unhealthy levels (Health Effects Institute). Those metals accumulated in lungs, heart, liver tissues and in blood. There they damage cells and very often prevent proper functions that are detectably or obscurely disease, including allergies, respiratory, and cardiovascular problems. At the conference, they failed to properly acknowledge that mercury, the worst neurotoxin on Earth that is mainly in our environment because of coal-burning, should have been outlawed 60 years ago.
Mercury is in fish, beans, grains, lakes and oceans. It’s in mouths within amalgam fillings. Mercury is pervasive in our environment, released mainly into the atmosphere through extensive coal-burning for energy.
I blame airborne pollution including vehicle emissions totally on industry. I did that because the auto and power industries have fought our right to clean air with billions of dollars over the last 40 years. Otherwise, we would have clean air because we would have technologies that are not dependent on oil and fossil fuels, or we would have technologies that cleaned the byproducts so they were not dis- persed into our environment. Industry fights clean air sources so that those invested in coal and oil continue to accumulate greater profits without having to spend much of it on pollution-prevention.
In our homes, there are many sources of toxins that enter our bodies, including metal toxicity from
-
cookware. Even stainless steel which is partially made of nickel and chromium gradually leeches from cookware every time food is cooked in it. Consider that while cooking, food changes to highly fraction- ated chemicals that often form into solvents. Those solvents gradually erode surface metal of cookware. Compare and consider that simple water gradually erodes rock made of metallic minerals. Now, consider what highly reactive cooked compounds from food will do to metal cookware.
Is modern stainless steel less toxic than metals made from a century ago? Yes but that does not mean that we are not being poisoned by cooking in them. It simply means that we are being less poisoned. Aluminum and other metallic cookware including and especially non-stick coatings (i.e. Teflon) are quicker to erode into food while cooking. Non-stick cookware is more toxic than any cookware produced prior to 1950s.
Flame-retardants containing polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) are added to plastics including foam products and mattresses to make them less burnable. (Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's fact sheet.) PBDEs are in many home and office products to protect against extreme fires. PBDEs can easily leave the products that contain them and enter the environment. Children teethe and chew on such products. Children wear clothing that industry tells us protect our children in case of fire. However, while every moment our children perspire into and inhale fibers from those clothing and bedding, they absorb PBDEs.
The scientists didn't test vegetables and fruits, but found PBDEs in a soy infant formula and breast milk. All soy products are toxic to humans in raw or cooked form and should not be eaten and here is another reason not to consume soy.
Organic Consumers Association states that scientists claim they aren't sure how PBDEs get into foods such as butter, cheeses, chicken, eggs, duck, fish and ice cream but they theorize that particles escape from carpets, furniture, computers and televisions into the air (out-gassing). Those micro- particles fall to ground and water, and are inhaled by animals including humans. Animals also consume crops grown in soil polluted with PBDEs.
PBDEs concentrate in fat as animal’s bodies try to
   
 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 5 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
bind it and prevent cellular damage. Animal studies have shown that PBDEs alter hormonal function, change the development of reproductive organs, harm the nervous system, affect behavior including attention deficit disorders, and cause liver tumors.
It was and is relatively ignored that when burned in fires, PBDEs and other chemicals in products caused such airborne pollution that people hundreds of miles from fires are rendered functionally helpless from breathing drifting smoke. Permanently or temporarily, some chemically sensitive people could not or cannot think rationally or coherently. Some are in a state of constant panic and fear, unable to perform normal everyday chores. Some cannot sleep so they pace incessantly. Some smoke-inhalation sufferers’ appetites are thrown into frenzy.
Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are a mixture of up to 209 individual chlorinated compounds. Most of them are extremely toxic. There are no known natural sources of PCBs. Although PCBs are no longer produced in the USA since 1970s, and have not been utilized since 1990s, they are still found in products produced elsewhere in the world, are imported into USA, and are in our environment.
The Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry's PCBs fact-sheet states numerous ways we are exposed to chemical cocktails: a) small amounts of toxic chemicals outgas into our air when products get hot during operation and could be a source of skin exposure and inhalation, b)eating contaminated foods and drinking contaminated water, during repair and maintenance of PCB transformers, c) accidents, fires or spills involving transformers, fluorescent lights, and other electrical devices; and d) disposal of PCB- laced and other chemically laced products and materials.
PCBs caused cancer in laboratory animals. Human diseases associated with PCBs-exposure include immunological and neurobehavioral changes in children and acne-like skin conditions in adults. PCBs were found in over 500 of our most toxic 1,598 sites on the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) National Priorities List.
Fluorochemicals (PFOAs) such as perfluorooc- tanoic acid (PFOA) are used in non-stick coatings on cookware, as a stain repellent on clothing, carpets, and upholstery, as undercoat on beach umbrellas to
-
provide increased sun-protection and as liner in canned and other food containers, especially fast- food packaging. Some references to PFOAs and PFOSs are Chemicals in frying pan a potential hazard to environment and Fluoropolymers may have harmful long-term effects. PFOAs are suspected carcinogens only because the industry fights the debate like the tobacco industry argues that smoking does not cause and promote cancers.
Another fluorochemical is perfluorooctanyl sulfonate (PFOSs). The 3M Company was the largest worldwide producer of PFOS chemicals but stopped manufacturing PFOSs in December 2000 because PFOSs do not biodegrade. They persist in our environment and effect long-term damage to health andenvironment.Although3MCompanydoesnot manufacture PFOSs, PFOSs continue to be sold from the manufacturer’s stockpile of it. Any manufacturer who desires to utilize it in their products worldwide may do so. PFOS were found in wildlife species across the US, such as fish-eating birds, and in the Baltic region and in Sweden, and in human blood samples.
PFOSs accumulate to a high degree in humans and animals. It has been estimated that PFOSs remain in the human body for up to 8 years. However, according to Dr. Frances Pottenger and Edward Howell, toxins are often transferred to new cells for up to 5 generations. That means that they could remain in humans for as little as 40 years in people who eat a diet rich in raw fats and proteins, or a lifetime in those who eat poor diets.
In a 2-generation “reproductive effects” rat study, PFOS caused postnatal deaths and developmental effects in offspring. At higher doses in this study, all progeny in the first generation died. At extremely low doses, many progeny from the second generation died. It is very rare that the public is privy to reports of such dire effects. Most often, those results are confidential to the industries that make and utilize chemical hazards. Understand that I am addressing only few chemicals of the 80,000 that are or have been produced globally.
Organochlorine pesticides, introduced in the1940s, persist in the environment long after they are applied, in soil, environment and animals, including people who eat food grown on or near application. They
   
 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 6 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
accumulate and levels build in the body daily, yearly. People may be exposed to organochlorine pesticides by eating cooked fatty foods, such as pasteurized milk and dairy products, or fish that are contaminated with those pesticides (Center for Disease Control (CDC) fact sheet).
Organochlorine pesticides may be absorbed by eating foods imported from countries that allow persistent pesticides usage. They are passed through placentas to unborn children and are passed by breastfeeding to infants. They are absorbed through skin and inhalation.
One organochlorine pesticide, lindane, is used to treat lice and scabies and is readily absorbed through skin. They produce reproductive and neurological effects in animals. People who work with organo- chlorine pesticides for years develop liver damage. Hold on to your panic button: organochlorines are used to “purify” our environments, food and waters of microbes, and to “clean” clothing and other materials.
Volatile organic compounds (VOCs) include toluene, benzene, formaldehyde, ethyl benzene, styrene, acetone and a host of other chemicals, some of which have already made the EPA's list of Extremely Hazardous Substances. Many can be found in medication such as formaldehyde which is used in vaccines, perfumes and cosmetics.
Other examples of pervasive VOCs contamination and health hazards are mentioned in the report Toxic Carpet: Dangerous Toxins that Live in Your Carpeting. Known carcinogen p-Dichlorobenzene is in new carpets, as are other chemicals that produce fetal abnormalities in test animals. In humans, those chemicals also cause hallucinations, nerve damage and respiratory illness. Some of new-carpet odor is outgassing of the chemical 4-PC that is associated with eye, nose and upper respiratory problems. Many new carpet owners suffer from these for as much or as little as 5 years, depending on the individual. 4-PC is used in latex backing of 95% of US carpets.
Government and chemical industries seem to let us think that they are conscientious and caring in regards to our health. Occasionally, they selectively disseminate to the media that one specific chemical has caused problems and that they have agreed to discontinue USA production. The other 79,900
-
chemicals and their hazards are ignored.
In 2000, 3M Company removed perflouro-octanyl
salphonate from Scotchgard because it caused reproductive problems in rats. It had also been found in high levels in urban wildlife. Rarely does a company who has polluted, or does pollute, suffer criminal or civil retribution. 3M Company did not suffer for harm it did to humans and environment for perfloouro-octanyl. In fact, none of the chemical companies were charged and convicted of criminal behavior. They never admit to gross harm from the worst chemicals, such as vaccines and dental amalgams.
It should also be a crime that companies can be allowed to produce chemicals that are not tested and proved safe prior to usage. It may be very likely that all industrially produced chemicals cause harm to environment and life just as there are side effects to all medications.
Chlorine has been used for more than 100 years to disinfectant water under the false belief that microbes in water caused disease such as malaria. About 50 years ago, it was discovered that that noble attempt to offset infectious disease in public water supplies caused disease. Since water is basically a solvent that disperses and gradually fractionates most objects within it, when chlorine interacts in water, toxic byproducts result that cause increased risk of certain cancers, and birth and developmental defects. All of those hazardous results are ignored and combinations of chlorine and ammonia and chlorine-dioxide (chloramines) and ozone are used to “disinfect” water and other items of our daily advanced modern society.
I have illustrated many times that microbes do not cause disease but the chemicals we use to destroy microbes and make our lives sterile are disease- causing. Toxic byproducts from chemicals used to disinfect public drinking water were named Disinfection Byproducts (DBPs).
It has been postulated that it is materials in water that react with chlorine and chloramines that cause toxicity resulting in disease. However, some of that debate is merely “legalese” to prevent successful lawsuits, arguing that the companies cannot know the content of all water because they are all different. Most of the same diseases resulted when those
  
 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 7 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
substances were administered alone into laboratory animals. However, approximately 600 DBPs have been identified since 1974 because of the combining of chlorine with substances that naturally occur in waters.
Scientists believe they've identified about half the DBPs that occur in chlorine-treated water. They estimate they identified 17% of those occurring in chloramine-treated water, 28% in chlorine-dioxide- treated water, 8% of those produced in ozone-treated water, and of the 600 structurally identified DBPs, the toxicity factor is known for approximately 30%.
Genetic toxicologist Michael Plewa, who headed a research team that examined DBPs in the public water, stated “This research says that when you go to alternatives, you may be opening a Pandora's box of new DBPs, and these unregulated DBPs may be much more toxic, by orders of magnitude, than the regulated ones we are trying to avoid.” Plewa's research team that included 3 EPA employees discovered idoacetic acid (a DBP) in US drinking water treated with chloramine that when tested on samples of mammalian cells proved to be the most genotoxic DBP ever reported. “These iodoacetic acids raise new levels of concerns. Not only do they represent a potential danger because of all the water consumed on a daily basis, [that contaminated] water is recycled back into the environment. What are the consequences?” Plewa and his colleagues found that in hamster cells, just one iodoacid they tested was anywhere from 2-300 times more toxic than other chlorine byproducts.
Using chloramines as "safe" alternatives to chlorine for water purification has substantially increased lead levels in some people. The chemical compounds used in purification, fluoridation and basic plumbing materials interact causing more hazards to our health. Tetravalent lead scales have been found inside lead water pipes from several utilities. In a free chlorine solution, tetravalent lead is stable, but in the presence of chloramine it dissolves into the water. (Experiment confirms chloramine's effect on lead in drinking water.) American Free Press highlighted “unhealthy cones- quences” of chloraminated-water in Washington, DC; Corpus Christi, Texas and San Francisco, CA.
Dioxins are created when chlorine and organic matter react in the presence of heat. Dioxins linger in
-
the environment long after initial exposure. Most plastics are treated with such chemical processes to prevent plastic from fungal molds. Fungi were the principal reason plastics were much delayed in manufacturing. Poisoning the environment was and is less of a concern than making plastics utilizable for practically everything in our technically advanced lifestyles.
Dioxins are known carcinogens. In fact, one dioxin in particular, TCDD, is the most potent animal carcinogen ever studied and has been linked to cancer in humans. We traded plastic conveniences and economy for deformed children, miscarriages, still births and a myriad of diseases, just as we have traded “purified” water with the same results. Are we happy or even content with those trades?
The military industrial complex is a grand user of dioxins such as in Agent Orange. Dioxins so contaminate cellular structures that cells can no longer perform normal metabolic detoxification. Resultantly, HIV-1 virus is activated in genes to perform detoxification; it does so very poorly. Dioxins, like most industrial chemicals, are virtually inescapable as they permeate our air, food, land and water.
Identifying merely 60 toxic chemicals in the Canadian study fails to address the possible consequences of new chemicals and hazards resulting from environmental and bodily mixtures of those 60 chemicals. Yes, an even greater catastrophe is the fact that there are dire reactions from mixing and combining 80,000 industrially produced toxins within our environment that enter our bodies.
Finally, to directly answer my subscriber’s question about drinking water from plastic, I would not drink water from plastic. Also, I remind readers that I am against drinking much water. I rarely drink water because waters do not contain any bio-active nutrients to properly utilize H2O within cells. When I do drink water, it is from water bottled in glass.
We may easily conclude that even if we try to live pure organic lifestyles, toxins are mostly unavoidable and inescapable because the bottom-line is business and profits not health or environment. Although we are frequently exposed every second to one or more industrially produced environmental toxins and have
   
 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 8 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
many accumulated within our bodies, eating my Primal Diet will help remove them and bestow to us greater chances of preventing or reversing severe diseasesinaworldwhere1of2menand1of3 women gets cancers (Samuel Epstein, M.D.). We need the best naturally grown raw, unheated-above- 96-degrees F. and non-frozen animal and other fats to protect our cells from those industrial toxins. Raw unpasteurized aged-in-wood apple cider vinegar chelates with many industrial toxins and heavy metals.
Consuming small amounts of that vinegar, about 1 tablespoon daily with or in one vegetable juices mixture, or divided into several vegetable juices, while eating a diet with plenty of raw fats mentioned above, helps remove industrial toxins including heavy metals gradually. However, the process of the body utilizing vinegar to chelate with those toxins causes massive mineral losses. Minerals are utilized to further chelate and neutralize those toxins. Each molecule of toxicity may require up to 200 molecules of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium to harness and neutralize it.
As much as possible, we need to prevent toxins from entering our bodies. Avoid drinking water in any form that is not bottled in glass. Decontaminate home water with filters by adding 3 tablespoons raw apple cider vinegar, 2 tablespoons sun-dried sea salt
and 3-5 tablespoons coconut cream to bath water, and a fraction of all of those to dish water. Avoid showers because there is presently no filter system that removes all the myriad of industrial toxins from municipal waters. However, filtration systems are very helpful. Avoid cooked and processed food. Keep plants that absorb toxicity in our homes to absorb many airborne pollutants. See Primal Diet newsletter for summer of 2007, dated June 9.
I suggest that we do not use soaps for cleaning anything except laundry. Many “ecologically friendly” soaps and cleansers are not friendly to us or environment. They may contain on average 30% biodegradable substances and the rest are the same chemical toxins used in commercial products. Yes, they are less toxic but they are not totally safe.
The only company I have researched that utilizes up to 93% biodegradable substances is BioKleen in their Cleaner, not their laundry detergent. I use a tablespoon of BioKleen’s Cleaner for each load of laundry. To clean my dishes, I simply use warm water with 2 tablespoons raw apple cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon sea salt and 1 teaspoon coconut cream. For my body, I use fresh or fermented coconut cream that leaves my body moisturized and protected against environmental toxins.

Subscriber’s question: Is Raw Milk Always Beneficial Even With Much Bacteria? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Hey Aajonus, The following news item about the dangers of raw milk appeared on Yahoo News http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20080611/ap_on_re_us/r aw_milk_crackdown;_ylt=ArkdQ7.XlWYQSqXdcbe lunla24cA What are your thoughts? (Subscribers name was lost in computer crash.)
Aajonus: There was virtually no scientific research conducted in that raw-milk article. The writer simply repeated past erroneous rhetoric produced by the pasteurized dairy industry and microbe-phobic individuals that has lingered since 1920s. There were at least 6 direct misrepresentations of facts in that article. Such non-journalists should have a warning
-
notice at the beginning of any article. It should read: “Writer is a researcher of available info and has been brainwashed to consider any academic view as predominantly true and all others to be suspect.” We should be able to sue them for tremendous penalties depending upon the probable damage to the public.
For details on the benefits and total safety of natural raw milk, please read my and Dr. Douglass’s Report In Favor of Natural Milk at www.RawMilk.org or http://www.wewant2live.com/site/811618/page/1755 637 Both Dr. Douglass and I have consumed raw milk from cows with unclean udders and teats.

milk were mud, fecal matter and urine from the cows. There were also flies and their fecal matter and urine in the milk. I drank much of that kind of milk up to 2 weeks after milking and did not get indigestion, vomit or diarrhea. Instead, I felt much healthier.
As you will read in the report, most milk prior to modern milking equipment introduced in the 1950s contained very high levels of E.coli and many other bacteria, up to 3 million bacteria per gram. Infants, children and adults thrived on it. If it were unhealthy
when full of bacteria, I would be dead. In fact, all of the people who drank raw milk prior to modern milking equipment would be dead. Although such milk does not taste as our taste-buds have been trained to enjoy, I often prefer high bacterial milk. I find that it digests quickly and gives me more mental clarity and focus. Today, it is relatively impossible to acquire such bacteria-rich raw milk unless I milk the goat or cow by hand. __________________________________________
Subscriber’s question: What Place Do Energy Therapies Take In Healing? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Dear Aajonus, There are many people who claim that energy work can cure anything. What is your experience? Debra, Birmingham, AL
Aajonus: I have experienced favorable and harmful energy therapists through my journey to optimal health. I have seen many people further damage themselves because they were told (and believed, without wisdom) that energy is more important than structures in this reality. That is, they were told energy is more important than the physical, including diet. They were told that if they controlled their energy-producing thoughts, they could eat anything without harm.
Every energy worker and "master" who had disseminated that rhetoric did not prove it to me with their experience. None of them surmounted health problems. All of them had worsened health problems while adhering to that concept. Even the life-long- committed vegetarian Dali Lama dropped his vegetarian dogma and began eating meat when his health deterioration began to affect his daily functions in his advancing years. Health-related miraculous events are exceptions and far removed from normal.
I have been health conscious as a health researcher for over 40 years. I experimented with all sorts of energetic modalities. They were relatively ineffective in making radical changes toward better health and never created homeostasis because they did not permanently change the structures (cells) that contain and generate energy.
I found several energetic practitioners who mitigated my pain and suffering for up to 3 days but without cure. I was very grateful for their help. If I were in pain that I could not control on my own with
diet and heat, I would again seek their help.
Yes, everything is made of electricity and light
however, cells are GROWN over time to hold, convey and generate bio-active energies. On this physical plane, without those structures (cells) there is no live self-sustaining manifestation, containment, conveyance or generation of those energies.
I have known thousands of people who had been misled to believe that energies are more important than cells. Acting on that belief resulted in no cures at all. It does not matter which came first, energy or structure (cells). Once structures are formed, it is relatively improbable that normal life and spiritual energies can immediately restructure our cells. Time and growth are prevalent in our reality.
Energies that can immediately alter physical matter are often those that can disrupt natural flows and destroy. I have found that man-made mechanical energy devices generate non-bio-energies. Those energies are usually in a large or small manner destructive to living cells. I suggest that we consume raw foods and absorb sunshine to provide everything that helps us re-energize ourselves, our cells.
The following is a miraculously natural event from Mother Earth’s kitchen of therapies that I discovered through trial and error. Renee Bentall, 47 years- young at the time, caught one of her index fingers in a grinder. It was ground including bone. Not even one cell could be saved and reattached.
I advised Ms. Bentall to apply lime juice first to open wound and surrounding area. Lime juice surrounds particles and dead cells of flesh, blood, lymph and nerves so that white blood cells would not amass in the area that could complicate healing and re-growth. I suggested that she apply coconut cream

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 10 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
over the lime juice, and apply unheated honey over the coconut cream, then lay a very thin slice of fresh beef or buffalo steak over her finger’s open wound. I asked her to cover the meat with a piece of coconut- cream-moistened gauze to prevent the meat from drying and contracting her wound. I instructed her to place a piece of plastic the size of the gauze to cover the gauze and prevent the gauze from drying, then
tape it all loosely with adhesive gauze. The following photos recorded her finger’s healing progress while Renee’ adhered to my Primal Diet and followed my advice for her finger. The first 2 photos were taken within 3 days of injury on 12 September 2007. The third and fourth photos werre taken 6 November 2007. The last 2 were taken 22 September 2008, one year after the incident.

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

What Is Our Likelihood Of Developing Cancer(s)?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
 The world’s most prominent cancers expert Dr. Samuel Epstein stated that 1 of every 2 men and 1 of every 3 women will develop cancers. I stated many times, most people get cancers 5-8 times in their lifetime. Some researchers have stated that we get cancers 6-10 times in our lifetime. We are getting cancers because of our intense reliance upon chemicals that cause cancers. Most of us may have cancers throughout our lives but not full-blown die- with cancers. Cancer is not something to fear, it is something to prevent or reverse. Cancer is our bodies’ inabilities to dissolve and discard dead cells; it is that simple. However, removing toxins that cause cancer is not easy.
When Should We Consider Medical Therapy For Our Cancers?
The pharmaceutical companies have ruled, and therefore the medical community agrees that
concentrations of approximately 50 cancer cells per million cells are “treatable” cancers. Pharmaceutical and medical fortunes abound with their diagnostic procedures and most people get sicker. As people get sicker and accept more medical treatments, pharmaceutical and medical fortunes compounds. The amount of people born after 1947 who survive beyond 7 years after medical cancer treatment is about 32%. The amount of people born after 1960 who survive beyond 7 years after cancer treatment is about 17%. Decrease in survival rate is due to increases of vaccines, medications and industrial chemicals in food and the environment. It is my opinion that chemotherapy and radiation should never be accepted, and that surgery be accepted only if tumor(s) blocks breathing, digestion, urination or defecation.
But Cancer Is Deadly, Isn’t It?

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 5 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
That is what pharmaceuticals and medicals want you to believe. However, their scare tactics are simply profit-motivated terrorism. If cancers in themselves were deadly, people would not be alive. People spend tremendous amounts of energy worrying about ailments. People worry more about cancer than any other illness. Worrying is a waste of energy and nutrients that could be utilized to reverse cancer sooner than later.
As compensation for cancer-stress, I have seen cancer sufferers do everything that increases cancer. Foods that progress cancers most (not considering additives) are high carbohydrate foods that are fried such as chips, French fries, donuts and cereals. When many cancer sufferers get upset, those become comfort foods. Comfort for what? That they will certainly suffer more and maybe die with very active cancer?
Again, cancer is nothing other than our bodies’ inability to dissolve and discard dead cells so dead cells collect and form tumors. Regardless of who comes to me with cancer(s), I tell them to accept that they will die with cancer(s) and stop worrying about it. I suggest that they do everything possible to avoid anything that causes or exacerbates their cancers and make the quality of their lives as high as possible. If they do so, the likelihood of their cancer(s) reversing increases exponentially, sometimes miraculously but most often gradually. Running to medical doctors for treatment usually exacerbates cancer and reduces life- quality. How does it make sense that out of fear and panic, we contaminate ourselves more?
I am a believer in the Hippocratic Oath’s first principal, DO NO HARM. Once when I questioned a doctor’s oath when he frequently used antibiotics, all of which destroy digestion and consequently detoxification and healing, he stated that he did not take the oath under “legal circumstances; it’s just something we pledge.” That is the sad truth. Medical and pharmaceutical industries have conditioned us to ignore the Hippocratic Oath because everything they do has side effects, short and/or long term. Everything they do causes harm to people and the environment.
Considering that 1 of every 2.5 people in our industrially poisoned society and world have “treatable” cancer(s) throughout their lives, any test is senseless. Expect that we have cancer and do everything rational to reverse it. If we want to reduce our likelihood of suffering from cancers, we have to avoid anything that causes cancers. That includes
-
avoiding processed foods and foods grown with chemicals, soaps, cosmetics and environmental pollution.
What Kind of Breast Testing Would Be Best?
If you want to check, gently palpate breast and armpits. The jobs of lymphatic glands are to neutralize, dissolve and dump toxins to be secreted or excreted from our bodies. The glands in the upper torso, especially breast and arm pits, have the most work to do because of all of the carcinogenic chemicals that enter lungs and stomach. We should expect swollen lymphatic glands as a daily part of our toxic lives. Some toxins will be dumped into the digestive tract to pass with feces or urine. Most will be secreted through skin after lymphatic systems dump neutralized and dissolved toxins under skin.
A swollen lymphatic gland is not an indication of lymphatic cancer. It is an indication that we have given that gland a toxic load and it is working very hard at its jobs to neutralize and discard waste and toxins. Never consider that a lymphatic gland is cancerous until it is as hard as rock and no longer functioning. We can palpate any swollen area of our bodies. If swollen areas are hard as rock, it is probably a protective coating after injury or it may be advanced cancer. If swelling is not hard as rock, it is simply our bodies isolating concentrations of toxins to neutralize and expel them.
However, for those diehard minds who want to know, thermographic screening measures infrared- radiation heat emitted from our bodies without discharging much EMFs into our bodies. The data is translated into anatomical images. It can register increased and intense blood flows to cancerous areas, if any exist.
If I Have Rock-Hard Swelling, What Should I Do About It/Them?
Are we going to run to the medical profession to pollute us more and drastically increase our chances of dying of painful cancers, as well as considerably reduce life-quality? Or are we going to approach it rationally, eliminating any more exposure to carcinogenic substances in food, air, water and environment, and gradually removing those toxins from our bodies that caused cancer? Remember, that if you are under 50 years young, your chances of survival after medical therapies are minimal. Your

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 6 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
chances of survival utilizing my Primal Diet are 95% or better (Dr. Elnora Van Winkle 2001).
The remedies in my books are simple but tedious and sometimes difficult. We must get the lymphatic system flowing as much and as quickly as possible without causing excessive detoxifications. Often, toxic fats from cooked oils have hardened and clogged lymphatic glands and sweat glands. It takes repeated heat applications of 102-104 degrees F. for long periods to melt them; this can take years. To help a swollen area, we can apply heat with hot-water bottle(s) through much of the night. To affect the whole body, I suggest Lymphatic Baths (see under Lymphatic Congestion in the book: We Want To Live, Revised In 2005).
Note: There is a typo in many printings of WWTL stating the baths should reach a maximum of 110 degrees F. That temperature will work to melt hardened fats in lymph, skin and surrounding tissues quicker, and perspire them through skin but it might destroy enzymes and vitamins in skin and connective tissues. Also, it is difficult to remain in baths long enough at that high temperature and most people get too exhausted to take the slow walk after bathing. It might be better to keep long lymphatic baths no lower than 102 degrees F. and no higher than 106 degrees F. Consuming the pineapple, coconut cream mixture before long lymphatic baths (from the book) will help dissolve lymphatic congestion. ________________________________________
What Would Happen If Aajonus Ate Some Cooked Meat?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
I received so many queries about what would happen if I ate cooked meat that I finally did in Laos October 2008. I had eaten one ounce cooked meat chicken in 1978. Before that, I had not eaten cooked meat since 1974. This time, I ate one ounce cooked water buffalo from a feeble elderly lady in the jungles of Laos. It was slightly spiced with her homemade hot sauce and no salt. I must say, it was delicious. I loved cooked beef when I ate it almost daily until December 1967. I was a little frightened that I would sufferer because after stomach surgery, every time I ate it, I broke out in large painful postulations from head to knees.
Within several hours after eating it, I noticed that my afternoon sleepiness increased. That night I slept 2
hours more than I normally do, losing 2 hours of wake productiveness. The most prominent reaction I had was body odor. I had forgotten that I had that odor daily 3 decades ago. I reeked and had to bath daily instead of every 5 days. I got a slight headache on the 2nd day but do not know if it had anything to do with eating cooked meat. Finally, the morning of the 5th day, I had to smell my shirt armpits to detect the odor. The odor was gone on the 6th day. That was from just one ounce of cooked meat. I am not interested enough to experiment what would happen if I ate a pound of cooked meat. __________________________________________

Subscriber’s question: What Do We Do About Emerging Plagues? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Dear Aajonus, Your news letters are excellent! Thank you. I do encourage subscribers. After seeing the information on a plague emerging in the Grand Canyon (Plague emerges in Grand Canyon, kills biologist - USATODAY.com), I was wondering if you could address the topic regarding what could happen in the future so we could be prepared by facts and not the propaganda of fear. Recently I heard on the news that there could be a world-wide flu epidemic. Could you please address how to handle man-made biologicals? Looking forward to your facts and wisdom. Peg, Omaha
Aajonus: Hi, Peg. A manufactured story is a fabrication to get people to believe something that has not been proved true. Such stories were manufactured at the behest of Knudsen Dairy when they paid doctors and writers to develop stories about raw milk causing tuberculosis and other diseases. Knudsen wanted people to be afraid of raw milk so that Knudsen could sell its expensive pasteurized milk that few wanted and most feared. Their manufactured stories reversed the fear, causing people to fear raw milk because of disease.
The first indication of a manufactured story is the factless often glib nature of the entire article. The Grand-Canyon story is not only factless, it is outrageous. First question to answer about this article is: How many cases of illness and accompanying deaths does it take to label an illness a plague? Isn't it ludicrous for someone to call an illness, as in the Grand Canyon event, a plague? The theoretical nature of a plague is that the illness is supposed to be easily transferred from one person to another.
That Grand Canyon story seems to have been designed to frighten people into consuming antibiotics just like the 34 people who came into contact with the biologist. The author claimed that all of the biologist’s contacts were treated with antibiotics even though none had any symptoms of anything. Secondly, the author wants us to assume that dead animal carcasses (other than human) can produce bacteria that can burst into the air and transfer from animal to human. Furthermore, the writer had no scientific proof of any disease from the lion that was active and growing in the biologist.
Also, notice that he mentioned some of the diseases (HIV, West Nile virus and SARS) that have been proved to be developed by military for germ warfare as proof of present-day epidemics. (See Dr. Leonard Horowitz’ info for the evidence). That is another case of someone who should not be allowed to have another article of his published.
Regarding a flu epidemic, flu is already omnipotent. Because most humans are too toxic to cleanse their bodies naturally with bacteria, parasites and fungus, their bodies utilize viruses. Flu is predominantly viral detoxification. However, understand that viruses are not alive, have no nucleus, respirator or digestive systems. They are as contagious as soap. That is what viruses are: protein structures that dissolve. They are solvents, soaps manufactured by cells, intracellularly.
The supposed Spanish flu epidemic of 1918 occurred when the first flu vaccine was made available to the public. Everyone who got the flu and died had had the vaccine and medical therapy for vaccine side effects. Do you think that the manufacturer and all of the doctors involved were going to admit their mistakes? So they blamed it on the Spanish flu and vermin.
I know some of my readers might think that I have gone off the deep end with the following but when you have seen and gathered facts as I have about pharmaceuticals and medical establishment, the conspiracy theory is valid. Dr. Samuel Epstein has stated on numerous occasions that those 2 industries are in a conspiracy to continue cancer for profits, rather than stop it.
I believe we are about to see an epidemic, the first of this century. It will be from disease created by the avian flu vaccine that is about to be issued to the public with millions of dollars of free and paid press, mainly paid with tax dollars, warning of the avian flu that does not exist and never did. I visited several fields in Thailand and Vietnam where they had slaughtered all of the chickens but none of us could find any virus that was not common to farm- crammed anti-biotic fed chickens. It was publicity development, preparing us to be fearfully willing consumers of the avian flu vaccine that will hit the

market any day. (Avian Flu Fright: Politically Timed for Global Iatrogenocide by Dr. Leonard Horowitz.)
If we get flu, we should rejoice. Flu is cleaning our bodies. On page 148 of my book The Recipe For Living Without Disease, I gave my daily dietary suggestions to
help flu detoxification run their wonderful course to create better health within our bodies and minds. ________________________________________
  Recent Research Proving That Friendly Bacteria Protect Against Type 1 Diabetes
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Researchers have shown that mice exposed to common stomach bacteria are protected against the development of type 1 diabetes. The findings support the “probiotics theory” (the theory that bacteria does good things for health) and "hygiene hypothesis" (the theory that lack of exposure to parasites and bacteria in our sterile lives may lead to increased risk of diseases).
In Type I diabetes, it was found that patients given common stomach bacteria, such as occur in raw milk, patient's pancreatic cells that produce insulin were reconstructed and regenerated. This proves that exposure

How To Remove Fear Of Microbes And Embrace Them For Improved Digestion And Health
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
  Probably the most blatant proof that microbes are not any animal’s enemy is that all animals frequently, daily, lick each other’s feces from rectums. That activity is only disgusting to humans. Why? Because we are indoctrinated to believe that bowel microbes are pathogenic (disease-causing). We are indoctrinated to believe that many digestive and janitorial microbes cause disease. However, we don’t have it drummed into our heads that industrial chemicals, including medicines especially vaccines, cause 90% of all diseases. I have discussed microbes in several issues since 2006.
The theory that microbes cause disease is one of the greatest fallacies of our “advanced” society. As I have stated many times before, we are advanced technologically but most of us are in disease-abyss ignorance regarding health. People administering health information and treatment are people who know nothing about health or methods to achieve it. They have been taught disease and disease-chemistry that microbes are the greatest causes of disease. How
many doctors do you know look for toxicology when someone goes to them with intestinal or other health complaints? How many cases do they check for microbes? Almost all cases. If tests find any microbe, usually without any in depth science, instantly the microbe is named the main cause of disease. That pertains to most diseases.
Understanding how our bodies digest naturally is often all that is necessary to eliminate fear of microbes and embrace them. In healthy humans, digestive acids, juices and enzymes prepare food for digestion by breaking chunks of food into small particles. Digestive microbes, including bacteria and parasites, then eat food particles. Microbes’ excrement and secretions are our food just like milk cultures (bacteria) predigest milk and the cultures’ wastes are our nutrients. Please realize that proper and efficient digestion occurs in no other way and that those and trillions of other microbes are our best symbiotic friends. With their help, we spend little energy and resources digesting food.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 2 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
ULTIMATELY, WE EAT URINE AND FECES OF MICROBES TO OBTAIN NUTRIENTS FROM FOOD FOR OUR CELLS TO BE THE HEALTHIEST WE AND OUR CELLS CAN BE, WHILE SPENDING LEAST ENERGY AND RESOURCES DIGESTING FOOD. If that is disgusting to us, we have been harmfully miseducated.
Food additives, pesticides, herbicides and medication, especially antibiotics and vaccines, destroy intestinal microbes. If we have destroyed our intestinal microbes, our bodies have to intensely increase the amount of digestive acids, fluids and enzymes to digest and absorb food. That process is very taxing on our bodies’ energies and resources. Most of us cannot produce enough digestive fluids and enzymes to accomplish those tasks properly. Digestive acids, fluids and enzymes are never efficient enough to fractionate food molecules into a balanced diet for most cells. Especially deficient are our brains and nervous systems.
E.coli are responsible for the final stages of digestion. E.coli and other bowel microbes digest proteins and fats into the finite particles necessary to feed our brains and nervous systems. Many people suffer depression resulting from low populations of bowel microbes even if they eat the best of diets, including my Primal Diet. It does not matter how good your food is if you cannot digest food well enough to assimilate it. However, even with poor digestion, foods on my Primal Diet will not add insult to injury and deficiencies.
We have to improve digestion by feeding, repopulating and supplementing our digestive microbes. Eating raw foods with all of their natural bacteria supplies us with much needed beneficial bacteria to facilitate digestion. However, that is not enough to develop optimal health for people with poor digestion caused by low intestinal microbes.
All naturally living animals eat lots of dirt with everything they eat, ingesting soil microbes that help digestion. Soil bacteria, such as from earth worms, help digest animal, insect and plant material in soil so that they can be recycled to feed plants. In fact, earthworms produce wonderful soil bacteria that help human digestion quickly. I know people who grow earth warms and eat the black rich soil in which earthworms are grown. As other naturally living
animals, we can increase our intestinal microbes by eating dirt and/or clay.
Improve Digestion With Probiotics
Many people call soil bacteria Probiotics. Some effective probiotics are made from dirt which is rich in worm casings (feces and urine). They are barely effective when processed and pressed into pills. They are somewhat effective as powder as long as they were not heated over 92° F (37° C) in drying processes. Higher heat will alter and eventually kill most soil organisms. Probiotics would be more effective if they were sun-dried below 82° F (28° C). Probiotics would be most effective fresh and alive in moist dirt and clay.
Don’t expect to supplement your microbe needs from plastic-covered or plastic-contained compost piles. When plastic-covered or plastic-contained compost piles reach temperatures up to 168° F (76° C), most soil microbes are killed. The highest temperature of compost depends on which organic wastes are composted. Low heat compost will render the best soil microbes. Some people produce earthworm-rich soil in wood-covered or slate- covered, sunken-in-the-ground old porcelain bathtubs full of earthworms in their yards. Some worm- growers use wooden boxes inlayed in the ground. Containers are used so that worms do not migrate away from their worm ranches. People eat a little of the dirt every day or every other day. Some eat earthworms with dirt.
Another way to supplement intestinal microbes is to eat the small and large intestines of organically grown pigs. Our digestive tracts are more similar to pigs than other primates. Healthy pigs and humans harbor the Trichuris suis whipworm that makes digestion and assimilation of food optimal. Dr. Joel Weinstock of Iowa University proved that pigs which are kept too clean lacked Trichuris suis and were very sick and lethargic. His experiments proved that implanting the much maligned Trichuris suis parasite into pigs and humans with severe and long-term digestive diseases cured them in 5 out of 6 cases within days. Trichinosis is not the dangerous parasitical disease that we have been brainwashed into believing. Trichuris suis is our best digestive partner. Truchuris suis has been used to cure one of the worst intestinal diseases, namely Crohn’s

(http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/articlerender.fcgi ?artid=1774382).
If you live in a city, you probably will not find non-contaminated dirt. If you live in a rural area where pesticides, herbicides and other chemicals are sprayed or manufactured, you will not find healthy non-contaminated soil. Packaged commercial top soils are usually cooked, steamed or chemically contaminated to destroy microbes and dehydrate them for lighter-weight shipping. If you do not have access to non-pollution-contaminated, organic, non- steamed, non-kiln-dried and non-sanitized top soil, I recommend supplementing soil microbes (probiotics) with Terramin clay to promote and improve digestion.
Terramin clay is mined from an extinct ancient thermal spring in a California desert (www.terraminclay.com). Terramin clay is mined where the spring never exceeded 99° F (37° C) so phosphorus, which is cauterized about 99° F (37° C) and above, is raw and stable. Most other clays are mined from lava beds where temperatures from 1,300° F to 2,200° F (700° C to 1,200° C) had cauterized all of the minerals. Those clays are laden with lead, mercury and other heavy toxic metals that too often become free-radicals when consumed.
To prepare clay as a probiotics supplement, I suggest that you pour and stir 4 oz of Terramin clay into a glass jar with 5 ounces of good mineral water that was bottled in glass, not plastic. Put a lid on it
but loosely. Let stand for 4-5 days in a dark cupboard and beneficial bacteria will flourish. Stir the clay/water mixture every time before eating it. If using naturally carbonated bottled water, carbonation must be removed because it will destroy microbes. You can remove carbonation by pouring the water into a jar and shake it until all the bubbles are gone before you mix it with clay.
For poor digestion that does not stem from Crohn’s disease, I suggest consuming 1-2 tablespoons moist clay daily at the same time you consume vegetable juices or milk. For children with poor digestion that does not stem from Crohn’s, I suggest 1-2 teaspoons daily. When digestion improves substantially, I suggest reducing clay consumption to once to thrice weekly.
For adults and children with Crohn’s disease, I suggest consuming 8-30 raw eggs daily as well as consuming probiotics such as moist clay and/or pigs intestines. Our stomachs and intestines digest raw eggs eaten by themselves in about 30 minutes with very little digestive energies or resources spent. Eggs supply our intestines with rich proteins, fats, vitamins and other nutrients quickly and efficiently to cleanse and heal intestines as quickly as possible.
Another method to increase digestive microbes is to eat high meat. See information about and methods to make high meat in my recipe book pages 148, and 174-177. ___________________________________________
 Subscriber’s question: Are Raw Miso And Shoyu Healthy Sauces? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Dear Aajonus, I have been buying and consuming miso and shoyu sauces from my club coop thinking it was healthy. I know they are made with soy but since they are fermented and not raw, I assumed they are they okay for me to use with my raw meats? Are they healthy? John, Los Angeles
Aajonus: Both miso and shoyu are soybean products. Miso is paste and shoyu is liquid; both are produced for flavoring other foods. Both are made using salt. Shoyu is extremely high in salt. Kojikin fungus and
salt are used to ferment soy beans because humans cannot digest raw soybeans. The fungus predigests soybeans like bacteria predigest milk however, soybeans have a poison that humans and fowl cannot neutralize as herbivores can. Salt is used to destroy poisons in soybeans. If the enzymes from herbivores that neutralize soybean-poison were utilized in the fermentation process, miso and shoyu could be okay sauces. However, the taste would be unappetizing to most people. So lots of salt, which is cheap and flavorful but toxic, is utilized instead. I have written many things about the negatives of salt.

There is only one illness for which I have suggested only a few grains of salt weekly for several months to several years and that is adrenal exhaustion. People with true adrenal exhaustion are so weak that literally they cannot get out of bed or off the couch.
There have been a few reports that both sauces prevent certain forms of cancer. Those tests did not take into account that the human subjects ate minimal miso and shoyu and ate lots of sashimi and/or sushi (raw fish). Also, the methods to induce certain forms of cancer in the laboratory animals that supported the theory that the soy products prevented or cured were

extremely suspect and paid for by producers of soy products.
It is my conclusion that miso and Shoyu, as long as salt is utilized to make them, are anti-healthy for people who seek optimal health. I created and presented 82 sauce recipes in my recipe book. Each can be made 3-5 different ways. That is about 400 sauces that can keep our palates culinarily entertained, satisfied and happy. Choose the ones you like and make several different ones so all you have to do is reach in the refrigerator and add them to your meats (red, poultry and fish). _________________________________________
SUPERFOODS?! For Vegetarians And Vegans Or Who?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
“Dear Aajonus, I have heard so much about superfoods and their benefits. What’s your experience and what do you think about them?” Samantha, Montana
Aajonus: Are there such things as superfoods? Gogi berries, cocoa beans, nibs and powder, noni juice and powder, maca root powder, acai berries and powder, hemp seed powder, camu camu berries and powder, green-tea extract, blue mangosteen, cod liver and fish oils, green powders and pills made from green grasses and their juices and algae such as spirulina, and chlorella are all claimed as raw superfoods by many people in the raw-food movements. I found that it is mainly within the vegetarian and vegan raw-food groups that people seek superfoods. It is helpful to understand why they must have superfoods.
Consider that humans have acidic and short digestive tracts producing acidic digestive fluids and harboring acidic bacteria, and 80% of teeth are designed for cutting, extremely similar to carnivores. Herbivores have mainly alkaline and very long digestive tracts producing vast amounts of alkaline- digestive juices and bacteria, and all teeth are molars for grinding vegetation. Rarely are there healthy long-term raw vegetarians and vegans. Usually, the more committed ones hit a wall at 7 years. Others that cheat may spend a decade or two before they hit the wall. Often, the wall is serious disease such as
cancer. Half of my cancer patients were long-term vegetarians and vegans.
Ninety-nine percent of human vegetarians and vegans cannot get enough protein and fats, and lack minerals and an array of nutrients from their diets. Ninety-nine percent of their bodies are unfulfilled and unsatisfied. I know from 6 years of subjective and objective experience as a raw “balanced-diet- eating vegetarian evolved to vegan.” I and ALL of the vegetarians and vegans I knew were usually malnourished with eating disorders. I adhered to it 99.9% of the time. Others were much less tenacious. However, occasionally, uncontrollably yet consciously, I stretched and contorted what foods were truly raw, trying to force reality to conform to my adopted concepts of vegetarianism and veganism.
I did not realize the irrationality of believing that humans were optimally healthy as raw-food vegetarians and vegans. I had accepted the false information that our digestive tracts were more alkaline like other primates, and herbivores. I was so malnourished, anytime anyone told me about a superfood such as amaranth “grain of Egyptian gods”, I consumed it. However, all such promises of superfoods resulted in my slow but steady deterioration to 96 pounds at 5’8”.
In photograph below, it is easy to spot the Primal- Diet-eating athlete Scott Wheeler of Australia with all of his muscles and stable constitution. All of the

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 5 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
other runners are vegetarians or vegans, some mostly raw and some not. Scott won that race at the Raw
Games in Hawaii November 2008.
 Ninety percent or more of all of currently purported superfoods are processed and not truly raw. They are not fresh so they lack enzymes. Whenever foods are dried, bioactive enzymes are inactivated like a dead auto battery. They cannot be resurrected any more than we can resurrect ourselves from dead. Therefore, even dried fruits are not really raw because they lack bioactive enzymes.
Although Native North American Indians lacked our laboratory sciences, they knew the inferior nature of dried food. They had empirical science called experience. Empirical awareness and knowledge is much more valuable, containing wisdom rather than conclusions based on chemical theories and hypotheses.
Each summer, Native Americans made large supplies of a mixture of dried meat and fat, sometimes adding berries. It is called pemmican. It would be eaten in case they could not find fresh kill. Eating pemmican would prevent starvation, fatigue and bodily deterioration. The process of making pemmican was time-consuming, both hunting and preparing it by drying, beating it until it became flour, soaking it in the sun with warmed fat, drying it in the sun and sitting near it and occasionally pressing it into 90 pound dried hard blocks. By spring, if they did not consume it, they buried it because they knew it would not be optimum for their
health.
Let’s take a look at the processes that so-called
superfoods undergo to see if they are truly raw. Noni juice is chemically or heat processed to prevent fermentation in bottles. The chemical process utilizes kerosene derivative or alcohol. Both are natural but toxic. All “superfoods” that are powdered must be thoroughly dried so they do not cake and stick in the machines while being ground. When hard foods such as cocoa beans and roots are ground into flour, the machines reach a temperature of at least 176 ̊ F (80 ̊ C), cauterizing the foods.
Cauterization seals the food and makes it harder. It is therefore harder to liquefy and takes more time to digest in the digestive tract. Also, any metallic minerals in the foods will be released by the heat and be more toxic. Claims that such foods are 100% raw and have more antioxidants are false, after drying and cauterizing/cooking. They have the opposite effect in varying degrees.
Whole leaf grasses and fruits also have to be completely dried and hardened for powdering. Rarely are any grasses sun-dried. Usually, they are kiln-dried at temperatures above 118 ̊ F (48 ̊ C) and up to 138 ̊ F (59 ̊ C). They are also subjected to the same friction-heat from machines during the powdering processes that reach at least 176 ̊ F (80 ̊ C). They are not raw because all enzymes are destroyed and the

 The Primal Diet Newsletter - page 6 © 2008 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
food is cauterized/cooked. Also, we are not herbivores that can properly digest vegetable matter, especially when dried. The only exception is chlorella; I have experimented and found it to be somewhat beneficial. Commercial liquid green teas are all steeped in boiling water.
Sometimes, kerosene derivatives, distilled alcohol or other chemicals are sprayed on those foods to breakdown the oils and force them to dry faster. Since kerosene and alcohol are natural, they may legally call the product “All Natural.” They know they mislead consumers and they do not care. Their interest is to supply products for abundant profits rather than produce quality products for which they obtain less profit.
The same is true of acai, camu camu, gogi, and noni. There are many beneficial claims about those foods so most people who consume them believe my analyses of those foods are wrong. However, consider that people feel better because most of those foods are high in carbohydrates and raise the blood and nerve sugar levels causing hyperactivity.
Raised blood and nerve sugar levels are not indications of health. In fact, they are indications of bodily harm. Columbia University found that we store 70-90% of Advanced Glycation End-products (AGEs), byproducts from spent high-carbohydrates, in our bodies for a lifetime. AGEs are cancer feeding byproducts that cause many ill effects, including arterial sclerosis by attaching to venous and arterial walls.
Also, infusions of powders cause increases in hormones such as adrenalin, also elevating energy levels but not to healthful benefits long-term. All endocrine glandular production is for emergency purposes only. For instance, adrenaline is for fight and/or flight. We are supposed to derive our energy from foods that supply fats, proteins with little carbohydrate, rich in enzymes and bacteria. If we were to eat proper raw foods rich in fats and proteins, and digest and assimilate them properly, most of us would have improved energy and stamina. After many years of eating a proper diet, we would develop tremendous energy and stamina. Like primitive Eskimos, we could live happily in the most strenuous climates and environments.
Cocoa beans (cacao), nibs and powder contain theobromine which is similar to caffeine and a nerve
irritant. When cooked and/or processed, that neural irritant is a free radical. It often stimulates hormones such as adrenaline, testosterone and estrogen, making people think their new energy is healthful.
The only truly raw cocoa bean retains it moist skin and must be hand peeled. In small amounts it may be briefly ground in a coffee-bean grinder or blender without reaching high temperatures to retain its rawness and nutrition. I discussed the benefits of eating small amounts of raw cocoa beans in the earlier PD newsletter issue Vol. 7, Oct. 30, 2007. I have a correction to that. Cocoa beans do not contain the nerve stimulants/irritants caffeine or theophylline. They contain theobromine of the same family as caffeine and theophylline.
Fish and cod liver oils must have all proteins removed on which bacteria can feed, according to USFDA standards. That requires heat and/or chemical processes to separate and extract proteins. Two companies claim they produce their fish oils without heat or chemicals but they add processed oils as preservatives. Although that is a small amount, those preservative oils have been heat and chemically processed. How much fish oil is lost to the heated and processed preservative oils? How much of the fish oil will be contaminated by the processed preservative oils? We can glean an idea by the fact that they add enough to prevent the oil from being predigested by natural bacteria. If all of the oil is prevented from predigestion, how much will we not be able to digest? How much will the contaminated preservative oils contaminate us?
As a civilized race whose members eat processed and chemicalized-food, we require air-conditioning and heat in our homes and transportation to sustain us or we cannot work, play or eat. Our perspiration would reek. So many people I know who exercise reek of old stinky sauces, especially tomato sauces. They have a body odor like the outdoor garbage bin of fast-food Italian restaurants or pizza parlors on a hot summer day. That odor is from chemically produced flavorings and fragrances added to tomato sauces to make flavor and odor consistent. Civilized man is now the weakest organism on this planet.
“Superfood” is a misnomer. All lack enzymes and little can be digested and assimilated. Some contain nerve irritants and other chemicals that cause the body to produce hormones that flow through blood

and nerves, elevating a sense of well-being without elevated true health. Therefore, the body's responses to "superfoods" indicate toxic responses. Calling any processed food superfood is the same as calling supplements magic bullets. However, if I were to
judge any food as superfood, one would be honey that was unheated above 92 ̊ F (33 ̊ C). Another would be bone marrow from completely organically raised animals, fresh and raw in bones. ___________________________________________

15th Edition; February 28, 2009
I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

Care To Have A Piss Of A Drink With Me?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
   I begin this issue with humor instead of at the end. Since the article was written with the same wit I most often embrace, rather than rewriting, I quote it.
Welcome to your new vending machine...
Jeremy Page, Delhi
Does your Pepsi lack pep? Is your Coke not the real thing? India's Hindu nationalist movement apparently has the answer: a new soft drink made from cow urine.
The bovine brew is in the final stages of development by the Cow Protection Department of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS), India's biggest and oldest Hindu nationalist group, according to the man who makes it.
Om Prakash, the head of the department, said the drink – called "gau jal", or "cow water" – in Sanskrit was undergoing laboratory tests and would be launched "very soon, maybe by the end of this year". "Don't worry, it won't smell like urine and will be tasty too," he told The Times from his headquarters in Hardwar, one of four holy cities on the River Ganges. "Its USP will be that it's going to be very healthy. It
won't be like carbonated drinks and would be devoid of any toxins."
The drink is the latest attempt by the RSS – which was founded in 1925 and now claims eight million members – to cleanse India of foreign influence and promote its ideology of Hindutva, or Hindu-ness. Hindus revere cows and slaughtering them is illegal in most of India. Cow dung is traditionally used as a fuel and disinfectant in villages, while cow urine and dung are often consumed in rituals to "purify" those on the bottom rungs of the Hindu caste system.
In 2001, the RSS and its offshoots – which include the opposition Bharatiya Janata Party – began promoting cow urine as a cure for ailments ranging from liver disease to obesity and even cancer.
The movement has often been accused of using more violent methods, such as killing 67 Christians in the eastern state of Orissa last year, and assaulting women in a pub in Mangalore last month. It also has a history of targeting foreign business in India, as in 1994, when it organised a nationwide boycott of multinational consumer goods, including Pepsi and Coca Cola.

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 15th Edition - page 2 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
The cola brands are popular in India, now one of their biggest markets, but have struggled in recent years to shake off allegations, which they deny, that they contain dangerous levels of pesticide.
Mr Prakash said his drink, by contrast, was made mainly of cow urine, mixed with a few medicinal and ayurvedic herbs. He said it would be "cheap", but declined to give further details about its price or ingredients until it was officially launched. He insisted, however, that it would be able to compete with the American cola brands, even with their enormous advertising budgets. "We're going to give them good competition as our drink is good for mankind," he said. "We may also think of exporting it."
Those readers who may be a bit squeamish about drinking cow urine should consider that urine is nothing other than blood serum with some ammonia added. Kidneys produce ammonia to separate red and white blood cells from blood serum so we do not become anemic whenever we urinate. In healthy animals like revered cows in India, urine is rich in proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals and enzymes. In India, where there are many vegetarians, they drink urine to recycle and supplement proteins. Since all soft drinks are presently chemicals only, cow urine drink sounds very nutritious. ________________________________________
Subscriber’s question: Athletes And Longevity On Primal Diet by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Are [there] any athletes who eat this diet or any cultures of long lived people. Any ideas where I might try to find out? Ronit
There are many athletes on my Primal Diet. Some follow it exclusively and others up to 60%. There are 2 high-school tennis champions who predominantly follow Primal Diet. I am not at liberty to identify the professional athletes or movie stars on my diet because they or their agents, coaches and managers have asked me to keep it confidential because of probable media and public ridicule.
Senior martial artist Pem Wall recorded and charted his heart rate within minutes of concluding an hour of intense jump rope prior to and after eating Primal Diet. His heart-beat rates within minutes after exercise before PD averaged 176 and while eating PD averaged 108. That is remarkable savings to his heart and metabolism. Gaining and maintaining muscle tone is very easy on PD.
The last time I saw an article that mentioned longevity of primitives was in 1971 issue of National Geographic. They interviewed people who lived to between 128-150 years old. They asked questions of couples who had lived together for up to 118(?) years, showing that both men and women lived healthful long lives with wonderful relationships. I believe that our present authorities do not want us to
know what is possible for health and longevity because it contradicts everything we are told and lead to believe about health and longevity.
There are many tribes on the 7,107 islands of the Philippines. The government threatens to jail people who visit primitive tribes. Government employees claim that many tribes are dangerous and/or cannibals. It appeared to me as I searched for tribes that that government used the same tactics to possess and usurp indigenous resources as those used by the USA government, claiming Native American Indians were savages who deserved to be exterminated.
After 5 weeks of trying to get government permission and trying to find primitive tribes, in November 2008, I found a tribe in Philippines. Without government permission but with the help of a former tribal member, I visited members of a tribe. That was possible because I had helped a leukemic Philippine baby within 3 days recover on raw milk.
I was privileged to meet and interview 4 members of the tribe for one day. My translator had learned English after leaving the tribe only 7 years prior to our meeting. The man with whom I interviewed most said he was about 80 years old but looked a stunning 40-something. The 3 women said they were about late 40’s but looked late 20s to early 30s. They had impressive stalky constitutions and strong white teeth that looked flawless. For some

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 15th Edition - page 3 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
bizarre reason, I expected to receive information about their diet that fit Weston Prices description. However, he told me that they ate only RAW food and only three foods: fish, coconuts and occasionally either banana or mango. Raw fish and coconut was their primary diet.
I was shocked. I had imagined that any tribe who lived on raw fish and coconut would be slender. However, these people were thicker and taller than most Asians. I think that that was the most exhilarating validation of longterm rewards of my
Primal Diet, even though their fat-enriched food was coconut rather than animal fats. Since we are so toxic, coconut pulp is most often indigestible and the juices and fats detoxifying rather than building. From 1980-1982, I observed 16 people whose diet were mainly raw meats and coconut. They suffered frequently and were relatively malnourished. In our toxic world, I found that we get well better with less pain when we eat raw animal fats.

The ongoing propaganda that microbes cause disease continues without scientific proof. The worst part of it is that people believe the microbe/disease myth the same as people believed the clergy that spirits and ghosts caused bad behavior and disease in people during the Inquisition. The all-encompassing beliefs were formed from FEAR, from imaginative stories of gross possession and, in the case of microbes, contamination. Fear makes most people irrational, illogical, non-pragmatic, ridiculous and even stupid. Yes, stupid is a harsh judgment but is it wrong judgment?
Consider that as clergy believed spirits possessed and caused diseases in human beings, medical professionals embrace the myth that microbes possess and disease beings. There has been no empirical laboratory test proving that notion. The tests they point to as proof have been done in artificial environments where bacteria mutate and behave differently.
In January 2009, I was a guest on The Doctors TV show. Host Dr. Stork blurted to the audience that they should definitely not eat any raw meat because bacteria could make them deathly ill. His medical advice at end of the show, titled something like The 10 Most Unusual Health Methods, was don’t eat raw meat because it will cause disease. At no time in the entire 5 minutes of my segment on Raw Meat Diet, were any of the 4 doctors rational. They spoke from fear, not personal knowledge or empirical science.
After Dr. Stork made the statement the first time, I asked him how many people he observed who ate raw meat. He did not answer and continued his
adamancy against eating raw meat. I stated that I had observed 25,000 people who had eaten raw meat without ill effects. He stated that he had seen people in Emergency during his internship dying of bacterial contamination from something they ate. However, he did not arrive at that conclusion by logic or rationale. He was instructed by his teachers that when microbes were and are found in bodies, those microbes usually caused the present, past or future disease. Medicine has its pat list of microbes. Much like clergy during the Inquisition tried to dispel goblins under Church rule and authority, under medical authority Dr. Stork tries to burn, cook and poison microbes and people while believing he will eliminate disease. He believes whole-heartedly in that myth.
Notice that all microbes blamed are in nature. In fact, they are nature. The Military Industrial Complex needs an enemy to frighten people into spending money on and fighting expensive, polluting, crippling and deadly wars; the medical profession, spurred by the pharmaceutical industry, needs an enemy that people will fear so they follow orders irrationally, illogically, ignorantly and even stupidly. Consider that former president 5-star General Dwight Eisenhower claimed the Military Industrial Complex was truly our biggest enemy economically and socially. Pharma/Medicine should be viewed identically. Their touted enemy is nature. Notice some of their terminology: Swine flu, Bird flu, Monkey AIDS, Rat lungworm, and animal rabies. To sell poisonous flu vaccines, they scare people into accepting and promoting that thousands of people will be in danger of gross diseases.
Home-grown Vegetables Blamed For Disease

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 15th Edition - page 4 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
Since nature is all around us, people who believe that microbes cause disease will imagine threats are everywhere. The establishment even got shallow President Ronald Reagan to proclaim that the sun caused skin cancer. If sun is responsible for skin cancer, why didn’t Africans and Asians who are very dark from sunshine develop skin cancers prior to WWII and the advent of mass vaccination? I remember a response from one journalist at the time stating, Reagan went from prostate cancer to skin cancer of his nose; we know where his nose has been. Although grossly funny, the analogy is pertinent.
The latest assaults blame our food supply. In the early 1900’s, they blamed raw milk for typhoid and tuberculosis from myths created by the pasteurized milk industry. Education and the media continue to disseminate that myth today. In 2007, they blamed sickness and deaths on E.coli from spinach. In January 2009, they blamed several severe diseases on eating fresh vegetables from home gardens. They developed the story that rats running around in your garden leave larvae that, when you eat your vegetables (even when washed), can overcome your body within days or weeks and cause serious illness. (I included the news article following this article because I do not know how long it will be available online.) Are we to believe such notions? How many creatures in this world eat such larvae every day without washing their vegetables and do not suffer such disease?
Consider that pharmaceutics ALL have side effects. Some people have immediate reactions to them, others have longterm reactions and others seem unaffected. Why do all pharmaceuticals have side effects whether realized or not? They are made of and/or with toxic substances. Consider that accumulation of such substances causes diseases in animals during laboratory experiments. Are we to believe that microbes that have not caused disease throughout millions of years suddenly make us ill and kill us? Maybe a more rational look at the evidence will remove our indoctrinated fears.
Since we became a society with industrial toxins in our medicines, environments, food, water and air, is it likely that the pervasive diseases are from industrial toxins? We have thousands of experiments proving that industrial toxins cause disease. To name a few, coal dust and fumes cause many respiratory problems including emphysema and cancers. Chromium 6 causes myriads of cancers and diseases.
Mercury causes many neurological, digestive and lymphatic diseases and death. Radioactive material and man-made radiation cause bone and blood diseases and cancers. The long list still does not cover all of the diseases caused by the gradual longterm accumulation of industrial toxins.
I was given the death sentence 42 years ago for stomach, blood, bone and lymphatic cancers. I received a vagotomy and was told never to eat anything raw or it would kill me. For 41 years I have done just the opposite. I have eaten everything raw. I have eaten at least 1,000 raw eggs coated with poultry feces, 120 raw meats containing various parasites, fungus and bacteria as documented on Ripley’s Believe It Or Not (aired July 17, 2001), and at least 10,000 cups of raw milk with goat, cow and sheep feces. Instead of getting more diseases, I have reversed my myriad of diseases, including cancers and Type 1 diabetes. There are literally thousands of intelligent and rational people who testify to improved health by eating and drinking “unsanitary” rawfoods.
Who benefits from accusing our food of causing disease? Manufacturers of processed food and chemicals profit from that. Consider that until the last 2 decades, some people - including medical - have been telling people that raw fresh vegetables and fruits will help health. A decline of processed-food consumption resulted. With these new tales that vegetables cause disease and death, people are brainwashed into fearing raw fruits and vegetables and will think cooked and processed foods are safer. Chemical industries will flourish because people will use more chemical poisons, for instance chlorine to wash raw foods and kitchens, and put pesticides on crops.
I witnessed entire cities of “third-world” people living in squalor and animal waste without getting disease. It has been their lifestyle for centuries. The people who are diseased are those who adopted medications, especially vaccines and other industrial pollution. Most farm-raised people live in and around animal waste and microbe-rich environments and are much healthier than their city counterparts. Also, as I have stated before: even though they have limited gene pools, Amish and Mennonites do not suffer any autism because they refuse vaccines. Primitive tribes did not know autism, Ebola or AIDS until medical evangelists gave them vaccines.

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 15th Edition - page 5 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
Regardless of those facts and overwhelming evidence that industrial toxins cause at least 90% of present diseases, medical professionals and fearful people irrationally, illogically, ignorantly and stupidly continue to blame nature, its animals and microbes. Vomit and diarrhea result from accumulated toxins that the body routinely eliminates quickly and efficiently as possible by vomit and diarrhea. Vomit and diarrhea are not the results of microbes! Microbes are symptoms of toxic damage to cells. Microbes are the janitors. They are part of the cure that follows detoxification. When will we stop the microbe witch-hunts of modern times?
I implore everyone to ignore any medical advice as biased and self-serving. I beseech everyone to disregard any medical advice about health because they are trained exclusively about drugs and disease, not health. Taking medical advice about health is like taking financial advice from guys flipping hamburgers at fast-food joints. I entreat everyone to eat microbe-rich raw foods.
(Article that appeared in a Hawaiian newspaper:
Disease is blamed on home-grown veggies by Gary Kubota
POSTED: 01:30 a.m. HST, Jan 17, 2009
A second Big Island resident is in a coma with rat lungworm disease, a rare ailment that can cause significant pain and trauma, including paralysis and blindness. Graham McCumber, 24, of Kapoho has been in intensive care at the Queen's Medical Center for the past few days, according to a family member and friend.
McCumber, a construction worker who also worked on an organic farm, is among three Big Island people recently afflicted with the disease. One of them, 38-year-old Silka Strauch of Black Sands, was admitted to Hilo Medical Center on Dec. 8 and has been in a coma for weeks.
Strauch's friend Zsolt Halda, 34, also of Black Sands, was being cared for by his mother at a hotel on the Big Island, after being released from the hospital. Halda said he and Strauch probably contracted the disease after eating vegetables containing arvae of a slug that carries the rat lungworm.
Like Halda and Strauch, McCumber grew his own vegetables.
"To have a 24-year-old kid dying from eating a salad is beyond my comprehension," said McCumber's friend Dennis Letvin. McCumber's uncle Geoff Rauch said Graham, who was noticeably sick by Dec. 18, has sustained a lot of brain damage. "It doesn't look good," Rauch said.
Rauch said he has known other people who have contracted the disease, but none as severe.
"I think everyone is taken aback by this," Rauch said.
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, most victims recover from the disease. But the critical condition of McCumber and Strauch points out the potential for extreme consequences.
The disease occurs when parasitic worms are passed from rat feces to slugs or snails and then to people.
The worms usually die after several weeks but can cause significant pain and damage to the nervous system and, in some instances, paralysis, blindness and death, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Letvin, an organic farmer, said with economic hard times, people turning to backyard gardening should be aware of the dangers of growing leafy vegetables without taking precautions.
"My concern is we night be hammering nails on our children's coffins," he said.
Letvin said he has pulled out all of his leafy vegetables and thrown them away because there was nothing in the world worth the suffering from the disease.
He said he hopes government officials will work on a program to eliminate the rats and snails that carry the rat lungworm disease. There is no diagnostic test that definitely confirms the presence of the disease, short of finding the parasite, and physicians rely partially on the likelihood of exposure through a patient's food history, according to state epidemiologist Dr. Sarah Park.
There is no medical treatment for the disease, and physicians treat the symptoms

with pain relievers for aches and steroids for inflammation, Park said earlier this month. Park said people cultivating home-grown vegetables need to clean them leaf by leaf,
and warned that a species of slug on the Big Island has tiny larvae, about 1 to 2 millimeters long. ________________________________________
Multiple Lacerations Healed Without Medical Help
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Sandra, of United Kingdom, was cleaning the counter near a blender that had its blades seated, ready for blending but without a blender-bowl or jar. The blender was accidentally turned on and the blades flew into the air catching her wrist and forearm. She sought help at Emergency in hospital but was told that there was nothing they could do. They said she needed a plastic surgeon for major skin grafting. Instead of seeking medical help further, her son called me and asked what he could do for her.
I suggested that he clean his mum’s arm wound with lime juice even though it would sting terribly. I suggested that he apply honey (1 part) and coconut cream (3 parts) and then cover it with a thin slice of beef, place a piece of plastic over that to keep the
meat moist (so the meat would not dry nor contract and dry the wound but would keep it moist). I suggested that they change the bandage every 2-3 days but only use the lime juice to clean the wound the first 2 times.
The following photos are Sandra’s progressive healing using my suggestions. I have commented on several to clarify what should be understood. Sadly, no photo was taken until 3 days after inflicted wound.
Also, note that Sandra is not on the raw diet but she still healed very nicely without much scarring. She drank some raw milk shakes during the following months. If she had been on my Primal Diet, she probably would have healed in several weeks instead of months.

A naturopath panicked when he saw Sandra’s arm and told her that her arm was terribly infected. He was adamant that she would lose her arm and possibly her life if she did not get medical help with antibiotics. He insisted that placing raw meat on the
wound would cause the worst problems, including parasites and gangrene, although he had no experience with this treatment. I assured Sandra and her son that he was speaking from inexperience and ignorance rather than wisdom.

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom-poison- ing. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly news- letters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for read- ing at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

Subscriber’s question: My Survival Kit
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
 Hello Aajonus, If something were to disrupt our everyday living, what would you recommend for a 6 week survival kit? [There are] many many [sugges- tions] on the internet but don’t think I want to buy them without your recommendation. Much appreci- ated. Rose Simons
Aajonus: My survival kit consists of semi-dried meat bathed in stone-pressed olive oil (or you can make beef jerky and keep it in oil), 3 gallons of vari- eties of unheated above 93 degrees F. honey, 20 lbs no-salt raw butter, 2 gallons unheated above 96 de- grees F. coconut oil, 2 gallons stone-pressed olive oil, 20 lbs cheese, 20 lbs dried figs, 20 lbs dates, and 30 gallons water. Well managed/rationed and depending
upon size, one person could survive 4-6 months on my survival kit.
RECIPE for lightly-dried muscle MEATS: Cut meat into 1⁄2 inch x 1⁄2 inch x 2-10 inches strips. Allow to dry for 5 hours on plates in the sun if in a cool cli- mate or in the shade in a hot climate. Turn meat over and let dry for another 5 hours on plates as instructed above. Baste all surfaces of meat with olive oil and let stand for 30 minutes. Pour 1 cup olive oil into wide-mouthed quart glass jars. Insert meat slices lengthwise into jars until jars are filled with meat to within 1 inch of top of jars. Make sure that olive oil covers all meat, so that oil level is about 1⁄2 inch above meat. When time to eat meats, consume about 1/3 cup with equal amounts butter and/or oils. After

consuming semi-dried meat, consume 1⁄4 cup water with 1⁄2 teaspoon honey slowly.
RECIPE for jerky MEATS (less nourishing than semi-dried meats): Cut muscle meats into 1⁄2 inch x 1⁄2 inch x 2-10 inches strips. Allow to dry for 5 hours on plate in the sun if in a cool climate or in shade in a hot climate. Turn meat over and let dry for 5 hours on plate as instructed above. Turn meat over again and again and allow to stand for 5 hours on each side un- til meat is dry inside. Baste all surfaces of meat with olive oil and let stand for 30 minutes. Pour 1 cup olive oil into wide-mouthed quart glass jars. Insert meat slices lengthwise into jars until jars are filled with meat to within 1⁄2 inch of jar tops. Make sure that olive oil covers all meat, so that oil level is about 1⁄2 inch above meat. When time to eat meats, consume about 1⁄4 cup with equal amount of butter and oils. After consuming jerky meats, consume 1/3 cup water slowly.
BUTTER: Even if you do not have refrigeration when disaster occurs, butter will keep in glass. Trans- fer butter into wide-mouthed 2-cups glass jars after butter softens. Warm butter does not mold although it may sour. When butter is soured, it is simply predi- gested by the natural bacteria in the butter and is more assimilable like yogurt. Refrigerated raw butter will mold within 3-5 months. Molds predigest the butter just as molds predigest old-fashioned-made cheeses. Moldy butter often tastes like blue cheese and can be made into Roquefort dressing. If you do not like taste of blue cheese, then transfer butter into wide-mouthed 2-cups glass jars to within 1⁄4 inch of jar top as soon as you get it. Let butter warm before packing it into jars. Do not refrigerate it; keep on a warm shelf where only a little INDIRECT sunlight shines to curtail mold.
CHEESES: Similarly, cheese will not easily mold at warm temperatures with enough sunlight. As soon
as you get cheeses, warm them to room temperature and press into wide-mouthed 2-cups glass jars to within 1⁄4 inch of top. When you remove lids, you may find hairy molds on top of cheese. Scrape only the hairy molds away before consuming.
HONEY: No preparation necessary. I keep mine in 1⁄2 and 1 gallon glass jars. I have 4 varieties: sage, orange, buckwheat, and wildflower. Sage crystallizes slower than most other honeys.
OILS: No preparation necessary. I keep mine in 1 pint and 1 quart dark glass bottles.
DATES AND DRIED FIGS: No preparation ne- cessary. However when time to consume, it is best to let figs stand for 20 minutes in water (if water is available) before eating them. Dates should not be soaked in water prior to eating. Always consume some butter or oils prior to eating no more than 3 figs or dates daily. If you let children eat only fruits and fats, they will become ravenously hungry and eat your storages quickly and they may become quite un- manageable.
WATER: No preparation necessary. Rainwater is best because it contains bacteria. I keep mine in 1⁄2, 1- gallon and 5-gallons glass jars. ALWAYS sip water, do not gulp. If gulped, any more than 2 ounces of wa- ter will be rushed to the kidneys for elimination caus- ing dehydration.
To recycle proteins from dried meats that may not have digested well, and to keep hydrated and con- sume less water, I would consume all of my urine. If you are very toxic at the time disaster strikes, it is best not to drink the first urine in the morning be- cause our bodies detoxify the nervous system at night and many neurotoxins can be found in our urine in the morning.

The WHO’s (World Health Organization – an agency of the United Nations) swine flu epidemic prediction began several months ago. I sent an email showing that the first predicted epidemic of swine flu in 1976 was a hoax, that the swine flu vaccine proved
to be harmful and lethal, that the swine-flu vaccine at the time was not destroyed as it was supposed to have been and will be reissued with added contamination of avian and human flu waste, and replete with many other disease-causing chemicals.
H1N1 (Swine) Flu Epidemic, Fact or Hoax?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition

Many people had difficulty understanding my ex- planation that viruses can not be contagious. I will try to be clearer for those who did and do not understand. When I studied bio- and pharmachemistry, I could not accept the pharmaceutical theories of viruses. Empirically, it did not make any sense because everything was done outside of living environments, mainly in Petri dishes in laboratories. I observed that pharmacology is the study of dying tissue rather than living tissue. Dying tissue undergoes natural pro- cesses of phagocyte, parasitical, bacterial, fungal and viral decomposition. Phagocytes, parasites, bacteria and fungi are living organisms but viruses are not alive. Viruses do not have respiratory, circulatory, or digestive systems and do not have nuclei.
Without life, they can not reproduce. If they can- not reproduce, they cannot be contagious. As I stated before, when viruses were placed in “fertile” environ- ment (Petri dishes with fluids that keep cells alive but not healthy), no additional viral particles appeared. Pseudo-fertile Petri dishes absent of cells that sat for 2 years with viruses had no additional viral particles at the end of 2 years. Viruses cannot reproduce or du- plicate themselves; it is impossible. What we label as viruses are mixtures of animal tissues and what I have called “solvent-fractionators” but more accur- ately should be called “enzymefractionators”. In oth- er words, what we find but do not acknowledge about flu chemistry are non-living enzymes that fractionate cellular tissue, including RNA and DNA.
Cells produce viruses where their tissues are so toxic that phagocytes, parasites, bacteria and fungi cannot help cleanse, repair and regenerate their tis- sues and fluids. Cells produce all viruses (enzyme-- fractionators) in an effort to cleanse themselves of their chemically poisoned cellular tissues. Viruses could be compared to certain digestive enzymes. En- zymes are protein structures that are not alive. Cer- tain enzymes disassemble cellular components to be used to either reconstruct live tissue or be discarded as waste. Viruses are no more harmful than enzymes, unless man-made, such as those found vaccines, in- cluding flu shots.
I will state the facts again in another way. When flu occurs, cellular tissues are so toxic that normal forms of bio-detoxification (phagocytes, parasites, bacteria and fungus) cannot cleanse the cells. So, cells make virus (enzyme-fractionators) to disas- semble the toxic tissue with the intent to isolate, neut- ralize or ameliorate the toxins and dispel them from
the cells and body. Since we do not reproduce pork or bird cells within our bodies, it is impossible for us to develop swine or avian flu, or any other species' flu.
The only way humans could contain other species' flu serums outside of the digestive tract is if they were regularly exposed to chemically toxic and sick farm animals from industrial farms. That occurs when people inhale skin cells from animals slough- ing-off industrially toxic skin cells. If enough of that industrially toxic dander becomes airborne and is in- haled by a human, a human may develop enzyme fractionators (viruses/flu) to neutralize or mollify and discharge the toxic dander. That is something like mollifying a bomb so its explosiveness is reduced to 1/10th of its original power. When analyzed, a variety of flu would be found, including animal tissue with its RNA and DNA. However, it is not another spe- cies' flu. It is human flu to decompose another spe- cies' toxic cells. The only way humans can get anoth- er species' flu is if it is injected into humans, period.
There is ample evidence that the Spanish flu of 1918 was caused by vaccines, especially typhoid vaccines that were distributed throughout much of the “civilized” world. After the war, typhoid was one of the vaccines used to protect a panic-stricken world from the soldiers returning from WWI battlefronts
infected with “dangerous” diseases.1 However, incontrovertible evidence shows that those soldiers developed their diseases from multiple vaccines. Instead of pharma/medical calling their vaccine- created disease “iatrogenic” disease, they named it “Spanish” flu as a cover-up.
According to R.B. Pearson, a witness and researcher at the time, the only people who got “Spanish” flu were people who had been vaccinated. Nine of every 20 people who received standard medical treatments for side effects of the vaccines, which included flu, died. Only 1 of every 9 people who received herbal therapy for their side effects of the vaccines died.
Many people have written to me, countering my 1 IRISH EXAMINER, Thursday, May 08, 2003.

stance that viruses are not contagious by pointing to “fact” that herpes is contagious. That herpes is contagious is also myth created by Big Pharma to get people to medicate themselves so they can profit. Human herpes is a human virus that most civilized humans have. It does not exist amongst any tribe I studied or met who do not participate in chemical farming. According to Dr. Robert Shaw, MD, of Beverly Hills who is a specialist in venereal diseases, 85% of the civilized world has herpes even though large portions do not engage in sex or kissing.
Again, viruses are enzyme-like fractionators made by cells inside an animal when cells are too toxic that their bodies cannot utilize natural microbial janitors such as phagocytes (white blood cells), parasites, bacteria and fungus. The “civilized” population has herpes because of all the metallic toxicity that exists in our “civilized” life-styles and environments, especially in vaccines that contain liquid mercury, aluminum, uranium and more. I repeat, herpes results from toxic chemicals, especially consisting of toxic metals stored or lodged in nerve-endings from medications, canned foods, pesticides, herbicides, food additives, lotions, deodorants, perfumes, colognes, makeup and industrial environmental pollution.
Herpes eruptions are our bodies trying to detoxify unnatural neural metallic toxicity from nerves in skin. Resultantly, swelling occurs, causing intense sores and sometimes pus. Pus is white blood cells (phagocytes) trying to eat, contain and discard toxins.
Others have argued that viruses are contagious by citing the mass illness and death of Hawaiian and Continental American Natives who reportedly died of viruses from Caucasians, namely smallpox. There are many poisons that were used to wipe out American natives that have the same symptoms as viruses, in- cluding smallpox. Since our bodies discard most poisons through skin, usually skin eruptions of all sorts will be experienced after poisoning. Clandestine military mercenaries were paid by our government and industries to poison native waters and food in Hawaii and continental USA. Medical and religious missionaries gave them smallpox vaccines.
“Many vaccines also cause other diseases besides the ones for which they are given. For instance, smallpox vaccine often causes syphilis, paralysis, leprosy, and cancer. Polio shots, diphtheria toxin-an- titoxin, typhoid vaccine, as well as measles, tetanus and all other shots often cause various other stages of
disease such as post-vaccinal encephalitis (inflamma- tion of the brain,) paralysis, spinal meningitis, blind- ness, cancer (sometimes within two years), tubercu- losis (two to twenty years after the shot), arthritis, kidney disease, heart disease (heart failure sometimes within minutes after the shot and sometimes several hours later). Nerve damage and many other serious conditions also follow injections,” wrote Dr. E. Mc- Bean.
I developed angina pectoris and juvenile diabetes within days after receiving my third polio vaccine in- jection at 15 years young. I experienced about 300 heart attacks from age 15 to 22. Although excruciat- ingly painful and I was rendered unconscious about 50 times, they did not kill me. When I began drinking raw milk and raw carrot juice at age 22, my angina stopped and only returned for 2 weeks when I was 60. Because my chest area felt more relaxed after the 2-weeks episode, I determined it to be detoxification of the polio-vaccine toxicity that had stored in and around my heart 45 years earlier that caused the re- lentless angina. My diabetes reversed after several weeks drinking raw milk and I never again took in- sulin.
Governments have been utilizing chemical warfare for thousands of years to usurp the resources of people and countries. All government personnel who utilized such tactics used the story “killed by disease” as their cover-up. It is an easy story for people to believe, especially the religiously inclined who often believe that people who do not believe as they believe have been stricken dead by disease because they are non-believers.
Here is a so-called “fact” that is actually a myth: most news reports on swine flu deaths regurgitate the CDC’s (the Center for Disease Control – an agency of the US Department of Health and Human Services) claim that "36,000 people die each year from flu-related causes." It sounds authoritative. However, from where is that number derived? Is it based on science? The standard by which the CDC and WHO are supposed to quote deaths are when cases are laboratory-confirmed viral strain that match flu-strain archives.
The CDC guestimate that 36,000 people die yearly from regular flu, is not real because none of those cases were confirmed in any laboratory. So, according to their standards, it is technically accurate to say that regular flu does not kill anyone. From my experience, it is probably accurate that no one

dies from flu. Flu is a detoxification of some serious chemical contamination in the body but rarely is it life-threatening, unless treated with pharmaceuticals.
If laboratory-strain-testing is the standard, then officially, if a death has not been confirmed in a laboratory, it does not count as a death from swine flu. Therefore, only laboratory confirmed deaths count. Such testing requires laboratories with frightfully expensive equipment and rigorous methods that compare samples taken from known database of viral protein patterns. Only 3 cases were confirmed swine flu. Why would those people in Mexico have been tested for swine flu? It consumes valuable technical equipment that is extremely costly. If a doctor had ordered that in a hospital, he would like have been fired or fined for costs. And why did they even look for the swine flu?
Resultantly, we have an infectious-disease double standard with swine flu that they now call H1N1. Why the double standard and why did they change the name? Was it because they want to manufacture a swine flu epidemic? Was it because I and others publicly explained to the masses that the present Swine flu was the same hoax as the Swine flu hoax of 1976? Is it to make enormous profits for select groups of people who will prosper by sickness and diseases created by global vaccinations, and treatment for all those who experience side effects? That equates to trillions of dollars for Big Pharma, investors, medical industry and politicians who are in their pockets. There are only three plausible intentions to promote and make compulsory injections that contain at least 35 known poisons that create disease: money, power and population control and/or reduction.
No scientist in history has been able to predict a forth-coming disease. All of a sudden the WHO predicts a pandemic of swine flu from 3 laboratory cases in Mexico. The fact is that one month prior to the cases being discovered in Mexico, a shipment of vaccines from the USA government was sent to Mexico City. That immediately followed Obama’s visit with Mexican government officials in Mexico City. Was that shipment swine-flu vaccines? People in Mexico who got that flu shot had swine flu RNA and DNA in their bodies from the vaccine, not because it mysteriously erupted from nowhere. Like the 36,000-deaths-yearly-from-flu propaganda, deaths from swine flu are pulled out of thin air. The forecasted H1N1 flu pandemic is a fraud, a hoax that
will cost hundreds of millions of lives if people globally take the vaccines.
If you are considering acquiescing to the flu-scare tactics, I suggest that you consider what you would have injected into your bodies. In addition to the viral and bacterial RNA or DNA that is part of the vaccines, here are some of the fillers considered inert: aluminum hydroxide (directly linked to Alzheimer's Disease)
aluminum phosphate (directly linked to Alzheimer's Disease)
ammonium sulfate (an inorganic chemical compound used a fertilizer and "protein purifier"; known to cause kidney & liver damage, gastrointestinal dysfunctions)
amphotericin B (an "antifungal disinfectant” that damages the urinary tract, bowels, heart functions) animal tissues: pig blood, horse blood, rabbit brain, dog kidney, monkey kidney, chick embryo, chicken egg, duck egg, and calf (bovine) serum, fetal bovine serum VERO cells, a continuous line of monkey kidney cells, and washed sheep’s red blood cells. Those build foundation for neurological diseases) betapropiolactone (disinfectant)
Ethylene glycol (antifreeze, proven to have extreme neurotoxic side effects)
formaldehyde (used as a preservative, embalming fluid, and disinfectant, known to cause cancer, chronic bronchitis, eye irritation and numerous other diseases)
formalin (used as a disinfectant or anti-bacterial, containing 37% formaldehyde)
gelatin (causes allergic reactions and anaphylaxis usually associated with sensitivity to processed egg or gelatin)
Gentamycin (antibiotic: destroys digestion and impairs healing)
Glycerol (used as a solvent, an antifreeze, a plasticizer, and a sweetener and in the manufacture of dynamite, cosmetics, liquid soaps, inks, and lubricants)
MF-59 (oil-based and composed of squalene, Tween 80 and Span85. All oil adjuvants injected into rats were found to be toxic, caused disease similar to multiple sclerosis which left them crippled and dragging their paralyzed hindquarters)
human diploid cells (from aborted fetal tissue) hydrolyzed gelatin (obtained by chemical extraction from the skin, white connective tissue and bones of animals, such as cowhide splits, bones (ossein), pork

skin, and fish skin)
monosodium glutamate (MSG; causes cancer in humans, also linked to obesity)
neomycin (antibiotic: destroys digestion and impairs healing)
neomycin sulfate (antibiotic: destroys digestion and impairs healing)
nonoxynol (toxic chemotherapy used to treat venereal diseases)
octoxinol 9 (toxic chemical used in vagina to kill sperm)
phenol red indicator (a highly toxic carolic acid disinfectant dye, attributed to liver, kidney, heart and respiratory damage)
phenoxyethanol (antifreeze, proven to have extreme neurotoxic side effects)
potassium diphosphate (destroys libido and motivation)
potassium monophosphate (destroys libido and motivation)
polymyxin B (antibiotic: destroys digestion, damages liver and kidneys, and impairs healing)
polysorbate 20 (trademarked Tween 20; emulsifier that often prevents absorption of nutrients causing malnutrition)
polysorbate 80 (trademarked Tween 80: a preservative that can cause severe allergic reactions including anaphylaxis)
porcine (pig) pancreatic hydrolysate of casein (isolated concentration of certain proteins that cause nutritional imbalances, allergies and often excessive hunger or the opposite anorexia)
residual MRC5 proteins (chemically isolated toxic proteins from cancerous DNA)
resin (causes allergic reactions)
sodium phosphate (solvent, dangerous, even life- threatening, toxicity may occur while using sodium phosphate if you have kidney disease, have congestive heart failure, have an electrolyte imbalance; or are on a sodium restricted diet) sorbitol (sugar alcohol that dissolve intestinal villi) Squalene (causes severe arthritis and lupus in humans at only 10-20 parts per billion)
sucrose (dissolves cellular walls and intestinal villi) thimerosal (mercury; a neurotoxin linked to psychological, neurological & immunological problems. Nervous system damage, kidney disease, birth defects, dental problems, mood swings, mental changes, hallucinations, memory loss, nerve damage and inability to concentrate can occur. Symptoms
also include tremors, loss of dermal sensitivity, slurred speech and, in rare cases, even death and paralysis. This additive alone was the catalyst for another recent Class Action Lawsuit organized by mothers of children born with Autism & the many related behavioral disorders associated with
it. Autism is now occurring at levels never seen before in history, 1 in 67. The average used to be 1 in 20,000.)
tri(n)butylphosphate (solvent and plasticizer) Triton X100 (a strong detergent)
If all of those toxins are inert, why are they in vaccines?
Additionally, we have to consider the synergistic toxic effects produced by combining those toxins. Side effects compound and more severe reactions result from combining toxins. NO TEST has been executed and released to the public. If you take the vaccines, you are the experiment. Good luck.
Some of the expected side effects admitted by pharmaceutical manufacturers and listed on vaccine package inserts are: Local injection site reactions (including pain, pain limiting limb movement, redness, swelling, warmth, ecchymosis, induration). Symptoms: abdominal pain, arthralgia, asthenia, blood disorders, cardiovascular, disorders, chest pain, chills, cough, diarrhea, digestive disorders, dizziness, dyspnea, facial edema, fatigue, febrile convulsions, fever, Guillain-Barré Syndrome (often resulting in death), headache, hot flashes/flushes, hypersensitivity reactions (including throat and/or mouth edema), hypersensitivity reactions have lead to anaphylactic shock and death, immune system disorders, loss of appetite, lymphadenopathy (local), lymphatic disorders, malaise, metabolic disorders, myalgia, myasthenia, myelitis (including encephalomyelitis and transverse myelitis), maculopapular rash, nausea, nervous system disorders, neuralgia, neuropathy (including neuritis), nutritional disorders, paraes- thesia, paralysis (including Bell’s Palsy), pharyngitis, pruritus (itching), rashes (non-specific), respiratory disorders, rhinitis, shivering, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, syncope shortly after vaccination, thrombocytopenia (transient), urticaria, vasculitis (in rare cases with transient renal involvement), vesiculobulbous rash, vomit.
Flu Shots Simply Don’t Work

• According to the 2006 Cochrane Database of Sys- tematic Reviews, 51 separate studies concluded the flu vaccine worked no better than a placebo in 260,000 children ranging in age from six months to 23 months.
• A study published in the October 2008 Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine found flu vaccines in young children have made no difference in the number of flu-related doctor and hospital visits.
• As reported in a 2004 publication of the Archives of Disease in Childhood, a study of 800 children with asthma concluded those receiving a flu vaccine had a significantly increased risk of asthma-related doctor and emergency room visits.[6]
• A more recent study released at the 2009 Americ- an Thoracic Society International Conference showed children with asthma who received FluMist had a 3- fold increased risk for hospitalization.
And not only are vaccines ineffective in preventing flu in your children, they are equally useless for adults, includ- ing the elderly.
Read Dr. Sherri Tenpenny’s well documented an- swers to these questions: What is in the regular flu shot? Do flu shots work? What about the new “Swine Flu” shot?
Is mandatory vaccination possible? In 1946, the U.S. Public Health Service was established and Executive Order 9708 was signed, listing the commu- nicable diseases where quarantines could be used. Between 1946 and 2003, cholera, diphtheria, TB, typhoid, small pox, yellow fever, and viral hemor- rhagic fevers were added to the list. In April, 2003, SARS was also added through Executive Order 13295.
In January, 2003, Project BioShield was introduced during Bush’s State of the Union Address. This cre- ated permanent and indefinite funding authority to develop “medical countermeasures”. The National In- stitute of Health was authorized to speed approval of drugs and vaccines. Emergency approval of a “fast tracked” drug and vaccine can be given without the regular course of safety testing.
In April, 2005, Executive Order 13295 added “Influ- enza caused by novel or re-emergent influenza vir- uses that are causing, or have the potential to cause, a pandemic.” Under this order, the president gave the secretary of HHS (U.S. Department of Health and Hu- man Services) the power to quarantine, at his or her discretion.
The secretary of HHS has the power to arrange for the “apprehension and examination of persons reas- onably thought to be infected.” A cough or a fever could put a person at risk for being quarantined for an extended period of time without recourse.
December 17, 2006, Division E: The Public readiness and Emergency Preparedness Act was added as an addendum to Defense Appropriations Bill HR 2863 at 11:20 on Saturday night, long after House Committee members had signed off on the bill and gone home for the holidays. Section (b)(1) states that the secret- ary of HHS can make a determination that a “disease, health condition or threat” constitutes a public health emergency. He or she may then recommend “the manufacture, testing, development, administration, or use of one or more covered counter measures...” A covered countermeasure is defined as a “pandemic product, vaccine or drug.”
Division E also provides complete liability protection for all drugs, vaccines or biologic- al products deemed a “covered counter measure” and used for an outbreak of any kind. Complete liability protection has been

According to the 2007 Cochrane Database of Sys- tematic Reviews, studies of over 65,000 healthy adults concluded vaccinations reduced the risk of flu by only six percent, and reduced missed work days by less than a single day. Vaccinations did not reduce the number of people who sought medical help or took time off from work.
The 2006 Cochrane Database also includes a re- view of 64 vaccination studies of the elderly across nearly 100 flu seasons. The studies showed flu vac- cines were ineffective in preventing the flu in either nursing home patients or elderly living in the com- munity.
A study published in the Lancet last year found that influenza vaccination was NOT associated with a reduced risk of pneumonia in older people. This sup- ports a study done five years ago, published in The New England Journal of Medicine.
Research published in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine also confirms that there has been no decrease in deaths from influ- enza and pneumonia, despite the fact that vaccina- tion coverage among the elderly has increased from 15 percent in 1980 to 65 percent now.

given to drug companies for any product used for any public health emergency de- clared by the secretary of HHS. This means that pharmaceutical companies are now pro- tected from all accountability, unless “crimin- al intent to do harm” can be proven by the injured party. They are protected from liabil- ity even if they know the drug will be harm- ful.
Can We Be Quarantined Without Evidence of H1N1 Flu?
The following draft of an “isolation order” was discovered on the CDC’s website. It is a template for state and local officials to impose quarantines and what would effectively be mar- tial law.
“Your illness [as determined by state and local of- ficials] requires that you be isolated and requires further public health investigation and monitor- ing.” Failure to obey will result in imprisonment without bail prior to trial and the possibility of a two year prison term. Therefore, officials can im- pose quarantine without evidence that somebody is actually infected with a virus that is negligible at best. It may also be used to quarantine potentially millions of people suffering from any number of illnesses — or not suffering from any disease at the discretion of the state — that have nothing to do with H1N1. It is basically a carte blanche for martial law under the cover of protecting the pub- lic from a communicable disease that is a manu- factured and weaponized threat.
Do Not Be Forced To Take Vaccines Of Any Kind
I wrote a document to present to anyone ordering
you to take a vaccine for their signature, assuring you that the vaccine(s) is/are safe without danger or risk. In it, the signatory agrees to be financially respons- ible for life for any harm that comes to you from the vaccines s/he orders you to receive. No one in their right mind would sign such a document. Regardless whether s/he signs it, it notifies and educates the per- son forcing vaccines of the prominent dangers of the vaccine(s) with a looming threat of responsibility that could be extended to her/him for life. After notifica- tion provided by my document, the person forcing vaccine(s) has no legal immunity. Make sure that you record the exchange that transpires between you, preferably with video. Find my document at www.NoToSwineFlu.net, (also in the 'articles and es- says' of www.WeWant2Live.com) where you can cut and paste or download.
People Ask Me, “What do I take if I am forced to take the vaccinations?”
I say, “Don’t take them.” If you are quarantined because you refuse them, that would be better than grossly diminishing your health for at least 40 years or the rest of your life from vaccine poisons. If au- thorities canvas your neighborhood to force vaccina- tions, I suggest that people have a survival kit, close windows to street and neighbors, stay indoors and wait for them to leave your neighborhood. If you are in a selected city that they are making a national pub- lic example, leave the city and go to a remote area where few people live.
If by chance you are abducted and given vaccines, I suggest eating lots of cheese, butter, butter/honey mixture, cilantro leaves and juice, plenty of eggs, meats and milk, and berries with coconut cream.

     Japanese Study Shows That Chubby People Live Longest

Health experts have long warned of the risks of obesity. However, a new study warns that being skinny is more dangerous and that chubby people live longer.

five years than that of obese people, the study found.
"We found skinny people run the highest risk," said associate professor Shinichi Kuriyama of To- hoku University's Graduate School of Medicine who worked on the long-term study of middle-aged and elderly people. The 12-years study was conduc- ted by a health ministry team led by Professor Ichiro Tsuji and covered 50,000 people between the ages of 40 and 79 in the northern Japanese prefecture of Miyagi. "There had been an argument that thin people's lives are short because many of them are sick or smoke. But the difference was almost un- changed even when we eliminated these factors," Kuriyama said.
Researchers of the team believed the main reas- ons for the shorter lifespans of skinny people were heightened vulnerability to diseases such as pneu- monia and the fragility of their blood vessels. How- ever, in my experience it is simply lack of fats that bind with toxins. Consider the Masai tribal com- munities are the skinniest, tallest people on earth. They live considerably long lives, as much as

145 years. Since Masai had not been subjected to industrial toxicity, they did not need excess fat to contain toxins and prevent bodily harm and damage. Therefore, their lifespans were unaffected.
The study divided people into four weight classes at age 40 according to their body mass index (BMI), calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their squared height in meters. Normal range is 18.5 to 25. Thinness was defined as under 18.5. BMI, 25-30 was classed as slightly overweight and BMI above 30 was classed as obese. and longevity. As I have been saying for decades, in our toxic societies, raw fat is of utmost importance for health.

Abduction and Injections
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
   On February 9, 2009, I was interviewed on an “international” internet radio show that transitioned from the Primal Diet to the subject of Swine Flu and the vaccines. From my understanding, that interview was the first in which facts about the Swine Flu hoax of 1976 were aired (see my last newsletter, 16th Edition). I stated that the present Swine flu fiasco wasthesamehoax,hoodwinkingtheworld’s population to be vaccinated with a poisonous concoction. I received several threatening phone calls over the next 3 weeks. I thought someone very invested in the 7-billion-dollar vaccine hoax was simply trying to scare me into silence.
I have had many threats over the years since my book We Want To Live was published. Four times my house was invaded while I was traveling. Four times my food or environment was poisoned. However, my perceptions protected me and I discovered the poisons without much discomfort or damage to my body. So, I was relatively unmoved by
the threats and I continued my public education about the impending Swine Flu hoax.
Three weeks later, I began traveling through March and most of April in East Asia. As usual, I made flight and hotel reservations with my credit card on line or on my cell phone. Anyone wanting to track me could easily use both devices to track me.
OnApril2nd inaverynicehotelinarelatively small town in the Philippines, I woke abruptly to the forces of two large men pushing my shoulders onto the bed as I struggled to sit. There was enough light passing through hotel windows to see that they were not Filipinos. They were CIA-clichés who were rather stunned and annoyed that I had awakened.
I felt a pain in my right upper arm. I glanced at it and saw a hypodermic and needle dangling from my tricep. A cloth that was falling from my face was quickly placed over my nose and mouth and pressed. I saw two more hypodermics on the bed next to my arm. I thought they were trying to kill me. The cloth was odorless but within seconds, I fell unconscious as

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 17th Edition - page 2 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
I watched one thug inject fluid from the hypodermic into my arm.
I woke the next morning after 6.5 hours sleep; 2 hours more than normal for me. I recalled the CIA- looking thugs and remembered the three hypodermics. I thought it was just a nightmare. However, when I turned to rise, I was sore in my arms, neck and shoulders with a headache. I had soreness and slight aches and pains throughout my body. I looked at my right arm and there were three injections holes in the midst of three inflamed bumps. I realized the event was not nightmare; the injections were real!
I searched the floor, garbage cans and every nook and cranny looking for some evidence, especially used hypodermics. I found nothing. I called the front desk for the number of the hospital. I called the hospital and asked if they had toxicology laboratory. I was told there was none.
Besides eating lots of honey and butter, I realized that I needed to eat something that would be high in natural ammonia to protect both red and white blood cells. I had to prevent becoming anemic or even leukemic again. I considered drinking my urine but thought that my urine was probably very contaminated with whatever was injected into me. Normally, I would never drink the first urine of the day because of all of the toxins discharged from nerve detoxification during nighttimes but this was an emergency. I urinated and smelled it. It did not smell normal. I ate some honey/butter mixture, 5 tablespoons of coconut cream, 4 tablespoons lime juice, 1 tablespoon of clay and about 3⁄4 cup of coconut water. I would have eaten raw no-salt cheese every 20 minutes for days but I didn’t have any.
An hour later when I felt I could urinate again, I urinated a little and it did not have an unusual odor. For insurance though, I added a teaspoon of clay to it, to bind with any poisons from the assault of injections. My driver was due any minute at 7:30 AM.
I had planned a two-days road trip around the island where, I was told I could find one of the only places in the Philippines where foreign companies did not clear cut every square inch of ancient timber. Clear-cutting had decimated the animal ecology and left most inland tribes unsustainable and protein deficient. Many tribal members had to forsake their
healthy easy primal lives and resort to industrial jobs in polluted cities, toxic housing grounds and work- everyday lives. That is reality for most of the 7107 Philippine islands. There are no car rental companies on 99% of those islands. I had to rent a driver with a car for my trip.
Although I was suffering symptoms from injections, including frequent nausea, I decided to continue my trip. Within 12 hours of the traumatic event of that night, I broke out in bumps that were similar to smallpox all over my arms, shoulders, neck, scalp, chest and back; some spots were worse than others. It seemed that where I had more hair, it was worse, especially on my lower arms and chest. However, the shoulders with little hair had the largest pox. Each bump itched almost maddeningly. My legs itched.
Although I periodically applied coconut cream and it was soothing, some times I had to scratch off skin just to relieve the intolerable itch at the bumps. They oozed fluid or blood. I continued to consume honey/butter/coconut cream mixture and sipped coconut water. About 11 am, I ate 1 cup raw water buffalo meat with lots of its raw fat. I felt stronger but still annoyingly itchy, irritable and dizzy.
We stopped at the end of the island at about 3 pm. We visited the docks where fishing merchants sold their daily catch. I looked for the two fishes that are very high in natural ammonia once killed, shark and ray. Those animals’ urea are changed into ammonia by bacteria when not kept very refrigerated.
I found a young 2-pounds stingray and bought it. Because it was many hours dead in hottest tropical weather on a tiny Filipino fishing boat, it was ripe with ammonia. So ripe that the merchant woman would not cut and chop it because the ray would ammonia-taint her tree-stump cutting block. I bought a thin board and chopped it with my hunting knife.
It was so high in ammonia that it burned my mouth and throat as I ate 1⁄2 cup. After chewing about 10 times with each mouthful, I washed it down my throat with mature coconut water. Several hours later, my dizziness, nausea and headache worsened. I developed very loud ringing in my ears. I felt somewhat numb, as if I might fall unconscious but I did not. I didn’t know if the symptoms were due to the excessive ammonia or the injected poisons.

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 17th Edition - page 3 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
I knew I had to sustain myself by eating the stingray, to protect my blood stream. I would eat less next time. The effects of the ray began to work within hours. That sensation of dropping into leukemia again slowly passed but the discharge of poison out my skin from injections continued. I knew that that was good because the body is supposed to discharge 90% of toxins through and out skin.
Within 48 hours of the injections, the bumps took several forms. All were 1-2 millimeters in diameter, about 30 of them. Some raised itchy bumps that I
could scratch off and would ooze fluid that turned crystalline, or bleed. Most discharged crystalline grains the size of table salt but grayish, grayish yellow and grayish light amber. I used the magnifying glass in my 82-tools Swiss Army knife that I carry everywhere to examine them. When I returned to the hotel, I used my miniature microscope. The crystalline grains were mostly smooth-edged, as if they were molded into alluvial- shaped plastic. PLASTIC!

 There was no way to discern what was in those injections without evidence in those hypodermics. I did not know how long it would take me to discharge those poison and if I would survive the process. What were the intentions of the injections?
If they wanted to kill me outright, I would be dead. For those criminals, probably the best way to benefit from my death would be to give me a disease including swine flu (H1N1) to discredit my work/diet and the fact that I declared, “The only way you can get swine flu is to be injected with it.” If they injected me with swine flu, they could declare that I was wrong. However, the more intelligent souls in the world would see my surviving at least 41 years after my cancer death-sentence as nothing other than miraculous, as I do. I woke and caught them, ruining the surprise.
I decided that I would wait to tell people, once I knew I was through the worst. I had too much to do already to juggle hundreds of caring phone calls. I
needed to be focused on my bodily changes every moment so that I could prevent as much damage as possible. I continued to eat honey/butter/coconut cream, clay, coconut water and watermelon every 30- 45 minutes. Watermelon promotes excessive perspiration. I needed to perspire as much as possible to discharge as many poisons as possible. Several times, we stopped at a river-crossing and I coated my body with mud and soaked in the water to relieve the maddening itch.
I noticed that I had massive number of freckles and tiny thin warts all over my body and many so-called liver spots. Liver spots are the collection of cells from liver, gall bladder, spleen and pancreas. Cells that could no longer function as organ cells but could be utilized as skin cells. Were all of my new freckles the result of internal damage to my organs and glands? They made my skin look old and tired. There is no doubt that the assault of injected poisons aged and tired my entire body.

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 17th Edition - page 8 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
Ten days after the injections, I traveled to a larger island to survey it while still managing the disease I had been given from injections. The sores became larger and larger until 12 of them on my legs and shoulders were approximately 5 centimeters (2 inches) in diameter. Many little ones continued to rise and erupt with blood, yellow or brown fluid-ooze and/or crystallizations. Many on my arms and hands were 2-3 centimeters in diameter. I could not tolerate being inside a vehicle with my itch and soreness. I decided to rent a motorbike (125 cc) and tour the island in short pants, no shirt with wounds on my legs, arms and shoulders exposed to the open air and sun. On that Sunday morning, I left at daybreak, long before sunrise.
Two hours into my journey on mostly dirt roads. I passed no more than 10 vehicles in two hours. I approached an area of the road that was being section-paved. Since I was first to enter the lane by 50 meters, I had the right-of-way. However, an approaching van-driver disregarded my right and raced directly at me. When he was too close, I panicked and engaged the front brakes without simultaneously engaging the rear.
My motorbike spun and flipped me. I kicked away the bike so it would not land on me. I landed on the dirt and gravel road that was dusted with toxic gypsum. They apply gypsum to help concrete dry it this rainy tropical climate. My side dragged the road and ripped skin from the side of my left leg, hand and arm until I was able to tumble to a stop, reducing damage.
The toxic gypsum kept my leg from bleeding although 2-3 layers of skin were gone. I decided to end my trip around the island and bike back to the hotel. On my return, I urinated on my leg hand and arm as an antiseptic and nutrifier. On my way, I spotted a dairy, stopped and talked them into selling me raw milk. First milk I had had in 3 weeks. I made arrangements to return daily everyday because they would only sell me 1 liter daily.
At the hotel, I applied lime juice as an antiseptic and detoxifier of the toxic gypsum. Then, I applied coconut cream and honey. Then, I applied a thin layer of buffalo meat to act as skin. However, about 4 days later sores began to surface all around the wound on my right leg, foot and sole, and several on my left leg, similar to those that had erupted on my shoulders from the clandestine-failed injections. Those sores were completely unrelated to my motorbike accident. About a week later, the motorbike wounds began to weep yellow and brown fluids, bleed, crystallize, turn tumorous and were constantly painful.
I tried to write my next newsletter but I could not focus. I seemed to have returned to my autistic fog in which I had suffered as a child, adolescent and young adult. I could speak and communicate well but when it came to writing, I was an idiot again. The harder I tried to focus, the worse my concentration. I could write one or two paragraphs and poof, my mind would fog, blur and haze into not remembering anything I had just written. I was very frustrated and angry at my assailants.

After 4 months of applying mainly honey and coconut cream, my sores began to react allergically to coconut cream and honey. They created more pain and sensitivity rather than less. I changed to using butter and that soothed my many sores as the coconut cream and honey had done previously. I had very little butter so I opted to not eat it anymore but instead use it on my sores. After 41⁄2 months, 80% of the bleeding, seeping and tumorous growths stopped but they were still very sensitive. I was able to wear long pants without severe irritation to my sores. I had to wear silk pants though because other fabrics irritated my leg sores. Most of that time, I had to wear open shoes or no shoes.
On August 22, I was presenting my workshop on the patio of a lovely home at Brisbane, Australia when my body decided to finally mass-dump much of the injection poisons into my stomach. I was merely 21⁄2 hours into my lecture when my stomach and back began to ache excruciatingly. I tried to continue by taking 10-15 minutes every 45-60 minutes to assuage the pain by stretching in yoga postures. My tactics worked for about 2 hours and then they didn’t. Finally, I jumping into the very cold swimming pool to possibly numb myself and lectured from the swimming pool.
I was so cold that I was only able to continue in the pool for about 30 minutes and then outside and wet for another 15 minutes. I had to vomit over the railing at the deck around the pool. I took an hour break and decided that I could not continue. Two of the people on the PD finished my workshop for me: Jeff Slay and Scott Wheeler. Jeff has been on the diet for about 6 years and has attended 11 workshops over those years; Scott is an athletic trainer who has been on the diet about 31⁄2 years.
I went to the other side of the house, being claustrophobic for that day and vomited for 6 hours as much as 7 times an hour. About the 5th hour, I immersed myself in a hot bath with milk, vinegar, Epsom salt and coconut cream. Within 15 minutes in the hot water, my back pain mitigated about 80%, I spent 2 hours in the bath vomiting over the edge into a bucket, and dozing. At 11PM, it was over. I felt very good although exhausted. My stomach felt like I had done 2,000 push ups. I had done so much vomiting, my body lost all fat around my waist and I had washboard abs; not that I cared for them but that was the result. I slept 5 hours and worked from 8AM- 10PM the next day without any symptoms or fatigue. Only the sore on my foot seemed worse and more painful.

I arrived home at Malibu, California September 5. My body was delighted to get as much butter as I could consume and apply to my legs, arms and back. All of the bleeding from my right knee ceased within a week of my return but all of the skin was still sensitive and a little sore. For several weeks, I was unable to take hot baths because of the sores but used hot-water bottles to help me perspire.
As of today November 23, my scarred legs are just a little sensitive to bumping or grazing things though. I still have the sore on the sole at the ball of my right foot closer to the smallest toes. I continue to apply/rub butter and honey on it. I continue to get sores on my scalp that crust amber and brown. I continue to consume 4 ounces of moist Terramin clay once or twice weekly blended for 3 seconds with warm raw milk. It arrests any injection poisons that are left and making there way into my fluid systems.
I have had to wear reading glasses almost daily whenever light is low or my eyes are tired. I have never scarred from anything as I have from the poisonous injections in the 40 years that I have been on a raw diet, especially my 27 years on my Primal Diet. From the looks of the scars (see the last photo below of my scarred right leg), it will be many years
before my body can remove all of the mercury and aluminum in and especially around the scars and heal the scars, if they can be healed.
I have to consider that some person or group was intending to get me very sick and possibly kill me and have my blood analyzed and say that I died of swine (H1N1) flu. They probably intended an entire publicity sham saying, “See, here was a man who claimed that you could only get swine flu from injections. And here he died from swine flu. Get your swine flu shots today!”
However, I spoiled the plot, if there was one, when I awakened and found men injecting me. I am putting this event into the public eye to expose any clandestine vaccine scheme. Do everything you can to refuse and reject any ploy for you to accept swine flu vaccines. Please read my last newsletter with my document of vaccine responsibility that could prevent you from being forced to accept the poisonous vaccines, any vaccine.
I hope that my ability to write with clarity and relative ease returns soon so that I may get current with my newsletters. Have a wonderful holiday season. I wish you wellness from the tropics where I will spend my next few months, further recuperating.

If any of you know anyone who takes a vaccine and wants help, I suggest that you note the things I utilized and foods I consumed to help survive through my injection assault and poisoning. Usually, only military personnel get more than one flu vaccine at once. If what they gave me was the
three flu shots they want everyone else in the world to get straddle over several weeks, people are going to be less affected as quickly as I was but probably worse if they do not know what is coming for them and what to do. __________________________________________

Subscriber’s question: What Should We Consider For Health When Buying A New Car? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
   I am looking into buying a new car. Do you have any recommendations for things to look out for? Hybrid or gas? Leather or cloth? Particular things to eliminate or request to reduce toxicity? I am planning to get a large enclosed truck or van to cart around things and dogs. Honda, Ford, or Toyota? Thanks, Bonnie
Hi, Bonnie. Hydrogen vehicles would be best of any offered because they do not produce gaseous monoxides and reduce dependency on oil but refueling is nearly prohibitive because very few fuel stations exist. Electric vehicles are my next preference because they do not produce gaseous monoxides and reduce dependency on oil, unless the electricity used in your town is powered by oil or coal. Yet, we must consider that, as all vehicles, electric vehicles produce very high levels of EMFs (electromagnetic fields). Hybrids use less gas and are a step toward reducing gaseous monoxides and other airborne combustion pollution but they produce high
levels of EMFs, as most cars do.
The accepted safe level of EMF is considered 3
miligauss amongst more health-conscious individuals. I notice that if I am exposed to higher levels of EMFs for more than 2 hours, I develop symptoms of mild fibromyalgia. If I expose myself to 5-10 hours, symptoms increase proportionately, I become not only sore but achy and stiff. I can sit for hours at my computer and not have the same results, so it is not that I am sitting for so long without moving.
I suggest that you test all vehicles for EMF emissions. Consider that EMFs emitted in the driver's seat are usually the highest. The next worst, I found under back seats in cars where batteries were stored under seats. If children sit in back seats, their gentle cells are much disrupted and may modify behavior unfavorably, making them weak, sore, achy and cranky.
When you shop for a vehicle, I suggest that you take an EMF meter with you while someone else

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 18th Edition - page 2 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 drives. You will find that all vehicles are much higher than the safe 3 miligauss limit. My 2003 Prius hybrid (Toyota) has EMF levels of 8-50 at the foot pedals. The faster my car goes, higher EMFs are produced, especially at foot pedals. So, most of the time when I drive, I place my feet on the mound between driver and front passenger where EMFs are rarely over 18. My 2003 Prius does not have a console as the later Priuses do, so I have that advantage. Best to keep legs and feet as far from pedals as possible and drive as much as possible with Cruise Control feature. Be sure to get a car with Cruise Control.
However, if a CD or tape plays, EMFs increase to 50-150 miligauss. It would be best to install a CD player in the trunk of the car but far enough from back seats so that children and other passengers are not affected by the high EMFs.
I had leather installed in all of my past vehicles because fabric upholstery is plastic and creates lint. It is unhealthy to breathe plastic lint. It must be
dissolved in the body to eliminate it in the mucous membranes of sinuses, throat, esophagus, bronchi, bronchioles and lungs. Plastic contains many hormone-disruptive chemicals as well as toxic carcinogenic polymers and epoxies.
After you buy a new vehicle, there will be many noxious toxic fumes produced by various products of which cars are made. I suggest you open all windows and doors and let the vehicle bake in the sun for up to 30 days to help speed the major outgassing process of new products. When driving during that 30-days drying period, leave all windows down and wear a gas mask to prevent inhaling exhaust fumes from other cars. If you live in areas with inclement weather, I suggest blocking rain or snowfall with an awning to prevent rain or snow from filling your open car during that major outgassing process. Also, get a car with a good air filter for interior of vehicle to help absorb further outgassing and environmental pollution while driving or riding in your new vehicle. ________________________________________
Subscriber’s question: Do People On Primal Diet Have More Gum And Tooth Diseases? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
I am thinking of going back on your [Primal] diet as I stopped it some time ago but have a renewed interest. However could you let me know what are the effects of consistently eating raw meat on gums and teeth? The reason I ask is because I have gum disease and...I noticed on Youtube a rant by a guy that seemed somewhat sincere but a rant none the less, saying that Aajonus had got it wrong. The strapline to his video was “a raw meat diet rots teeth”. He cited that all of the people he had met on this diet had gum disease and then proceeded to show a photograph of a friend whose mouth was clearly suffering from gum disease. This he said was due to all of the continued acid that people on this diet would be exposed to. I wanted to know what you felt about this. I accept that the guy is a vegan and therefore obviously has an agenda but I am more than intrigued to know if the possibility of over- acidity leeching calcium from the body due to over exposure to too much protein is a possibility. Yours
sincerely, Wayne Atkinson
Aajonus: Hi, Wayne, I think that the rant is not logical; you say he rants about decaying teeth but cites gum disease. They are two separate issues although they can be caused by the same toxins. Also, the rant is not rational because he does not consider that everybody stores toxins in their brains, and that toxins from brains most often detoxify through gums, salivary glands and tongue, especially if a person does not have tonsils. Very few people I know on my diet have gum disease and those that do, do not have it because of the foods. It is because of the toxins dumping through gums.
Most people I know who have receding gums are vegetarians and vegans, especially fruitarians. Most people have receding gums as they age, ask any dentist, that is not gum disease. We are living in a polluted world of immense airborne, medical and food contamination consisting of radical chemicals that are overly acidic and cause gum and tooth

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 18th Edition - page 3 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 diseases.
To get a rational view of whether my Primal Diet
creates over-acidity that causes receding gums, one can look to the Inuit (Eskimo), Samburu and Masai. None of those tribes had ANY gum problems or carries as long as they ate their normal raw diets of raw meats and raw dairy. They have the finest teeth into old age that is recorded. Most people I know on my Primal Diet stop or reduce movement toward receding gums on this diet unless they drink too much vinegar or brush their teeth with vinegar more than once weekly, or consume too much fruit especially citrus.
Consider my personal case: After medical radiation “therapy” for stomach and abdominal cancer, all of the bone around my teeth dissolved. The body eats its own bone to get alkalinizing minerals in times of gross injury or disease. I could not chew anything without bleeding profusely. I had to have everything blended into a liquid or puree and suck those through giant straws. I got 2-3 blood transfusions weekly, not because of the blood and bone cancers that the radiation gave me but because of the loose teeth that dangled and tore from the gums and caused so much bleeding that I lost about 1⁄2 cup blood before the bleeding stopped each time. Within 1.5 years after drinking and eating lots of raw dairy, the bone around my teeth reconstituted.
After chemo”therapy”, my gums receded terribly.
After consuming lots of raw dairy for 1.5 years, much of the receded gums reconstituted. When I switched to a raw fruitarian diet, I suffered much tooth decay and gum recession again. When I began eating raw meat twice daily and consuming raw dairy again, within 3 years my tooth decay decreased by 85% and gum recession stopped and reversed about 60%.
The over-acidity that causes so much gum and tooth disease comes from medical drugs especially injections, and processed foods with free-radical chemicals that dissolve bodily tissue whether the tissue is soft like gums or hard like bones. The gum disease presented by the concerned individual on Youtube is not evidence that my Primal diet caused it.
Many people think that a good diet should automatically resolve all health problems quickly. However, consider that our bodies are on Earth-time, not magical time. It takes hours, days, weeks and 40 years on a perfect diet to cleanse and replace every cell 5 times. According to doctors Pottenger and Howell, it takes 5 generations for diseased animals to achieve optimal health. For us, that is approximately 40 years. In our polluted environments, it may take longer even on a perfect diet.
Would someone like to go on Youtube and counter the fellows misconceptions; I wish I had time but I do not. __________________________________________
Subscriber’s question: Are Citizens Being Attacked By Their Governments? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
I get so much information that our government, and many governments in the world are about to create mass genocide. Much of the evidence I have read supports that theory and after your last newsletter, I am scared. What do you think about warnings of mass genocide? Meridiche
Aajonus: There is much evidence to support that there are and have been governmental programs designed to create mass genocide. President John F. Kennedy warned us about such secret elitist societies shortly before his assassination. Consider that big government is big business and is controlled by
several major industries whose profits have always been much more important than people.
The earliest absolute evidence I read was Henry Kissenger’s report "National Security Study Memorandum 200: Implications of worldwide population growth for U.S. security and overseas interest (NSSM 200)" which identifies India, Bangladesh, Pakistan, Nigeria, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, Philippines, Thailand, Egypt, Turkey, Ethiopia and Columbia as targets for initial population reduction. Subsequently, the Philippine Supreme Court found that 3 million Filipinas between 12 and 45 years of age were given the U.S. vaccine that caused sterility. Native American

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 18th Edition - page 4 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 women and African-American women in the U.S. received that vaccine. Consequently, sterility rates in Native American women in the U.S. increased to over 35% and sterility rates in African-American women increased to over 25%.
In December 1976, no epidemic of Swine Flu surfaced despite rapid approval and response to a perceived pandemic threat following 1 death of a solder at Ft. Dix, NJ. Our government ordered and paid about $150 millions for a Swine Flu vaccine with taxpayers’ money and over $350 millions in lawsuits for damage caused by that vaccine. The Swine Flu inoculation program was shut down with in 6 weeks after risk of death and polio like symptoms from the vaccination were found to be almost 12 times greater in vaccinated than unvaccinated people. Five percent of the people afflicted died, and 10% were crippled or maimed for life.
Center for Disease Control (CDC) now under- reports those incidents, stating only 46 deaths caused by Swine Flu vaccine of 1976. However, consumer advocate Ida Honoroff’s investigation at the time revealed over 2,200 deaths. I knew her and communicated with her on several occasions, including an hour-long KPFK radio show we did together in 1978.
Additional information that supports mass genocide by governments is that in May 1987, The Times of London reported on its front page that smallpox vaccine administered by the World Health Organization (WHO) had caused HIV/AIDS in over 100 million Africans. Robert Gallo, so-called discoverer of the HIV/AIDS virus, defends those figures and says, "AIDS researchers will keep their mouths shut because they are paid to do so." More supportive evidence is that on November 28, 2002, a rider tacked onto the end of the Homeland Security Bill confers immunity from liability prosecution on Eli Lilly and other manufacturers of vaccines.
Fast forward to 2009, we have another swine flu fiasco generated by the U.S. and U.K. governments and backed by 154 governments world-wide. A South African newspaper reported that on June 26,"Suspicious aircraft were forced to land. A US operated AN-124 [Russian-made long- range heavy transport] changed its call sign from civilian to military which then triggered a response from the IAF (Indian Air Force) upon
entering Pakistani air space [forcing] the plane to land in Mumbai while [a] second one was forced down by Nigerian fighter jets that also arrested the crew."
"According to reports, China's People's Liberation Army Air Force contacted the Indian and Nigerian intelligence officials about the presence of these US operated Ukrainian aircraft amidst growing concern that the United States was spreading 'biological agents' in the Earth's atmosphere, which some Chinese officials believed to be an attempt to [commit] mass genocide via the spread of H1N1 swine flu."
These aircraft "were carrying 'waste disposal' systems that could spray up to 45,000 kg [nearly 100,000 pounds] of aerial type mist from sophisticated... nano pipes in the planes' wings, forming what is normally called chemtrails. Last week, [aircraft] sprayed [an unknown] substance over Ukraine days before the [mysterious] plague outbreak."
Further scrutiny should be directed to the CDC who went out on a limb by crying Swine Flu (H1N1) PANDEMIC. They were and still are pushing it as hard as they can, and in a committed way. However, consider that CDC ordered that testing people for H1N1 stop in JULY. Was it because they did not want the public to know it was a mild flu season? From that point on, anybody with a sniffle, cough, limp, pimple, hangnail or shirttail hanging was diagnosed with Swine Flu. Even then, the numbers weren’t high enough it appears because CDC began to make them up.
Two days before Obama announced his “nationwide Swine Flu State of Emergency,” Tom Frieden, the CDC director, drank four cups of coffee, stood up before the press, and said “many millions” of people in US had Swine Flu. He pulled that right out of his imagination. Until that moment, the figure was somewhere around 44,000 but he looked straight toward the cameras and said “many millions.” Reporters stood there and looked blank, as usual. (Jon Rapaport, investigative reporter,
www.NoMoreFakeNews.com.)
But "many millions" must have been too vague, so CDC released another figure: 22 millions world-
 
 Primal Diet Newsletter; 18th Edition - page 5 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 wide. CDC said right before that, that 98,000 people had been hospitalized with (untested-for) Swine Flu and that 4000 people in the US had died from (untested-for) Swine Flu. Were these estimates based on science and testing? Of course not.
Every year since the 1970s, CDC reported that in the U.S. 36,000 people die of ordinary flu. (Ref: JAMA; 289 (2); 179-86.) CDC stated 4000 people died from the Swine Flu in 6 months. However every year, 9 times that many died from ordinary flu according to CDC. CDC’s figure for yearly hospitalizations from ordinary flu in the U.S. is 200,000. If 98,000 people have been hospitalized in the US with Swine Flu in the last six months (and remember, this is a lie based on nothing because the CDC stopped testing anyone for Swine Flu in JULY), that would average out to about 200,000 Swine Flu hospitalizations for the year. Which is what happens EVERY YEAR, according to the CDC. Yet ordinary flu is not called a pandemic, and no one goes crazy, and the media say nothing, and there is no hysteria BUT THE DRUG COMPANIES DO NOT MAKE ENOUGH MONEY so the drug-companies-owned U.S. Congress and White House do their bidding by declaring pandemic and the profits roll-in for all of them. Here is a video stating a legal suit that documented such mortal actions: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y6enlzeAYt4
About 10 days ago, Disaster Specialist Ray Greenwood of the Disaster & Client Services division of American Red Cross, Orange County Chapter, called a Mass Mortality Training by Rosina Smith, Rio Hondo Health Services Lead, on Monday,
November 16, 2009 at the Rio Hondo Chapter at 7pm at 6706 S. Friends Ave., Whittier, CA 90601. For the past 5 months, Mass-Mortality trainings have been conducted throughout the U.S. and other countries.
None of the above is absolute proof that mass genocide is being perpetrated among populations of the world because we do not have a motive. If we consider that all governments are in debt beyond reconciliation, we might have motive. Take for example our U.S. Social Security (SS) funds. Since President Ford began using SS funds to pay federal debts and President Reagan exuberantly increased spending of SS funds to finance government programs, SS funds will run out in several years. Who is not going to get their SS benefits and who is going to get upset at the US government? Therein lies great motive for the crime of genocide.
Consider all of the chemtrails we have experienced in the last 15 years, and now another Swine Flu (H1N1) hoax. Are they parts of the same plot to distract the population and protect legislators from harm? There are hundreds of reputable people postulating with sound evidence that governments are trying to destroy people for personal gain. Time will tell.
However, it is up to each of us to prepare for the worst and care for ourselves and loved ones who are willing to be helped. Those who are not willing cannot be helped. In my newsletter #16, I revealed my survival kit in case the worst happens. But then, I may simply be paranoid without just cause and none of the above means anything. ___________________________________________
SUBJECTIVE Effects of Dietary and Environmental Pollution on Children's Sleep
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Although this subject could be dealt with properly in an entire book, I will give brief summation of my research and experiments. Many food additives, pesticides, herbicides and chemical fertilizers cause disruptions in brain and nerves. Only three of thousands of neuron and nerve disruptive toxins are: MSG (a preservative), aspartame (sweetener) and food colorings. Although this essay is geared toward children, it relates to adults. When sushi bars began using MSG to preserve their raw fish in Los
Angeles in 2002, I began to get severe headaches and nausea that disrupted my sleep and in general, my life. I stopped eating at Los Angeles sushi bars.
Depending on the makeup and health of a child, behavior modifications differ from various toxins. Often, many of food additives cause disturbances during sleep. Most often, heavy free-radical, cauterized metallic minerals are part of food additives, pesticides, herbicides and chemical fertilizers found in foods. Because our brains and

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 18th Edition - page 6 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 nervous systems utilize much metallic minerals from food and pollution to conduct electricity and reflect light, they store in the brain and nervous system causing disorders along with a myriad of neck and head diseases including tonsillitis and dental decay.
Most often, our brains and nervous systems detoxify during the night when we sleep. As children's bodies detoxify those chemicals and free- radicals, too frequently they cause bad dreams, night twitches and spasms. Those symptoms are caused by all of the many neuron-and-nerve- disruptive chemicals that cause excessive electricity and acidity, irritating neurons and nerves.
To alleviate those symptoms in children, it is
In my next issue (19th Edition), I will reveal tests that show some of what was forcefully injected into me on April 2, 2009 (see 17th Edition).

important to eliminate all processed foods from the diet and prepare meals and snacks from organic foods, preferable fresh. As a remedy to reverse those symptoms in children and adults more immediately, drinking raw milk and eating raw, no- salt-added cheeses throughout the day helps provide alkalinizing minerals to bind with and neutralize those metallic free-radicals and chemicals. Often, simply raw milk is needed. When symptoms are chronic, both raw milk and raw cheese may be needed. Thereby, 95% percent of the time, I have seen children sleep restfully and peacefully after as little as one day eating raw dairy and eliminating any and all processed foods. __________________________________________

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

Knowing Some Of Ingredients In Forced Injections With Hair And Iridology Analyses
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
   Since I was unable to have blood and urine analyses immediately after forced injections of April, 2009 (see Primal Diet newsletter Edition #17), I had to seek other means to determine some of what was injected. Usually within 1 month after toxic exposure, by using iridology, I can see in the eyes what parts of the body were damaged and contaminated, if the body stored the toxins. Normally, even for someone following the Primal Diet perfectly, gross exposure to toxins will result in internal damage and contamination. However, if a person is very fat, often the fat will chelate with the toxins and prevent inter-
cellular contamination and harm. That is another reason I like to maintain a high ratio of body fat. Unfortunately, I had just experienced a detoxification that resulted in much weight-loss prior to the forced injections.
The sections of my irises in 2 photos below reveal that much of the contamination stored in my intestinal walls (all the little black spots). Note that the purplish cast around the spots indicates radioactive material especially in the second iris- section photo. (Purplish cast may appear purplish brown on some computers.)

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 19th Edition - page 2 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
  
 Primal Diet Newsletter; 19th Edition - page 3 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
  I experienced many bodily illnesses/changes after the forced injections that indicate the toxins permeated everywhere, not just the intestines. The mass freckles that I have now all over my body and many warts indicate that my body threw some of it out into and through skin after these toxins did internal cellular damage .
Our bodies discard many toxic elements by building them into hair. The toxic elements that are built into hair at any particular time could have entered our bodies as early as during gestation even if we are 100 years young. However, during a severe toxic exposure, within 30 days the body will incorporate many of the toxic elements into building hair. After several months of growth, hair analyses can reveal what the body discarded by building it into one's hair .
The results of hair analysis before and after the
forced injections are below; hair was taken from my head in both analyses. Notice how almost all of the toxic elements increased exponentially, indicating that I was given a soup of injected poisons designed to create disease slowly rather than kill quickly. I cut hair from my right leg where so many of the toxins discharged, to gather evidence also but the hair sample was not enough for the lab. I asked the lab to return the deficient sample. After the hair grows foranother several months, I will cut more from my left leg, add it to the previously cut hair and have them analyzed .
Please do not be misled by the two different patient numbers. One is with my birthday numbered backwards; both are mine. I avoid using my name for self-protection and less likelihood for interference of tests.

 As of December 19, 2009, I am at the end of an 8- days cold-flu detoxification wherein the same types of sores I experienced after the forced injections erupted on my neck, scalp, shoulders, upper torso and arms. However, they were of the smaller variety experienced in the first 3 days after forced injections. My cold/flu symptoms began in the sinuses with burning, soreness, swelling and near constant nasal drip. Within 3 days, symptoms progressed to voluminous sinus, nasal and throat mucus discharges. After 3 more days, detoxification moved into my lungs with infrequent deep mucosal coughs.
Subscriber’s question:
However, sometimes in the morning, coughs lasted several minutes, discharging thick brown or greenish mucus. Increased eye pressure and redness fluctuated throughout. The open sore on the ball of my right foot subsided for about 3 weeks but is no opening gain and painful.
I continue to eat lots of butter/honey mixture, about 6 to 1 respectively. I notice that when I eat red meats at this time with restricted milk supply, I become lethargic. So, I mainly eat fish until I get so hungry I have to eat red meats for one day, then fish again for several days. __________________________________________
With Mercury Found In Wild Animals, Do We Need To Be Extra Careful?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
I recall one of your late 2006 or 2007 newsletters advising that mercury ingestion from RAW fish is much less than from cooked fish, the implication being that it is probably safe to eat RAW meats and fish even if they are known to have moderate mercury levels.
I'm finding data, or at least allegations, that mercury poisoning is found in wild predators, presumably as a result of eating (raw) prey that has mercury in its tissues -- e.g., the following link pointing to mercury toxicity in Florida panthers who consume more raccoons than deer. http://www.panthersociety.org/mercury.html
Perhaps less mercury is absorbed from eating meats raw, but is enough still absorbed to cause problems? And if so, should we avoid most fish as much as possible?
I thought your point was that eating it RAW was the key. But then how do the cougars suffer from eating the raccoons raw? Wouldn't we suffer similarly from eating mercury-laden fish, and those exist even in open ocean water, it is said. ??
Sorry, just trying hard to understand- is the distinction how much and what type of Hg is in
the animal we eat, or in whether we eat it raw or cooked? Thanks, Bonny Schumaker
Aajonus: Hi, Bonny. There are many ways that land and fresh-water animals receive mercury poisoning. It is sprayed as pesticides and fungicides greatly in Florida where raccoons forage. Many mercury-containing poisons are in garbage dumps where raccoons rummage. As I have stated for years, ocean-caught fish are not exposed to the type and concentrations of mercury that land and fresh-water animals are.
I suggest that we do NOT avoid wild-caught ocean creatures that are consider high in mercury. My point was that eating ocean wild-caught raw fish was a factor with low mercury absorption. Land and fresh- water animals do not have the same mineral-altering ability that ocean animals have. Also, land and fresh- water animals are exposed to a lot more industrial mercury than ocean animals.
Most of our mercury-poisoning is from pharma- ceutical and other industrial pollution. Government and industry want to blame fish-eating for our mercury woes but it is mostly a smokescreen to avoid lawsuits that would rightfully blame government and pharmaceuticals for our mercury-poisoning. ___________________________________________

 Subscriber’s question: What Is Nutrient Value Of Dehydrated foods? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Do you know how Aajonus feels about dehydrators; mine has a temperature of as low as 95 to 155? Seems like it would be great to use to make the survival meat esp. in winter time. Jennifer Nelson
Aajonus: Hi, Jennifer. Consider that dehydrating anything live does not preserve life. If I dehydrated you at only 70 degrees F. you would be dead and relatively useless except as some type of carbon fuel. Likewise, when food is dehydrated, it loses all of the bioactive enzymatic activity along with most of its H2O. Native Inuit used to make Pemmican in case they were unable to find food in the most difficult winter months. They made Pemmican every late summer by drying meats and then crushing them into flour-consistency. Then they melted some type of animal fat in the sun and mixed it with the dehydrated, powdered meats. They kept the mixture in the sun until it dried to a waxy hard substance and molded it into 90-pounds blocks. If necessary, they ate 1⁄4-1⁄2 cup daily with 1 cup stream
or lake water. However, they knew that dehydrating foods caused much nutrient loss. If they did not have to eat their Pemmican survival food, they buried it in Spring-time and left it for nature to recycle.
Most people notice that when they eat dehydrated foods that their digestion is slowed and much water is craved and consumed. When non- dehydrated foods are eaten slowly, the H2O is carried with nutrients to cells. When dehydrated foods are eaten, the body leaches enzymes and H2O from our bodies to try to digest, absorb and assimilate nutrients. Digestion, absorption and assimilation of dehydrated foods are long and laborious tasks for our bodies and cause gradual dehydration, including drying of skin and entire body.
As survival foods, dehydrated foods dried below 96 degrees F. may be practical but as nutritiously rich foods, they fail. Best for nutritional value to eat all foods as natural as possible. __________________________________________
Subscriber’s question: What Is Nutrient Value Trace Minerals; Should We Add More? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Has Aajonus addressed the question of adding more significant amounts of liquid trace minerals to good quality untreated water? (I have been using "Sea Crop" which I use for feeding plants including herbs and garden vegetables like tomatoes and hot peppers). I realize that such water does not exist in LA. But it does here in Vermont. I agree that water is a powerful solvent. But, it is also a carrier, and as such could be a carrier for beneficial content, like alkalizing minerals as found in nature, like vegetable juices are. I realize the vegetable juices are the ideal, however, I'm
considering the contingency of viable alternatives. It is very possible that fresh vegetables may become unavailable or relatively unavailable in the future here in the northeast out of season. Also, has Aajonus changed his position on glass bottled naturally sparkling mineral waters like Gerolsteiner?
Aajonus: Hi, Bonny. Water is relatively deficient in nutrients. It only has trace amounts of minerals and adding another trace relatively does nothing because the minerals are non-absorbable in humans. They may attract and chelate with toxic

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 19th Edition - page 8 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 minerals such as free-radicals and other over-acidic minerals but they cannot be absorbed for nutrient value. Plants digest rock and that is what minerals in water are. When it rains, rock minerals are dissolved to the extent that plants can digest, absorb and assimilate them but we cannot. On my raw PD, drinking more than about 1⁄2 cup water daily leaches and dilutes nutrients in our digestive tracts and dehydrates cells rather than hydrates them.
If you are interested in increasing mineral absorption, I suggest that you drink more milk, and eat cheese with a little honey 30 minutes after every meat meal. Ratio of cheese to honey should be about 6 to 1, respectively, such as 1 T. cheese to 1⁄2 tsp honey. ALL of the minerals in milk and cheese may be digested and absorbed in our bodies. Cheese without honey will not digest because it is a dehydrated substance. Mixing a little honey with it will add bioactive enzymes so that the minerals and some other nutrients in cheese may be digested, absorbed and assimilated.
I continue to advise that if drinking water, the
safest (chemical-free) water is naturally sparkling mineral water in glass. However, the very best water if we are going to drink water would be algae- rich lake water with all of the bacteria and other organism in it. I have heard the tales of malaria in stream and lake waters throughout tropical environments and I believe it is myth just as 99% of all medical information is myth, which is designed to keep us taking medication rather than heal.
Natives in tropics are so brainwashed now that they believe they cannot drink their own organism- rich waters because of fear of malaria. Whenever they watched me consume such waters, they think that this white man has lost his mind. I have never gotten sick from any such chemical-free waters. I have consumed water from ponds and reservoirs rich with cattle urine and feces and, like cattle, never gotten sick with diarrhea or vomit. That water has never made me feel dehydrated as bottled waters and rain water does. In fact, sometimes consuming just a little has improved my digestion. __________________________________________
Subscriber’s question: Is It True You Eat Buckets Of Cow Dung? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
There is a very interesting website that states you eat fecal matter from Organic Pastures Dairy by the buckets. Is that true? Daniel Holt
Aajonus: Hi, Daniel. People take my stories, like the above urine and feces in reservoir water, and invent the craziest of stories. Fecal matter tastes like overly cooked vegetables; a diet I detested as a child and still do. I utilize it only remedially. Even with my unusual dietary approach, people should be a little more cautious of irrational gossip.
I have suggested the consumption of fecal matter for several health conditions, which are psychotropic illness, seemingly irreversible cancers and severe indigestion, non-assimilation and mal- absorption. When I suggested that someone eat fecal matter for any of the above named conditions, I suggested that they acquire the bowel of an animal with its contents intact wherein bacteria is preserved and relatively bioactive. It is a true probiotic and
works 100 times better than any probiotic supplement on the market.
As far as acquiring feces from a dairy farm, I have told people consistently that when fecal matter sits in the sun and/or air, its bacteria is dehydrated and neutralized. Maybe if you captured a fresh dump and consumed it relatively soon, you would get lots of probiotic-rich substance. Or you dug deep into a fecal patty that had been dropped within an hour, you might find some warm active bacteria but you would have to eat it within minutes to make it worthwhile.
When debating the subject of and supporting the eating of fecal matter, we should consider that fecal matter from herbivores is predigested. It requires very little digestion for any animal that would eat it. If other animals who do not have digestive systems to digest vegetable matter eat herbivore-feces, they will be able to digest considerable amounts of predigested protein and fats that they cannot

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 19th Edition - page 9 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 normally get from vegetation.
Some tribes who lack animal protein because of
deforestation thrive on fecal matter. Although not an appealing gourmet diet to me and most “civilized” people, it certainly provides nutrients necessary for vibrant health. If we eat for health
rather than taste, who will enjoy better health? However, I enjoy eating my raw dairy, meats and eggs and do not need to eat feces except rarely, remedially.

Subscriber’s question: Oysters - Special Food In Our Toxic World by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
  Is there something oysters are especially good for? Ilene
Hi, Ilene. There are two reasons to eat oysters: First but not ultimately, is to stimulate sexual prowess. Secondly and ultimately in our toxic world, oysters supply nutrients to help our bodies remove heavy metals quicker than anything else and usually with significantly reduced symptoms. Cilantro and berries will help our bodies remove heavy metals both deep and already loosened, respectively. Cilantro helps remove heavy metals but does not contain all of the animal fats that soothe and protect our cells, so there are side effects such as, nausea, graying of skin and hair, diarrhea and vomit. When we eat oysters in abundance to remove metals, there are little or no side effects.
I’ve had about 12 people over the past 5 years eat large quantities of oysters and it has been successful in every case. The first person that experimented with me was a woman born and raised in the heart of
London. She had airplanes from 4 airports flying over her constantly so she was living in and breathing all the jet and diesel exhaust and particles of those planes as well as from heavy street traffic. Anyone in the aerospace industry knows how bad those particles are, especially in jet and diesel fuels. From that metallically toxic environment, her irises looked very similar to irises of lathe operators, showing an abundance of black, charcoal and grayish coloration throughout her entire irises that should be blue. Even her skin had a grayish cast.
The condition caused her a lot of physical problems, and resultantly emotional problems. She was usually fatigued and suffered chronic Fibromyalgia. Because of her emotional fluctuations, she was on and off the diet for about 1 1⁄2 years. Finally I said, “Let’s try something more radical. I suggest that you do this religiously, so we can make a difference with your health. I suggest that you eat a half to a whole cup of red meat with three oysters twice daily, 6 days weekly with one day off,

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 20th Edition - page 2 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 replacing oysters with whatever other meats you want.” She did the regime for a year. In one year, she removed as much metallic poisons as most people remove in 3 to 5 years on my Primal Diet (PD). Her life changed. Her suffering Chronic Fatigue and Fibromyalgia reduced to the extent that she enjoyed and pursued life and experience.
I suggest that no one eat oysters from Florida or the Gulf of Mexico. U.S. military regularly dump vast amounts of radioactive waste and freight ships
Subscriber’s question:
passing through Panama Canal discharge and dump petroleum chemicals and waste hourly. Farmed oysters, clams, muscles and scallops because, unlike non-ocean-based farmed creatures, they cannot survive eating processed food. Farmed oysters, clams, muscles and scallops are grown in the ocean normally on ocean waters. The thing that makes them farmed is that people fence off an area of the ocean where they grown and break off clusters and move them to other rocks where they can grow larger. ________________________________________
Is Eating Pickled Fish Better For Health Than Fresh Fish; Does Pickling Preserve Fish?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
In terms of preserving meat, I was wondering can you preserve fish in vinegar, like pickled fish? Have you ever tried anything like that? Carla
Preserving raw fish with raw vinegar for longer than 2 weeks with the same recipe that pickles are made will completely disintegrate fish and you will have a preserved fish soup. That fish soup will digest faster because it is predigested and your body will use little or no enzymes for digestion. Normal acidic intestinal bacteria can digest it quickly to make food for us. However, most people do not want raw-fish soup, they want chewy fish.
Fish used for pickling commercially is cooked, processed and preserved to the point that vinegar will
no longer dissolve it. Also, the vinegar they use is cooked and processed. The processing of raw fish for commercial purposes hardens it, as if it is in formaldehyde-based chemicals. If vinegar cannot dissolve your food, can your digestive juices (ideally 20% of digestion) and intestinal bacteria (ideally 80% of digestion) dissolve it? Can you imagine eating formaldehyde preserved fish? Stated humorously: That is a choice. However, if you want chewy fish, I suggest you marinate fish in vinegar and/or lemon juice from 1-24 hours, and pour off the vinegar and/or lemon juice from 1-24 hours. Usually, that preserves fish for 2-5 weeks, however after 2 weeks it may have a little rank odor. ___________________________________________
Subscriber’s question: Can We Preserve Raw Chicken In Vinegar Or Lemon Juice? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Somebody said something about marinating chicken with vinegar and lemon juice. Have you tried that? Carla
When preserving raw chicken in raw lemon juice and/or raw vinegar for more than several days, the chicken will dissolve the same as raw fish. Lemon juice will dissolve whatever raw meat you marinate in it. If you just leave it in lemon juice for 1-24 hours,
and pour off the lemon juice, chicken and fish will solidify and stay that way for 1-2 weeks. If when you pour off lemon juice, you pour stone-pressed olive oil over the chicken, it may be preserved for 1-4 weeks. However, there may be some gas that forms which smells slightly rank. Remember that raw lemon juice and raw vinegar promote fermentation, they do not stop fermentation. ___________________________________________

Subscriber’s question: Can We Preserve Raw Fish In Oil? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Could you do the same thing with fish, like sardines? They’re packed in oil aren’t they, in a can? Terri
You can do that but not in metal containers. It is best to marinate everything in glass. I recommend that you cure the fish for 1-24 hours in lemon juice,
pour off the lemon juice and then add your vinegar but again, it is likely to last no more than 2 weeks without getting unappealingly rank but still very nutritious. I discussed preserving meats for long periods several issues ago for my survival kit. __________________________________________
Subscriber’s question:
I’m looking at my sleeping cycles and I have a tendency in the mornings, just before I get up, for my mind to start racing. I’m wondering what fats and proteins you recommend for people who are early wakers with racing minds? Christi
Usually, consuming raw fish and sea food with their high minerals are best to relax the body. Eating some cheese and a tiny bit of honey (4:1 ratio respectively) 30-40 minutes after eating raw meat will help relax the body. Like any dried food that is deficient in active bacteria and enzymes, cheeses do not digest well. However, when we add honey to cheese, we digest minerals, some proteins and fats, especially minerals. Food minerals when in raw food help our bodies relax themselves by protecting cells and binding with toxins that irritate cells.
If you feel disturbed and anxious when you awaken, you likely have lots of old toxic adrenaline in your system, or caustic toxins are irritating your nerve cells. I suggest that you have a nut formula at least once weekly, maybe twice weekly. Or, you could have half a nut formula one day and the remaining half the next day. That formula provides nutrients for our bodies to chelate with toxic
adrenaline from tension or toxicity that sometimes stores in our bodies. Eating 1⁄2 tsp cheese without honey hourly can help chelate with caustic toxins irritating our bodies. Also, exercise utilizes excessive adrenaline that causes anxiety and stress.
Eating fish at least one hour before bedtime is optimal for relaxation. Consuming nut formula at least 3 hours prior to bedtime is optimal for relaxed sleep and waking. Red meats eaten to help sleep may cause the opposite: more energy. It may be best to eat raw eggs with raw red meat for better sleep and relaxation. For people who have good digestion, any of those foods mentioned herein may be eaten only 1 hour prior to bedtime. People with poor digestion, might want to eat those foods 2-4 hours prior to bedtime so that their bodies have enough time to digest, absorb, assimilate and utilize some of the nutrients in those foods. Except, of course, high meat will begin absorption, assimilation and utilization within 20 minutes and may be eaten 30 minutes before sleep. Bacteria in high meat predigest the meat; much like bacteria in raw milk predigest milk to become kefir and yogurt. __________________________________________

Subscriber’s question: Quick Alternative Cure For Arthritis; True Or False? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
There is an arthritis cure on the internet that is basically a therapist injecting the joint with a formula of Lidocaine (an anesthetic) and common dextrose (sugar water). What do you think about it?
Rather than curing arthritis, I think that the therapy is not a remedy but a destruction of the nerves in the joints and a loss of pain is all that is beneficially experienced. Most often, pain is Nature’s way of telling us something is wrong, that toxicity has accumulated in an area or system from malnutrition, accident or contamination/poisoning. If we ignore the cause of pain, often toxins remain and disease develops.
To be thorough, let us look at arthritis. It is a swelling of joints from toxicity that has stored there, inter-cellularly or extra-cellularly. I guestimate from experience that 90% of arthritis is from leaky gut. When a person’s intestines fail to produce enough or poor-quality mucus, intestinal walls deteriorate and become thin. As intestines thin, they begin to tear when a lot of food is eaten at one time. Undigested food particles pass into the gut (called leaky gut). Most often the undigested food is moved to joints where cells are stronger and more rigid, and food will be digested with the least damage to surrounding tissue. However, the process often causes joints to dissolve along with the food and waste products collect. Ten percent of arthritis is from other toxins entering joints, especially antibiotics and vaccines.
Let’s also evaluate Lidocaine that is most often used by dentists. Lidocaine causes numbness and nerve damage. When our bodies cannot remove it,
Subscriber’s Question:
our bodies try to neutralize Lidocaine by surrounding the molecules with concentrations of minerals. That process hardens nerves and surrounding tissue, and often causes permanent mild to severe sensory loss. Consider that processed sugar is an acidic compound that, even in resilient intestines and bones, gradually dissolves our villi, bones and teeth.
Therefore, since Lidocaine was produced to enter and alter nerve cells, Lidocaine carries sugar into nerves and nerve destruction occurs. Lidocaine and sugar do NOT carry toxins out of the joints. They contain toxins, and our bodies respond with minerals deposit, hardening and damaging tissue. I have seen several of those cases end in joint replacement because pain that was designed to make us change and correct the way we feed and treat our bodies was ignored. Some of the joints in those patients dissolved painlessly from toxicity without further notice, and mobility was lost. Some of those people began to re-experience excruciating pain when deterioration was so advanced that new and surrounding nerves were affected. It is a very young “therapy” and most of the results won’t show for many years as more people subject themselves to it.
However, there were 2 cases that had the Lidocaine/sugar-water "therapy” which removed their constant arthritic pain and then immediately adopted my Primal Diet. They did not experience pain as the foods provided their bodies with nutrients to remove the compounds of toxicity from joints that previously caused them painful arthritis.

What If You Have High Blood-Pressure While Transitioning Into Primal Diet?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
My question would be on transitioning into the raw diet, which I’m doing and I’ve only been doing it for 3 or 4 weeks, I think. I’ve been doing eggs and some other things. I’m having some high blood pressure. It’s almost like my blood gets thicker. Clarice
High blood pressure should be tolerated. High
blood pressure is very necessary for most people who have either arterial congestion, or are overweight, or subject to certain toxins, including house molds. Since you are not overweight, you probably have congested arteries or something is toxic in your home or office.

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 20th Edition - page 5 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
High blood pressure makes blood move through our bodies properly when something interferes with or limits circulation. When you have high blood pressure and you slow blood pressure with medication or homeopathy, you’re likely to cause clots because the blood is not moving fast enough through congested arteries. Excessive pressure on the blood stream from obesity requires high blood pressure to properly move the blood. Enjoy your high blood pressure.
If you have high blood pressure that is not disease-oriented from eating too much garlic or other spices, eating some grapefruit will provide the
nutrients for your body to lower blood pressure. I suggest that you eat half of a grapefruit daily for 10 days. If that brings it down, then you simply lacked nutrients to lower blood pressure. If eating grapefruit does not help your body lower blood pressure, then your body needs high blood pressure. I think it’s good for everyone to have high blood pressure for awhile at times. High blood pressure is important for many people over mid-forties and they may have high blood pressure for the rest of their lives because they do not care for themselves enough to make necessary changes in diet and environment. __________________________________________
Subscriber’s question: Are There Aggressive Treatments For Cancer? by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Regarding cancer, I was listening to your DVD set recently again and I noticed you made a point about tumors that are not resolving. I don’t say that mine are unresolving, I’m doing a lot better, but with unresolving tumors you suggest consuming buffalo feces Would you explain how?.
Since E.coli and other bowel bacteria eat flesh food best, we can use them to consume tumors in the body. You may ask, how our bodies know E.coli will eat dead and cancerous cells rather than healthy cells. Consider that our bodies are highly intelligent unless we poison them with extremely toxic substances. Consider that even with all the abuses our bodies take from us with diet and life-style, they continue to detoxify, survive and heal. We can count on our bodies’ intelligence. Consider that our bodies are a lot more caring and smarter than our consciousness. What we have to admit is that we are stupid and ignorant. Most often, we deny our bodies’ intelligence.
When we realize we are responsible for everything that happens to our bodies with our life-styles, we become smarter. Yet, because of our dietary conditioning, I do not think that we should trust our bodies when they crave cooked and processed foods, unless the food is cooked starch (when my nut formula does not work) with the limitations I instructed in my books.
Regarding eating feces and dissolving non- resolving tumors, I suggest that you find an organic farmer listed on my 'Report of producers and distributors at http://www.wewant2live.com/site/811618/product/R PD-01'. Do not order a clump of cow patty from a field. Order the bowel with its contents. Shortly after feces are exposed to air/oxygen, digestive bacteria die. Therefore, we must get the active bacteria-laden feces from within the bowel of the animal.
We should order a 1-2 pounds section of bowel with contents intact, tied at both ends. It will look like a fat sausage when received but with feces inside. I recommend that it be placed in a wide- mouthed glass quart or half gallon glass jar to be consumed a little at a time without refrigeration.
Although air destroys digestive bacteria, a lot of airspace must be kept in the jar because bacteria will continue to digest the food-matter in the bowel, causing bowel and contents to expand in the jar. With air space, bowel and content will have room to expand without breaking the jar. Also, I suggest that the jar filled with bowel and contents be kept in a wooden or cardboard box outside because of gaseous odors that will leak from jar(s). If you obtain and eat it during winter, I suggest that you keep it in a somewhat warm place in your garage inside a wooden or cardboard box.
  
 Primal Diet Newsletter; 20th Edition - page 6 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
Normally, I suggest that people with cancer or psychotropic illness eat about 2 ounces daily until it is consumed. Also, our bodies can use it to help improve chronic digestive problems. I recommend that it be consumed shortly before meat meals. I suggest that you remove the string that ties one end, open the bowel and scoop out the poop, then close the bowel again and tie it in a bow. It does not have to be tied tightly. Consume the contents as soon as possible after extracting it from bowel. If it is from a cow or other herbivore, it is going to taste like overly cooked vegetables with feces' odor. As I suggested in one of my books, use a swimmer’s nose clip over your nostrils to avoid the odor. Bon appetit!
To remove the fecal odor from hands, I suggest rubbing lemon juice into the hands. Then rub raw tomato into hands. Twenty minutes after washing that way, usually the odor disappears.
When people get anxious about their tumors and
want to get a little aggressive to dissolve it or them, I suggest that they consume 11⁄2-2 tablespoons of vinegar daily and/or consume feces but not together. Eating feces has definitely helped in every case to either stop growth and/or dissolve tumors. Eating feces is not for everyone. It is for those who are courageous enough to quicken improvement of digestion, mental attitudes and cancers. Eating feces as I instructed is good for brain and nervous system because bowel bacteria are responsible for digesting food molecules to finite form that feeds our brains and nervous systems best. It seems our government doesn’t want us smart because they try to rid us of E. coli and other bacteria. A note about consuming vinegar as suggested above: consume half of the suggested vinegar mixed in 2-3 ounces of raw milk, and immediately drink 2 more ounces of raw milk without vinegar. ___________________________________________
Proof Of Long-term Delayed Detoxification; 58 Years Later
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
On a Saturday in late spring of my 3rd year of life, my father purchased a brand new push mower. My two older brothers had their turns pushing it. I wanted my turn but my brothers refused me and let a neighbor boy push it. I was outraged at what I thought was injustice and I grabbed the bar next to the blades to stop it from moving as the boy pushed it. It cut off the end of my right middle finger. I ran into the house to my father (mom was grocery- shopping). He saw the blood spurting and panicked. He poured cold water from the refrigerator into a stainless steel metal pan and stuck my hand in it. It bled worse. He wrapped a hand towel around my finger and hand and pushed my wrapped hand into the cold water again. He drove me to “Emergency” at the hospital.
The young intern looked at it and decided I needed a tetanus shot. He asked my father the last time I had had a tetanus vaccine and my father said he didn’t know. After the intern filled his hypodermic with tetanus, he moved toward my hand with it. I screamed from instinctive fear. The intern thought the needle scared me and offered to jab me with a blunted wire that he happened to have at hand instead
of the needle. He tried to explain to me that the blunt wire would be much more painful than the sharp needle. Since I was autistic, I didn’t understand his words but I got the gist of it and I chose the blunted wire. He and 2 nurses were shocked. Obviously, they had pulled this stunt on other children and it worked every time but not on me.
I could see and feel dangerous energy being emitted from that hypodermic of which I was afraid. One of the nurses told me a story about a blunt scissors going into her foot, I thought because she handled scissors and gestured toward her foot as if to jab it. It did not sway me and I pointed to the wire again. They looked at each other, grabbed me and held me down while the intern injected my finger around the nail 7 times with tetanus vaccine, injecting a little each time. He injected the rest into my upper arm.
He prepared another hypodermic and injected it into several places on my forearm, at which point I screamed again. My arm became numb. He sliced a section of skin from my forearm, trimmed it and sewed it onto the opened wound of my finger. He sewed one stitch to close the cut he made in my

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 20th Edition - page 7 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
forearm. Within several months of that surgery, the end of my finger turned so hard I could ram it into anything painlessly. The end of my finger was deformed and dead as rock with scar tissue.
Exactly 12 months after I began eating raw meat and 27 years after that finger was cut by the lawnmower, that finger swelled from its end to the first joint and became very red and sensitive. Within 3 days, the grafted skin on my finger fell off where new skin had replaced it. The finger was much less deformed, sensitive and had normal texture. Then, nearly 58 years after the surgery, on December 23, 2008, my finger began to swell and produced an odor
First 2 photos were taken 23 December 2008 showing
that smelled the same as the tetanus vaccine injected into it all around my fingernail. Over the next 2 months, I documented the changes with photographs.
Consider while you view the photos that 90% of toxins are supposed to be discharged through skin. Realizing that, you should never be afraid of such distortions of skin. Notice in the last 2 photos that the last two months of fingernail growth during and after my finger detoxification thinned tremendously near the cuticle. After six more months, the nail grew to normal fingernail thickness. I declined to photo that phase because we all know what a normal fingernail looks like.

The     Newsletter
21th Edition; April 25, 2010
I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

This issue will be one in which you may have to dig deeply into your well of compassion and understanding for me rather than ill judgment, condemnation and rejection. In some of this newsletter, I took off the gloves and spoke directly about the ways we are “handled” like senseless cattle by the world rulers and governments regarding our health and food supply.
Eating Out, Is It Safe?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
  Most of us crave sharing, camaraderie. Whether from tradition or habit, we desire to dine with others rather than alone. We are conditioned for it. Add to that, the fact that food preparation takes lots of time in our work-busy world, we desire time to rest and eat in restaurants, whether plush or fast food usually depends on budget.
When dining away from home, shouldn’t we consider what food is being served? Is the food nutritious? The word nutritious comes from the word nourishes. So, does the food on the menu nourish our bodies to better health? To know the answer to that question, each food must be analyzed. Oops, did I just remove fun from dining in restaurants?
One hundred years ago, the answer for most foods would have been, they are nourishing. Today we have to consider how food is processed. Now, nearly all processed food is meant to have “infinite” shelf- life for corporate profits. In order to create infinite shelf-life, all ingredients must be sterilized. That is, any thing that occurs in food to make them naturally decompose (nature’s digestion) for bio-recycling must be chemically altered, destroyed or removed. Processes that accomplish those are high heat, centrifugal or chemical fractionation, radiation, isolation, and industrial chemical treatments.
Take for example milk. The major producers of milk completely remove any animal fat from milk

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 20th Edition - page 2 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 because it decomposes and alters flavor as it ages. They boil it for about 20 minutes. They add equal amounts of chlorinated and fluoridated water, and then sterilize the liquid that was made from milk that looks blue and smells like brewery mash. To make it look like milk again, they add chalk or dolomite (powdered rock high concentrations of calcium) that can be up to 1/4 the weight of the “milk”. To make if flavorful, they add artificial flavorings and hydrogenated vegetable oils.
Most foods today are made with vegetable oils, margarine being the highest. Nearly ALL vegetable oils used in food production are hydrogenated to make them solid. This turns the oil into highly unhealthy trans-fatty acids. It has been documented and known among health-minded individuals for at least 25 years that hydrogenated oils are trans-fatty acids that have the same molecular structure as plastic.
University of Auckland, New Zealand researchers documented that children who ate margarine daily had significantly lower IQ scores by age 3.5 than those who did not eat margarine.1 Those man-made trans-fatty acids have been shown to raise LDL cholesterol and lower HDL cholesterol. They have also been linked as a major cause of heart disease.2 Underweight children at birth who consumed margarine had IQ scores that were even lower by age 7.
A 20-year study revealed that men who consumed margarine had 77% more heart attacks than men who did not eat margarine. However, when butter was consumed, heart attacks decreased substantially.3 Since real butter is very expensive, you will not find real butter in any average restaurant. In fact, you may not find it in many exclusive restaurants.
Primarily, consider that in human bodies, vegetable oils harden and crystallize because of our low body temperatures. Herbivores have normal body temperatures between 101 and 105 degrees F in which vegetable oils remain liquid. In our normal range 98.6 F. and lower, vegetable oils do not remain liquid, solidifying over time and eventually crystallizing. That causes many ill problems, from congested lymphatic system and arteries, hardened liver and pancreas to psoriasis, eczema and multiple sclerosis.
Add the hydrogenous/plastic factor and most
people have a fat that will completely congest the lymphatic system and decrease health substantially, causing lots of lymphoma and other cancers. Those fats are relatively non-removable. The greatest crime, and it is criminal, is that margarine and vegetables oils have been sold as healthy, better-for-health over butter and other animal fats. That is completely fraudulent. We have been told that animal fats cause heart disease and obesity. However, hydrogenated vegetable oils are the main factor in heart disease and add greatly to obesity.
The main cause of obesity is processed carbohydrates, such as corn syrup that is in 70% of all manufactured foods as a sweetener. Ninety percent of the corn used in food-processing is genetically modified (GMO). GMO foods have proved to cause many allergies, cellular mutations and some diseases. Soft drinks are loaded with corn syrup.
Kerosene-derivatives are often used to fractionate parts of food to isolate them, giving them longer shelf-lives. Chlorine, fluoride, hydrogen peroxide and other chemicals are used to soak and wash food including animal products. Would any of us knowingly eat foods that have been soaked or washed in kerosene, wood alcohol, chlorine or fluoride?
Even most of the better restaurants use canned sauces rather than prepare them. ALL fast-food restaurants use canned sauces such as tomato and paste, mustards, horseradish and other sauce condiments.
When I lived outdoors traveling on a bicycle for nearly 3 years, I observed how tomatoes are prepared for soups and sauces. They let the tomatoes sit in open trucks to ferment, mold and rot for weeks, then haul them to factories where they process them as much as they process and alter large-factory milk. The coloration, fragrance and flavor are all produced with industrial chemicals that are not food, chemically bearing little resemblance to a real tomato soup or sauce.
For a dose of hard reality, I suggest that everyone view the documentary “Food, Inc.” Although it may be faulty in its assertion that factory-farming created E.coli 157H7 that killed a little boy, and although it lingers on bacterial contamination as a main objection to processed food, it shows how animals are factory-raised, slaughtered and processed. What

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 20th Edition - page 3 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 killed the little boy was medical stupidity. They treated his bloody diarrhea with antibiotics (Cipro?) which damage his kidneys and reacting to the kidney problem, dehydrated the little boy to death. However, the movie reveals how the fast-food industry created the worst animal-growing factories in the world, naming McDonalds as the initiator starting in 1930’s. I wish that it would have focused on the diseases that are caused by the 30,000+ industrial chemicals that are used to grow and process factory foods.
Now, let’s return to the question, what is good to eat at a restaurant? My answer is: Nothing is absolutely clean and healthy in restaurants. Absolutely everything from fast-food chains deteriorates health.
I choose the least of evils at good restaurants. I order meats that are deep into an animal so that they are less likely to have come into contact with cleaning compounds at slaughter houses. I choose only fish that grow in oceans and cannot be farmed. I choose FRESH sliced tomato, avocado, peeled cucumber, onion and garlic. If I want butter and/or cheese with my meal, I take them with me in decorative glass jars so they look nice and appropriate on the table.
Having a vegetable or fruit salad may be risky because most restaurants buy them pre-prepared, sprayed with monosodium glutamate (MSG) to preserve a fresh-look. MSG causes many health problems and is toxic. It would be best to order a whole fruit if the restaurant has whole fruit. If the restaurant cuts fresh fruit and makes its salads, salads could be okay but ask if they use any preservative to keep their salads looking fresh.
Many Subscribers asked this question:
Almost all of the sushi restaurants in Los Angeles use MSG on their vegetables, fruits and fish. I stopped eating at sushi restaurants in Los Angeles 9 years ago because every time I ate at one, I got an MSG headache and experienced poor mental and physical energy for next 24-48 hours. If I want to eat at a sushi bar, I choose smaller, cheaper Asian-owned sushi bars where they are less likely to use chemicals. I always ask before I sit. Twice I was lied to and got MSG headaches. I returned to the restaurants several times and picketed outside the restaurants stating that they used MSG, lied about it, and I suffered. For those 2 days of picketing, probably I hurt the restaurant's business considerably for several months, causing many customers to turn and leave. When the police came, I explained the situation and they did not immediately evict me. We must act to oppose such behavior, or corruption will be our fate.
So, if you plan to eat at restaurants, now you know what to order to be at lowest risk of damaging your health. If you want the best for your body and your life-experience, you might arrange with other health- conscious eaters for dinner together at one of your homes.Bonappetite.

Cholesterol, Should I Be Concerned about LDL and HDL levels? A Reiteration
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Many of you may not know that foods do not contain cholesterols, including eggs, unless we drink blood of an animal. Cholesterols are made from food, especially fats, by our bodies. When we eat raw fats, we do not construct any “bad” cholesterol. If we eat fats such as margarine, we create bad cholesterol, lipid peroxides and other toxic byproducts. When
eating PD, no fats are eaten from which our bodies can make bad cholesterols.
Any bad cholesterol that is made on toxic diets and stored intercellularly or intracellularly may be detoxified at any time. On my PD, it is common for people’s cholesterols to elevate from 130-400. Since we on PD do not synthesize bad cholesterol, the bad

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 18th Edition - page 4 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 cholesterol that appears in our blood is old toxic cholesterol from past toxic food. Our bodies utilize good cholesterol to harness and cleanse bad cholesterol as well as all of the immediate needs for bodily functions. We should be delighted if both good and bad cholesterols are elevated because our
bodies are removing the bad gradually, daily. We should want and expect our cholesterols levels to soar. We will gain better health quicker. In our toxic world, we cannot get healthy quickly without high cholesterol levels. ___________________________________________
FRESH-WATER LAKES AND STREAMS POLLUTED WITH MERCURY, 100%
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
One hundred percent of the 291 freshwater fish tested by the U.S. Geological Survey contained mercury contamination. Sixty-six percent of those fish had levels higher than "level of concern" set by the Environmental Protection Agency. Mercury pollution occurs most from air-born emissions, primarily burning coal. We need to stop burning coal on this planet. As I stated in my books, the level of multiple chemical contamination in freshwater rivers and lakes is 35%, and in oceans 8%.
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for regulating industrial mercury from factories and plants but it does not enforce those regulations. Instead, money goes to FDA to stop raw-milk farmers from producing raw milk. Do not think for one minute that authorities in our government have any interest in our health. Government authorities are concerned 95% with economy. Is the 5% concern for us just for show and smokescreen, giving only an impression of concern?

Loss Of My BIOHAZARDS Research But Another Book That Vilifies Pollution
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Although, as I stated hundreds of times in the last 13 years, vaccines cause every person receiving them the greatest harm to health that is thrust upon the “civilized” world, there are myriads of toxins thrust upon us daily made of at least 60,000 chemicals that did not exist 100 years ago. My long over-due book on detoxification was going to include much information on biotoxins.
I spent 22 years collecting data on all types of biocontaminants. Two years ago, all of my files in my Biohazards folder on my computer were infected with a virus or worm that could not be removed. I lost about two thousand pages of research, references and documentation. It was the only folder contaminated of my 256 folders. I have used every ultimate virus program, trying to clean this folder but none has worked.
How was it that the only folder affected by that uncleanable virus/worm was my BIOHAZARDS folder? How could only one folder out of 256 be
targeted and why? How did someone get through my firewalls of computer protection? Three high-tech computer virus technicians told me that the virus/worm infecting my Biohazard folder was personal and specific, programmed to destroy that single folder. I was told that it had to have been a very high-tech operation such as those used by FBI and CIA to monitor and destroy “enemy” data.
So, the question that begs in my mind to be answered is WHO created the virus/worm and trespassed into my computer and installed it? Who conspired to devastate 22 years of my work on biotoxins. Since every industry pollutes, every industry is suspect but who conspired to take the time to illegally break and enter/invade my computer and take the time to forage through 256 folders to infect just one? Who oversees the integrity and protects all industry?
GOVERNMENTS oversee and regulate all money-making operations and schemes from which

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 18th Edition - page 2 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 their revenues are taxes and payoffs. However, that is no smoking gun and there is no trace of a smoking gun. By following the money, I know the most likely culprits. I simply have to conclude that the industries that most likely fear my work are pharmaceutical, medical, and food. So, my work directly affects the income of 7 of the world’s wealthiest families, including the Windsor family who owns at least 70% of all industrial food-manufacturing in the world through web-works of trusts, diversionary companies and other owner-concealing contractual structures.
To some extent, those ruthless money-mongers have been vilified, not to the extent that I would have denigrated industrial polluters that cause so much disease but at least a crater-sized dent in their esteem. The Hundred Year Lie by Randall Fitzgerald reveals
how the totality of our environment, including water, processed food, and pharmaceuticals are permeated with innumerable toxic synthetic chemicals. The scientific basis for these conclusions is well documented and impeccable and presented in readable and gripping style.
Although it does not include much of the information that would have appeared in my book, it documents the point very clearly that industry protected by government cares specifically about profits and “pays” little attention to health concerns. As I asked above, when they do pay attention to health concerns, is it usually just a smokescreen and fraud? __________________________________________
Whole Foods Markets, Inc.; Friend To Better Health Or Foe?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Whole Foods Markets (WFM) has been around for over a decade. The company bought every successful chain healthfood store in America, including California’s Mrs. Gooch’s. Most of the healthfood stores they purchased carried at least 50% organic produce and meats. However, as soon as WFM took over the stores and became the only major healthfood stores around, the supply of organics fell dramatically.
WFM created a slogan “Go Organic”. They advertised everywhere with that slogan. However, when shopping at their stores, no more than 5% of produce was organic. In winter, the best was 2% organic. WFM continues the slogan with no more effort to obtain organic than a sleezy car salesman intends to fix a bad car and cons you into buying it.
After WFM was well established, one of my patients and I researched WFM and its “All Natural” meats. Its head offices are in Texas and owned by several other companies/trusts with ties to the powerful Bass and Bush (U.S. presidents) families. Like all chain-food companies, they ruled all of the many ranches and ranchers’ methods of caring for and feeding animals that supplied WFM meats. After many calls, WFM home-office management
reluctantly allowed us to speak with the man who regulated meat-growers for WFM. We discovered that the all-natural diet included 15% bakery waste. You know, stale donuts and cakes that were boiled in hydrogenated (plastic) vegetable oils.
I called the head office again and asked them to remove the All Natural ads. I was refused based on the fact that donuts are made with grain that cows naturally eat. I countered that cows do not find and eat donuts and cake boiled in plastic oil in fields. The response was, they naturally do in our fields. So literally, he stated that the “All Natural” was not the universal meaning but natural to cows at WFM- controlled ranches.
I called the FDA who told me that anyone can call their meats natural as long as no more than 15% unnatural feeds were fed to cows. That was my revelation that WFM company statement of noble intent was nothing other than a scam by profiteers for the sole purpose of taking money from trusting health-conscious individuals who were unlikely to ever question WFM integrity.
Ten years passed and WFM had not added any more fresh organics than the 2-5%. However, 2 years ago one of its officials began to fight for raw milk

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 18th Edition - page 3 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 with us in California, appearing at Senate and Assembly hearings. I was impressed and amazed until the last month’s slap in the face when WFM announced they were not going to carry raw milk products any more. Its excuse was they could not get insurance for raw milk. That is a lie. About the same time, WFM made two diehard vegetarians the chief operations managers for all stores who think that milk is the worst food man consumes.
Soon the stores will be overrun with all sorts of non-animal products, especially “organic” soy products. The irony is sad. Humans cannot eat raw soy. It must be chemically treated and heated. So even though soy may be grown organically, after it is processed for human (or poultry) consumption, it is full of contaminants that are not organic. Not one soy
Until my next issue, I wish you happiness along with radiant health.
To help change food policy and allow raw food, including raw dairy, to be commercially available nationally send donations to:
product is organic when made for human consumption. So, just like WFM’s slogan “Go Organic”, the entire food store will is predominantly a health scam. Considering that the Bush family financially supported Hitler’s genocide campaigns, would it be unrealistic to consider that that family with more wealth than it could spend would create a company set on false-health conditioning and annihilating health seeking individuals?
Did the attack on my person create a paranoid schizophrenic,youmayask?Ordidtheattackonmy life make me more determined to speak about the ills of the controlling members of this planet, exposing their misdeeds?

The     Newsletter
22nd Edition; June 14, 2010
I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!
At the time that I wrote these articles, any link referenced was functional. I do not control those links or websites that contain that info. If a link no longer works when you click it, search on the internet for other locations for the same info.

In this edition, I will discuss one issue that is thrown at me constantly, mainly by the “highly” educated people. I did not discuss anything else because I do not want any other distraction from that issue. I want readers to think about and concentrate on the microbe issue thoroughly. If you understand it, you will be free of many fear-mongers.
Microbe Food-Poisoning; Fact or Fiction?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
  No matter how many times I revisit the microbe food-poisoning issue, people have extreme difficulty grasping the reality of it. Consider ourselves in the Dark Ages where we believe Earth is flat. Although we see that the moon, sun and planets are round, we cannot fathom that celestial objects are balls rather than circular disks. Why? Because clergy, teachers and representatives of the elite control education, that is, what is taught, acceptable and learned. We are ridiculed if we think too differently.
Now, let’s return to the present. We are in the same circumstance today. All academic thought has been tunneled into junk science to protect industrial and economic values that have nothing to do with human
welfare and well-being. The present BP oil gusher and the way it has been handled is the best evidence of that. Countless millions of people will suffer and die because of it.
The imposed microbe food-poisoning perspective of our time is a prejudicial perspective. It is completely tunneled into a framework created and controlled by pharma/medicine. How do they control that perspective? The few major pharmaceuticals use the medical industry as their puppet. Big Pharma (as it is called) controls and finances tests, controls how they are interpreted to be drug-favorable and then published in “Peer-review” magazines.1 They finance major university research and funding. They promise

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 22nd Edition - page 2 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
scientists and researchers enormous shares in profits for drugs and/or prestige.
The medical prejudicial perspective of microbes is invested in finding inner and outer culprits that can be treated with medical drugs. If they can scare us into fear, or at their best scare us into terror, we will unwittingly attack the nature of our bodies. However, the basic factors that could identify any microbial direct scientific link to any food are not within our present scientific resources. Probably, that limitation is purposeful.
People who consume such a product could get sick from their wastes but not directly from bacterial presence in the food. The contaminated processed food causes the bacteria to get sick and consequently consumers to get sick. In such cases, food would have a direct impact causing vomit and diarrhea.
In nearly a hundred experiments before I began eating only raw foods, I consumed bacteria-laden cooked and processed food. I experienced vomit in over half of the experiments and sometimes diarrhea. After becoming a raw-food eater, I experimented thousands of times with microbe-laden raw foods including raw milk, meats and eggs. I experienced vomit several times when the meat or eggs were from non-organic sources. Most immediate food-poisoning in raw foods is not from bacteria but additives/ chemical poisons that rarely if ever get blamed. Foods are rarely if ever analyzed for additives/chemical contamination including fertilizers, pesticides, herbi- cides, hormones and genetically modified food- allergens.
The food industry controls the food market. How?! By supporting the theory that inner and outer microbe-culprits are to blame for disease. They do not want their additives scrutinized. They rejoice in the ignorance that predominates our health departments. They support the mythic bacteria-theory that imprisons our entire civilized world; this theory is mainly media and education-driven. If they can get “educated” people to believe that spinach, which we have been educated to believe is our greatest iron- rich muscle-building food epitomized by the character Popeye, can cause disease when fertilized naturally with the Earth-old fertilizer manure, you can get those “educated” people to believe that we should outlaw raw and naturally occurring foods.
What is left that is safe? According to Food- Giants, their lobbyists and supporters, only chemically grown processed “foods” are SAFE and the unproved conclusion is that they are healthy. Advertisers, media, education and politicians are the world’s greatest liars.
Appraise the antics of Food Giants (technically a misnomer because their products are all chemical and not food). Take for example Coca Cola. It wanted to expand its beverage business. In about 1996, the chemical beverage company decided to acquire the fastest-growing and most lucrative of beverage companies that had mass moral appeal, California- based Odwalla juices company.
 If people realized that most negatively interpreted microbe detoxifications were unrelated to a specific contaminated food, people would have to acknowledge that their diets are causative. That would destroy the processed food and the medical industries. Big Pharma would fall fast and hard. People would realize that most cases of so called "pathogenic illness" are unrelated to a particular food but are related to an accumulation of toxic food-stuffs in the body from their diets, either in the stomach or intestines or being eliminated through those walls, resulting in vomit and diarrhea.
All of those minds that argue microbe nonsense- science and discovery approaches accusing raw milk or any food of causing immediate foodborne illness should be ignored. Just as any racial prejudice must be learned and ingrained, present prejudicial microbe- science is taught from within our homes through media and nonsense advertising through to our universities. Notice that the CDC, FDA and biologically trained minds argue that microbes may not be found in the food that caused an “epidemic” because they were “killed-off”. You cannot have it both ways. If you have a bacterially contaminated product, bacteria may die but the bodies do not disappear. If there are no bodies, the product under investigation could not have been causative of a microbial illness, period. Such lawyer-type garble from microbiologists simply confuses people. Is that their intent?
The following question has been posed to me numerous times: If lots of people spontaneously get sick from the same batch of food, then it seems that food is contaminated, correct? That is likely to be correct in the following case. Consider that bacteria get diseases like other organisms when their food sources are contaminated/processed. They suffer comparable experiences to vomit and diarrhea as a response to consuming contaminated processed food.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 22nd Edition - page 3 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
A smokescreen was established where huge Procter and Gamble would make beverages for Coca Cola but the profits for Coca Cola would be meager. The smokescreen was to distract other beverage companies and the public from noticing their maneuvers on Odwalla. Behind the scenes, Coca Cola’s secret agents were preparing to defame Odwalla into ill repute.
In 1996, they targeted an area in Washington State where many people drank Odwalla juices. Those agents manipulated health department employees into accusing a batch of Odwalla apple juice for so-called E.coli food-poisoning in 10 of 13 people. What contaminated the other 3? They had not consumed Odwalla juices, so they were ignored. To this day, I have not been able to obtain the documents claimed to prove Odwalla juice as culprit. I was refused names, addresses and investigative documents into the issue. Why the secrecy?
The incident was publicized, of course. Soon Colorado health officials claimed the juice had damaged 4 people. Now, consider that over 40,000 people had consumed apple juice from that particular batch. Why did only a tiny fraction of those people “get” E.coli “food-poisoning” if the apple juice caused the vomit and diarrhea? At least 30,000 people should have experienced vomit and/or diarrhea.
All of the ridiculous notions of “fingerprinting” as a means to isolate and trace bacteria are nonsense. Any microbiologist with more than cursory intelli- gence can see the junk science that is used in bacterial fingerprinting. The fingerprinting label was used to legitimatize the science without proper science. People were led to think that because literal fingerprinting is a fairly good science that bacterial “fingerprinting” must be accurate. That is a false and dangerous assumption.
Odwalla was a company of people who really cared about the health of people. They got into the business because they wanted to do good, providing raw juices with all of the vitamins, enzymes and nutrients unadulterated. Although the science was not definite that it was Odwalla juice that caused those 14 vomits and/or diarrhea, Greg Steltenpohl of Odwalla said the company issued its recall of thousands of juices because its primary concern was for the "safety and health" of its customers. They were duped.
Odwalla was fraudulently defamed and Coca Cola bought the company in 2001 for a pittance of what it
had been worth if Odwalla had not been defamed. Coca Cola representatives acted like they were a caring mother, offering to help Odwalla out of its guilt-ridden conscience, buy its company and make the lawsuits and ill repute disappear. Odwalla’s creators may not have sold to Coca Cola if all of the microbe-related law suits were not pending.
To consider the degree that the good people of Odwalla were duped, you must consider that in 17 tests, I was unable to get E.coli from fecal matter felled from cows, goats or sheep to grow in pure fresh raw apple juice. I was able to get E.coli to slightly populate when fecal matter was taken fresh directly from intestines of a cow and spiked into apple juice but all E.coli died in less than 2 hours. Since the E.coli was inactive, even theoretically, how could it have caused illness? There are only inferences that the apple juice caused illness and not any accurate science.
I hear all of the scientific voices shouting, But it was E.coli 157:H7! As I stated in a previous edition of this newsletter, E.coli 157:H7 does not exist in nature. It appears to be a genetically modified manmade bacteria that must be introduced.
At the time of the apple juice escapade, Don Schlimme with the University of Maryland suggested the apples could have become contaminated through feces from cows grazing near an apple orchard. Why was this Schlimme character, far from Washington or Colorado, interviewed for this situation with no direct knowledge, only opinion and conditioned health- department rhetoric? Because he stated exactly what Coca Cola wanted. He said that pasteurization would have killed the bacteria in the Odwalla products; that when people drink nonpasteurized juice, they run the risk of becoming sick; and they should boil juice before drinking it.
Boiling juice is another process that families do not have time to do, so they must buy boiled juice from a store, profiting beverage producers and sellers. The story does not end there. As I established above, Coca Cola is a company that demands the highest profits through any means it can, even criminal. Coca Cola wanted to eliminate any competition from other juice companies such as Naked Juice Company. They wanted to ensure the greatest profits, meaning little or no spoilage and returns. How is that accomplished with raw juices containing healthful bacteria that cause fairly rapid digestion and fermentation? You cannot, so you pasteurize them to insure at least 2

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 22nd Edition - page 4 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
more weeks of shelf-life in refrigeration. The apple juice incident and Schlimme's opinion were not enough to make pasteurization of juices into law. It had to be legislated.
This is the most immoral of corporate schemes. A little girl who was said to have been harmed by the apple juice developed Hemolytic-Uremic Syndrome (HUS). Her kidneys dissolved and she died. The mother was brainwashed into believing that the “E.coli-ladened” apple juice caused her daughter’s HUS and death. However, antibiotics often cause HUS, especially Cipro, the antibiotic used to treat the
little girl’s bloody diarrhea2, and aspirin and other painkillers that prevent clotting caused the bleeding to continue.
Coca Cola agents told the mother that her daughter could have been spared if the apple juice had been pasteurized. They sponsored her to take it to the US Congress to get a law passed that would criminalize the commercial sales of bottled raw juices. Paid lobbyists assisted her. They financed the literature and got puppet health officials to appear before congress and make absurd claims of impending deaths from raw juices. Just about every sucker in the civilized world will fall for “Raw apple juice killed a little girl and it should be outlawed.”
Where is the objectivity that those “highly” educated people are supposed to embody? If bacteria were the killer that health departments, pharma, medicine, advertisers, education and food producers claim, animals would be dying like flies all over the world. They lick fecal matter from each others and their own anuses daily, even animals who meet for an instant. Primitive tribes and economically poor people all over the world would be dying like flies because they do not wash their hands after touching animals, fecal matter and handling their food and eating. They may bathe once weekly or monthly. It seems that education has made us into stupid creatures with facile intricate brains that can handle lots of complex issues, have faith in science and industries but no common sense.
Let’s return to the microbe-food-poisoning issue. Most cases of diarrhea and vomit are not the result of a particular food at the time of consumption. Most often, vomit and diarrhea result from accumulated substances from processed food that are absorbed through intestinal walls and into the body, or from injections or consumption of medicines. Vomit and diarrhea often result when the body decides to
discard those toxins or the cellular-destruction-waste caused by those toxins. If stomach or intestinal walls are damaged during detoxification, bleeding may result.
Many astute individuals argue that many people experiencing vomit and diarrhea simultaneously is evidence of microbial food-poisoning. I argue that it is not. Most detoxifications are seasonal. Are bears contagious; since they seem to appear simultaneously but appear in USA first and then in Canada and then Alaska? Similarly, bacteria, that cease hibernation in usually climatically-inspired cycles, create such detoxifications as colds, vomit and diarrhea, appear- ing simultaneously amongst many people. However, the pharma/medical profession makes big bucks on the myth that colds, vomit and diarrhea are conta- gious, unhealthy and must be stopped or prevented. Those bacteria are doing their job of cleansing certain types of waste or contamination at cyclical times for most people.
Food does not have to be pasteurized or processed to be safe and health-giving; that is a present-day developing myth. Food does not have to be raised with chemical fertilizers, herbicides and pesticides and be genetically modified to be safe and health- giving; another present-day developing myth. Food is not a chemical derivative of food. Most foods in markets today are not foods at all but merely plastic versions of real food with indefinite shelf-lives. In fact, the only safe health-giving food is raw, unpasteurized, unprocessed, and non-chemically- exposed naturally evolved (non-GM) raw foods.
One more case that disproves microbes cause disease: Remember from my books that I was always a sickly child and after a vagotomy at 20 years old, I was told that I would die from eating anything raw. I was instructed that I had to at least steam bananas and apples if I wanted to eat them or the microbes that are in them would kill me. As I relive those medical terrorist statements, I realize that they are beyond ignorant, they are stupid. I have eaten microbe-laden foods everyday for 41 years, am 63 and 42 years beyond the death-sentence given to me by medical doctors. If we, every one of us, do not make the time to fight the legislatures who are financed by Big Pharma and Big Food, we will lose our access to health-giving foods. It will be criminal to grow or possess health-giving raw foods. We will be condemned to disease, like it or not.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 22nd Edition - page 5 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
It is time for us to take off the gloves and fight for our rights. We must look closely at congress persons who introduce bills that contain legislation that will deprive us of rights to healthy raw food. We must look closely at any congressional member who co- sponsors such a bill. We must make them suffer by disrupting their lives while and after they are in office and we must let them know our stance on health and nutrition. How do we do that legally?
For example, when Governor Schwarzenegger vetoed our hard earned SB201 bill in California that would have reinstated our ability to buy healthier raw milk in stores, we should have faxed, called, mailed, emailed and picketed him everyday all day long until he signed the bill. We should still be harassing him for his violation to our health. We should still be harassing every member of California Senate and Assembly.
But why would we want to harass the California congressional members; they passed almost unani- mously our bill? Because they had the ability to override Schwazeneggar’s veto but would not even consider it. It is one of the time-old routine side-steps of placating the people into thinking that they have a voice in law. You may get a little law, fairness and justice in local government but on State and Federal levels, politicians are bought and paid. Behind closed
Until my next issue, I wish you happiness along with radiant health.

doors, politicians rob citizens of everything with a one-minute-signature veto. In this case, one politician took the flack while most legislators looked good and we the people still do not have the right to better health.
As long as we do nothing, they have nothing to fear and we will lose our most precious asset, our health. Unless you enjoy suffering disease while immersed in high lifestyles, our health is basic and primary. Everything else pales in comparison when you have suffered disease. Take every spare moment you have and picket, call, fax, email and mail all of your representatives daily to let them know what you think. If you can think of any other way to persuade them, do it.

In the last issue, I discussed mainly the myth of microbe food-poisoning. In this edition, I will discuss the myth that microbes cause disease.
Bacteria and Other Microbes Are Responsible for Vibrant Health
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
   The greatest myth and trap of society today besides the banking system is that microbes cause disease. Many astute people chide me for my resoluteness that bacteria NEVER cause human disease. Since very intelligent people all over the world firmly believe the pharmaceutical and medical theory that bacteria and other microbes cause most human diseases, I must be crazy.
This article revisits microbe phobia again because so many of the same people continue to argue that there is plenty of proof that microbes cause disease. I hope that this article will help people open their minds to realize where human diseases originate.
I have not seen ANY clear-cut evidence that proves microbes cause human diseases. Maybe that
myth believed today is as sensible and true as the belief that the world is flat. The idea of a flat-Earth was argued mathematically, scientifically and theosophically up to as recently as 1980. Why and how? Some people just could not get their heads around global-Earth. So they argued and argued until most stopped after Russia’s sputnik photos. Since I am a living example of a person who ought to have died millions of times from eating microbe-infested food, it is time that people acknowledge once and for all that microbes do not cause disease.
Why do people believe that microscopic creatures could usurp entire bodies and bodily systems but dangerous chemicals that kill bacteria are safe for our

bodies?
Our bodies are 90-99% bacteria.1 There are 100 times more bacterial DNA in our bodies than human DNA. Therefore, we are actually 99% bacterial and 1% human. Every microbiologist is taught and programmed during collegiate years to believe that some bacteria are malicious and dangerous. They do not see that the cells that are eaten by some bacteria are already dying or dead. Professors point to those bacteria and say, “they are eating cells; there is your evidence that some bacteria are harmful.” Everyone is taught this incorrect biochemistry that is myth. Students are not given the opportunity to study them with an open mind. If they did, they would eventually find that those so-called bad bacteria are simply janitors, consuming severely damaged, dying or dead cells.
Children are taught by cartoons, TV shows and commercials that microbes cause disease. They do not understand that those media propaganda are as true as the cartoons they watch. Everyone is trained to be prejudiced about microbes as thoroughly as children raised by racists accept that certain races are evil. We are conditioned to accept false concepts.
Corporations that control the media and government constantly brainwash us with rhetoric stating that microbes cause disease. Corporations make chemicals that are dangerous to us and our environment but tell us that their new or improved product will somehow save us from disease because it destroys microscopic creatures. Since our bodies are 90-99% bacteria, that makes as much sense as 900+47=1.
People who live more in nature and on farms do not easily accept such propaganda because they see healthy animals licking and eating fecal matter off each other's butts and thriving. Do farmhands ever see animals washing their hooves and faces before they eat? Do they ever see animals clean their troughs before they eat? Do they see animals vibrantly healthy in the midst of so called microbial contamination?
Probably, the reason most intelligent people believe microbes cause disease is because of the spectacular advancements in electronics and mechanical technologies. Technology is extremely impressive. Intelligent people think, “if we can have such great advancements, surely medicine is equally
1 http://www.ted.com/talks/bonnie_bassler_on_how_bacteria_co mmunicate.html
advanced.” The average individual simply unconsciously transfers those advancements onto medicine. However, medical advancements are as factual as Bugs Bunny because none of the technology is curative.
Exploring Our Bacterially-Vibrant Nature
We begin digestion in our mouths by infiltrating our food with bacterially rich saliva. We have more bacteria in our saliva than dogs and cats, according to many bacteriologists. Depending upon a person’s health or lack of health, 80-90% of digestion should be bacterial from mouth to sigmoid colon. Digestive enzymes, which healthfully should be 10-20% of digestion, disassemble large particles of food so that bacteria can infiltrate and eat food molecules. Bacteria eat our food molecules. Bacterial byproducts
(feces and urine) are our food!
Yet corporations that can afford to spend $100
million yearly on ads tell us we will have brighter smiles, more sex, more friends, more money and happier lives if we use antibacterial toothpastes and mouthwashes that destroy not only digestive bacteria in our salivary glands and mouths but in our brains.
What Is Health Departments’ Role In That Myth? Health departments bombard us with news-bites that microbes attack us. For decades E.coli was blamed for tens of thousands of cases of food- poisoning resulting in severe vomit and/or diarrhea, and some deaths. However, in about 1985, as more microbiologists observed that E.coli is a helpful and harmless natural part of bowel digestion, medicine and government diverted attention from their general E.coli-blaming to a newly created monster E.coli 0157:H7 (genetically modified?). I did not hear one peep from the scientific community and government apologizing for decades of prejudice against E.coli. Instead, they ushered to the stage this new varmint
E.coli 0157:H7.
To this day, I have not found one 0157:H7 in
nature, including at the infamous California fields of spinach “contamination” or at factory-farms. The only 0157:H7 I have been able to observe is a culture given to me by a university professor who got his culture from the FDA/CDC. Is this man-made creature being planted in society, hospitals and food to continue brainwashing us into believing our microbial nature is bad and that industrial chemical poisons are good? Microbial “pathogenic” activity in food does not cause food-poisoning or disease.
 
Industrial agricultural chemicals, food additives and processing cause food-poisoning, period.
Health departments are empowered with the job of protecting people from contamination. However, their hands are tied by Big Pharmacy, Big Food and Big Industry who are the real culprits creating disease. So, who can people that are entrusted with our health blame for diseases? They blame Nature and Creation’s big mistakes, microbes! They want us to believe that although man has lived at least 4 million years amongst microbes and is 90-99% microbes, microbes are giving us diseases and killing us.
Then what causes all of the vomit, diarrhea, including bloody diarrhea, and kidney disease?
Diarrhea and vomit are not diseases but a process of the body discarding toxins rapidly to prevent diseases. Chemical contamination causes most cases of food-poisoning, not microbes. Even old isolated toxins may be mined from our bodies at any time and dumped into stomachs or bowels to remove those toxins through vomit and diarrhea. Toxins of all kinds can mix in the body creating more volatile chemicals. It can occur at anytime and is usually unrelated to food previously eaten. However, sometimes chemicals in food will cause diarrhea and vomit. if someone is tested at the time of diarrhea and vomit and high janitorial bacteria (so-called pathogenic) are found eating the damaged cells, whatever was previously eaten is blamed even if it were raw food instead of the chemicals that caused the problem. That is not science but prejudicial ignorance.
Industrial chemicals accumulated alone or mixed within the body are very volatile substances that can cause any minor or severe disease. How many people do you know who have had severe burns or rashes as a result of chemical exposure and contact? Imagine how volatile those substances are internally.
Antibiotics, such as Cipro, cause severe kidney disease when administered to some children or elderly in a weakened state. The original leaflet inside Cipro warned about kidney damage. Now, that information is not on the insert leaflet. Anyone who believes that E.coli 0157:H7 can multiply in raw apple juice that is less than 15 days old and dissolve a little girls kidney and kill her has not done objective testing and believes the paid propaganda of Coca Cola through health officials. The little girl who died of kidney disease (HUS) was treated with Cipro but
E.coli that was claimed to have been in the RAW apple juice and the juice was blamed.
Conditioning begins in childhood.
Commercials drum into children’s and parents’ minds that microbes will destroy children, relationships, sexuality and lives. People are conditioned to believe that the new or improved anti- bacterial soaps, clothing and blankets will keep children safe from dangerous microbes. The chemicals added to fabric, and the fabrics themselves, are toxic and dangerous. Lint from those synthetic antibacterial fibers (that are usually forms of plastic) will enter children’s mouths, nasal passages and lungs.
The toxic lint will dissolve then contaminate our children with chemicals that cause serious diseases. As those fabrics age, they produce more lint. Consequently, our children are very likely to develop cancers sooner than later in their lifetimes. Are children the only ones to ingest those fibers? What about siblings, and mothers who wash and handle those fabrics, and parents who cuddle their children swaddled in those fabrics? Everyone who wears them breathes lint every momement. Even bystanders may breathe the toxic lint. Synthetic fabrics are already plastic and plenty toxic.

equipment is designed to alter your body and temporarily improve function without improving health. For example, laser eye surgery unnaturally changes the shape of a weak or damaged cornea. It does not improve poor eye-health that caused corneas to misshape. If an individual is on a very poor diet, the warped corneas will warp again within 5 years in 90% of cases.
Will doctors make money again for the same procedure? Probably, the person will pay thousands of dollars to have it done again if it is possible. In many cases, the surgery can only be performed once in a lifetime. There are no effective instructions to patients on how to increase health of eyes prior to or after surgery. When eyes do not get healthier, ophthalmologists will continue to reexamine eyesight, sell glasses and contact lenses and make lots of money.
Medical technology has NOT been developed to heal us but to repeatedly treat us for profits. As most machines are made to breakdown rather than last, (termed “planned obsolescence”), medicines are made to treat symptoms but not correct the cause of symptoms. Medications are developed with a similar concept as planned obsolescence, ensuring that we continue to consume medicines and medical therapies. However, most medication fails most people. In people whom they seem to help, medications eventually stop working. All will create longterm harm.
Why are poisons that destroy our natural bacteria implemented en masse?
Bacteria are responsible for 99% of all of our bodies’ functions. Antibiotics destroy all types of bacteria, reducing digestive functions. They destroy bacteria responsible for ALL bodily functions. One 5-days antibiotic regime can destroy 1% of our bodies’ bacteria, destroying 1% of our bodies. We become weaker and sicker. Who benefits from that?
Let’s look at fluoride4 in toothpastes, mouthwashes and water issues. Does fluoride really prevent or stop tooth decay? In children, it often causes deformed palates and salivary glands, crooked
4 "The Case Against Fluoride: How Hazardous Waste Ended Up in Our Drinking Water and the Bad Science and Powerful Politics That keep it There" by Connett, Beck and Micklem. Publisher at Chelseagreen.com and reviewed by Prof. Vyvyan Howard at http://www.fluorideresearch.org/433/files/FJ2010_v43_n3_p 170-173.pdf
and/or discolored teeth and tooth loss. In a test to prove fluoride was good, the community that got fluoride in their drinking and bathing water had fewer cavities because they had more tooth loss compared to the community which did not have fluoride in its water. Of course, fewer teeth equates to fewer possible cavities. So, government and corporations tell us fluoride prevents cavities. However, proportionate to number of teeth, fluoride subjects had slightly more cavities.
Government and corporations’ uncanny support of fluoride is matched only by fluoride's toxicity. It is an industrial poisonous waste that cost billions of dollars to isolate, store and/or decontaminate. Government‘s military industrial complex is responsible for much of it, so they force us to add it to our municipal water systems to dispose of it and save them money. However, is that the only reason?
Could Governments And Corporations That Control Governments Be Using Chemicals In Thousands Of Products To Control The Masses?
All endocrine disruptors in tens of thousands of products reduce hormones that normally give people gumption to stand up for their rights. Animals subjected to fluoride in their water became so docile that they did not fight back when attacked and beaten to death by peer animals who were not subjected to fluoride. In concentration-camps, Hitler’s regime used fluoride in water to make prisoners docile, feel powerless and disrupt mental focus. In times like these, when governments are controlled by corporations, and are completely undermining our Constitutional Rights - and our tax dollars are given as welfare to banksters and Wall-Street - does government want us docile so that we cannot maneuver a revolution as our Constitutional father’s did around 1776?
How do we remedy ourselves?
Keep natural. Use coconut cream as soap. If you do not want your hair to be so oily from using coconut cream as shampoo, simply let it ferment out of the refrigerator until it turns pink and dilute it with water. Then wet your hair before applying the diluted coconut cream. Wear and use only natural materials, cotton, wool, silk and hemp. The same natural fabrics should be used for bedding, furniture and rugs.
We must avoid industrial and medical contamination. We should eat a balanced raw diet, such as my Primal Diet.
    
Let’s return to the subject of bacteria.
What do we have to do to reverse the brainwashed myth that microbes cause most diseases? First, each of us has to realize that microbes do not cause disease. We must realize that microbial presence in disease does NOT constitute proof that microbes caused disease. Instead, it should be observed that when creatures are fed their natural diets of healthful organic foods, the greater concentrations of bacteria equate to quicker and more thorough digestion, cleansing and healing. The first time I realized that phenomenon, I was studying two cases of polio.
One case was hospitalized, receiving massive medication including antibiotics. Bacteria levels throughout the body were very low. According to medical science, that was a good thing but the patient was weakening and deteriorating more everyday. The other person experiencing polio was cared for at home with a raw diet of mainly raw meats and raw dairy. She improved everyday without antibiotics. Her bacteria levels were high everywhere within her body.
The more evidence of bacteria and poliomyelitis debris, the greater her improvements. Her poliomyelitis ran its course of cleansing her spinal cord in just 6 weeks and another 4 weeks to heal to where she could move well enough. I was astonished and elated that health could be so much more tangible and natural than the fear-mongering medical industry, its community and cohorts had made me believe.
What created the polio epidemic of the 1950’s? Canned foods were thrust onto the masses during WW II. People at home were told to eat canned foods to support soldiers. How would people at home, away from war, benefit soldiers by eating metal- contaminated additive-rich processed food? No one benefited except Big Food and its investors.
My mother and many women who were food- quality-education deficient loved canned foods. They did not have to wash, cut and slice food anymore; simply open a can and plop it into a pan or dish. What followed as a result of the new tin-poisoning were epidemics of tonsillitis and polio. Tonsils are endowed with the job of protecting thyroid and brain from direct assault of substances in the mouth. When tin accompanied by additives enters the tonsils, they damage cells. Tonsils utilize fatty cells, either lymphatic or white blood cells to harness toxins. When damage to tonsil-tissue occurs, discharge of toxins throughout surrounding tissue results, causing
throat and mouth rashes and swelling.
When tin and additives enter the spinal cord, polio
may result if the spinal cord tries to discharge it rather than containing it in fat. Polio is a cleansing process to rid the spinal cord of metallic toxicity. Polio and tonsillitis are cleansing processes that should not be stopped but assisted with proper nutrition.
The Earth is not a flat disk and microbes are not the causes of diseases. Industrial chemicals and pollution are always the cause of disease, whether it is cooking, processing, medication or any of the causes of environmental pollution. Microbes are our helpers whether supplying, building or cleansing. All of us should be elated and relieved that we can do much more for our health than we have been brainwashed to believe. We do not have to be victims of diseases.
After that realization, we can spend worriless days and nights tending to naturally cleansing and healing our bodies, even though sometimes tediously and while having to endure cleansing reactions that are detoxification. We should celebrate our janitorial microbes.
The Contagious Trap
Thinking that diseases are contagious is false and blocks our peace of mind. We blame animals, other people and microbes for our diseases. If we blame others for our illnesses, including microbes within us, we trap our minds into thinking that diseases are not a part of us. We believe that we are helpless victims. Subconsciously we believe that we cannot and must not trust nature, creatures and our fellow man. When we believe that someone “gave” us a disease, we automatically think we must attack that person and our bodies to remove the disease. Everyone is scathed in wars, including victors.
Reality is that diseases come from industrial toxicity only. And when toxicity accumulates, it often destroys parts of or entire systems in our bodies. I have heard so many people claim that an ex- boyfriend or girlfriend gave them herpes virus. In cases of herpes, toxins such as heavy metals store in nerves. Everyone has metal in her/his nerves in our industrial societies. We may not know that we have metals in nerves because we do not have signals (symptoms). Often metallic minerals cluster and cannot pass out of nerve endings easily. However, when our bodies decide to detoxify metals from our nerve-endings and it causes painful sores, we

discover we have herpes.
According to Robert H. Shaw, M.D., Beverly
Hills, California 85% of people in industrial society have herpes, including maidens who have never had sex. Elderly people who do not engage in kissing or sex get it. Viruses are not contagious; they are a natural part of every body.
Why, then, do some people develop herpes after being in contact with someone who has herpes? Is it the person whose body has already begun to detoxify metals from his or her nerve-endings and has herpes sores? That is who the medical and industrial community want you to blame. However, the only contagion that is possible is educational, not microbial. Your body may learn how to detoxify nerve endings by observing another body in the process.
There is the climate-factor that is constantly written off as contagion. Flu is the most widely
Until my next issue, I wish you happiness along with radiant health.
To help change food policy and allow raw food, including raw dairy, to be commercially available nationally send donations to:
believed to be contagious because people in the same family get it one after another or all at once. Here is the best analogy I know. Bears rise from hibernation earlier in USA than they do in Canada and then Alaska. Are bears contagious because they appear first in USA then Canada and then Alaska? All intense cleansing cycles of our bodies are periodic, sometimes seasonal.
Our lifestyles that cause us to ingest toxic industrial metals are responsible for herpes and all diseases. We can change our lifestyles. If we are fortunate enough, we can live in rural areas without industry and its contamination. However, even if we cannot, we can avoid processed food full of 60,000 different industrial chemical additives. We can eliminate or at least drastically reduce toxins in our homes and offices. Then we can create environments that are conducive to better health. ______________________________________

My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies.

  Declaring Our Rights To Our Body, Health, Prosperity And Happiness
by aajonus vonderplanitz, phd nutrition
Congress and authoritative individuals within government agencies have been hard at work tearing the hearts from our freedoms of health, prosperity and happiness, especially in the last 2 years under Obama, that is, after the Bush regime cut off the feet. So that we understand the structure of the United States government, let’s look at its health-department structure.
Firstly, it should be understood that the U.S. Government is a corporation. Congress consists of 535 members that are 100 Senators and 435 House of Representatives. They are the executives of the U.S. Government Corporation, not crusaders for the people of the U.S.A. We all should know by now that voting-rights are a façade, falsely making us believe we have rights over decision-making in government. They give us about 95% candidates who protect and promote corporations rather than people no matter which party.
Congress is the only power to make laws. Congress writes tax codes and sets fiscal policy. The House of Representatives decides appropriations of
tax dollars. In 1913, Congress gave the Federal Reserve Bank (an independent corporation run by criminal private bankers that are mostly foreign) complete control of U.S. monetary policy that always acts to the advantages of those banksters. Congress gave nine Supreme Court justices power to interpret laws who virtually make their own laws. (The interpretation of law really belongs to jurors in any case.) Congress gave the President power of law to write Executive Orders. No one man should be able to dictate laws at his desire or whim. They are all dictatorial actions. Congress could rescind all of those powers at any time, as they should now.
Congress is directly, legally, morally and individually responsible for the domestic problems that plague this country.No matter what any lobbyist promises, it is the legislator's responsibility to determine how s/he votes. Congresspersons spend much of their energy convincing us that what they did was not their fault. They participate in this common dance regardless of party. Also, the president cannot force the Congress to accept his
   
 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 24th Edition - page 2 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
proposed budget. If the president vetoes alterations to his proposed budget, Congress can pass it over his veto. ALL of what we experience results from Congressional 2-stepping (2 steps forward for corporations and one step back for the people) and side-stepping (avoiding responsibility and blame).
Politicians and corporations campaign against problems. If money can be made by a problem, they will create the problem then offer resolutions from which corporate friends are paid tax dollars to resolve. To keep the money flowing into their pockets, resolutions are ongoing or eternal. It is a fact that 95% of those in office are criminally incompetent and irresponsible to the people but competent and responsible to corporations.
It is inconceivable that a nation of 300 million people cannot find 535 brave and rational people who are also competent and responsible to the people. All domestic problems, from unfair tax codes to defense overruns are traceable directly to those 535 people. Every thing we have in this country is exactly what they created, including wars that are the biggest money-makers for corporations and investors.
Although there are no insoluble governmental problems, Congress shifts the blame for problems to bureaucrats, whom they hire and whose jobs they can abolish, and lobbyists, whose gifts and advice they can reject, and regulators they have hired to regulate and from whom they can take that power. Congress tries to con us into believing that mystical forces such as "the economy," "inflation" or "politics" prevent them from doing their job to which they took an oath.
To add insult to injury, this year, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that corporations are PERSONS with all of the Constitutional rights of living individuals. Previously, corporations had limited rights under Uniform Commercial Codes (UCC). Now, corporations, including the US Government have many more laws to protect themselves, avoid prosecutorial and civil claims or bury any legal challenge under decades of legal nonsense.
For most of 2010, congressional members fought to pass U.S. Senate bill 510 (S.510) that was ironically titled FDA Food Safety Modernization Act. Since they were unsuccessful, they tried to sneak it into other bills but constituents were watching carefully. Congress got so much constituent- opposition that they were unable to pass it without inciting a near hostile revolution. The people’s ally against the bill was Senator Tom Coburn who stated
that he would block the passage of S.510 in any form. He called it the fake "food-safety" bill and stated that it will raise food prices, add $1.5 billion to deficit, add unfunded state mandates, and drive up the costs of food production by adding more layers of government interference, and that it would NOT increase food safety one bit. He was correct.
In closed session on a Sunday evening a week prior to Christmas holiday, congressional members stripped House Representative Bill 2751 (HR2751) of its Consumer-Assistance-to-Recycle-and-Save-Act language and inserted the language of S510 and passed it with Senator Coburn’s help. Coburn betrayed us and revealed himself to be a “fake” ally. That, my health-food and freedom lovers is the Congressional dance.
The evil that S510/HR2751 does: It empowers the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) with money and authority unprecedented in history. It now has almost as much power over farming and food as the Nazi’s SS had over German people in 1936. Probably, some of my readers are chiding me for such a statement but let’s look at the FDA.
The FDA is under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS). The HHS is the principal agency that is supposed to protect the health of all Americans and provide essential human services, especially, purportedly, for those who are least able to help themselves. That means people, not corporations, right? Not with the new law that ordains corporations as Persons. Also under HHS are Central Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Department of Agriculture (USDA), and Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services National Institutes of Health.
HHS, which is headed by its Office of the Secretary, represents almost a quarter of all federal outlays, and it administers more grant dollars than all other federal agencies combined. HHS’ Medicare program is the nation’s largest health insurer, handling more than 1 billion claims per year. Medicare and Medicaid together provide health care insurance for one in four Americans. Basically, most of their payouts go to the medical establishment, only about .1% of medical payouts go to alternatives to medicine such as chiropractic.
Also included in the HHS is the Office of Public Health and Science, the Office of the HHS Inspector General and the HHS Office for Civil Rights. Do you get the picture? All of it is enmeshed and inseparable

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 24th Edition - page 3 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
from medicine as the provider and protector of health and has NOTHING to do with alternative pursuits or options toward health. The idealism that the HHS and its branch departments protect people is gross façade. The president appoints the branches’ heads/dictators, almost all of which have business-nepotistic relationship histories, before or after taking office, with drug and/or chemical/agricultural companies, such as Monsanto.
Over the last 10 years, the FDA approved 9 drugs with literally deadly side effects. The Journal of the American Medical Association underestimated that 125,000 Americans die each year from the side effects of FDA-approved drugs.
Let’s look at how the FDA operates over food. FDA caused and causes the illness and death of millions of people in America with its approved food-additives, such as Aspartame. http://www.dorway.com/ Yet the FDA spends tens of millions of dollars yearly fighting raw milk. The FDA, without any science-based authority, completely discredits raw milk’s nutritional value and aggressively attacks raw milk. On its website, the FDA falsely states with no scientific proof that consuming raw milk is equivalent to playing Russian roulette with health. All it states are grossly exaggerated estimates of illness and deaths by prejudicial testimony of medically-biased health officials such as CDC.
FDA and CDC state that the elderly, sickly, infants and pregnant are in grave danger by drinking raw milk. They not only ignore the million raw-milk- drinkers’ positive testimonials, including many in the at-risk categories who reversed their conditions by drinking raw milk, FDA and CDC discredits them as raving lunatics. FDA, HHS and CDC completely ignore all peer-reviewed proof that drinking raw milk is not only safe but health-giving and very often helps our bodies reverse diseases.1 In a lawsuit against the FDA filed this year, the FDA argued that people have no“fundamentalrightundersubstantivedueprocess to produce, obtain, and consume unpasteurized milk...There is no absolute right to consume or feed children any particular food...There is no 'deeply rooted' historical tradition of unfettered access to foods of all kinds....[people have no] ‘fundamental right to their own bodily and physical health, which includes what foods they do and do not choose to

consume for themselves and their families'...” Sounds frighteningly like fascism and the Nazi Reich because it is.
“...control the food and you control the people...” Henry Kissinger, 1970
State health departments follow the example of and pressure from US FDA. Together they have intensified their raids on raw-milk farmers and suppliers for the past 10 years. FDA’s new power will only make it worse unless we fight them tooth and nail every time they attack raw-milk farmers and suppliers. Can we exhaust their funds that they appropriate for such fascistic raids?
That is unlikely because FDA got 1.2 billions dollars from Drug companies in 2004-2009. Their funding is likely to continue because drug- corporations want us sick and taking medication to line their pockets with profits. Food corporations supply FDA with more funds. Most food corporations do not want us nourished with healthy foods. They want us constantly hungry, nutritionally unsatisfied, buying and eating their junk food to line their pockets with profits. Big-dairy corporations do not want small farmers taking even a fraction of dairy profits. All are reasons why FDA attacks raw-milk farmers, distributors and consumers under the false food-safety banner. The 2010-egg-bacteria- contamination hoax was maneuvered to push the new food-safety bill through congress to give the FDA unfettered powers.
So, how do we defend ourselves against the newest fascist-SS FDA? We have to band together with methods that work. We have to be as creative as possible and do not dismiss any idea and how it can be effective.
I will give several examples. I formed Right To Choose Healthy Food Trust (RTCHF) on 8 August 1998 while waging my campaign to make raw milk legal in Los Angeles County and resultantly California. In 2004, I began to design a method where leases were made between RTCHF and farmers - and created clubs in which its members were the beneficiaries of the leases. The leases secured members’ ownership of farm animals. Members could pick up and transport their raw dairy anywhere without government intervention. (In U.S., we have about 75 years of legal precedents regarding lease agreements but relatively none regarding herd-
  
 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 24th Edition - page 4 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
share agreements.)
All members of co-op clubs signed under
RTCHF are protected owners of food rather than buyers of food. That eliminates any relationship of food sales and commerce (selling to the public). Each member pays a minimal yearly membership fee to RTCHF. Some people ask “how are those funds used?” I have used those funds to pay expenses for office, printing, travel, clerical and laboratory tests on food for RTCHF-related activities and only about $2,000 dollars for myself for hundreds of hours work yearly.
Finally in 2005, my leases were tested in Los Angeles when the County health department trespassed onto Venice branch of Rawesome Club and cited it for not having licenses and food permits to sell food. I called and issued letters stating that all foods came from animals that members owned and therefore products were free of commerce and consequently not within government jurisdiction. It proved to be legally sound because government has jurisdiction over commerce only. The County, failed to respond to the letter and dropped the citation; all proof that government had no legal jurisdiction.
In 2006, the FDA and Pennsylvania Department of Agriculture cited the Amos and Jacob Miller farms for producing raw milk without licenses and permits. I wrote the legal briefs for both of them, proving government did not have jurisdiction over the farmers or members’ rights to raise and consume food as they desired. The health departments and deputy city attorney walked out of the courtroom without objections to my Motions to Quash or Dismiss for Lack of Jurisdiction. The matter disappeared and the farmers have been caring for producing members’ animals and foods.
In 2007, I and a team of 5 people used most of the donations collect up to 2007 (about $75k) to lobby every congressperson in Washington, D.C. to get a raw-milk bill written. RTCHF rented a town house and we worked 9-16 hours daily, 6-7 days weekly. Our team of volunteers was given minimal financial assistance from RTCHF. I did not take anything but food expenses for myself. RTCHF's team faxed in the morning and evenings, made appointments with congresspersons and kept appointments from 9 AM to 5 PM in congressional offices. For 2 days, together we rewrote and rewrote my and Dr. Douglass' "Report In Favor Of Natural (Raw) Milk." We had them professionally printed
and bound in spiral notebook form (about $25k) and delivered them to every congressperson.
We sat for 20-60 minutes at official offices educating Congresspersons or their executive staff. Although the Raw-milk Bill sponsored for us by Representative Ron Paul did not make it to the floor for vote, we educated a lot of people and made it clear that we would fight for our right to healthy food.
“When the government fears the people, you have liberty. When the people fear the government, you have Tyranny." And “The price of freedom is eternal vigilance.” Thomas Jefferson
Please support RTCHF (address at end of this newsletter) with regular donations and relay this message to people and farmers to form such contracts that work to protect farmers from bankruptcy or closure by governments’ anti-raw-milk zest, and protect club member's right to own, transport and consume raw dairy and other healthful organic foods, and to educate the public about the benefits that most people attain from consuming raw dairy products.
An organization that claims to be pro small family farmer and defends them I suspect may be a front to help deprive us of our farmer to consumer rights. It calls itself Farmer-To-Consumer Legal Defense Fund (FTCLDF) and takes membership fees from farmers. I do not know if we can trust that this is a legitimate protect-small-farm organization or not. Several farmers in the last 2 years were encouraged by FTCLDF attorney(s) to accept FDA-pressured guilty pleas and FDA restrictions. Those restrictions caused some of those farmers to lose their family farms and livelihood. I intervened in 2010 with my lease program and stopped 4 farmers from signing guilt and jurisdiction under government rule. The lease agreements prevented those farmers from likelihood of bankruptcy at the hands of FTCLDF plea-bargaining with FDA terrorists.
Because FTCLDF may merely be a front established to defraud us and remove our inherent food rights, as Senator Coburn did, we must watch it carefully. This year, RTCLDF led a lawsuit challenging FDA’s regulations to prevent interstate transportation of raw dairy across state boundaries. See this important link: http://www.ftcldf.org/litigation-FDA.htm. RTCLDF

is not the only plaintiff. There are several citizen- plaintiffs in the action. Even though I absolutely support this class action lawsuit, I do not trust the attorney in charge (Cox) because he relinquished many farmers into the jurisdictional hands of FDA.
Probably the best way to support this action would be to write letters to the FDA, HHS, the judge and FTCLDF weekly, reminding them that we do have inherent rights to our health, bodies and the food we
want, and that the FDA’s anti-raw-milk regulations, and on any food, are anti-Constitutional and morally wrong.
For each of our personal exits from HHS/FDA/CDC tyranny, we must declare our rights to food, health, liberty and pursuit of happiness. I suggest that each and every human being send each Congressional member, HHS, FDA and CDC the following Declaration:
Sovereign’s Resolution for Food Sovereignty
WHEREAS All people are endowed by their Creator with certain inherent and inalienable rights, and among those are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and
WHEREAS Food is human sustenance and is the fundamental prerequisite to life and health; and
WHEREAS The basis of human sustenance and vital health depends on the ability of all people to save seed, grow, process, consume and exchange food and farm products; and

Another step that we should unyieldingly pursue is to Petition for an Amendment to the Constitution, dictating that Congress must consider our well-being on all matters equally. For too long, we have been complacent about the work of Congressional members. Congressional members specifically exempted themselves from many laws they passed for non-congressional citizens. For examples, Congressional members legislated that each of them may retire with the same pay from merely one term in office which taxpayers fund; that they do not pay
into Social Security funds and none is deducted from their pay as it is with other citizens; and they exempted themselves from prosecution for sexual harassment, while all other citizens must live under those laws. The latest self-exemption was from the abominable Healthcare Reform Act laws that they passed. They made themselves an elitist group that is above the law whether they are Democrat, Republican, Independent or whatever. Self-serving congressional actions must stop.

Congress shall make no law that applies to the citizens of the United States that does not apply equally to Senators and Representatives; and, Congress shall make no law that applies to Senators and Representatives that does not apply equally to all citizens of the United States.

Protecting Ourselves From Common Medical Treatments During Emergencies
by aajonus Vonderplanitz, ph.d nutrition
“In case of emergency, how do I stop medical personnel from treating me with medications and procedures that I do not want? I ask that because I do not want tetanus shots or antibiotics or anything harmful to my health in case of emergencies.” Kathy, Los Angeles.
Aajonus: As stated above and in other newsletters, many diseases and deaths result from medicines and medical procedures. Many deaths and comas result from anesthesia. Since our bodies are 99% bacteria and all functions rely upon bacteria, receiving antibiotics will interfere with our healing processes and other bodily functions.
Consider that preventing medical assaults will be met with tremendous resistance. We will likely be defrauded and outright lied to, in attempts to coerce and intimidate us into accepting very risky procedures and drugs. The medical arrogance that comes from a society that accepts almost all of the nonsense that medical therapies are absolute and good for us is not only disrespectful but criminal. Any one confronting and rejecting medical “therapies” are usually treated as if they are lunatics. To protect ourselves we must be as aggressively verbal and intense as the situation requires.
After my health-conscious awakening, I learned the hard way with one of my first non-cancer experiences with an emergency-room hospital situation. In 1975, when I was bicycling North America, a tiny splinter of metal was thrust into the
iris of my right eye from a vehicle passing over metal shavings near the roadside. The pain grew as every blink of my eyelids moved the splinter around, lacerating my eye more.
I attempted many methods to remove it. I flushed the eye with water first. Because the water is a solvent, it removed the protective coating on my eye and made it worse. Also the water was fluorinated and caused my eye-lacerations to burn. Every blink of my eye caused increased pain and suffering. I tried the process where I held my eyelids open and looked outward towards my right temple, then released my eyelids, and with a closed eye, I looked as far as possible at the corner of my eye right eye. I repeated that many times to move the object to the inner corner of my eye. That method usually works best, quickest and with the least amount of pain but it felt to me as if the object were embedded. I sought and found an aloe vera plant, kneaded it until the inside was soft gel, lacerated it, took the gel from inside and gently dropped it into my eye with my head tilted backwards.
Within minutes the pain eased but did not stop. Keeping my eyes closed was impossible. I felt as if my eyelids pressed the splinter into my eye, cutting deeper into my eye. I decided to seek help at the hospital. My girlfriend drove me and accompanied me to ER. The pain very gradually decreased by the time the attending physician got to me but I still felt pressure from my eyelid. I did not know if the splinter was still in my eye or if I had flushed it with

 Primal Diet Newsletter; 24th Edition - page 5 Copyright Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 the aloe gel. I told the physician my problem and he immediately got a prepared eye-tray kit with all sorts of sterilized tools and ointments from a cabinet. He first looked at the injury with his naked eye and then with a scope.
I instructed the physician to ONLY examine my eye to see if the metallic splinter was still in there. I told him that no matter what he found, I did not want any type of salve or medication. I merely wanted him to remove the splinter if it existed. Upon examination, he told me that there was nothing in the laceration and that my eye must have flushed it away. As he talked, I noticed he maneuvered something with is left hand but I could not see what it was. Suddenly and clandestinely, his left hand rose to my eye and squirted salve from a tube into my eye.
I was instantly angry, betrayed and abused. He knew that I did not want ANY chemical in my eye; I had made myself clear about that. I scolded him. He smirked as if I did not know what was good for me but he did. He did not have any respect for my opinion for my body. He was God, knew what was good for everybody, and did as he pleased. I got angrier and deflated his stomach. As I left the room, I told him that since he was God, he would pay the $60+ for the eye tray and that I certainly wouldn't.
I faced another emergency in 2007 after being mugged. The bone connected to my lower front teeth had been broken and knocked under my tongue with the teeth still in the bone. When I went to the hospital to have the bone and teeth maneuvered into place, I told them that my body is allergic to all sorts of medications and that everyone is at risk from side effect of any medication. I told them that although I desperately needed their help, they were to absolutely not to do anything without my step-by-step approval, and that if they violated my choices, they would be faced with serious consequents. Although the doctors and assisting nurses disapproved and disliked my stance, they did only what I allowed.
For everyone interested in protecting themselves from the normal medical assaults, I suggest that you carry a card on you at all times, in a pouch around your neck, in a wallet, pocket or in a purse. I suggest that you laminate it to insure that it does not fade or mutilated.
On that card, I suggest that you type the following on the front-side:
In Case of Injury or Unconsciousness, The Following Medical Procedures Apply
Absolutely NO medications of any kind except those mentioned permissible herein can be utilized on or in my body.
Absolutely NO antibiotics, vaccines or antiseptics are to be used, applied, administered or injected into me at any time for any reason.
If unconscious without severe injury, NO medical procedures are to be performed on me. I am to be left alone until I recover consciousness. Once conscious, I will decide if any help is necessary.
Alcohol (non-wood) may be used sparingly, applied to wounds only and not used internally. Pain relievers and narcotics may be utilized only upon my conscious request. Absolutely NO

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

  __________ Subscriber’s question:
Jack: Dear Aajonus, I read your 1st book 5 yrs ago and bought your Recipe book a few months ago. I have some questions in my mind that I want to resolve before I book a consult with you.
However right now I am thinking of getting an MRI to see what is going on with a hip that hurts. I'm hoping the MRI is safe. Please give me your opinion.
Aajonus: Hi, Jack, An MRI uses 75,000 milligauss Electromagnetic field radiation (EMF). If a metal object, such as a spoon were to be in the room when they turn on the machine, the spoon would pass through the MRI machine and possibly injure you. MRIs cause internal free-radical metallic minerals in the body to pass through cellular walls like tiny bullets and cause much internal cellular bleeding. EMF-safety by present-day alternative scientists is 3 milligauss. They have observed that any EMF above
3 milligauss alters the molecular structure of animal cells.
An average household AC current inside the body of about one billionth of an amp per square centimeter (RMS) seems to be the conservative threshold for biological effects. Based on epidemiological studies, personal exposure to electromagnetic pollution should be avoided if it produces AC currents inside the body higher than the threshold level, of frequencies at or below 1000 cycles per second. An external household appliance magnetic field of 3 milligauss, or an electric field of 2.5 kilovolts/meter will produce approximately that threshold current inside the body.
Consider the consequences of driving a modern vehicle that exposes drivers to EMF of 35-100 milligauss as long as the car is operating. It creates substantial hyper-activity or fatigue, or hyperactivity
How Bad Are MRIs?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 2 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 followed by fatigue. Some people experience soreness in their legs, especially the leg operating the gas pedal where EMF is highest. Consider the fact that pilots who are exposed to EMF from 100-200 milligauss cannot fly more than a limited amount without considerable brain fog and fatigue.
Subtract 3 from 75,000 and consider the effects/ damage produced by 74,997 milligauss above safety. Imagine the particles of metals in your body darting around like bullets damaging cells. If you are already having a health issue, do you think that your body can withstand 15-25 minutes of bombardment with being scathed? What is your decision?
An alternative method of visual medical analysis can be obtained through ultrasound. It uses sound waves to map tissue density and is not as radical as
radiation waves. The images are not as delineated and doctors may spend 20 minutes analyzing them rather than 2-5 minutes analyzing images from MRI. Therefore, most medical doctors hate and refuse to use them because, to them, their time is more important than your health. Although much less harmful, ultrasound can damage the auditory capabilities of a fetus, impairing hearing. Therefore, if you are pregnant, it would be wise to avoid ultrasound and radiation exposure.

   Medical Researchers Proved 90% Medical Research Is False
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
Internationally recognized as the foremost expert in assessing credibility of medical research, Dr. John Ioannidis announced that up to 90% of published medical information is misleading, exaggerated, or obviously wrong. That means the information doctors use to determine treatment is 90% false. Stunningly, the medical community agrees with his assessment.
Dr. Ioannidis started his medical career at the beginning of the evidence-based medical movement and gravitated away from new research. He began assessing the validity of previous research. Systemic inaccuracy emerged consistently at every level, and revealed that most studies were biased. As an expert statistician, Ioannidis carefully assembled a team who spent ten years exploring the problem before publishing their astonishing conclusions.
They discovered that with normal levels of researcher-bias, generally imperfect research techniques and a common tendency to focus on novel rather than plausible theories, wrong findings are inevitably normal. Also, they found that scientific journals are strongly biased towards publishing the most novel claims and lack effective safeguards for rejecting inaccurate studies.
Their research showed that 80% of common non- randomized studies, 25% of the "gold-standard"
randomized trials, and nearly 10% of "platinum- standard" large randomized trials were incorrectly executed.
To highlight the inability to eliminate bad research, Dr. Ioannidis’ team focused on the 49 most highly regarded and cited research papers published in the 13 years prior to this study’s inception. Forty-one percent were disproved when tested, and 24% hadn't even been retested. Upon further examination, in 3 of the studies which were firmly disproved during retesting, they found scientists recited the original inaccurate study, in one case for at least 12 years after it was discredited.
To be that pervasive amongst people who have such adept minds, we must conclude that it is purposeful. What would be the purpose? Successful scientific careers depend upon research being funded and published. That motivates scientists to pursue and produce results that will be funded. Who funds most research?
Scientific journals like to publish new and exciting research. They utilize a vetted peer review process that is frequently commandeered by scientists in pursuit of career advancement. Worst are drug studies funded by pharmaceutical companies and commonly corrupted by a much stronger financial

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 3 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 conflict of interest than merely academic and social praise, and power. Monetary gain is what we are taught to achieve in schools and business. We are conditioned to believe the bottom-line (economics) is always more important than other people’s welfare. Our politicians and corporate leaders are proof in the pudding.
It is easily understood that many medications originally shown to be safe and effective in large randomized control trials were found to be dangerous such as Vioxx, Zelnorm, and Baycol which were taken off the market after they did extensive harm to people. Science, by definition, is supposed to rely upon continual retesting of previous results by other
scientists to protect against erroneous conclusions. Dr. Ioannidis stated, "[the] odds that anything useful will survive from any of these studies are poor."
From my experience, 99% of medical information is wrong and will maintain or even generate illness rather than health. Doing the opposite of anything the medical profession proclaims, 99% of the time my body generates excellent health.

  Chemical Burns Can Be Devastating But Managed And Healed
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
 Photo taken 7 days after chemical-detoxification burn appeared with no signs of improvement.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 4 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 The following is a long-distance email correspondence from and to a patient suffering from severe burns that coincided with applying a hotwater bottle to her lower back. Photos are included. I have changed her name for obvious reasons. I substituted my mother’s name Doris to honor my mother’s passing from this world on February 23, 2011 in her 92nd year.
Doris: Hi Aajonus, I attached 4 photos of my back taken 2 days ago. The burn has lots of honey on it. Most of the white areas that you see in the photos have now been peeled off by a doctor, as of today.
I burnt my lower back using a hot water bottle. I did not know my back was getting burned. I had 2 shirts on between my skin and the water bottle. The rubber water bottle felt good on my muscles and it took the muscle pain away. But what was left was a 2nd degree burn. Very bizarre, I don't know how to explain it. I've used hot water bottles many times before.
Anyway, the burn happened on Wed. February 16th. It was initially very, very red with a big blister. I did not know the extent of the burn, so I opened your book and read about burns. I used kefir on it for relief then switched to fresh aloe vera from a plant, and then to some homemade moisturizing cream from your recipe book.
After about 3 days, I switched to raw honey. By this time the burn was very sore, sensitive, and red with some black looking dead skin areas and other areas with white colored dead skin. At one point, I tried the red meat like your book said but the burning of the red meat was too intense and I switched back to raw honey.
I have been using raw honey on my back for 1 week now, up until today. The raw honey always initially burns' when going on, but within 30-minutes the burning goes away and my back feels better. The honey seems to provide some relief, but it's been 10 days later and nothing much has really changed. It does seem to be getting a tiny bit better each day.
Today, I finally decided to have a doctor look at it just to see what the doctor would say. I know doctors have their own chemical approach which I do not always agree with. To be honest, I just didn't know how to treat a 2nd degree burn.
Anyway, the doctor said that it should be healed much more than what it is after 10 days. The doctor said it doesn't look good and that she needed to get off all of the dead skin to expose the new skin underneath so healing could start taking place.
So the doctor pulled the white dead skin off with tweezers (OUCH) to expose the new skin underneath. After pulling off the dead white skin she said the burn looked a lot better. She continued to clean the burn and then she bandaged it. She wants toseemein2daystocheckit.
The doctor is concerned about the black looking areas since they are receded into the skin a few millimeters. She could not pull off the black areas right now because of the amount of pain it would cause me. She said she might have to cut-out the black areas to expose the new skin underneath.
The doctor, of course, is concerned about infection, so she cotton swabbed the area to culture them to see if anything grows. When she first looked at the burn, she thought it might be infected. (Actually when she first saw it, she thought it might be shingles and not a burn.) I had to laugh and explain to her that it was a burn.
The doctor wants me to take Cipro, 2 times a day at 500mg each tablet. I argued against taking Cipro. So far, there is no infection that we can see with the naked eye. I do not want an infection. I do not want to take Cipro.
What can I take in place of Cipro that will fight an infection in my body if one happens to take place? Anything orally to pre-empt an infection if one should start? What can I do? Thank you.
Aajonus: Hi, Doris. That does not look like a hotwater bottle burn. It looks as if it is a vaccine burn, I have seen them before however, such responses usually occur within 4 weeks of a vaccine. The black looks like mercury and the white tissue looked full of aluminum. The faint greenish cast to it looks like formaldehyde. It was probably a detoxification of tetanus injection(s) at sometime in your life. That would explain why your body cannot heal it. The mercury is still in the wound.
I suggest that you apply moist Terramin clay to it but you must keep the clay moist. I suggest that you apply the clay as a poultice and cover it with a wet washcloth, cover that with a piece of plastic so that it does not dry, and wrap an Ace bandage to keep the

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 5 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 clay, cloth and plastic on yourself. After it has been on for about 12 hours rinse it off with good water. Reapply unheated honey only. This will take about 8 days and repeat the clay every day.
I suggest that you eat lots of unheated honey/raw no-salt butter/raw milk and raw no-salt cheese. I suggest 1 part honey to 5 parts butter, taking 1 1/2 tsp. every hour followed immediately with 2 ounces of raw milk. Every hour 10 minutes prior to honey/butter/milk, I suggest 1/2 tsp. cheese. Also, I suggest one meat meat daily; no honey/butter/milk for one hour before and 1 hour after meat.
Avoid the doctor like the plague. Notice she did not respond to the black as toxic substance but ignorantly, suspecting bacteria. Bacterial infection is the body cleansing dead cells damaged by an industrial toxin in every case; cooking is industrial toxicity. Infections are not a bad thing and medication will take you further from health.
Doris: Hi Aajonus. It really is a burn. I have had no vaccines in many, many years. I left the hot water bottle on my back overnight as I slept on the couch. I had the flu 2 weeks ago and could not lay in bed as I was too miserable so I slept upright on the couch. My back started hurting me from sleeping on the couch so I used a hot rubber water bottle on my lower back to get rid of my back pain. After sleeping with the rubber water bottle overnight against my low back with 2 t-shirts in-between the skin and the hot water bottle, my skin had gotten burned. It was very, very red and blistered.
Would your treatment for a burn be different than your treatment you suggested I use? If it is a burn, do I still use clay and then honey and still eat what you recommended?
If it is a burn and I am trying to avoid an infection, would I need to take lime juice by mouth?
Aajonus: Hi, Doris, Physics of a heat burn from a hotwater bottle would not be 2nd-4th degrees variations like yours. You have a chemical burn that coincided with your use of the hotwater bottle. The hot water bottle could never have caused that without your knowing it. You would feel the amount of heat that would cause 2nd-4th degrees burns, you would know. However, chemical burns are much more insidious. Because they damage nerves, often people do not know that they have chemical burns until they
are apparent. As I stated in my last email, this kind of burn is consistent with vaccines, especially tetanus. I had such a detoxification several years ago and I have not had a tetanus in 35 years relating to that detoxi- fication. If the doctor had had common sense, she would have had the tissue she removed checked for toxins rather than microbes. Then, you would have
known what caused your problem.
There are toxins in that wound that do not come
from a heat burn. Therefore, you must remove them or not heal. The clay and other suggestions apply. Lime internally is not likely to help.
Doris: Hi Aajonus, I would like to get my chemical burns tested for toxins. How do I do it? What do I ask for at the doctor’s office? Do I wait to put on the clay and have the back area tested for toxins first? Then after the back has been tested for toxins, tomorrow would be the soonest for testing for toxins, then I can start using the clay? Is the clay, 12 hours on and then honey for 12 hours, and then clay again for 12 hours? Off and on with clay and honey for 8 days straight?
Aajonus: Hi, Doris, You would have needed the first layers of peeled skin to be accurate. Did your doctor save them or discard them? Doctors Data Inc or Chemir Labs; about $8,500, Clay for 12 hours, honey for 12 hours, clay for 12 hours, etc.
Doris’ next email questions are in blue and my answers are in black:
What does the honey butter mixture do followed by 2 oz. of milk every hour?
They provide multiple nutrients but basically: fats protect cells, harness and breakdown toxins, and give energy; minerals neutralize toxins and help heal.
How does that help my chemical burn?
See answer above.
Also what will the 2 meat meals do to help my chemical burn?
Provide you with nutrients to heal.
When I make the clay poultice do I make the

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 6 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 Terramin clay wet with Gerolsteiner water and then put the wet clay in cheese cloth?
If you use naturally carbonated Gerolsteiner water, you must shake the water until there is no carbonation in it. Carbonated waters are antibacterial by virtue of being a type of hydrogen peroxide. Therefore, Gerolsteiner would inhibit the probiotic effects of clay. As I state in my books, a large batch of clay should be made so that you will have probioticly active clay for 1-2 months, depending on how much you consume. The clay should be made into a fresh plaster-of-Paris consis-tency and let stand for days. In your situation, you cannot wait. I suggest that you begin using it immediately. Do not refrigerate clay, keep in cupboard.
After 12 hours of clay being on burn, is it okay to rinse with Gerolsteiner water?
Yes.
Next round of email of questions and answers:
When I apply the honey for 12 hours to the burn, do I cover the honey with gauze or something like that? Cover honey or do not cover honey on the burn?
If it were me, I would cover it with a thin slice of meat with a damp cloth over that and a thin piece of plastic over that and an ace bandage to keep it all in place, the same as with the clay poultice.
Also, why not honey butter 1 hour before meat and 1 hour after meat?
I want your meat to easily digest quickly. Butter with meat slows it some. Honey/butter with meat sometimes causes the body to make energy nutrients from the protein rather than cellular-regenerating protein.
Can I eat other foods besides cheese, honey/butter, and meat such as kefir or yogurt or some fruit? When can I eat them?
If healing progresses, I suggest unheated kefir and/or yogurt. Organic berries would be the only fruit I would recommend at this time. However, if healing decreases when you consume fruit, then I suggest you forgo fruit.
Is it okay to leave clay on a little longer than 12
hours? Reason I ask, is if I put clay on at 2 pm then 12 hours later is 2 am and I am sleeping. Will it hurt for clay to be on burn longer than 12 hours?
No, that is simply a minimum; Maximum without honey would be 17 hours.
Next round of email of questions and answers:
Want to make sure I am doing it right. So eat meat by itself 1 time a day...I like it in the lunch time or dinner time, is that okay?
Whenever it suites you.
Cheese, and then honey butter every hour...I’ve been doing it...
Yes.
Wet Clay is on burn right now, with wet cloth over it, with plastic on top and an Ace bandage...just wet clay on burn only 12-17 hours?
Correct.
I am using the eatable Terramin clay from California Earth Minerals or I can use the TerraBath Clay that I have from California Earth Minerals. Is the eatable clay better to use than the bath clay?
It does not matter which you use topically. When using it on skin, I found there is no difference except price.
When I use honey, put thin layer of raw beef on top of honey, then a damp cloth and then plastic and Ace bandage...12 hours?
Yes, for 7-12 hours.
Is Kefir okay to eat 30 minutes after honey butter? Then 30 minutes later do honey butter again...
Best to have kefir soon after honey/butter mixture for the minerals.
Next round of email of questions and answers:
Couple other quick questions. In the past you said or your book said, if I have it right, that raw meat (beef is what I eat) should be eaten with butter for re- building cells and if you eat raw meat alone is goes

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 7 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 toward energy production. Do I have this right or wrong? I know you told me below that I should eat raw meat alone, and I have been eating it alone. You are correct if you are not eating butter all day. Since you are eating butter all day, it is better not to eat it with your meat meal.
Also, I heard that raw bison on a burn will heal better
than raw beef. Is that right? Are thin slices of raw bison on top of the honey for the burn better than raw thin slices of beef?
I have utilized both on myself and others but did not find any difference as long as they were both organic.
Next round of email of questions and answers:
 Photo taken 15 days after burn, treated as indicated for 8 days, showing many indications of chemical detoxification and progress toward healing.
I attached some pictures I took this morning of how the burn looks 16 days later. Let me know what you think. The black spots from the initial burn have turned to a light brown while the outer rim of burn is still pretty red.
Wonderful, it looks the way it should after 6-7 days of applications.
Also, do I rinse the burn with water after the honey has been on the wound for 8 hours? I know I rinse after the clay, but do I rinse after the honey and

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 8 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 meat?
I suggest that you do not wash or rinse after honey butter meat.
Or, do I apply the clay directly to the burn right after the honey and meat has been taken off?
Apply directly over after you remove the meat.
When I put the honey and meat on the burn, it stings and burns like crazy for 1 hour afterwards and then it calms down. It really hurts for that 1 hour after honey and meat has been applied to burn. The sting you feel is some sugars in the honey and bacteria from meat infiltrating the areas. That is a good thing although uncomfortable.
My burn is extremely itchy right now and I want to scratch it, but it is still very tender. I am assuming the itchiness is a good thing?
Itching indicates that fats in the area and in cells are not enough. I suggest that you mix 1 T. raw butter to 1 T. unheated honey and apply that prior to covering with meat. It is okay to gently press and hold the area when it itches.
Do you think I got most of the toxins out from my tetanus shots or is there still more in my body? That, I could not surmise.
Why now, out of the blue, do I get a chemical burn in conjunction with a hot water bottle? I have been using hot rubber water bottles for years and nothing has ever happened before? Just curious. I know friends who let their children sleep with the hot water bottles in their beds all night and the kids have been immunized but none of them are getting chemical burns associated with warmth of hot water bottle. Can you explain why some people and not others. Very curious about this.
When it happens, there is never a rhyme or reason that I am able to deduce. I detoxified an injury and injections from 1963 just 6 weeks ago, out of the blue. I had cut half of the end joint of the finger off in shop class that split two finger-bones. The doctor sewed it on. The finger is as deformed as it was when the accident happened but is very gradually improving in appearance. When my finger- detoxification began, it turned black at the corner of the nail. That was an indication that the mercury from
tetanus-injection into the finger, and possibly the penicillin, was/were detoxifying. I do not know if the hotwater bottle application had anything to do with your detoxification. However, with the location and concentration of mercury, formaldehyde and aluminum stored at your spine, you should be ecstatic it got removed when it did. Owanza's (from WWTL book) spinal tumors were caused by that when she was 33 years of age. Your detoxification without tumors is a much more desirable method than cancer.
Next round of email questions and answers:
Okay, the stinging/hurting from the honey, butter, meat is not going away this morning. It’s been over an hour and it still stings like CRAZY. I want to wash it off. 6 more hours of this is going to be miserable. What do you think?
Also, after washing the clay off this morning, I wanted to leave the wound open with nothing on it or maybe with a light piece of gauze. It wasn’t hurting too bad, but when I put the honey, butter, meat on ZOWIE with stinging.
If you let it dry, you are in for many more problems. I suggest that if it does not itch to make you crazy with the clay, simply apply and leave the clay for 24 hours, rinse and reapply.
Next round of email questions and answers:
You are right. I have noticed when it dries in between me applying the honey or the clay, it can hurt badly, but in a different way, like it is going to crack or something. So, leaving it dry has its own problems.
Leaving clay on for 24 hours then washing it off and re-applying the clay for another 24 hours is okay? How long do I do this for?
Until you see the skin is pink without seepage that causes scabs.

  Photo taken 21 days after burn, treated as indicated for 14 days, showing faster progress toward completing detoxification and healing.
Hi Aajonus, I just took recent photos of my burn. I decided to wash off the clay this evening and not wait until morning. Photos are attached. The lighting seemed to be a little off in the bathroom. The middle photo is probably the most accurate for color but not as clear as it could be.
It did sting when the water hit the burn, but when I re-applied the clay tonight, surprisingly, it did not sting at all like it did this morning. Cannot explain it.It was almost uneventful putting the clay on tonight.
Overall it looks better, even the kids think so. It’s a lot smaller than it was. It’s receded quite a bit. Still very tender and sore.
The brown spot in the middle used to be the big black spot that you said had mercury in it. It looks like it’s
getting ready to peel off because it’s loose and very gooey-looking in person. If you look at the original photos I sent you, the burn has changed a lot. The clay is amazing I think in healing it.
Do I continue to put clay on it based on what you see? What is my next move?
Hi, Doris, Looks very much improved; 80% detoxified and 30% healed. You have no more second-degree tissue exposed, only first-degree. That is the reason for no sting when clay was applied. It stung when rinsed because some of the tissue that was removed exposed sensitive new skin. After it aired for several minutes, the tissue firmed and sealed itself.
I suggest that you apply the clay for 24 hours more
 
 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 10 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 and then proceed to what I stated in my last email, applying honey and then a thin slice of meat for 2-3 days. Afterward, I suggest lightly rubbing honey then a little butter or coconut cream, alternating, until redness disappears. However, if the skin becomes dry and tight, I suggest you continue to apply a tiny bit of honey then alternate butter and coconut cream on alternating days for another 3-5 days.
Next round of email of questions and answers:
Hi Aajonus, Thanks for the good news. (new photo from this morning attached).
I am leaving town in a week and I am hoping I can improve even more in the next week so I can function out of town. The last 22 days has been difficult and painful. It’s hard to be ecstatic during a detox when the pain is very bad. But I do understand that detox is better than a more severe illness.
When I saw the photos from last night, I thought that the raised skin was scar tissue (fused dead layers of skin) however, on this morning’s photo, it looks as though it is some form of scab (non-fused dead layers of skin). As long as you have non-fused dead layers of skin (scabs), your body is still discarding/ detoxifying industrial chemicals and you should continue applying clay.
Questions: I put a fresh layer of clay on this morning and will leave on for 24 hours. Then I will start the thin layer of honey and meat for 2-3 days. Do I cover
with a wet wash cloth again?
Yes, cover it but use damp t-shirt material (because it is easier to keep in place) rather than thick heavy damp washcloth and thin plastic (which only covers the meat and does not touch skin). Hold all in place with an Ace bandage.
If honey and meat burns, what do I do?
If they burn your wound more than 20 minutes, return to clay application.
After honey and meat, I will start the honey and a little butter or coconut cream. Do I mix the honey/butter or honey/coconut cream together before applying or just put the honey on the burn and then rub on butter or coconut cream? Does it matter if mixed together or not?
It has been my experience that layering is better than mixing but you may experiment and see for yourself.
Do I rub with honey/butter, and an hour later rub with honey/coconut cream? Is that what you mean by alternating? Do I cover it?
By alternating, I mean use honey/butter one day and honey/coconut cream the next day, etc. Only your clothing should cover it. However, I suggest that you let the mixture absorb into skin for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes, pat with very lightly damp cloth and don your clothes.

Subscriber’s question: Who Has The Right To Institutionalize Me?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
Eric from Chicago: Aajonus, hi. I was recently hospitalized in a mental institution when my mom tried to force me to throw away my high meat and for eating raw meat in general. I was forced by police to go into a hospital for 6 days. The lawyer said I needed a doctor to say I was ok mentally. They said I was a danger to myself for eating raw meat.
I know you have experience dealing with the law in these types of cases. There they took blood from me twice, made me miss a credit card payment. Made me lose a job. Have you ever experienced anything like this? I saw that you were on Ripley's Believe It or
-
Not eating high meat. So now I have to hide every time I have to eat????
What can I do in regards to a lawsuit? How do I protect myself from further hospitalizations? I was forced to “voluntarily” sign an agreement to be admitted and could not leave. Now my insurance has to pay for my stay. I need to sue and get the people who put me in there out of their job. Can they really do this to us?
I am 20. The police department involved was east Hazel Crest, Illinois. They forced me to sign under duress. They said I had to or they’d hold me until a

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 25th Edition - page 11 © 2010 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 judge saw me which would take all weekend. At the hospital, when I asked if I could leave, several security officers arrived and told me to sit down or they would pump me full of drugs and strap me to the bed.
Aajonus: Hi, Eric, You need a good non-judgmental open-minded attorney. If you were under 18 years of age, all it would take would be one of your parents to induct you into a hospital. Since you are over 18, ANYONE must have a court order to force you to do anything. Every thing else is an idle threat that has serious legal constitutional liabilities. In order for the police to seize and hold you, you must be a physical (sharp object, weapon or firearm, or chemical) threat to others or yourself, or be breaking a law. Disobeying your mother, and eating raw and high meat are not crimes.
Whether in the hospital or with the police, they must have authority to hold you for criminal reasons, period. They can threaten you all day but you should not sign. If you feel that you will suffer physical harm if you do not sign, add the words, “Signed under physical threat and duress” as part of your signature. Also, pronounce, “You are making threats of a physical nature to me. Without a warrant or court order, you are subject to criminal kidnapping, and endangerment to my life and liberty. If you try to seize me without warrant or other court order, you will have kidnapped and endangered my life. I assure you that I am of sound mind and body to pursue such legal actions against you.”
There is no legal case or direct science that says eating raw and/or high meat are dangerous and that they could kill you. If it were so, everyone who eats
Until my next issue, I wish you happiness along with radiant health.
To help change food policy and allow raw food, including raw dairy, to be commercially available nationally send donations to:
sushi, steak tartare, carpaccio and kibbe would be dead or in jail. There have been and are cultural groups that regularly eat spoiled foods with healthful results and no ill-consequences.
I suggest that for your case, for your attorney, you research all of the cultures that eat decomposing food, including those in Europe that decompose their cheese with worms inside the cheese. Some of them eat the maggots as well as the cheese; the cheese is mainly waste from the maggots, that is, predigested matter that is easily assimilated, as bacteria makes yogurt and is easy to digest. Many Turks use gangrene to cure their meats. If you compile such research to take to court, the police department will negotiate and you should receive anywhere from $3- 10k plus attorney expenses, or go to court for their blood and get $200k from the hospital, hospital employees who threatened you, the city, police department and officers who kidnapped you without warrant or court order, or proper probable cause.
The city and courts are very powerful and can threaten your attorney’s ability to function in courts. I have seen many attorneys lose their cases to protect their livelihood. You must get a credible attorney or be ready to try the case yourself if it goes to trial. Citizen's Commission on Human Rights (CCHR) is an organization that routinely fights psychiatric abuse; it might be able to help you. You can find them on line at www.cchr.org. On the home page, you can locate a chapter near you and contact it. In some cases, CCHR got directly involved, in most it at least gives good advice.

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

Hello, health-lovers. Thank you for your kind and compassionate patience, waiting for my newsletters. As you know from having read my newsletter about my abduction and forced injections, I suffered terribly. Since that tragedy 19 months ago, on the anniversary of that assault I suffered the same symptoms for several months yearly.
Thank all of you who have been concerned for my safety. I appreciated your suggestions. Because I am not a millionaire to afford a 24-hours bodyguard, I have made safety my responsibility. I took several gun-training courses, including tactical, and self-defense courses. I am no ninja but I can defend myself fairly well. I have concealed gun-carry permits for 37 states in which I travel. Also, I travel with detection/alarm devices that will likely prevent a future surprise assault while I sleep.
I have been trained to try and stop an attack without killing the attacker unless he is relentless and the only way to stop the attack is by killing. I have been trained for many situations that I continue to practice. I feel much safer and am not as concerned about safety. However, I will not become complacent and careless with those skills. _________________________________________________

Ball and Kerr Jar Lids, Are They Plastic Coated and Toxic or Not??
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
   Christina: Hi Aajonus. Did you know that BPA is on the interior of Ball and Kerr Canning jar lids? I was finally able to talk with a person from the Ball Company about their rubber rimmed lids with the
white-coated interior and their plastic storage caps. The person (Jessica) looked in her data sheets and confirmed that the white interior lid contains BPA. She said it is a small amount. She said it

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 26th Edition - page 2 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 would take a 150 pound person 2,400-4,300 lids with the BPA in them to reach the maximum safe daily limit required by the FDA. She went on to say that the BPA must be in the lids according to FDA rules to prevent corrosion. The lid with the white interior is made from a modified vinyl and is not enamel. She also said the modified vinyl does not have PVC in it but definitely has the BPA.
The Ball plastic storage caps are made from
polypropylene which is a #5 plastic1. There is no BPA or PVC in the plastic storage caps. She further stated that the Ball Company is researching a new lid which would be BPA free. All my best.
Aajonus: Hi, Christina. The manufacturer and distributor of Ball and Kerr lids are supposedly the same company now. I was told by a representative of the company who licensed the manufacturing and sales of those lids that the Ball company does not manufacture or sell lids anymore. The representative claimed that both lids were sealed with plastic coatings.
However, when I scraped the goldish underside of Kerr lids, a clear-undercoat easily curled like plastic.
1 Plastics are made of various toxic compounds and are graded as # 1-7. #5s are polypropylene (PP). Its characteristics include strength, toughness, barriers to moisture and resistance to heat, chemicals, grease and oil. #5 grade plastics are used for microwaveable ware, kitchenware, yogurt contains, margerine tubs, microwaveable disposable take-away containers, disposable cups and plates.
Subscriber’s question:
Therefore, I do not use Kerr lids. When I scraped the white-undercoat of Ball lids, there was no curled material. When I pressed and cut hard into the white- undercoat of Ball lids, the coating chipped but did not curl or fragment. So, if the Ball white-undercoat is plastic, it is a variety that does not dissolve with food.
The only way BPA2 would leach into food is if the undercoat were soft enough to dissolve in food. That may be true of the Kerr brand but not the Ball. The main foods I use that touch the lids are vegetable juices and milk. Neither are caustic and could not dissolve the undercoat and release BPA from the Ball brand. However, I mix my fruits and creams together in jars. Some of the acidic fruits such as pineapple could dissolve the coating but when I tested for that, I could not find any etching of the coating under a microscope unless the pineapple (without cream) directly touched the Ball lid's undercoat for several weeks.
The coating of at least 2,300 lids would have to completely dissolve into food to cause a severe reaction from BPA. I estimate that that would take about 500 years. The trace amount of BPA that might be released over many months from one lid would not be enough to store and harm the bodies of people eating my Primal Diet(tm). However, I have one caution: Once the white-coating has chipped it should not be used; recycle it with cans.

   Chemicals Used to Protect Food From Bacteria; Harmful
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
Patty: Hi Aajonus. The fresh fish in my local supermarket has been looking very shiny lately - like plastic. I called the buyer and during the course of our conversation, he told me filleted fish was run through a Chlorine Bath to kill bacteria. I was a little stunned and questioned him further. He told me as far as he knows ALL fish that is filleted is run through this chlorine bath; he saw the process.
Whole Foods told [a friend] recently they are spraying their fresh fish in the case with ionized water to keep it fresh looking. Neither of us knew what ionized water would do to the fish.
[Another friend] said she was told to wash oysters because they are being irradiated.
What is your safest recommendation of fish? Or do you, or has anyone found a GOOD MAIL ORDER FISH SOURCE ? I am going to try to research that soon.
Aajonus: Hi, Patty. Adulterations to our food increase daily. That is why I stress that people have to invest in and own farms, period. There is no escaping the onslaught of chemicals in food purchased at any market, including Whole Foods

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 26th Edition - page 3 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 because they embrace toxic genetically modified foods and carry very few organic products.
If you rinse meats with water rather than scrape them, you would probably wash the chemicals deeper into meats. Therefore, I suggest scraping meats. As soon as I arrive home from markets in industrial cultures, I scrape all surfaces of meat (red, fish, seafood, pork, etc.) no matter what kind. From a 1 lb. slice of meat, I remove up to 3 T. of meat by scraping it with a sharp flat-bladed non-serrated knife.
Food-irradiating machines are very expensive and hazardous because they handle radioactive waste material. Only major food-manufacturing plants can afford it. Therefore, I assume that only the major
Subscriber’s question:
oyster-producing processors would be able to irradiate oysters, such as canned and processed oysters, not in-shell oysters. Only buy in-shell oysters. However, with Fukushima disaster, I would check oysters monthly for radioactive material with radiation Geiger counters.
Ionized water neutralizes much proton-activity that helps bacteria digest food. Therefore, fish sprayed with ionized water will not predigest when exposed to oxygen. When you consume fish that has been sprayed, the ionized water will interfere with your intestinal bacteria's ability to digest. So, scrape the surface of all fish, as I do as soon as I arrive home. _______________________________________
How Long Does It Take To Understand The Primal DietTM?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
Ray: Hello Aajonus. Do you know it has taken me all of these years [11] to understand the theory of the diet: We age rapidly (and die quicker) throughtoxicity,builtupdayafterday,yearafter year, decade after decade, eating cooked foods that bodies have not been designed (almost all) to digest and assimilate. Those residues lodge somewhere and everywhere in our systems.
There are those that push the diet and use various methods to do deep-cleansing, cleansing that the body may or may not get to [without extra effort], down the road. The body has infinite wisdom in attempting to balance and heal. For me, I have been faithful,nocookedfoodforthe11or12yearsthatI have been on the diet, but have not done the high meats, the [long hot] baths or weight gain/loss flush. So, perhaps I am like a turtle, slowly progressing by not adding so may toxins, at least through food. Alas, still I introduce new toxins environmentally through my work and just breathing air (car exhaust, factory fumes, etc.). So my body does it's best to keep up and now and then go deeper.
I am involved [in a new relationship] with a young woman who is a fitness instructor. Being with her pushes me in certain ways to think a bit about the future and ways in which I can slow the aging process. This is actually what drew me to you in the first place. I saw you and then again one and a half
years later, and you looked younger. Now, looking back, you had cleansed your body of deeper levels of toxicityin that time frame and your body was functioning at a higher level.
I have begun, in the last four months to work out, lift weights and such. This feels good, stronger in the body.
Aajonus I am grateful for your teachings and the opportunity that you give me with choice. This is all that can be asked for, just to givepeople the information, the understanding and offer them the choice of what they want to do with their bodies.
I am thinking again of going to the Ukraine and to photograph atChernobyl. It is imperative that Chernobyl remains in people's consciousness as to the dangers of nuclear and risks of radiation. Chernobyl is misunderstood here in the west. 500,000 Ukrainian/ Russians were involved in the clean-up. All of these people were exposed to dangerous levels of radiation and all are sick. Generations are and will be affected.
Aajonus: Hi, Ray. Thank you for your continued appreciation for my work. It takes many people a decade to understand their bodies and my Primal Diet. I am delighted you understand and thankful I was helpful in your well being.
Since the forced injections almost 2 years ago, I

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 26th Edition - page 4 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 am aging. I am sad for the corrupt minds that have to hurt others to achieve their goals of complete control of other people for profit and power.
Looks as though Chernobyl will be overshadowed by Japan’s new China-syndrome nuclear disaster at Fukushima which is much worse. I saw a
commentary this morning by a scientist who stated the radioactivity is 1,800 times greater than the hydrogen bomb. I hope that you do not go to Japan to photograph that disaster until the radiation dissipates enough in 500,000 years. ______________________________________
Enduring and Persisting Through Difficult Detoxification
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
As I promised in my last newsletter, I will update you on my health condition as a result of the forced anesthesia and injections in this newsletter. I will focus on my detoxification. Since most detoxifications are treated with drugs/medication or supplements by medical doctors and "alternative" practitioners, I will discuss why I do not utilize them, ever.
What Are Drugs And Supplements?
Drugs are industrial chemicals combined in different ways to create a change in bodily conditions. Industrial chemicals have no relationship to nourishment. Nourishment grows, maintains and renews the body every moment that food passes through our digestive tracts. As food passes through, usually in 24 hours, bacteria digest and release nutrients in the food that gives us energy, vitality and bodily stability, that is homeostasis.
Drugs cannot create homeostasis. In fact, they create the opposite. They create disease and suffering. If we were to try and live on medication and supplements without food, we would quickly become ill and die. Even eating ultra-processed foods can quickly make us sick and diseased as proved in the documentary "Supersize Me". In the film, the subject ate nothing but McDonalds "wholesome" food for 30 days. He gained about 30 pounds, diabetic symptoms, depression and anxiety in just 30 days.
ALL supplements are chemically derived even if they are from food sources. In order to isolate a nutrient from food, heat and industrial solvents must be utilized. In "natural" supplements, kerosene, kerosene-derivatives and/or ethyl alcohol are used. Although they are considered natural, they are highly toxic, and to varying degrees damage
-
animal/human cells. Kerosene, ethyl alcohol and other industrial processes are used to dissolve food from which substances will be extracted and negatively alter those substances sought.
Do we think that rinsing it will eliminate the solvents or are they etched into food molecules and sub-particles? What chemicals are formed with the interaction of the solvents and food? Would we soak our food in kerosene or ethyl alcohol for 30 minutes, rinse it for 30-45 seconds and eat it? That is a mild scenario of the industrial process. Laboratories usually soak food for 6-10 hours to dissolve it and rinse for 30-180 seconds.
Then they use various industrial processes to isolate parts of the dissolved food that they will sell as nutrients. All nutrients are complex. Once nutrient-complexes are separated, they no longer function as holistic nutrients, causing accumulation of fragmented nutrient-parts and imbalances. That does not include the kerosene or alcohol contamination within the so-called "nutritional" supplements. Deformed fragment and solvent toxicity accumulates, causing great imbalances on cellular levels.
In order for a company to grow and process foods to isolate and extract so-called concentrated "nutrients", they would have to produce at least 20 supplements to gain a profit. They would have to isolate at least 20 separate "nutrients" that they can package and sell in order to profit.
If, for instance, a company produced only 1 supplement from a specific food that they grew, one bottle or even one pill would cost about $1000 yet still not be truly natural and complete.
Vitamin E
For example, how many units of vitamin E are in one ear of corn to make one low-dose vitamin E

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 26th Edition - page 5 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 capsule containing 100 I.U.? If the company and lab are very very lucky, they might derived 50 I.U. from one ear of corn, that is only 1/2 capsule. The average cost to grow one ear of corn is 50 cents.
First, let's take a brief look at vitamin E. Vitamin E from food sources is listed as "d-alpha- tocopherol" on food packaging and supplement labels. Synthetic (laboratory-made) vitamin E is listed as "dl-alpha-tocopherol". Some food-sourced vitamin E supplements provide other forms that are vitamin E-related, such as gamma-tocopherol, tocotrienols, and mixed tocopherols. They constitute the vitamin E complex. All of those must be present to utilize vitamin E efficiently to accomplish the many things that our bodies perform with it. Some people take large doses because they believe or hope that doing so will keep them healthy or lower their risk of certain diseases.
The myth is that we have to derive vitamin E from food or supplemental sources. The truth is that our bodies create vitamin E from completely raw natural fats through healthy natural bacterial processing during digestion. If digestion is healthy and uncontaminated, during digestion, our bodies' intestinal bacteria not only fractionate food molecules but redesign them, including the production of vitamin E. Cooking, processing and chemically treating food destroys creative bacteria in our intestines, causing massive deficiencies such as vitamin E. Consequently, absence of vitamin E causes oxidization and other toxic substances that result in symptoms of aging.
Returning to vitamin E manufacturing, the wastes remaining from "natural" supplemental processes are 99.9999% of the corn. Waste is voluminous and very expensive as well as harmful to environments. Therefore to be profitable a company and/or lab making the vitamin must find other uses for all of that waste. Most food manufacturers sell waste as animal feed that will grow inferior and diseased animals for meat, diary and eggs. All animals have grown and been vital on their natural raw diets, disease-free for millions of years. As Hippocrates stated, let food be your medicine and medicine be your food. Processed chemicallized fodder is not a natural diet to any creature.
In "natural" supplement-manufacturing what actually happens is, a well-meaning person
-
representing a company approaches representatives at laboratories and asks for bids or estimates for cost of producing an "all natural" vitamin supplement. The lab wants the work. The representative tells the company representative that they will produce an "all natural" supplement in which they will not add or use any thing that is not a natural substance. Usually, no one knows that ethyl alcohol and kerosene will be used since they are "natural" solvents.
Most supplemental companies do not grow or utilize raw food from which they derive their "natural" supplements. To make products viable and profitable for both parties, the lab goes to food- manufacturers and buys their waste. Food- manufacturers sell their waste (already chemically and industrially processed with thousands of chemicals) to the lab. The lab dissolves the waste without adding new chemicals that are not "natural". They use the "natural" solvents mentioned above: ethyl alcohol, kerosene and/or kerosene derivative. They label their supplements "All Natural". NO SUPPLEMENT IS TRULY NATURAL, ORGANIC AND BIOACTIVE.
Now, let's consider the composition of synthetic vitamin E. It is made by combining industrial chemicals completely unrelated to food. They are as able to create real vitamin E as laboratories are able to build an apple from chemicals. It is impossible and ludicrous to make such claims. It simply cannot be done.
In fact, did you know that most synthetic vitamin E is the byproduct of film-developing chemicals? Film-developing chemicals are extremely toxic. They are expensive to contain and dispose of the waste. Sometime in the 1960's a scientist noticed that petroleum-based film-developing fluid waste looked about 70% like vitamin E. Instead of film- developing companies paying enormous costs of waste disposal, they diversified into processing and selling the toxic waste as vitamin E. Ninety-five percent of supplemental vitamin E consumed in the world is, or is very similar to, toxic film- development waste.
Controlling Fear and Panic During Illness (Detoxification)
Industrial toxins create all illness whether mild or severe diseases. The first thing that should be our

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 26th Edition - page 6 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 concern is not to panic when faced with severe detoxification, even if deforming. Going to a medical or "alternative" doctor will usually result in the same experience, that is, terrorization followed by poisoning. They will terrorize you into believing the worst-case scenario.
They are trained to scare the "living daylight out of you". Literally, that means to scare you senseless and stupid. They will convince you with chemistry nonsense, microbial and auto-immune myths and other horror stories to confuse you into accepting harmful substances or "therapies" whether they be medication or supplements.
Herein, I chose to document and share my grueling experience with you so that if such detoxification happens to you, you do not panic and seek harmful medical help. Since all such detoxifications are the result of industrial toxins accumulated and stored in the body, the cause is never bacterial, fungal, or parasitical. Taking antibiotics may stop the detoxification of stored industrial chemicals but does not remedy the problem.
The problem is that stored industrial toxins cause internal imbalances and damage. Taking an antibiotic adds industrial toxins and causes more harm. In other words, the body simply changes its priority to harnessing and detoxifying the new industrial toxin that is the antibiotic, and suppresses detoxification of the old accumulated and stored industrial chemicals.
Since April 2, 2011 until September 7, 2011, my last annual detoxification from those forced injections and anesthesia caused severe attention deficit disorders when I attempted to write. The area in my brain relating to writing became unresponsive and agitated when I attempted to write complex thoughts. It took me 3-5 times longer to write anything. Consequently, my newsletters have been tardy.
Besides the brain disorder, I suffered shoulder, arm, chest, buttocks, leg and foot detoxification similar to those that occurred for 6 months immediately following the forced anesthesia and injections 19 months ago. Other symptoms I have endured since that time are:
 low skin luster with grayish and/or greenish tones especially in legs
 numbness of feet especially in soles -
 thick callused soles
 deformed whitish or tarnished toenails, some
as thick as 1/8 inch
 severe increased hair loss on top my head
 severe reduced ability to neutralize, dissolve
and discharge industrial toxins from my
skin, causing dryness
 cellular death and scarring
 appearance of aging from many dead cells in
skin
 sporadic farsightedness
 loss of much sensuality, feelings, sexuality
and 5 teeth
 and every time I breath, I smell harsh
chemicals even in remote forests.
Most of those symptoms are normal indications of "aging". However, that malignant aging is simply the result of industrial contamination gradually
destroying cells.
My body moved much of the metallic and
industrial chemical poisoning from forced injections into my lower legs, most of that settling/storing in and/or discharging out my feet in the last detoxification from April to September 2011. From indications in my irises, detoxification of injected industrial chemicals could take my body 3 more years to discharge the majority. I do not know yet how long it may take my body to correct cellular and functional damage, such as my sense of smell, sensuality and libido.
The following photos are of my detoxification that lasted from April 2, 2011 through September, 2011. During that detoxification, the 3rd since forced anesthesia and injections, I developed cancerous tumors at my outside ankle on my left foot throughout July and August and ending September 7th. I will explain how I treated that detoxification and tumors following the photos. I was in Asia when the detoxification began until I traveled to South Africa in May.
The sores on my neck, arms, shoulders, chest and buttocks were similar to those that occurred on my feet but they were few in comparison. I had one inside my right nostril that continued to seep and bleed from May through August. To save redundancy, I did not photo-record those and display them here except one on my left buttock and one of my right knee. Also, the sores on the rest of my body did not linger as did those on my feet.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 26th Edition - page 7 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 As you will see in the progression of photos, the lesions were similar but different, indicating that different industrial chemical compounds released at different times, damaging the skin as they passed to the surface. The internal damage is not apparent but can be surmised from surface appearances. The internal pain was far more excruciating than the surface. I managed most of the pain with hot water soaks, hot tub soaks and hot water bottles applied to the most painful areas along with my various painformulas listed in my books.
I continued my normal diet while I was in Asia and South Africa. When I returned to USA June 24th, I began eating no-salt raw cheese frequently to draw any industrial toxins from blood and neurological fluid into intestines. Once I began
eating cheese frequently, every 30-90 minutes, the detoxification mitigated. Upon doing the hot water foot and shin soaks every 3-5 days tremendously reduced damage to skin. I would have done the hot soaks more frequently but I was traveling, lecturing and consulting patients from 8 AM-9:30 PM every day and working on everything else through most of the nights, sleeping about 4 hours nightly.
Skin rashes began on April 2 and became bubbled, prominent and widespread by April 15th. The follow 7 photos were taken on April 15th: 4 of left foot, 1 of right shin and calf, 1 of right knee and 1 of swollen left buttock and upper thigh. Although both feet were involved, I recorded only the left foot because the detoxification was much more persistent and acute in my left foot.

 The following 2 photos are 1 day later, April 16th. You can see how quickly the detoxification transitioned from mainly rash to oozing and blistering. Remember, this is NOT some ominous bacterial, fungal or parasitical cleanse, this was an industrial toxin discharge from forced injections. Some viral matter was involved simply because viruses are solvent detoxifications, not microbial. Therefore, DNA and RNA debris were present in dissolved fluids, that is, the fluids discharged from my feet.

  The following 2 photos are from April 17th. Notice how much the rashes are seeping compared to the previous day and how jaundiced the foot is.

 The following 2 photo are from April 19th, showing the foot turned purple and 3 times more seepage that dried and hardened, some crystallized. When I removed some of the hardened seepage, it was flexible like plastic. When I tried to crush it, it did not flatten or break apart, just like plastic. Some of the injected matter from 19 months ago must have been a type of plastic polymer.

 Late in the afternoons of April 19th and 20th, I soaked my feet and legs half way up my shins in 105° F. hot water with 2 ounces coconut cream and 3 ounces raw milk.
The next photo is from April 21, after having soaked the foot for 2 consecutive days, for 4 continuous hours each day. It shows a cessation of seepage but very chemically burned and damaged skin.
The following photo is from April 23, showing the detoxification subsiding and skin beginning to heal but little reduction in swelling. Remember that swelling is the result of increased nutrient circulation to the swollen area(s) for proper cleansing and healing.

 The following 2 photos are from April 25th, showing that the detoxification cycle has begun again. Rather than redundancy, view the second set of photos above down these to see how the detoxification repeated itself.

  The following photo was taken May 7th when malignant tumors began to form at the ankle.
 
 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 26th Edition - page 23 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 As in April, all through May, June, July, August until September 7, the detoxification cycle pictured in all of the photos above repeated itself twice monthly. During August, kaposi sarcoma repeated itself 4 times at the left side of the left ankle as shown in the following photo of August 17th.
 
 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 26th Edition - page 24 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 Finally, since September 7th, I have not experienced any more rashes, sores, swelling or tumors, including the kaposi sarcoma.
During August and the first week of September, I realized that if I soaked my feet daily in 105-107° F. water with 2 ounces of coconut
cream, 1 T. sea salt and 3 ounces raw milk every 2- 3 days for about 2 hours, the detoxification of chemicals exuded out the skin and into the water. The heat caused fluids to pass from lymph and blood into the connective tissue and perspire out the skin with very little skin damage.
The following photo was taken September 29th after
healing. Notice how the toenails have improved in texture, color and tone.
3 weeks of no radical detoxification and considerable

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

Is It Good To Donate To Charities That Feed The Poor and Starving?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
   Silvia: When I donate money to feed starving children, what do they feed them?
Aajonus: What I am about to write may seem shocking and very cynical. The truth of it is shocking but my cynicism is born from experience in the real medical and food world with my eyes and ears wide open. We must realize that there are some very ominous and even downright disappointing, infuriating and depressing facts we will encounter while we investigate anything regarding large and international charities.
I suggest that you call charities you would like to support and ask specifically what food is purchased and given to the starving children. Ask from which companies the foods are bought. Then ask what specific foods are given to the children. After you get
that information, I suggest that you call the company selling the food and ask what is in that food, that is, what chemicals are used to manufacture it from growing to cleaning and preparing through processing and packaging. Ask if the food sold or donated is rejected food. Then investigate what they tell you.
There is always a bottom-line and we might want to consider the source and the intentions of any non- profit organization/foundation. I discovered when investigating international food charities that most are not charities but marketing ploys to make something sinister look beneficial and even compassionate. For example, I found that mega food manufacturers, companies like Purina, General Foods and General Mills have millions of dollars of product

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 27th Edition - page 2 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 that does not pass inspection in USA every year and cannot be sold in so-called civilized countries.
Frequently, it may be merely bad packaging errors. Regardless, those foods are always nutrient deficient and often very toxic. Generally, those foods are full of acrylamides, pesticides, fungicides and food additives, especially cereals and powdered milk. Too frequently, those products contain so many contaminates from processing that they are too toxic to peddle in "civilized" countries. How do these mega companies dispose of those products and still make a profit from them?
In the USA, if foods are not excessively contaminated according to FDA standards (which are extremely low except for raw foods), manufacturers can sell them as reclaimed product in the USA, such as at an auction but that is not enough money to cover manufacturers' costs. So, what do they do? Often, they peddle them as "good food" to third-world countries or to starving people, that is to charitable organizations. Through non-profit organizations/foundations, they lure people to donate money, usually for the cause of needy children.
Too frequently, the foods sold to charities to feed third-world countries are specifically manufactured from food-manufacturing waste. The companies make grand profits on those foods including what they save in waste disposal. Normally, such food- manufacturing waste is made into animal feed but to make larger profits, they make it into food for countries without food-standards and sold to charities that will feed the poor of the world. Should the poor and starving look a gift-horse in the mouth? Certainly.
Organizations knowingly or unknowingly buy the non-sellable "food" from mega food manufacturers. Literally, they lure the public to pay for the food, labor, shipping and handling all the way to the desperate children who are starving for nutrient-rich foods but get toxic junk food.
On the corporations' books, those products are written off as loses so the sale to non-profit organizations wipes out their tax liability on profits and profits a bundle. Guess what else I discovered? Most of those charitable organizations were established by agents of the food-manufacturers. Shocking and infuriating?
The same profit scam occurs in almost every industrial field, especially the medical and health industry. They sell their unsaleable goods and waste to organizations like Unicef that promotes aid to children of the world, especially medical aid. However, as far as I surmise, 99.9% of all medicines are toxic and should not be sold to anyone anyway.
If you want to donate to a charitable organization that is truly helpful, I suggest you support Heifer International. It promotes true community sustainability and nourishment. It does not give food directly. It teaches husbandry and farming. It gives farm animals to raise, breed and eat. They do not give meals but give livelihoods. There may be more charities like it but I have not seen any in my searches. However, I have not done any thorough searches and investigations on charities since 1990.
There are probably local charities that feed children better food. There is a restaurant owner in America who feeds poor children his very expensive food from his restaurant. Of course, unless the food is made from scratch, that is, basic organically grown raw foods, it will have industrial additives and agricultural chemicals in it.
If you want to give the best, do what I do, I give raw foods to the poor, usually bananas and avocados. Those foods are filling and health-giving. When I give foods at Halloween, I give bananas and apples, sometimes slices of no-salt raw cheese with slices of apple kept together with toothpicks, and/or slices of cheese with dates also kept together with toothpicks. You must choose what you are willing to do to help whomever you wish to help to whatever degree.

Bacteria, Bacteria, Bacteria; and How It Relates to Antibiotics in Feed
and Affects the Immune System? Is There an Immune System?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
William: Hi, Aajonus. What do you make of this? "Meat contaminated with resistant bacteria by Marissa Cevallos, HealthKey, 6:05 AM PDT, April 15, 2011.
[http://www.latimes.com/health/boostershots/la-heb- meat-bacteria-20110415,0,7828885,print.story] Meat in the U.S. may be widely contaminated with strains of drug-resistant bacteria, researchers reported Friday. Nearly half of all meat and poultry sampled in a new study contained drug-resistant strains of Staphylococcus aureus.
"Translational Genomics Research Institute produced the research. It claims to be a nonprofit biomedical research center in Phoenix. They reported that they analyzed 136 samples of beef, chicken, pork and turkey from 80 brands from 26 grocery stores in five cities: Los Angeles, Chicago, Fort Lauderdale, Fla., Flagstaff, Ariz., and Washington, DC.
"DNA testing suggested the animals were the source of contamination. The research was funded by the Pew Campaign on Human Health and Industrial Farming.
"'The fact that drug-resistant S. aureus was so prevalent, and likely came from the food animals themselves, is troubling, and demands attention to how antibiotics are used in food-animal production today,' said Lance Price, lead author of the study and director of TGen's Center for Food Microbiology and Environmental Health, said in a news release.
"Antibiotics are routinely given to livestock to promote growth and prevent disease in crowded pens. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration urged the meat industry to cut back on antibiotics use over concerns that the bacterial resistance bred in stockyards makes antibiotics less effective in humans.
"About 11,000 people die every year from S. aureus infections, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and more than half of those deaths are from the hospital "superbug" methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA).
"The direct risk to meat consumers - a staph infection from the meat - can be reduced by cooking -
meat thoroughly and washing all foods or surfaces that come in contact with raw meat. But the wider danger is to public health-that antibiotics will become increasingly ineffective in humans. Copyright © 2011, Los Angeles Times"
Aajonus: Hi, William. There are several factors to consider whenever we are confronted with such laboratory examinations. Firstly, it is expensive to develop a bio-research laboratory. It costs about $2 million per month just to maintain one idle laboratory that is not doing any research. If research is performed, the costs can run an average of $2 million per day with very expensive laboratory equipment, technicians and security who have to follow incredibly expensive safety precautions. Large corporations usually fund such work for selfish reasons.
In this particular resistant-bacteria study, consider how much it costs to fund a laboratory to do DNA research. Who funded that expensive research? Why would someone fund such research? Who would gain, and would anyone profit? Always it would be the medical industry which is controlled by the pharmaceutical industry and all of its millions of agents, including politicians. Several scenarios could create riches for them.
One would be to create a need for something. New antibiotics means instant sales. Call the old ones bad and bring in the new; just throw away the other ones. In the research about a particular newly resistant strain of bacteria, there will be a new drug to pharmaceutically address the problem. All of the other rhetoric, such as immunity and feeding animals fewer antibiotics, is pertinent issue but is it just smoke screen for the bottom line mentioned in this paragraph?
Are antibiotics a sham? They do not correct a bacterial-infestation problem that they are purported to correct. Consider that it is admitted with the most recent bio-research that humans are 99.5% bacterial. All of the bodily functions are the result of bacterial exchanges, including digestion, smiling, singing,
  
 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 27th Edition - page 3 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 breathing and running. The bacteria that pharma and medical industries call pathogens are merely janitors.
Researchers observe that janitorial bacteria fragment, consume and/or dissolve cells. The cells that are acted upon by the bacteria are those that are damaged, non-recoverable weak or dead. They are not healthy cells. Usually those affected cells are low in bacteria and bacterial exchanges. They all have been damaged by industrial toxins, including toxic byproducts from cooking food, as well as small amounts of normal bio-waste. Researchers and observers look at this occurrence as if the janitorial bacteria are the reason for the degeneration of those damaged or dead cells. Consider that the janitors did not cause the mess and it is wrong to label them "pathogenic". They do not create disease. They remove the toxins and waste accumulations that cause disease.
We must investigate why antibiotics seem to work half of the time. If blood is observed uniformly following antibiotics, we will find elevated waste, hormones and related products that elevate energy levels. Also, janitorial-bacterial activity shifts following antibiotics. Rather than detoxify damaged cells, the body focuses on removing the toxic antibiotic. Together, elevated hormonal-related substances and the cessation of dead-cell removal elevate bodily energy.
Symptoms are often temporarily alleviated. However, the problem of stored toxicity and accumulations of damaged cells advance a body toward disease. We get sicker as pharma/medicine profit. That serves those industries well. When we are sick and have them attend to us, they profit.
When there is weakness in the body, it would make sense to supply certain types of bacteria, such as janitorial. That is exactly the opposite of what pharma and medicine prescribe.
However, more importantly, we must supply the body with nutrients to effect proper cleansing, to assist the bacteria. We must feed the body's system that eliminates waste and poisons, the lymphatic system. Ninety percent of all cleansing is supposed to be done by the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system does most of its work with fats, often with all sorts cholesterols that are often referred to as lipids.
Another way we are conned into thinking we need help, pharma and medicine tell us our immune system is deranged, deficient or non-functional.
There is no such thing as a definable immune system. Pharma and medicine are all over the place about it, making stuff up as they go.
The body does not need to defend itself in natural environments. The medical/pharma industries created the term immune system to brainwash people into thinking that our bodies have to always defend themselves from nature and themselves. The lymphatic system is the only major system designed to cleanse the body when natural or unnatural toxic substances interfere with functions. There are literally millions of natural chemicals that result from lymphatic activity which pharma/medicine call immune-system activity.
Pharma/medicine knows that if you really knew how the body works (as I describe in my DVD Lecture set) you would not be afraid of your body and you would not attack it with their treatments. They do not see any profit in you understanding your body and taking care of it. They have phenomenal resources to convince you that you need them and would dissolve in an instant from some tiny microbe that could take over your whole body.
That is the stuff that bad Hollywood writers create. Yet, people believe it, just as they believed all of the religious jargon about possession that was part of the Inquisition. Religious minds devised elaborate scenarios, theosophy and philosophy to convince and scare people that spooks could take over bodies and cause plague, famine and suffering. They wrote books on it. Pharma and medicine are the same ilk with well-developed minds conditioned at medical universities that are directly and/or indirectly controlled by pharma. Those minds are conditioned to have no holistic wisdom but are politically, socially and financially motivated.
Basically, your question is answered without speaking of Staphylococcus aureus. However lets discuss that so-called pathogen. If you ask CDC for its scientific case-data on Staphylococcus aureus, you will get reports but not any actual science-based laboratory facts. You will get one or two past study references and lots of theory and conclusions based on other laboratory work. Most of those past studies are based on skewed laboratory conclusions and theory rather than natural science.
All of the reports about Staphylococcus aureus are not science based on what naturally occurs but what occurs in laboratories under completely

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 27th Edition - page 4 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 unnatural conditions in unnatural fluids and industrial chemical environments. Additionally, the strain did not come from a natural source and was not naturally occurring bacteria. Most of the actual data written while trying to investigate so-called bacterial disease are complete nonsense.
Who gains by such skewed science? Health departments, their officials and the companies that control them, control them for profit and power motives. It is historically documented fact that the FDA has been directed for at least 40 years by executives of pharmaceutical and chemical companies. The present head of FDA, appointed by Obama, is a former executive of and lobbyist for Monsanto, Michael Taylor.
There are only two major culprits directly connected to profits from the nonsense, they are big pharma and medicine. Trailing with them are all of itsmillionsofagents.Bacterialdiseaseisthesmoke screen that keeps people from investigating the true cause of disease. The true cause of disease is industrial chemical pollution in our food, environment and especially our industrial medicines. As the article about antibiotic issues, antibiotics are a problem but not in the way they are framed in the article.
Most reports on bacterial-related food- contamination are guesstimates at best based on the false premise that bacteria caused illness and disease. When reports point to laboratory experiments involving Staphylococcus aureus, or any other bacteria, it is based on surveys about what people ate, not science. That is, a person who was sick will get a call from the health department and ask what they ate. If the person replies raw milk or a raw meat dish, that is automatically documented as the cause. There are no laboratory processes, just a simple survey.
The pharma/medical industry needs an enemy for everyone to believe in so that people can be terrorized into taking medication. Their enemy is bacteria and they will do everything, lie, cheat and steal to get us to ally against bacteria. Is it about the money, like 95% of all wars. Believe them and fear will overtake us and we will not know truth. We will harm ourselves by attacking our bodies. We will be conned by their slight-of-mind "scientific" jargon. The jargon is elaborate. I would use Staph. aureus as the focus but I do not have with me any reports about that bacteria.
However, I have a recent one on campylobactor. That report involves local, state and federal health departments trying to frame raw milk with an "outbreak" of 25 cases of Campylobacter in Michigan in 2010. The milk attacked by government was that of Amish farmer David Hochstetler. He contracted with me and members of Right To Choose Healthy Food, Trust to board its animals and produce raw dairy products from members animals for members only.
Notice as you read the report that it is all over the place about how bad Campylobacter is, how it can kill children, how it is prevalent in raw milk, what health departments can do to detect it, and hunt down farmers such as David. Yet, through all of the intellectual banter and scientific nonsense, there is NOT one trace of Campylobacter in any of the laboratory results of the many products that government agents seized from David and consumers. NOT A TRACE.
Did they find a food-culprit to blame the 25 incidents of Campylobacter? No. They did not look anywhere else. Why? Because looking for a culprit of Campylobacter is like looking for a needle in a haystack. In reality, when a natural strain of Campylobacter is introduced (spiked) into raw milk, it does not survive (University of California Davis 2004). All you will find is a fingerprint, that is DNA of Campylobacter.
The odds of getting Campylobacter from any raw food is 1 in 10,000,000. They lied and continue to lie. If anyone knows statistics, no food with that statistic could ever be concluded as campylobactor- related. Yet, as you read the inane report, health departments concluded and made all types of rate- manipulations that raw milk was campylobactor- related in those 25 cases. They use one skewed study that they reference at the end of the report.
Even the title of the document is misleading. The title states, "Summary report of the March 2010 Campylobacter outbreak involving consumption of raw milk". There was no outbreak involving raw milk, multiple elaborate tests proved and documented!
Finally, William, industrial chemicals being fed, coated or injected into any animal is a serious problem. The way we avoid such contaminated meat is to find and eat truly organically grown meats that are pastured, especially grass-fed.

   Does Drinking Raw Milk and Eating No-Salt Raw Cheeses Cause Bladder, Kidney, Liver or Gallbladder Stones?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
It was reported to me that people were saying and even writing on the internet that I had kidney stones caused by consuming dairy and/or eating so much meat, depending on who said or wrote the rumor. I did not have a kidney stone that I was aware of at any time in my life. However, I had a bladder stone develop. It is an interesting story starting from when I was an infant.
I remember from a very young age that my urination was slow, slow to start and slow stream. The first conscious memory of my problem is when my mother took me shopping with her when I was almost 3 and no longer wore diapers. I was autistic and did not utter much coherently. My mother and father knew something was not right with me but
they would never admit retardation because it would have reflected on them. They slapped me on my back or back of my head whenever I dazed into my autistic stare, saying, "Stop that! You look like a crazy person." So, my mother was always conscious of my bodily indications as if I were an infant.
On our first day of shopping together where I was not wearing a diaper, she saw me holding my crotch and dancing as if I had to urinate. She took me to the Ladies room and we entered the stall and she placed me in front the toilet. She left the stall door open. She waited for me to drop my pants and underwear then she lifted me onto the toilet. I suppose that she thought I took too long to urinate. She probably supposed that I was shy because she stepped outside

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 28th Edition - page 2 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 of the stall and closed the door. She waited.
After about 2 minutes, she said, "Are you finished yet?" I gave my negative-sounding whine and she waited another minute and said, "Nobody's watching you, go." When I was at home, no one ever noticed that it took me a long time to urinate. I wet my bed every night and everyone noticed that. This was the first time I remember that I had to force myself to
urinate.
As I pushed, my urethra and bladder seemed to
lock. My sensation to urinate disappeared. Without urinating I got off the toilet and raised my underwear and elastic-waisted pants. I open the door and my mother took my hand and we walked. Within a few minutes, my sensation to urinate returned even more so. I urinated in my pants. It trickled slowly as usual. As soon as my mother noticed, she looked debilitated with shame and embarrassment. "What's wrong with you?", she said irritatedly yet with sympathetic tone.
Until that time, I did not know there was a requirement to urinate in an allotted time. As the years traversed and my mother was in the position to have to wait for me to urinate, she complained. I do not remember ever urinating in less than 4 minutes. Sometimes, it took me up to 6 minutes, 4.5 minutes to begin and 1.5 minutes to empty. Those are all signs of kidney and/or bladder stones but without the pain that normally accompanies them.
Under heavy pressure from someone waiting to use the toilet, I did not go. I held it sometimes for hours. In schools, I regularly held it for hours. With the high pressure of more fluids collected in my bladder, still urination mostly came in a slow narrow stream. That was the story of my urination-life until August 2006.
I was 59 years old. I had just eaten some raw shrimp that I had marinated in lemon juice for almost 4 hours. I ate it with raw shrimp cocktail sauce; delicious. As I was about finished, a shooting pain
passed through my lower abdomen. It reminded me of the peritonitis I suffered at age 12, that was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. The doctor removed my appendix even though nothing was wrong with it, in case it caused problems in the future, the surgical report stated. It could not be appendicitis, could it be peritonitis again?
I knew that the pain did not result directly from my food. However, my meal had added pressure to my abdomen. As pain increased, I decided to force vomit to relieve pressure. My vomit-convulsions made pain worsen. I realized that I had to urinate but without the normal pressurized sensation.
At the toilet, I was unable to urinate. A few drops fell at a time. Pain forced me to lift one leg and urination began slowly as always. After 5 minutes of very slow urination, most of the pain subsided. I realized I had bladder swelling. Since swelling always indicates increased circulation to deliver more nutrients to swollen areas, I surmised that my bladder cells were detoxifying.
The pain returned every time I had to urinate and that was more frequently than normal for me. I had to lift my left leg every time before urination would trickle but seemed slower each time. By morning, I had to lift the leg and lean to my lifted-leg side. It was very awkward.
Because of the position I had to take urinating, I realized that something other than swelling was obstructing urine flow. I called a friend who had recently had stones removed and ask the for his urologist's name and number. About six months prior, I advised him to find a urologist who used ultrasound rather than x-rays to diagnose urinary problems.
Two and a half days after pain began and increased to cause headaches, I watched the ultrasound screen reveal a large mass. Here are the results from front and side, respectively. The mass was blocking the outflow of urination to my urethra.

  The urologist looked extremely concerned. I took that as normal terrorist tactics. I got ready to receive alarming news that I had a huge tumor that require immediate surgery. Instead, he said, "That is the largest bladder stone I have every seen; in experience and literature. You have not had pain before only 3 days ago?" I had not.
Naturally dissolving a stone that size could take months and my next lecture tour was to begin in 2 weeks. The urologist explained that he would insert 3 tubes: a laser to blast the stone, a camera to accomplish that and a water tube for flushing stone debris. I imagined a tube holding the three tubes to be inserted in my penis, up my urethra to my bladder to be about 1/4 inch in diameter; ouch. The urologist said that the entire procedure, once it began would take about 45 minutes. I decided I would undergo non-surgical removal of my one massive stone.
I thought about refusing anesthetic because I knew that I could withstand incredible pain but because I could not ensure that I could be still while and after a 1/4 inch tube was inserted in my penis, I decided not to refuse. Because no American medical doctor will
perform any medical procedure while under anesthetic without an IV of glucose, I had to accept the IV. I told the urologist that he was not to use any antibiotic injections or antibiotics in the IV. Additionally, I instructed him that I was not to receive anything in me or my IV except glucose water, not even saline.
He argued with me for about 10 minutes and said that he would not do the procedure unless he could administer antibiotics. I warned him that if anything major happened to me because he refused to help me, he would be liable. I told him I could take oral antibiotics and he then agreed. I did not state that I would consume the antibiotics, I truthfully told him that I could take them. He gave me a package of antibiotics for me to take that night and the morning before the procedure. I accepted them merrily but did not ingest them, of course.
I was given written instructions to prepare for the procedure that was scheduled for 10 AM. I was not to eatafter2AM.SinceIwasandamonarawdiet,I knew that would not be necessary nor beneficial for me.

 The urologist's assistant, office nurse and manager were stupefied by the size of my bladder stone. They did not understand why I did not have excruciating pain before 3 days ago. The assistant said that I should have been experiencing pain at least 3 years ago and that it would take a long time for a stone to get that large. "The body makes many stones instead of making one large one," the nurse said. But not mine. Why me, was a question I was used to asking but rarely finding an answer in comparisons.
Most of the night, I tried to figure how my body built such a stone. I did not eat any meat or other solid food after 2 AM. I consumed liquids only, milkshakes with double the amount of eggs and absolutely no water. I wanted to be certain that I had all of the nutrients to bind with the toxic industrial anesthetic and glucose that would be infused into my body so, I consumed 20 eggs in the 18 hours before I reached the hospital. I did not drink milkshake after 6 AM and did not eat eggs after 8 AM.
When I arrived at 8:30 AM for the procedure, I was ushered to hospital administration. Because I did not have medical insurance, they wanted the $6,000+ for the hospital bill in cash. The urologist had informed me so I was prepared with cash. The clerk gave a waiver form for me to sign. I informed him that since the waiver was several pages, he could get it from me in the preparation room in about 30 minutes.
I was escorted to the preparation room and placed my shoulder bag on the floor next to the gurney on whichIwastolie.Inmybag,Ihadaquartof milkshake for when I awakened.. The man returned twice in that 30 minutes for the signed waiver but it took me 35 minutes to complete.
I marked a line through any wording that stated I would accept any procedure or medication the doctor deemed necessary while I underwent the scheduled procedure. I wrote in the margin that I accept only anesthesia and glucose water and no surgery. I lined any mention of doctor and assistant's non- responsibility for anything that happened to me during procedure and initialed it. Hello? Every profession gives certain guarantees for its work, they must guarantee the most important work in the world. What recourse do I have if they perform badly on me if I signed a waiver? None. I was not going to give them a waiver.
I read, marked and signed the papers; I did not agreed to any waivers. I agreed to hospital procedures, payment, payment methods and other non-medical procedural matters. A nurse took the document and prepared to insert an IV. Before I allowed her to insert it, I read the IV bag to ensure that nothing was in it except glucose water.
Glucose water is not healthy but I reasoned that my body could handle only two toxins, glucose and anesthetic. There was saline in the IV bag to which I refused. The nurse walked away a bit concerned. I thought that she might go to the urologist and report and he would tell her that he agreed that there would be only glucose. She returned awhile later with another bag with only glucose water.
About 15 minutes later, the anesthesiologist entered and inserted the dope into my IV. I told him that I would not accept anything in me or my IV except anesthesia and glucose water. As I was becoming groggy, he injected something into my arm. Doped and duped, I demanded to know what was in the injection. He smiled and with unrestrained bravado said, "Medicine."
He darted away and nurses wheeled my gurney before I could discover what he had injected into me. I demanded to know from the nurses but they said they did not know. I was certain that it was antibiotic. Later, he denied giving me an injection. The injection mark was on my arm for the next 24 hours so I knew I had not imagined it. (I did not pay his $800 bill.)
As I rolled into the operating room, I saw surgical steel tubes that were wider than my penis, about 1.5+ inches in diameter. I was very grateful I did not mention no anesthesia!

 The photos above are different angles of the stone immediately prior to laser-blasting it to smithereens. The stone is about the actual size in the photo if you open your file to 100%. From the cameras very close perspective, the stone looks round but its actual shape is scalene ellipsoidal as seen in the ultrasound prints.
About four hours later, I woke in a room with people preparing to go home from minor medical procedures. I was lying on a gurney. When I tried to move of the gurney, the head nurse insisted that I had to wait 90 minutes before they would allow me to leave because the procedure did not go as planned. It had lasting almost 2 hours. I checked to make sure my penis was still on me. It was and I was wearing a diaper and very sore.
I had no idea what they had done to me in the extra hour and 15 minutes. No one who knew anything could explain what happened. Another nurse offered me some orange juice. I asked her if she squeezed it herself. She gave me an are-you- crazy look. I refused it. I asked for my clothes and bag. Another nurse brought them to me. I removed my milkshake from my bag and sipped it while I waited to leave.
I had to urinate and the pressure soreness on my bladder was tremendous. I thought I would wet myself. One nurse helped me to the toilet. Urination began within 10 seconds over the toilet like a horse. Urination was about 2 cups and took only 15-20 seconds to empty. Wow, what a sensation; must have been the first time since I was an infant.
When hospital personnel where ready to release me, I had finished drinking my milkshake. The head nurse asked who was the friend who was taking me home from the hospital. I told them that there was a taxi driver who was waiting for me. "I gave him the time so he must have been waiting for over 2 hours for me," I said. They stated that they could not release me to a taxi driver. I told them that the taxi driver was a friend, that I had known him for about 4 years. They still declined.
I had just purchased my first cell phone, removed it from my bag and initiated it. I called the cab driver. He said the hospital had sent him away, refusing to let him know when he could get me and ordered him off the property. "I parked my cab on the street just outside the release area and I am waiting for you. I was not going to abandon you," he said. I thanked him and told him I would be out in about 5 minutes.
I felt trespassed upon and betrayed by the nurses and hospital. "That's fine," I stated, "I will walk out of here without your consent." They threatened to call security. "What are you going to do, shoot me?" I asked. I walked, slowly of course from soreness. They relented and offered me a wheel chair. I accepted the ride and rode to the taxi.
When I arrived home, I called the urologist's office and asked what happened during procedure. She transferred the call to the urologist. He told me that it was not only outrageously large but hard, almost like metal. It took him over 1 hour 45 minutes to disintegrate the stone. Its core, he said, was the size of a large marble and black like steel.
He stated that to be that dense and large, it had to have formed over several decades. It was the most gruesome task he had every performed. He had to increase the intensity of the laser and still ensure that he did not tear/burn my bladder. He said that he sent some of the fragments and a bladder-scrape to the lab to ensure no cancer resulted.
The lab report stated no cancerous activity and that the black particles were "mercury dense." I explained to the urologist that I had had slow urination since I could remember and that the stone probably developed as a result of the many tetanus injections I received as an infant and adolescent. Obviously to me, my bladder is where my body tried to rid itself of the neuro-toxic mercury and aluminum from vaccines. Probably because it had developed since infancy, my body simply acclimated by creating calloused bladder tissue and preventing pain. His head motions as if that were a good possibility.
There is a very low percentage of people who develop stones whether kidney, bladder, liver or gallbladder. Tribes who lived entirely on raw dairy and meats had no history of any kind of stones developing in their bodies. Therefore, it cannot be the concentration of minerals in raw dairy or raw meats as some people believe.
Analysis of stones reveals that they are an amalgam of various cauterized minerals of all sorts. The hardest are those dense with heavy metals. All people who develop stones, develop them from numerous cauterized minerals and resins. Their bodies cannot process cauterized minerals and crystallized resins well enough to eliminate them through skin by perspiration. Their bodies discharge them into kidneys and may collect there or in

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 28th Edition - page 6 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 bladders, rarely both. Some people's bodies dump into and collect cauterized minerals in liver or gallbladder.
There is nothing on my Primal Diet(tm) that causes minerals to collect, and there are no resin-based foods on the diet except propolis. Some people who eat more than a little propolis could cause some stones to develop because propolis is tree resin. Tree resin does not digest well and has a tendency to collect in some people.
Stone Remedies
To dissolve and remove any kind of stones, I suggest implementing my Kidney Stone formulas recommended in my book WWTL. Alternate the formula recommendations, that is, one day one and the next day the other until stone(s) is/are dissolved. Also, I suggest adding 2 ounces of naturally sparkling mineral water to each formula. The natural hydrogen peroxide effect of natural carbonation helps
to dissolve stones. For kidney or urinary bladder stones, I suggest that you warm the formulas and drink them fast so that they are delivered to kidney and bladder quickly. For liver and gallbladder stones, I suggest that you sip the warm formulas.
For the first few days, you may add an extra tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar to those formulas to increase stone-dissolving processes. Too much vinegar for too long can cause mineral deficiencies. Walk the mineral-balance line but do not cross it. If crossed, usually pain increases exponentially. You may recover it fairly quickly by eating small amounts of no-salt raw cheese every 15- 20 minutes.
There are other remedies in my book WWTL for gallstones (gall bladder stones). If you have gallstones, see additional suggestions under Gallstones.

What Foods Help Our Bodies Dissolve Plaque from Our Circulatory Systems?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
Gaining more health and avoiding medical procedures are my main goals in life. Since I was an infant and all through my childhood, adolescence and young adulthood, I received many medical procedures including horrific vaccines and surgeries. All of them caused great harm to my body which it sustained throughout my life. Tests as early as 15.5 years of age proved that I had plaque in my right internal carotid artery of PSV 223 cm/sec and EDV 76 cm/sec.
PSV is Peak Systolic blood flow velocity. The higher it is indicates the faster the blood has to be forced through arteries and veins because of obstruction. Obstructions can be excessive weight causing pressure on the arteries or buildup on arteries. If it is buildup on arteries, the higher the number the greater the buildup. According to pharma/medicine, the higher the number, the greater the propensity for heart attack. I do not agree with that. If the buildup is made of hardened fats that could brake away from the arterial wall in large enough chunks, that could a clot. High blood pressure
andhighbloodvelocitytonotcausestrokesorheart attacks.
EDV is End-diastolic velocity. It has similar meaning as PSV but is usually measured to see if there is propensity for cerebral stroke.
My high PSV and EDV meant that I had plaque buildup in my right carotid artery resulting in increased blood flow velocities. That categorized me as someone who was in danger of heart attack and cerebral stroke. It is believed, and sometimes observed, that if a large chunk of plaque breaks from an internal arterial wall, it can cause a clot - restricting blood flows to heart and/or brain, depending on where the clot lodges in the body - and cause stroke and/or heart attack. My mother was alarmed because that condition is almost unheard of inadolescents.
The tests were performed because I developed angina at 15.5 years young. The angina began within 10 days after my third polio-vaccine injection. Doctors and my mother, who was a nurse, never put the vaccine and my immediate on-set of angina

 together because they were conditioned not to.
Fast forward to 2001. When it became more common to check arterial plaque with ultrasound, I began having mine checked every 3-4 years. Ultrasound is only harmful if done more than twice in a 6-months period, or to a fetus if done more than once every five weeks for more than 4 minutes at a
time.
The company Life Line Screening made
ultrasound tests easily accessible once or twice yearly, inexpensively. Although 4 tests over 10 years revealed my right carotid artery showed plaque buildup of at least PSV 181 cm/sec and EDV 59 cm/sec, I did not feel the need to bother with correcting it. I was and am not a physically active person and was not concerned. My lowest reading was PSV 168 cm/sec and EDV 49 cm/sec in the tests of 2/24/2007, showing that as I continued to eat my Primal Diet, it helped my body gradually remove plaque.
However, while my right carotid artery contained the buildup, my body had to have high velocity blood flow. I am for higher velocity flow because it is a symptom that something causing it to be necessary. I agree with eliminating the cause but not simply reducing velocity with medication that can cause stokes. A person is much more likely to have a stroke while taking medication or eating chocolate. The 3 people I know who had strokes while partially follow my Primal Diet were heavy consumers of regular brand chocolates.
In September 2010, I decided to see how long it would take me to dissolve it if I tried. Thrice weekly, I began to consume 1-2 tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar mixed in 2 ounces of raw milk immediately followed by another 2 ounces raw milk to rinse the vinegar out of my mouth, insuring it did not deteriorate my dentine. Occasionally, I consumed vinegar in my Sport Formula or vegetable juices instead of milk. I was not consistent because I traveled frequently and did not bother while traveling and away from home. Another food that helps remove plaque is citrus, especially pineapple. However, as I stated in my book WWTL, over-eating pineapple can cause extreme emotionality. If eating pineapple daily to remove arterial buildup, I suggest eating only 1 ounce per day with a raw fat such as 3- 4 tablespoons coconut cream and 1 tablespoon raw cream or 1 teaspoon no-salt raw butter.
My estimate is that I had raw apple cider vinegar about 30 times before my next tests of 8/4/2011, eleven months later. The 2011 tests returned these results: Carotid Artery: Left: Normal; Right: Normal; No Atrial Fibrillation; No Aneurysm, and Peripheral Arterial condition Normal. The abnormal plaque buildup was gone! Interestingly, my neck, thyroid and two lymphatic glands under my lower jaw slightly diminished in size. I do not have as much right-side stiff neck ache and fatigue after very long airplane travel as I used to experience.

Subscriber question: Is The Science of Viruses Real?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
Trevor: Science claims viruses are structured and self-replicating. It even details their unique genomes1. How do you account for this whilst claiming they are non-living, solvent detoxifications? Aajonus: As I stated many times, science observes that the accumulation of cellular waste increases as time passes during detoxifications such as flu. Most doctors and researches are instructed to not see them
1
as detoxifications. They surmise that a viral microbe is responsible for the dissolution of cells instead of realizing it is cells themselves that produce the solvent that causes their own dissolution of particular cells within themselves. It is a matter of cellular self- cleansing. It is a frequent occurrence because cells lack bacteria to do the process more easily, naturally.
Researchers vary in there assessments of how many cells are in the human body but they all agree that it is around 60 trillion, depending on our sizes. According to my laboratory calculations with healthy animals who were not subjected to industrial
 Genomes are complex chemical skeletons, so to speak, of a particular type of species, such as the genomes of a human being. They can also be simple genomes of any single cell, such as a neural cell.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 28th Edition - page 8 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 chemicals, there is supposed to be about 300 times more bacteria than animal cells in our bodies. It the last two years, science has only found 150 times more bacteria than human cells in the human body. I surmise that low bacterial level is because of our constant poisonous exposure to industrial toxins that destroy bacteria.
Each cell type, such as liver, heart, pancreas, spleen, nerve, neuron, lymph, artery, muscle, etc. has a specific DNA pattern. For instance, if I were to find cellular waste that contained heart-cell DNA and RNA, that would be a specific category. We could subdivide those into more categories because there are muscle, nerve, lymph, connective, reproductive, blood and other cells within heart cells that are heart- specific and have particular DNA and RNA.
Naming and categorizing them as viruses that attack us creates the monster that pharma/medicine needs for us to be in fear, seeking their weapons of mass destruction so we create war within our bodies so they can profit. The bodily war waged by medical
practices only makes us sicker so they can profit more. Believe and accept it and you will live in fear and self-destructive war without healthful resolutions. Do not believe them; instead, seek natural remedies and you will live a life that progresses nurturing, understanding, peacefulness and healthfulness.
I wish it were different but all of the people who profit by pharmaceuticals and medical procedures, including 99% of politicians, do not wish it to be different while saying they do. They spend trillions yearly and make laws that deny you of your human right to well-being, ensuring that you believe them. As was reported recently, 95% of all pharma/medical tests were proved to be purposefully falsified and wrong to gain profits and notoriety. Are we going to fight our conditioned, brainwashed illogic and trust in convoluted medical science and seek peace and health, or are we going to choose the opposite? What is your choice? _______________________________________
Subscriber question: Does Rabies Exist?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, ph.d. nutrition
Trevor: You claim rabies is a myth, whilst science calls it a virus. What are purported 'carriers', such as frothy-mouthed dogs, detoxifying from and is there any danger from being bitten?
Aajonus: In all of my travels, especially living off of a bicycle for 3 years, out of the thousands of sick dogs and cats, I saw only four who frothed at the mouth. One was a puppy who had a terrible reaction to his puppy vaccines that dissolved his digestive tract. I saw another dog with frothing mouth which had eaten poisoned food from a neighbor. The poison dissolved his esophagus and stomach.
The third was my cat. Embarrassing as this is and as shamed as I am to have done this, I will reveal the circumstance. When I became a raw vegetarian, I forced my adopted cat, a known carnivore, to be vegetarian. It was about 3 years after my autism went into remission and my nutritional studies were all I lived for. After a few weeks, he refused to eat anything raw vegetarian, even raw dairy. Even though I did that and knew that I was responsible, he
stayed loyal to me and cuddled with me. Two months after that change in his diet, he died in my lap frothing at the mouth.
I performed an autopsy on him in the bathtub. The decaying odor from the inside of his body was astounding. The frothing at the mouth was the result of him digesting his stomach. The rest of his body was almost completely dehydrated. Rigamortis was everywhere but not his stomach. He continued to produce hydrochloric acid but he had no mucous on his stomach lining. The acid ate his stomach lining causing a frothy reaction.
I have been bitten by several animals in my youth. One was a ground hog that we were supposed to keep for 10 days to ensure it did not have rabies but it died 3 days later. My mother and doctor talked about giving me the painful rabies shots just in case. When I saw the needle heading for my stomach, I refused and put up the biggest uncontrollable tantrum mom had ever seen. The doctor said that they should wait to see if I have symptoms in the next 5 days. I did not develop any.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 28th Edition - page 9 © 2011 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 Also, I was bitten by several snakes, horses, goats, a wild rabbit and several mad dogs but no Englishmen. When I was 9 or 10 years old, I was bicycling on a narrow road in a wooded area only 3/4 of a mile from home when a dog raced from its yard, chased me and bit my ankle. I noticed he frothed at his mouth but did not know what it meant. I immediately rode home and showed my mother the lesion. After examining it, she asked where was the dog that bit me. We got in the car and I showed her the way as she drove.
When we arrived at the dilapidated wooden house from where the dog had charged me, my mother parked on the street. The dog came charging at the car, growling and barking, frothing at its mouth. My mom looked more concerned. An unclean middle- aged-looking woman came and restrained the dog and put him in the house. My mother and I exited the car and approached her.
Mother asked her if her dog had its rabies shot within a year. The woman opened her mouth to speak and revealed that nearly all of the teeth she had were rotten and jagged, some were missing. In a somewhat loud voice, she gruffly told mom that her dog did not bite anybody and that it was none of her business.
My mother showed my lesion to the woman. The woman said that I must have crashed on the bike and one of the spokes punctured my ankle and I would not admit it. Mom looked at me queryingly. I did not understand the words but I knew the woman denied her dog bit me. Mom observed me and knew the dog had bitten me. Again, she asked the woman if her dog had its rabies shot. The woman blurted back, "Yeh. Now go on and leave us alone."
I could see in mom's face that she did not believe the woman and was concerned. When we arrived home, she called the doctor and he explained the indications to look for in the next 7 days. They symptoms of what rabies is supposed to do did not happen.
In my examination and research of rabies, all of the images I saw of the "virus" were computer or somehow graphically generated. All of the other imagines that are shown are of tissue that could have
been altered by any number of causes and animals claimed to have rabies. Nothing with scientific evidence. In the late 70's, after I return from living outdoors mostly from a bicycle, I investigated two cases of people who the news stated had rabies. I used the Freedom of Information act to get the names of the people reported. County health department did not have any record of the cases.
Since one of them had been shown on the news, I called NBC News and asked for the name of the person interviewed. They gave me the name but would not give me the address or phone number. I told them I was a medical researcher and asked if they would call him and give my number to him. I received a return call from NBC that the number they had been given for him was not in service. I searched for the man with that name and there were many. I called everyone over the next 2 weeks and no one admitted to having had rabies.
Finally, I asked NBC News for the hospital in which he was videotaped. They did not know because they did not take it themselves, the recording was giving to them. Again, I called the county health department and asked about the two rabies cases reported last month and they did not know what hospital was involved. I stated that it was impossible for them not to know if it were reported to them. I asked who the doctors were who reported the cases. They did not know that either. I realized it was planted news. As journalist Jon Rappaport calls it "fake news" to generate gain for someone or many.
No one has shown me any evidence that rabies really exists. To me, it is simply another myth created by people promoting health fear and profiting from it. Just think how much money is involved when politicians make laws that every dog and cat must have yearly rabies shots. Billions if not trillions of dollars are involved yearly. It is exactly the same as health departments creating a mythical disease claimed to be caused by raw milk whenever they want to promote a law against raw milk or stop one that favors raw milk.

 Hi, health lovers,
Unfortunately for everyone, our liberties have narrowed to a frighteningly dangerous state. Industrial giants like banks, agriculture, pharma, oil and government are out of control. Some people who speak out against them are threatened and/or harmed.
Several of my clients have asked me to be more careful, to not speak the truth of food, industrial contamination of everything, and liberty. I just cannot sit back and keep my mouth shut or stop my pen.
It boggles my mind that people can accept, sit and watch injustice and assaults as if they were just unreal TV soap opera. I will die for my health and liberties before living as a diseased slave to this industrial oligarchy protected by the bureaucratic oligarchy (our government) in this country and most of the industrialized world.
I cannot sit and watch 100s of millions of children being poisoned daily at birth to adulthood, if they live, by toxic potions called vaccines. There is nothing more sinister than 99% of our politicians defending the medical fraud of vaccines because they have stock and financial interest in pharmaceuticals.
It astounds me that parents can so easily be persuaded to allow their children to be injected with any vaccine that has no nutrient value and is full of only toxic ingredients. Most parents do not research and demand to know specifically everything that is in vaccines and how it might effect their children.
Because of my stance on vaccines and specifically my international and domestic broadcasts about the Swine Flu H1N1 hoax from February through March of 2009, in April 2009 I was abducted and injected with three hypodermics full of poison. I am still affected by those poisons. I will probably be affected by them for another 40 years. If they caused genetic damage, I will be effect for life.
On July 1st, just 30 days ago, I was riding in my Toyota pickup truck to my farm in Thailand. The steering wheel began to shimmy at about 85 kph (53 mph). Since I would be traveling to Finland in 3 days, I asked my girlfriend Pawadee to have the front end aligned while I was away.
I returned to Thailand on July 15th. My truck had had a complete checkup and wheel alignment at a respected Toyota dealership while I was in Finland. However, Pawadee was as surprised as I that between 95-105 kph (59-65 mph) the truck slightly shimmied. It hadn't for the few days she drove it while I was away after she had it aligned. Since I was going to be in Thailand for 5 days only, we decided that she would return my pickup truck to Toyota dealership right after I left Thailand and have the truck's wheels and axle properly aligned again.
However, 3 days later, the day before I was to leave Thailand, we were traveling a narrow road with many sharp curves in late evening. At the seventh curve at about 25 kph (15 mph), the car veered off road, stopping about 2 meters from the roadway on a steep embankment. Even though we were not going fast, the truck traveled off road about 10 meters (30 ft.). WE should have stopped before the car left the pavement but the truck veered off road. It should not have veered at all.
My truck rolled on its side and landed on its roof, crushing the roof a little and shattering the windshield. Pawadee and I were upside down, secure in our seats by harnesses and seatbelts uninjured.

Water began shooting through the floor above us. I realized the truck was slowly sinking under water.
I released my seatbelt and fell headfirst to the ceiling and shattered windshield. I braced my fall with my hands but cut my right knee on the shattered windshield; I was wearing shorts and teeshirt. Pawadee began to panic. I lowered her window. The water began pouring into the car and the car began to sink quickly. I released her seat belt and she fell into the water filling the car. I asked her to move fast out the opened window before the water trapped us in.
I decided not to open my window because the water would fill faster and I might be trapped in swamp sludge or quicksand. It was dark and I could not tell where we were. Dashboard lights were all we had to illuminate the cab.
Pawadee moved out the window and stood on the doors window edge, keeping half of her body above water. I tried to follow her but the truck had sunk so far that the force of the intruding water forced me back inside the cab. I grabbed the edge of the top of the door that was upside down and did a fast and strenuous pushup. However, the force of the incoming water was too great.
I was trapped underwater where I could not breathe. I tried another pushup but was stopped partially through the window-opening. I reached for the running board outside the car above me, grabbed it with one hand and turned my body around facing the door that was completely under water by then. I wanted to breathe but was still under water. I felt a urge to panic but decided not to panic. I reached upward and grabbed the running board with my other hand. With both hands and great force, I pulled myself above water and caught my first breath.
Pawadee and I crawled on the underside of the car that was still above water by few inches. The truck did not sink more. We were in a swamp. Since we were so close to the swamp's edge, I leaped from the truck to the edge of the swamp. Pawadee followed. My suitcases and brief case were all in the truck being soaked in the murkiest swamp water. I was thankful that those were all I had to worry about.
Several cars had stopped and shined their headlights into the swamp below. People had gathered and watched us emerge from the truck and swamp, alive. We climbed the embankment and saw only one skid mark, revealing that not only had the steering of one wheel been lose and misaligned but that the breaks had failed on the same side. That was the reason we did not immediately stop as we should have when the car began to veer.
The possibility that the mechanic was so negligent that he did not tighten the wheel to the axle and failed to connect the brake was farfetched. To me, there was no other explanation than someone had purposely sabotaged my truck, trying to seriously or fatally injure us. If the wheel had veered at a great speed, we would probably be dead.
A tow truck was called. It arrived within 20 minutes. It wenched my truck from the swamp. Because it was not a crash accident, very little structural damage resulted to the pickup. Mainly, the roof and windshield were somewhat crushed from the tumble. However, my computer, camera, lenses, cell phones, numerous electronic surveillance equipment I carry for protection, and documents were destroyed.
Soaking wet, we went immediately to the nearest police station and filed a police report. Afterward, we went to Pawadee's family's home, only 20 minutes away from where we veered and toppled. It was her mother's birthday and we had missed the party but everyone was happy we were alive and significantly

uninjured.
It took 4 technicians and me 10 days in 3 cities to recover my email files and email address book from the harddrive of my unsalvageable laptop. For those who contacted me during the last 10 days and did not receive my help, please understand and accept my apologies.
Interestingly, just 5 weeks ago, I made a short video on the toxicity of all vaccines, appealing to parents not to vaccinate their children. The video was supposed to go on YouTube last week. The file was destroyed in the water. However, a friend has an unedited copy and it will go online as soon as I can edit it again
As I stated above, the last major attempt on my life immediately followed my international and domestic interviews about the Swine Flu H1N1 hoax and the toxicity of the vaccine. Of the 240 million vaccines produced, less than 20 million were reported to have been injected. I feel happy that I was part of the H1N1 vaccine's failure.
I cannot keep quite while children are being poisoned everyday by the edicts of senseless medical personnel and lawless government employees. How can you?
healthfully and appreciatively, aajonus

In an email received August 8th, 2012, Aajonus says:
“Because of what happened to my truck in Thailand and the fact that my FJ Cruiser in Philippines also shimmied, I looked at the car and found two engine mounts gone on the passenger's side and brake damage. It is in the shop getting fixed. They have to pull the engine to get to the motor mounts and that takes 3-4 days to complete. What is telling about this is that, I had all of the motor mounts changed last year. They should have lasted at least 5 years. This time, I am having them reinforced with double the steel. Someone is definitely trying to kill me or cause great bodily harm. I will have to regularly check my vehicles.”
In an email received August 10th, 2012 Aajonus adds:
...Visited Toyota repair yesterday and found both rocker arms were also bent, and something cause a crawling crack in the body frame. I have not been in an accident with this vehicle and have not gone off road on rocky/boulder terrain that would have caused such damage.

The     Newsletter
29th Edition; July 7, 2012
I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

  Long-term Damage From Abduction and Forced Injections
by aajonus vonderplanitz, hon.ph.d. nutrition
This article updates how my body continues to detoxify the mass industrial poisons from the abduction and forced injections of April 2009, that resulted from my interviews and information about the H1N1 hoax of that year. I also show the long- term effects on my body.
My yearly detoxification of the toxicity from the forced injections started again on the anniversary week, the first week of April, 2012. In Aprils 2011 and 2010, the detoxifications lasted from April into late August. However this year, I am near completion of my injection-toxicity detoxification this first week of July except for my severe brain fog.
I have great difficulty keeping subjects focused and on point. That has been the case every year of these detoxifications. The brain fog usually clears by late August. So, I am struggling to get this newsletter to you. Please understand and forgive my delayed newsletters.
This year's detoxification has been physically mild compared to the last 2 years. The last 2 years, I suffered 5 months of exploding tissue with near constant oozing but rarely puss (white blood cells). If
you remember from my yearly posts, I used lime juice, unheated honey, coconut cream or butter, and thin slices of raw meat to help detoxify and heal the wounds when they appeared, and for as long as they appeared, for months. The lime juice prevented the necessity for my body to deprive the blood of many white blood cells which help eat the millions of damaged and/or killed cells during the chemical detoxification. When our bodies are healthy, white blood cells remain in the blood and only consume dead red blood cells, keeping the blood clean. During some emergencies, white blood cells will leave the blood and travel to areas with massive cell destruction and eat the organic waste.
This year, my first symptoms were a few 2-3 mm explosion-like burns on the left side of my neck. The next week, I bled from my left eye, nose and ear for about one week, losing 2-4 tablespoon blood daily. That was enough to cause me to sleep more than my normal 4 hours daily, up to 5-7 hours but not enough to make me anemic. Bleeding lasted only 10 days and was inconsistent. I felt little discomfort in the eye and nose but a lot of pressure and pain in my ear.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 29th Edition - page 2 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
To mitigate the pain, I consumed unheated honey, no-salt raw butter and no-salt raw cheese (ratio: 1:2:4 respectively) every few hours as needed. Probably, any of my pain formulas would have worked but for the ear, I preferred the butter/cheese/honey pain formula because it was the least liquid and would help remove fluid from the ear. It worked perfectly.
I rarely experienced pain unless I went 5-6 hours without the above pain formula, or on flights. On flights, pain was intense from altitude pressure that added to the water pressure caused by detoxification.
Remember that the body must have swelling when there is detoxification. Swelling is increased circulation of blood and lymph to the troubled area, increasing nutrients to the area for detoxification and healing.
Because I was traveling so much, lecturing at the time, I did not take many hot-tub baths to help perspire the toxins from my tissues. I remind you that 90% of toxins are supposed to leave the body through skin as evaporation and perspiration.
Usually but not healthfully, skin is blocked with lymphatic waste and congestion that must be melted and moved with heat. Instead of hot baths to help move the plastic-congested/blocked lymphatic system with all of the poisons remaining from the forced injections, I applied 7 hot water bottles while I slept. I did not use electrical heat because electrical heating devices emit enormous harmful electromagnetic fields.
I filled each water bottle with hot water and placed each one inside a separate flannel pillow case and wrapped the excess pillow-case material around the bottle. I took them to bed.
With the covers drawn, I spread three beach towels over the sheets on the area where I would sleep. The towels caught my profuse perspiration while
I slept with the hot-water bottles against my body. I laid myself on my back or face, and placed one hot- water bottle at each of the following locations: between my calves, between thighs, at each hip, in each armpit and one at left-side of the neck and head.
Then I placed another beach towel over me and the bottles to tent the heat into my body and catch rising evaporation from getting into the down quilt cover and making it wet. Then, I drew the down quilt over me, the towels and hot-water bottles. With the bottles inside the pillow cases and under the covers, the bottles remained hot for 6-7 hours.
Sometimes, I did not consume my usual 1 cup of
fruit with fat daily because I did not want to increase detoxification. However, when I began smelling acrid chemicals emitting from my skin, especially my hands, armpits and under fingernails, I began making and consuming one quart of smoothie with vinegar daily.
The smoothie helped chelate with the metals from the forced injections. The amino acids in raw apple cider vinegar are excellent for bonding with toxic metals, that is, with the help of berries and a combination of other foods.
Here was my daily metal/industrial chemical chelation formula: 3/4 cup each of raw raspberries and blueberries, 1/2 cup raw cream, 2 ounces coconut cream, 1-3 tablespoons (T.) raw apple cider vinegar, 4 T. fresh raw lime juice, 1 T. fresh raw lemon juice, 2 ounces pineapple (whole not juice) and 3-4 raw eggs to fill the jar to one quart, and blended all together.
I sipped it throughout the afternoon and evening, sometimes into the night. Sometimes, to insure I harnessed as many toxins as possible, I consumed at least 1/2 inch cube of cheese while I sipped the smoothie.
To help eliminate any of the toxins that may have made it to stomach and intestines, I ate 1 or 2, 1/2 inch cubes of no-salt raw cheese every 20-30 minutes through most every day.
I took photographs of my irises in June to see the effects of the forced toxicity inside my body and compared them with iris photographs taken prior to the abduction and injections.
My eyes have returned to metal-contaminated gray with lots of tarnished-looking toxins. My irises have not looked like that since the late 1980's, that is, before they changed to blue. It took me over 30 years of hard nutritional exploration to achieve the blue eyes that came with bodily cleanliness.
The following are photos of my left iris from June 2012 and pre-injections of May 2007. I did not take any photos of my irises from May 2007 to the time of forced injections in April 2009.
In the 2012 photo, notice all of the flared and fused grayish white tissue outside the inner circle of the pupil. All of that tissue indicates mass cellular death, organic debris and scarring. My body's cellular life went from about 87% alive to about 73% alive. Although my cellular average is much greater than other people at 65 years of age, a 14% decrease in cellular life in the body is devastating. It will take about another 7 years to reverse that damage.

As I compared my present and past irises, I was very distressed that I am living in a world where some humans have no moral conscience and hurt me for pharmaceutical profits and people-control. They deserve no less than life imprisonment for their crimes.
Here is another person, a journalist Jane Burgermeister, who had 3 attempts on her life for speaking out against the Swine Flu/H1N1 epidemic and vaccine hoax.

   Repeated Surgeries Resulted In Thick Scars; Do I Need Another Surgery?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, hon.ph.d. nutrition
Kathy: Hello Aajonus, I'm scheduled for trachea reconstruction surgery. I don't want to have it, I know my body can heal itself if given the right environment and nutrition.
I had a triple osteotomy 12 years ago on my left hip. During this surgery my trachea was injured when I was intubated. [An iatrogenic problem.] It's a rough bumpy violent looking injury, according to my surgeon. The good thing (according to him) is that the scar tissue is in a single location of around 1/2 - 3/4 inch section below my vocal chords.
I've had 2 bronchoscopes with laser surgery and stretching to open my air passage. The scar tissue always grows back and I'm told it always will. The doctors advise me to have this surgery (trachea reconstruction) to solve the problem once and for all. They would cut out the section of the trachea with the scar tissue and sew the trachea back together, shortening my trachea by about an inch. I would be in ICU a week, mainly in case of swelling.
Today my airway is about half the size of its normal diameter, in the affected area. It's hard to breathe. I can't walk and talk at the same time without getting winded. It's very disabling. I sound like I have emphysema. Phlegm gets caught on the scar tissue and blocks my airway even more or completely, which causes me to cough it away. So it's often hard for me to have conversations, because I'm constantly clearing my throat with a dry sounding cough, or swallowing hard to try and clear it. It's embarrassing.
I'll start talking and it will sound like I'm gurgling. Gross.
I've needed the laser/stretch bronchoscope every 3-4 years to keep my airway open. In between, I have had 1-1.5 years of being disabled physically because of a blocked airway. I always wait as long as I can before having it, but this is bad because I can't exercise like I need and want to. I'm very active, love to windsurf, bike, hike, ski, etc.
In my first laser surgery, I woke during surgery and was very traumatized. When I had the laser surgery, they gave me a paralytic so the reflexes in my throat wouldn't cause damage. The anesthesiologist had to manually control my breathing. The surgeon and anesthesiologist had to take turns with my airway, since laser and oxygen together would create fire in my throat.
I woke [during surgery] and was completely paralyzed and suffocating with no way to tell them. It was extremely painful to feel my body suffocating and traumatizing emotionally. This is another reason I don't want the surgery. I'm afraid for this reason and the obvious reasons of cutting into my breathing passage.
What do you think? I'm up to 3 raw eggs a day, 1/4-1/2 cup of raw honey, I've only had raw meat once, but I'm going to try some recipes. I had sashimi twice last week. I haven't located raw butter or cream yet, but I'll find it asap.
I normally eat mostly raw fruits and vegetables, but have always cooked my meat and eggs. I've never

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 29th Edition - page 5 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
had raw unheated honey until I just read your book. I didn't know! My point is, I already juice daily and eat all organic and I WAS taking LOTS of vitamins, but it sounds like this isn't good, so I've stopped them.
Another thing is, I've been on Nexium for 10 years, 1-2 x daily. I'm trying not to take it. Last night I seared some organic hamburger and ate it mostly raw. I had quite a bit of burning in my esophagus. I don't know how to deal with this. I need help.
Can you help me? I'll eat anything if I can keep it down and if I'm convinced it will heal me. Do you think my body can get rid of the scar tissue somewhat quickly? I need to breathe. It's uncomfortable, I get dizzy a lot, and it's very hard to live like this.
Aajonus: Hi, Kathy, Every time you had surgery, your wound keloided, that is, it grew many layers of uneven scar tissue. One of the main reasons for that is that during and after surgery, medical practitioners swabbed your throat with iodine, Merthiolate and/or Mercurochrome.(the last two are liquid mercury) used as antiseptics. They are not only antiseptic to bacteria, they are antiseptic to live cells and prevent cellular regeneration and division. They poisons cells and your body does not want to dissolve those cells when they die because those contaminated cells would release the poisons again. So the body gradually builds those poisoned cells into scar tissue when they die.
Doctors use those antiseptics because they prevent white blood cells from trying to clean the area damaged by surgery. Normally, during surgery, many cells are killed and the body must dissolve or consume them. Normally, that is the job of the lymphatic system. However, under such a mass cellular destruction as surgery, white blood cells leave the blood stream and enter the fluids in tissues that have been injured. There, the white blood cells consume dead cells but not just red blood cells. When the white blood cells have consumed some industrially toxic or venom contaminated cells, the body throws them off as puss rather than allow them to stay in the body.
Normally, it is the job of white blood cells to eat only dead red blood cells to keep the blood clean of organic waste. When antiseptics like toxic iodine and/or mercury are used, often white blood cells will not try to help the body by eating those surgically
destroyed and poisoned cells, thus preventing cleansing (detoxification) of the area.
With their antiseptics, doctors prevent proper detoxification, preventing the consequential intense swelling and puss that would likely and necessarily occur. The swelling would result in more pain, puss and slow mending of incision(s), complicating medical treatments. With antiseptics, doctors save themselves the tedious task of having to deal with complaining patients. However, patients suffer harmful long-term side effects that could easily lead to cancer. That is, the inability to dissolve dead tissue and instead collect dead cells to form tumors.
Additionally, those antiseptics contaminate surrounding live healthy cells. Those cells cannot reproduce. Because of the medical contamination with antiseptics, those healthy live cells are poisoned and quickly die (compared to normal cellular lifespan).
Since those cells are contaminated, the body cannot easily dissolve them because dissolving them would release those toxins and damage more healthy cells. As the dead cells accumulate, the body has no alternative but to store them, creating tumor(s). Keloidal tissue is a tumor, most often fibroid-like tumor. All tumors are the body's collection of dead cells that it cannot dissolve and discard until the health of the body is significantly improved.
When dead cells collect in the mucous membranes as a tumor, the body tries not to let the tumor get too large. The mucous membranes will create mucus and discard some of the dead cells into the mucus, preventing for as long as possible the building of scar tissue (tumor) to the extent that it blocks the passageway.
Note that dead cells in the mucous membranes do not manufacture mucus; they are dead. Only live mucous membrane cells can create mucus. Therefore, the scar tissue is usually very exposed without mucosalprotection.Often,thatcausesdrycough.
The possible remedy to prevent need for surgery that I suggest is gargling with raw apple cider vinegar diluted by half in fresh liquid whey 3-6 times daily. The exposed dead cells, that is scar tissue/fibroid tumor, will be gradually dissolved and discarded. However, if the mucus members become too sore, please cease the remedy for 24 hours each time excessive soreness occurs.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 29th Edition - page 6 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
Vinegar, whether raw or distilled, strips mucus from the membranes but the distilled causes much destruction and havoc with live cells. Use only the raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.
To ensure that your body makes enough mucus to protect live areas, I suggest that you drink 1-2 milkshakes daily. Milkshake recipes are in my recipe book, The Recipe for Living Without Disease.
Should that remedy not work, you may have to have surgery. If you have surgery, I suggest that you demand that the surgeon only use alcohol as an antiseptic rather than iodine or mercury or any other antiseptic. Also, I suggest that you tell him not to stretch the area, only scrape away the layers of scarring because stretching often causes more scarring, that is, stretch marks. The ideal natural antiseptic is raw lime juice but I do not know if you can convince your surgeon to use lime juice during surgery with his microbe-phobia of raw foods.
Although alcohol can cause a lot of damage, it does not cause long-term toxicity like other antiseptics, especially the poisoning caused by mercury and iodine. I suggest you demand that your surgeon absolutely, under no circumstances use anything as an antiseptic or antibiotic other than lime juice or alcohol on any tissue of your body, inside or out. You would have to put that in writing and have someone video tape the surgery to insure that he does not use iodine or mercury-based antiseptics.
Doctors will often lie like a parent to placate their child, persuading the child to calm and then do what the parent wants. Doctors, like parents, think that they know what is best for the patient. However, most doctors do not have clear discernment or wisdom because of their pharmaceutical indoctrination.
Pre- and post-surgery dietary regime and lifestyle can prevent keloidal tissue from developing after your next surgery, if surgery is necessary after trying vinegar/whey gargles above for 3-4 months.
Subscriber"s question:
If surgery is necessary, I suggest that you allow the surgeon to only scrape the uneven scar tissue and not take a section of your esophagus. A shortened esophagus has caused much pain to patients.
I knew one man that had to take morphine many times daily because of the pain of the stomach pulling on the esophagus. With morphine he could not function and was often depressed. He took medication upon medication for all of the pain caused by his shortened esophagus.
Following surgery, to directly help prevent scarring, I suggest that you gargle with fresh lime juice. If you have to dilute it that is okay but it is more effective undiluted. Also, sipping/licking no- salt raw butter/unheated honey/lime juice mixture from a spoon helps soothe the throat and promote healing without much scarring. The ratio of butter to honey to lime juice I suggest is 4:1:1 respectively.
Raw protein is very necessary to accomplish repair of damaged cells. Most often raw eggs will accomplish that however, most often it is impossible to get perfect eggs because people do not understand the dietary needs of chickens.
Profits prevent them from exploring, experimenting and knowing that chickens are vultures and will consume mostly raw and decaying meats if they have the opportunity. If they do not have meat, they will eat as many worms and insects as possible. If there are hundreds of chickens, there will not be many insects or worms. When desperate, they will eat another chicken.
Chickens are always frantic and panicked when fed grain and processed-food diets. They need meat or insects. Since good chicken is difficult to acquire, it would be better to consume grass-fed meat or ocean wild-caught fish. I give suggested diets for humans on pages 40-41 in my recipe book.
There are other things that I could suggest but I would not know without knowing either your history, or photographing your irises. _______________________________________
Severe Back Deterioration; Can It Be Reversed or Even Helped?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, hon.ph.d. nutrition
Thurston: Tom from Ireland has been quite sick recently. He has 'Ankylosing Spondylitis' which is attacking his back and he's been in a lot of pain and
has restricted movement for the last 6 weeks. [The disease is] particularly focused in his neck and caused a bad headache yesterday that caused his body

to shake for hours.
I thought if he could get bee pollen and raw butter
that might help - also to do hot baths maybe? Anyway, I was hoping you could recommend what would help him. He seems to have a particular sensitivity to calcium that causes his back to get worse.
He's only been partially eating raw food as some raw food is hard to source in Ireland. Through a friend of mine, I have tracked down raw sources of the following in Ireland: 1. Raw butter, 2. Raw milk organic, 3. Raw honey, and 4. Raw meat & eggs are easy. The one thing that we can't seem to get is raw cheese that's unsalted. I assume its better not to use raw cheese that's salted?
I really appreciate all the incredible work you do.
Aajonus: Hi, Thurston,
This problem requires more than a simple dietary
program.
Infections are misinterpreted. Fats and white blood
cells surround, neutralize and consume waste to help eliminate toxins. What results is puss, which is white blood and fatty cells. Puss is not contagious or harmful. With infections, the body tries to prevent several types of damage to cells. In a healthy body, once toxins are isolated and neutralized and/or eliminated, white blood cells may be reabsorbed into the body and continue their work of consuming organic tissue waste. They may even reenter the blood stream. If the white blood cells are damaged, the body will discard the white cells with the toxins bound with fats, in the form of puss. Infections are cleanses, just like colds and flu.
Ninety-nine percent of all bodily activity is produced by bacteria. There are no bad bacteria unless it is man-made. According to the latest biological research, we are 360 bacteria genes to only one human gene. (See article below, How Much Bacteria Are We Today?)
Because of the industrial contaminants in vaccines, food, air and water, such as mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, detergent and at least 60,000 other man-made toxins, many bodies are unabletodischargethosetoxinsthroughskin. Many bodies store them wherever there is enough fat or in the stomach lining. Bone marrow, brain and spine contain the highest concentrations of fats and therefore toxins. As those toxins remain in the body,
they deteriorate the fats that suppress them. If not enough new fats are available to re-harness them, those toxins will begin to deteriorate healthy tissue.
When the body neutralizes most toxins, it will use concentrations of minerals, resulting in mineral collections (deposits) that stiffen a contaminated area. If a good diet is maintained, those mineral deposits will gradually dissolve and normal mobility will be restored. If proper minerals and fats are not supplied, the body will suffer severe cellular damage and mineral deposits will remain. In most cases of Ankylosing Spondylitis, toxins are not harnessed and neutralized so deterioration of vertebrae and mineralization (permanent stiffness) occurs.
Now for nutritional suggestions: Cheese provides minerals for neutralizing toxins and fats to absorb those toxins. Cheese is relatively easy to make, especially very dry cottage cheese. You let the milk separate into curds and whey. Then pour all through a sock made of white organic cotton cloth such as t- shirt material. Let it drip for at least 8 hours but as much as several days until it is fairly dry.
I suggest that Tom eat 1 tsp. cheese every hour, alternating 1/2 tsp. butter, and 1/2 tsp. honey. That is, he would eat 1 teaspoon cheese with 1/2 tsp. butter then one hour later, he would eat 1 tsp. cheese with 1/2 tsp. honey, continuing that rotation throughout day and night (when awake).
10 minutes after eating the cheese with its accompaniment every hour, I suggest that Tom consume 1-2 eggs.
15 minutes following every egg-consumption, I suggest 1-2 T. pain formula. Here is the pain formula I suggest for Tom: 3 eggs, 4 1/2 T. butter, 1 1/2 tsp. coconut cream, 3 T. milk, 1 1/2 T. lemon juice, 1 T. honey and 2 T. cheese.
Once daily whenever he wants, I suggest Tom consume 1 cup either chicken or fish with 1/4 cup boiled rice with its liquid and 2 T. butter. Forgo raw eggs and pain formula for that hour.
I may not have to write this but, all the above listed foods are to be eaten without salt, and unheated except for rice.
To relieve tension and pain in the spine and back, I suggestthefollowingthreeyogapostures.They should be attempted 2-5 times daily AFTER applying hot-water bottles to painful areas of the back for 30 minutes, or after 30 minutes in hot bath: Plow, and Spinal Twists.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 29th Edition - page 4 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
The spinal twists may be done while lying on bed or floor as follows: lie on right side of body, keeping right leg completely stretched and straight while bending left leg at knee and move left foot to press flat against right shin just below right knee. Now move the left shoulder and arm behind the back, that is twisting the shoulder backward. Try to keep left knee pressing onto the bed (or floor) while trying to press left shoulder and arm onto bed or floor. For the ideal twist, the upper back at the shoulders should be
flat on the bed or floor and the left knee flat on the bed or floor in front of the body.
Then reverse sides to stretch the back in the other direction. Try to maintain each posture for at least 3 minutes each time.

Thirty years ago, mico-biologists believed that humans were composed of about half bacteria. They were in total denial about the good of all bacteria, including E.coli. However, Sara Arab, a student at the University of Toronto, Canada discovered nearly 30 years ago that the biological waste of E.coli dissolved human brain tumors in about 5 days.
Since her work was a threat to standard pharma/medical cancer-protocol, her work was cursorily pursued and quietly dismissed as ineffective. However, it was very effective. The reason it was rejected is that the trillions of dollars profited from cancer treatments and side-effects would disappear if they utilized Dr. Arab's bacteria methods.
Such work would also undermine medical procedures altogether. Bacteria would be seen completely as beneficial to humans rather than a threat. All of the nonsense about bacterial food- poisoning in raw food would prove ridiculous. All governmental health departments would have to focus on the real cause of incidents of food- poisoning, that is industrial chemical contamination.
So that everyone will have a clear understanding of the nature of bacteria regarding food, I give you the following experiment that has been performed several times but is relatively unpublished. It is mostly unpublished because it would undermine millions of health department employees, big pharma and big med.
When you introduce naturally occurring strains of bacteria such as E.coli 157:H7, salmonella, Listeria monocytogenes, Campylobacter jejuni, Staphylococcus, and mycobacterium species into raw
milk, they do not proliferate. Not only do they not proliferate, they die in raw milk.
However, when you introduce those bacteria into pasteurized and/or homogenized milks, those bacteria proliferate within hours. That proves all of the reports declaring raw milk is inherently dangerous is nonsense and unscientific. It also proves that pasteurized milk is inherently dangerous.
Think about it. The bacteria proliferated in pasteurized milk because the biology of milk was killed by pasteurization. The janitorial bacteria listed above that is accused of being disease-causing (pathogenic) is simply doing its ecological job of breaking down and recylcing the damaged biology of pasteurized milk.
Ten years ago, a microbiologist named Bonnie Brassler revealed that we were at least 99% bacteria and only 1% human. http://www.ted.com/talks/bonnie_bassler_on_how_b acteria_communicate.html
Yet, she continued to believe the false rhetoric that there are naturally occurring bad bacteria that can cause disease and even cause raw-food poisoning. She did not realize that there are NO naturally- occurring bad bacteria.
Microbiologists ten years ago and today still were/are so brainwashed that they did/do not conclude that certain bacteria that are responsible for disassembling matter were and are good. The bacteria that disassemble dead or contaminated matter are ecological janitors. They are not pathogenic. They do not disassemble healthy tissue. Microbiologists need to categorize those bacteria as janitorial rather than pathogenic.

About 2.5 years ago, a gastro-enterologist estimated that we are 150 bacterial genes to every one human gene. Digestion had become 99.5% bacterial and only one percent human digestive juices. That is, our digestive juices, such as hydrochloric acid and bile were about 99.5% bacteria. Digestive juices reduce large food particles to small molecules for intestinal parasites and bacteria to consume. He was finally able to see that bacteria is almost everything and that without bacteria, we would not exist.
Digestive bacteria can be considered bacteria that disassemble. They disassemble food by consuming it. Their waste is our food, that is, their feces, urine and perspiration are our nutrients. Consider that kefir and yogurt are milk thick with bacterial feces, urine and perspiration that will nutrify the drinker quickly and efficiently with little or no work for the drinkers digestive bacteria.
Those bacteria in the milks we call kefir and yogurt consumed the milk similar to the way our intestinal bacteria and parasites consume food in our intestines, saving us time and energy in digestion. They are beneficial to good health although they are not the same food-disassembling bacteria as in our

Two weeks ago, we were updated with the fact that we are 360 bacterial genes to one human gene. That means that as of May 2012, we are only 2/100% human and 99.997333% bacteria. <www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomeprj/43021?report=H MP> All human cells are predominantly bacteria. We are bacterial in nature and fact. The idea that any disassembling natural bacteria can take over our bodies is ludicrous unless we were hit by a train and mangled. The idea that any strain of disassembling natural bacteria can take over all of the other bacteria in our bodies and cause our bodies disease is absurd.
Is it about time we stop this bacterial nonsense and realize that all diseases originate from industrial chemicals, including cooking food, not biological?
As long as we control the quality of the food and lifestyles we choose, we can prevent diseases in ourselves.

I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

How Do Our Bodies Function In Regards To Thyroid, Digestion, and Blood-Sugar, As
Seen Through A Case Study Of Thyroid Cancer?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, hon.ph.d. nutrition
   Debra: Hi Aajonus. This past year for me has been very, very stressful due to my husband leaving his job and starting a new business, and we moved twice with two young children. Also two deaths and a divorce in our family, and my Mom's downward spiral with her health. So enormous stress this past year or so.
I seem to have gone through a Hoshimotos Thyroiditis autoimmune attack. My TSH had climbed through the year up to 10 (should be less than 4.0). I have been having generalized achy feelings and sore throat / achiness at thyroid area, which goes with thyroiditis. I was also diagnosed with thyroid cancer almost 7 years ago. I never did any Western treatment (refused the surgery they recommended to remove my thyroid). I am only doing natural healing, mostly using my diet.
I have to admit that I haven't been following the diet you suggested this past year in the exact way you
had recommended. This was because of all of the changes from moving and stress in my family. I stopped making myself the priority yet I have not been consuming junk food of any kind and avoid all sugar. I have mostly been eating what you recommended but often missing juices and not getting the order of things or not always doing everything you suggested.
By this past summer I was more and more not following your recommended diet. I have two young children and a very busy house and found it too hard to do everything. I also wanted the comfort of warm food during all of the stress. I am always organic and careful not to eat junk. When I have cooked I try to eat things more raw still, but warmed or partly cooked.
After European Thermography showed that I have an insulin problem, I did a fasting-insulin level test with my last thyroid labs. The result was 8.8. From

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 30th Edition - page 2 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
what I have read and learned it should really be around 3.0. I wondered if too much raw honey could contribute to any problem here. I was sloppy, over- estimating with the measuring and probably eating more raw honey than I should be. I have also learned that auto-immune (Hoshimotos Thyroiditis) can also cause an attack on insulin receptors and lead to insulin problems and Diabetes Type 1. I am concerned that I could be attacking these receptors from the auto-immune process.
I also have had mid-upper abdominal aches / discomfort. I read that the auto-immune can also attack the parietal cells in the stomach and cause stomach aches. I couldn't really perceive exactly what organ was the location of the discomfort.
I grew up on constant Penicillin due to a dog that was a strep throat carrier and gave me strep throat very frequently. I now wonder if I have a leaky gut that is still not healed. I have read that there is a very strong correlation of leaky gut and all auto-immune illnesses.
With you away for so long in Asia, and because I wasn't feeling great and my labs weren't good, I recently met someone new locally who did some testing on me and found me to be allergic to eggs and dairy, as well as whey. This would severely interfere with your suggested diet.
This is based on specific immunoglobulins showing up after exposure to each of these potential antigens. I am told this is a newer test and much more accurate than any of the tests from the past. This testing was done by Cyrex Laboratories. (www.cyrexlabs.com <http://www.cyrexlabs.com>).
The testing was due to my complaints of a lot of achiness lately and my labs with a large increase in TSH. The question was, am I reactive to gluten (which I don't eat anyway and any other foods when there is leaky gut, such as egg, cow's milk, casein, and whey?
It has been recommended that I stop eggs and dairy (including whey), as I could be reacting to them with a constant inflammatory response. This could be a problem for my immune system and be aggravating the auto-immune Hoshimotos.
I have never asked you if you have direct experience seeing thyroid cancer and/or Hoshimotos Thyroiditis heal before? Also how much do you understand about leaky gut and auto-immune? (Which I hear are very intimately connected).
This has created great confusion for me about what to do with my diet. I have come much more off of your diet over the past couple of months due to this information. But, I have really wanted to talk to you and get your input and come see you again.
I would like your opinion whether I should make any changes or continue with the diet you suggest originally April 2010. I last saw you in New Jersey in early May 2011 and at that time you suggested that I was doing well and should continue on the original diet plan.
*_The Diet:_*
*Start day with 1 tbsp raw cheese, wait 10 min and have 1 raw egg, wait 5 min and have another raw egg, wait 5 min and have 8 oz juice with a raw egg and little cream added in, wait 50 min have 1 tbsp raw cheese.
Wait 10 min have 1/2 cup raw white meat and 1/2 cup raw red meat.
*/*/Wait 30 min and have 2 tsp raw cheese with some raw honey on it./*/*
For lunch have 1/2 C pineapple pureed with coconut and dairy cream every other day and rotate with 1/2 C. raspberries with coconut and dairy cream every other day. One day / week eat papaya custard.
Put some shredded raw cheese on whatever fruit I am eating. Have raw cheese all through the day (every 15 min or so) - little nibbles. Have next juice either before dinner or at bedtime. If at bedtime add raw egg to it (same way as earlier). For dinner repeat 1/2 C white meat and 1/2 C red meat. *//**/
*/Wait 30 min and have 2 tsp raw cheese with some raw honey on it./*
/* I sipped on raw milk through the day or more often everyday had your Sport Formula (3/4 C pureed tomato; 3/4 C pureed cucumber; 1 C whey; 1 1/2 tbsp coconut cream; 2 tbsp dairy cream; 1 tbsp lemon juice; 1 tsp lime juice; 1 1/2 tbsp apple cider vinegar; 1 1/2 tbsp raw honey; 1 raw egg; raw ginger root). */
So this is what I did very accurately for a little over a year (though I didn't usually have white and red meat at every meal) and I was too full on this diet and ate the amount that felt right, which was less than a full cup of meat you suggested at my two meat meals. It is over the past year that I wasn't doing as good a job sticking to your suggested diet accurately and going down hill.
  
 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 30th Edition - page 3 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
My weight was up to 141 lbs a couple of months ago (up from original weight right before I first saw you of 110 lbs). In the past two months off of your diet, my weight has fallen to 130 lbs. I am 5 feet 1 1/2 inches tall.
My periods had been irregular for a good year now. Female hormones levels show low proges- terone and otherwise normal. I have missed my period for 3 months now. I am 50 years old.
I am scheduled for a thyroid ultrasound on 10/30th to re-check the thyroid nodules (diagnosed as papillary carcinoma by fine needle aspiration in 11/2005). I have had 16mm one on right side and 6mm one on left side. The one on the right side had been getting smaller prior to my last ultrasound (done 2 years ago).
So - without having seen me in over a year, what would your thoughts be and what would you suggest? *_What are your thoughts in regard to: 1) your experience with thyroid cancer & Hoshimotos Thyroiditis (auto-immune);
2) Leaky gut?
3) Do I need fermented foods with better bacterial balance in the gut to heal leaky gut? How do I heal intestinal lining?
4) The lab's results show that I have allergy to egg; dairy; and whey.
5) My symptoms of burning / achiness in throat especially thyroid area; more tired; not sleeping well all of the time; general body achiness. 6) My thyroid labs results show TSH up from 2 -3 up to 10.0 but has started to come down, most recent down to 6.3.
7) Fasting Insulin level is high at 8.8 and why I would be developing an insulin resistance after being on your suggested diet for over a year?
8) Female hormones levels normal except low progesterone. I have missed my period for 3 months in a row now.
9) What should I do about my diet, including allergies to egg, cow's milk, and whey?
Thank you so much for your input on this Aajonus! I have missed seeing you and would have just stuck with you and come for an apt, but when you were so far away for so long, I felt uncomfortable with everything and just started to see the local person. I have felt confused what to do. I needtogainconfidenceagainonwhatwouldbebest. Thanks!!!
Aajonus: Hi, Debra. I suggest that you read my books and watch my DVDs many times so that you will understand how your body truly functions healthfully rather than the way pharma/medicine wants you to believe your body malfunctions. Also, I hope that you realize that your downward-spiraling health directly coincides with your fall from your body's dietary needs because of your time-constraints and stress.
I wrote my books to give everybody the knowledge to be able to take care of their bodies without outer guidance. I know that it takes many years to understand the body enough to feel confident about health choices and 2 years is usually not enough time when applying the diet fully. I can always be contacted by email if not by phone. Please contact me when you need help.
Firstly, the easiest way to follow any diet properly is to prepare the foods for the entire day in the first hour of your day before children are awake and demanding. That first hour should be yours to eat the foods necessary to begin your day healthfully, and to prepare foods for the day. Usually, within 4 weeks on all dietary programs that I suggest, people are able to prepare the entire day's foods in 40-45 minutes except on days when they need to juice. It is a relief that we can juice once every 4-5 days and keep the juices relatively fresh for 4-5 days if prepared as I suggest in my books and recipe DVD.
Secondly, there is no such thing as an autoimmune disease except in theory and shoddy scientific support. With that theory, the pharma/medical industries terrorize people into believing that our bodies are stupid, to be feared and attack rather than nurture themselves.
We must objectively see that even with all of the toxic abuse to which we subject our bodies, they seem to rebound 95% of the time. That shows that our bodies are filled with great intelligence and unrestrained love rather than vengeance at our abuses.
Thirdly, our bodies will use cleansing bacteria, parasites, fungus and/or virus to dissolve industrially contaminated cells/tissue. They are termed infections. The industrial toxins are the invaders, infecting the body. Calling our janitorial bacteria, parasites, fungus and virus our enemies turns us against our cleansing and healing processes. That only benefits the pharma/medical industrial complex. Our janitors are

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 30th Edition - page 4 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
part of the cure. They are not the causes of diseases as pharma/medicine has people believing.
When we have caustic industrial chemicals in thyroid cells, from time to time, our bodies will try to remove those poisons and the cells they have damaged, crippled or killed. The TSH levels will increase proportionate to the toxic cells being dissolved and waste discarded. Realistically, the body is not attacking itself. It is merely trying to improve its localized and overall health by removing poisons and the contaminated cells. We should embrace infections (cleansings) and nurture our bodies' cleansing-processes rather than fear them, and not panic when they occur.
In the last 30 years, I have suggested diets for several people (12?) diagnosed with so-called autoimmune thyroid disease (Hoshimoto). None have died from it and all have improved considerably. Most are completely asymptomatic. The foods I suggested provided the nutrients their bodies needed to gradually cleanse and heal.
Fourthly, all allergen tests are performed in a laboratory (not in our bodies) with proteins processed from the foods tested on our chemistry, I reiterate, removed from our bodies. When eating a raw diet, we do not eat altered proteins that cause most allergies, unless we eat genetically modified (GM) foods or foods contaminated with agricultural industrial chemicals.
Allergen-tests are performed with processed, altered proteins. Very frequently, the tests will give positive allergic reactions because of the processed, altered proteins. Raw proteins are not altered as those used in the tests. As I stated above, we will not have allergies to raw non-GM non-industrial-chemical- contaminated proteins. The implication that those tests apply to raw food is another measurement-trap convincing us that our bodies are stupidly hurting themselves. The conclusion drawn from that trap is that we need some magic bullet, some supplement, homeopathic or pharmaceutical drug. THOSE SUBSTANCES ARE NOT FOOD. They are all processed with laboratory industrial chemicals, even if called natural and derived from foods.
Most people eating cooked and processed foods will have varying degrees of allergies to cooked and processed proteins similar to those used in allergen tests. Stated in another way, those tests do not reflect what occurs in natural circumstances inside our bodies on a raw Primal Diet® regimen.
Leaky Gut and Crohn's Disease
I have assisted over 2,000 people with leaky gut. Crohn's Disease is an advanced case of leaky gut.
Intestinal health is greatly dependent on mucus. Mucus is of paramount importance to protecting intestinal walls from being eroded by normal digestive activity, that is, normal acidic digestive bacteria and acidic enzymes (digestive juices). Mucus is so important to intestinal walls, that intestinal walls are called mucous membranes.
When mucus is not enough or is too thin, intestinal walls are gradually deteriorated. As deterioration occurs, intestinal walls become thin and weak. Sometimes they become very irritated, causing inflammation. Inflammation is an increased blood flow and resultant swelling and fever. Both swelling and fever are necessary for properly cleansing and healing.
In such a weakened intestinal state, eating too much at once or eating foods that have a tendency to collect and bulk will tear weak and thin intestinal walls. Frequently where tears in the intestinal walls occur, undigested food passes through the tears and into the gut outside of the digestive tract. That is "leaky gut".
Our bodies must move those undigested food particles to as safe a location as possible to complete the digestion of those particles. If they remain in the body as undigested particles they can cause serious disease including severe necrosis and death.
Our bodies choose one of two areas to store undigested food particles that pass through intestinal walls: either in fat deposits or in joints. In fat deposits, the body can store it for decades without much bother except excessive weight and size gains. In cartilage, because cartilage are very resilient tissue that can withstand highly acidic environments, our bodies can digest those undigested particles.
However, food was not meant to be digested at joints, thus gradual deterioration of cartilage usually occurs. The first symptoms are joint pains. Then swelling may occur as deterioration continues, such as in Crohn's Disease. Or massive cartilage deterioration occurs wherein all cartilage disappears, such as osteoarthritis. Ninety-percent of arthritis is caused by leaky gut, not bacteria. Other causes of arthritis are caustic toxins stored in joints, such as from vaccines and industrial agriculture and food- processing chemicals.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 30th Edition - page 5 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
The form of bacteria that is found in arthritis is actually a form of bacteria used to digest the undigested food particles and damaged cartilage, not breakdown and digest healthy cartilage-cells. However, the joint-area digestive-process simul- taneously gradually erodes the cartilage to varying degrees.
However, poor mucous production is the cause of leaky gut, and leaky gut is the problem in most cases of arthritis. The simple cure is to eat the raw foods that help the body produce lots of mucus quickly and constantly. Remedy the cause first and foremost along with localized remedies.
At this point, we must ask, “What causes poor mucous production?” As all functions of our bodies are 99% dependent upon bacteria, bacteria in the intestinal walls helps mucus-production. Antibiotics and other industrial chemicals damage those bacteria as well as digestive bacteria, drastically reducing mucous formation and digestive abilities.
Extensive antibiotics use is the main cause of rapid development of leaky gut in fetuses and children, as well as adults. It is very common in our toxic environment, especially in certain toxic cities, and states where agricultural poisons are heavily used.
To illustrate the severe harm that antibiotics do, a 5-days' regimen of antibiotics destroys 1% of all bodily functions. That is, an entire 1% of our body's ability to function digestively, muscularly, and neurologically are destroyed.
If we eat a perfect diet, such as my Primal Diet®, our bodies can regain/restore approximately 1.5-2.5% of lost bodily functions per year. On standard diets, the body does not recover. On standard diets, the body borrows from other parts of itself to strengthen the damaged areas but at the same time this borrowing weakens the once stronger areas.
Gradually though years on standard diets, our bodily functions reduce to the extent that we shrink in height from bone and cartilage deterioration, and we reduce in physical and mental agility and endurance. In children and fetuses, antibiotics often cause genetic damage, forever destroying proper digestion when consuming standard diets.
(See "According To Medical Research, We Cannot Grow In Height After Age 21 But We Will Shrink. Can We Grow In Height On The Primal Diet® After Age 21?" article in this issue.)
Remedies For Leaky Gut
Reducing intestinal work is paramount. By reducing intestinal work, the body can focus more on cleansing and healing intestines instead of digestion, that is, instead of spending nutrients and energy synthesizing digestive juices. To simplify digestive activity for easy understanding, consider that 90% of digestion should be bacterial.
Bacteria eat the food we eat and their waste is our nutrition, absorbed and utilized through intestines and the lacteal system. The lacteal system is a webbed network connected to intestines that completes the digestive process.
When we have large food particles in our stomach and intestines, our stomach and intestinal walls must synthesize digestive juices such as hydrochloric acids to dissolve the large particles. Once the large particles are dissolved into a soup by digestive juices, intestinal bacteria can consume the food we have eaten by 100%, nutrifying our body easily.
Therefore, eating liquid food is paramount. Raw milk and raw eggs are ideal foods for leaky gut because they are liquid and require only intestinal bacteria to digest them. In fact, raw milk and raw eggs are resplendent with bacteria that help our intestinal bacteria digest. The bacteria in those foods are helpful not harmful. The only time that bacteria appear to be harmful is in contorted laboratory tests that do not reflect how the body truly digests and utilizes those bacteria.
Since raw meat is very necessary to restoring and healing as quickly as possible, raw meat is necessary for any ill condition. However, we have to take precautions to prepare meats in certain ways for particular health conditions. When meats are relatively whole as partially chewed chunks, the chunks are bulky and can collect in a particular intestinal section. As mentioned above, collected chunks can cause tears in weak and thin intestinal walls, and/or cause meat to be only partially digested, thereby not getting the benefits of eating it.
A lot of digestive acids are necessary to dissolve meats into a soup for the digestive bacteria to properly digest meats. For meats to be nearly 100% digested, meats must be cut into 1-inch cubes and then pate'd in a food-processor.
I suggest that people suffering leaky gut eat lots of whole raw eggs from chickens that are fed meat scraps, crushed raw bones, worms (maggots) and

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 30th Edition - page 6 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
fermented dairy. Eggs are the most easily digested food. Because they are already liquid and contain lots of quick-reproducing bacteria, eggs digest in about 30 minutes.
Although liquid, one cup of raw milk still requires about 6-10 hours to completely digest. Eggs and milk provide nutrients for the body to produce necessary mucus. Milkshakes (raw milk, raw eggs and unheated honey blended together) help build the mucus necessary to protect and heal stomach and intestinal linings quickly.
However, the digestive tract may be so compromised that a person may get cramps from drinking milkshakes. If continual cramps occur, it would be best to sip milkshake all day long. I suggest sipping on a quart of milkshake throughout each day but taking a break from milkshakes one day of every 12 days. If there is too much suffering when drinking milkshakes, then consuming many raw eggs by themselves and sipping raw milk separately is a preferable solution throughout each day.
Another important solution to poor digestion is consuming small amounts (1/2-1 tsp.) of no-salt raw cheeses every 30-45 minutes. The small amounts of raw cheeses absorb the toxins that gradually accumulated in and around stomach and intestinal walls like a sponge. Eating the cheese frequently prevents the toxins from entering food that will be digested. It will prevent our bodies from recycling the toxins with our food.
Because all dried foods are bio-active-enzyme deficient, they are difficult to digest. The body has to borrow enzymes from other areas to digest dried foods or allow them to pass through the digestive tract without digestion. No-salt raw cheeses will pass through our intestines relatively undigested. Since raw cheeses absorb toxins inside stomach and intestines and will not be digested, we can use raw cheese as a marvelous remedy to remove toxins from contaminated stomachs and intestines.
Fermented foods are not good for leaky gut until there is enough mucus covering mucus membranes. Fermentation tends to thin mucus, the opposite of what is needed in leaky-gut conditions.
Your thyroid is not your problem. The industrial chemicals stored in it are the problem. Remember 2 things:
1) Your lymphatic system is principally responsible for dissolving, sorting, recycling reusable substances and discharging waste and toxins. Our necks contain
one of three major networks of lymphatic glands. We should expect toxins to accumulate in the neck on toxic diets and lifestyles. We should expect that we will have symptoms for 40 years on a perfect diet to remove all of the toxins ingested, injected and inhaled from our industrially toxic world.
2) It is a fact that our bodies ALWAYS act beneficially toward our better health whether we feed our bodies the proper nutrients or not. When we give our bodies the proper nutrients and take long hot baths daily to remove waste and toxins, our bodies act most efficiently toward better health.
Aches and stiffness are caused by accumulations of waste stored in the tissues, usually muscles and tendons. Waste collected in muscles and tendons results from congested lymphatic system and blockages in pores. Long hot baths (between 105- 110F.) gradually helps relieve those symptoms. Mixing about 1-2 tsp. raw apple cider vinegar with 2 ounces raw milk and 2 ounces of whey 2-3 times daily can help remove accumulations from the muscles, and very gradually from tendons.
Your TSH will fluctuate. When your body is removing toxins from your neck, lungs and heart, your TSH will elevate. That is a cleansing process. Do you think that you should arrest the cleansing process?
There is no fasting-test that will measure whether your blood-sugar levels are proper. Blood-sugar levels vary considerably depending on how much is needed in the body for the activities being performed by the whole body. When your body is not involved in cleansing processes, the blood-sugar levels can soar without any ill effects.
The only measure of poor blood-sugar levels is whether you can function or not. If you literally cannot stand after lying or sitting for awhile, if you get extremely disoriented even after eating, and if breathing is all of the energy you can produce, you have a low blood-sugar problem that could be insulin-related.
If you are able to get out of bed, literally, after a night’s sleep, you do not have an insulin/glycogen problem. The fasting/insulin test is simply another trap to get people addicted to insulin or other drugs. Consider that you do not have a blood-sugar level problem unless you have the symptoms I stated in the preceding paragraph.
Hormone levels will fluctuate with nutrition and toxicity levels. Because hormones are predominantly

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 30th Edition - page 7 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
fat, our bodies often use hormones to bind with toxins to neutralize those toxins. It is another method our bodies use to promote and manifest better health. The pharma/med world wants you to be addicted to hormone supplements/medication or drugs that lower hormone levels. They do not profit if you get healthy.
I suggest that you enjoy our God-given raw dairy, raw eggs and unheated honey. They are the most easily digested, absorbed and utilized foods on this planet. How do you think all infant mammals grow
so fast? When the body is growing and/or healing, tiredness should be expected. Just like a baby, our bodies need to eat and sleep or nap often (even if for only 10 minutes).
Consider that excess fat is very necessary for protecting the body from toxins stored within itself and those entering it. Your excess weight is very beneficial, measurably reducing symptoms.

When my father reached complete growth maturity, his standing height was 5'6". I remember when he was 64 years of age, he stated that gravity had shrunk him almost 2" since when he had entered college. At his death at 92.6 years of age, he was 5'1.5". He shrunk 4.5" in the last 73 years of his life. My mother's standing height was 5'4.1" when she completed growth maturity. At her death at 91.7 years of age, she was 4'11.5". She shrunk 4.6" in the last 71 years of her life.
My standing height at growth maturity was 5'7.6". One year after radiation and chemo treatments at 22 years of age, my standing height was 5'6.9". The medical cancer treatments/poisoning caused a half-

Although most of that gain was recovery from medical-treatment-related deterioration, I regained it plus .2".
I believe that the scientific theory that EVERYONE shrinks through her/his lifetime due to the constant force of gravity on the body applies to people eating foods that fail to supply complete nutrition. It is not gravity that causes people to shrink but poor nutrition.

Death comes seldomly in my work. I consider death only 2-3 times yearly in my several hundred clients who are over 60 years of age when most deaths are expected. My mind views any death prior to at least age 138 as a premature death.
I arrived at that figure because all creatures in nature live 7 times the time that it takes them to finish maturity. For humans, that is 147 years. I substract about a decade because I do not have any record of anyone living longer than 138.
When anyone who comes to me that dies before 138 years of age, I constantly think about what more I could have done to delay death by and while restoring health. Also, I always consider if a premature death was as peaceful as possible. I want toknowallthatIcan.IwanttohelpasmuchasI can. I want to discover new natural ways to help endlessly.
Most medical doctors must consider one or
two deaths weekly from all ages because of the toxically harmful treatments they are forced to administer. Especially oncologists, who are forced by law to cut, burn and poison their cancer patients.
Medical doctors might be aware of a patient if they pay attention and/or truly care about any one patient. Almost completely, they focus not on their patients but the patients’ medical charts full of pharmaceutical’s pseudo-scientific jargon about their patient’s state of health. Most medical tests are designed to promote continuous treatments, not to promote good health.
Medical doctors' blinders are so tight that they are numbed and some even ignorant of the premature deaths they cause. They are focused on three issues: 1) prescribing drugs as mandated by the medical procedural manuals that are financed by big pharma, 2) financial and career statuses, emulating their master the pharmaceutical empire, and 3) keeping

 their licenses to practice by doing what is designated by medical law. There are a handful of medical doctors who battle against the pharma-goliath, such as Drs. James Privitera, Stanislaw Burzynski and Joseph Mercola.
However, even though they are crusaders striving for better treatments for patients, they still believe the basic fallacies about how our bodies behave and function, especially believing that supplements are magic bullets. It is the same business as pharmaceuticals selling harmful so-called medical magic potions.
(To better understand how our bodies function, I suggest that you watch and listen to the Primal Diet® Workshop DVD set.)
Medical doctors are forced by law to administer only those treatments that are acceptable to the body of law that was established and is
maintained by the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceuticals movement to outlaw healing and curing therapies was begun in full-force and funded in the USA by the Rockefellers and Carnegies in the late 1890’s after honoring the non-biochemist, non- medical doctor, crystal observer Louis Pasteur. If Mr. Pasteur had worked all of his life with people sick with industrial pollution, probably he would not have been so duped by the medical profession using his work to prove that microbes caused disease. Rather than explore that history herein, I leave it to your curiosity to research.
However, separation of a person from her or his loved ones is a difficult emotional fait a compli. First, let’s begin this issue with life.

 Journalism honored the oldest-known new dad of 96-years young when the Sun Times of India published a brief story about the birth of the man's second son in 2012. I waited and watched for the story to be carried by mass media. It has been 2 months since the first report in October 2012 and I found only 2 published stories about it. With all of the trite stories publish, why wasn't this important one published every where?
Are we indoctrinated to believe that since it is a rare incidence, we should not expect to accomplish the same degree of health nor should we even look
into it? Or was the story discarded because the truth could begin a ruinous trend to medical/pharma, food- processing, supplements, supermarkets and the HHS, USDA, CDC and FDA?
This “elder” man’s and wife's, by our standards, abilities to produce a healthy child holds many clues to truth about health and health independence. Due to so many “health”-minded alternative practitioners, as well as the unscientifically based FDA- and CDC- rhetoric shouted by mass media and parroted by the masses that raw milk is innately dangerous, this documentation is at least revealing and inspirational.
Does Raw Milk Do A Body Good?

 The 96-years-young new dad Ramjeet Raghav lives in India with his 52-years-young wife Shakuntala Devi. He is a farmhand who works long and hard days in the hot and sunny fields. Two years ago, he became the “World’s Oldest New Dad” when his wife gave birth to their first son when Mr. Raghave was 94-years young. The birth of his second son two years later reaffirmed his title.
Ramjeet said to a reporter, "I think it's very important for a husband and a wife to have sex regularly and when she asks I will go on all night...” He lives on a diet of raw milk, raw butter and almonds.
The few people I have known who lived their entire lives eating raw milk and raw butter maintain abilities throughout their lives that few glean. Here we have a man who lives mainly and merely on 3 foods, raw milk, raw butter and raw almonds. What does that say about the food-industry-owned USDA’s food pyramid?
The simplicity of such a diet appeals to me still but I was energetically unsatisfied when I tried the diet of raw milk, raw butter and raw nuts for over one year. I was unable to achieve the vigor Ramjeet does. However, it kept me vital and young-feeling and looking.
I had to consider that I was raised in a toxic industrial world on a toxic diet. If I had been raised as Ramjeet, maybe I could live my life on such a diet. My experiences have taught me that I cannot live on such a diet when living in a toxic body in a toxic industrial world. The same is true when I lived in temperate and cold climates. I must have meat; eggs are a bonus.
I have lived on raw milk and raw butter with half the meat I normally eat when in tropical and industry-free environments like Mr. Raghav does. If I do not have raw milk and raw butter, I must eat much more raw meat.
When I cannot get raw dairy, I acquire medium ripe coconuts and scrape the meat from the coconut shell. Then, I blend it with the coconut
water. That smooth milk-looking mixture gives me some of the same pleasurable, soothing and calming properties of raw milk and butter. It serves somewhat as a raw diary substitute but not completely.
Nothing in all of my dietary exploration with myself and 98% of the people with whom I have worked has prospered more toward better health than with truly organic raw dairy with its many health- supplying nutrients. The evidence of its efficacy is the fact that the world’s oldest new father of 96 years remains active in work and sex while living mainly on raw dairy. Is he an exception to the rule? Yes but the rule is that mostly, people consume cooked and processed foods.
Empirical evidence in hundreds of thousands of testimonials proves that organic raw dairy supplies our bodies with vital nutrients not available in industrially-processed dairy. Thousands of so-called "at risk" people have reversed their conditions that placed them in the "at risk" categories by consuming raw dairy, including me.
There have been occasions when I and others have reacted with bloating and discomfort when eating dairy. Some people have eaten raw dairy without such symptoms for up to 10 years. Such symptoms are not a response to the dairy. It is not a newly formed allergy to dairy.
I found such symptoms to be a stomach and/or intestinal detoxification wherein the body uses its minerals in dairy to bind and harness toxins in stomach and intestinal walls. I suggest that when such symptoms occur, consumption of milk be reduced but not completely avoided. Those nutrients are needed, especially no-salt raw cheese with its concentrated minerals and raw butter with its healing fats. There have been times that I did not consume dairy because of such symptoms. However, to achieve the strength and endurance I want, I had to eat a lot more raw meat when I did not have raw diary.

Needles Of Disease and Death Continue In The Name Of Saving Children
by aajonus vonderplanitz, hon. ph.d. nutrition
On Halloween, I received the most alarming that kills innocent children. I received it in a letter terrorist threat to existence - next to military wars - from Care2 organization that read, “This Halloween

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 31st Edition - page 4 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 season, we're haunted by a completely preventable disease - polio. Most of us have never witnessed the crippling effects of polio, but the fight isn't over. Polio is still endemic in three of the world's most difficult countries - Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan.
“This is the scary truth: levels of polio are at an all-time low, but polio anywhere remains a threat to children everywhere. Eradication is within reach, but we need your help. In fact, if we don't end polio now, it could result in as many as 200,000 new cases every year.
“The United Nations Foundation's Shot@Life campaign needs you to help reach their goal of $40,000 - enough to vaccinate 40,000 children - by Halloween. We're almost there!
“It costs less than $1 to vaccinate a child against polio - that's less than the cost of downloading a song on iTunes. Do your part to end polio by donating $50 to vaccinate 50 children against polio and give them a shot at a healthy life...Let's scare away this disease once and for all!”
In the name of saving children’s lives, it begs for donations to jab poor mostly unwilling children with harmful toxins that include liquid mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, detergent(s), ethyl ether, MSG and a myriad of other toxic additives promoted as a cure for polio. It completely misstates the facts about polio, fails to warn against toxic side effects of the vaccine and never mentions causes of polio. It lies about the cost of each vaccine for each child; the cost of manufacturing and distributing one vaccine is more than $4. It does not consider the cost of preparing and injecting those harmful chemicals into a child.
What Are Vaccines?
Firstly, vaccines are aimed at viral diseases. Viral diseases are ones that cannot be blamed on microbes such as bacteria, parasites or fungus because there is nothing alive in viral “diseases”. Viral diseases are identified by the specific type of tissue dissolved not by a microbe.
Certain bacteria, parasites and fungus are our cellular-waste janitors. They eat organic cellular debris the way white blood cells eat dead red blood cells to keep the blood clean and efficient. It is misleading that our janitorial microbes are called
pathogens. Only in unnatural environments can they seem to cause the degeneration of tissue called disease.
Animal cells in a petri dish, test tube, or other artificial environment/fluids are not biologically equipped to thrive outside of animal’s bodies. They can be forced to live in artificial environments with certain chemicals but that is not the natural state of life. All cells in artificial environments lose homeostasis and begin to degenerate. Of course, in such artificial environments, the cell’s janitorial microbes will become prominent and try to consume all of the waste, which is all that exists in an artificial environment. Try to keep a body part that is no longer connected to the body alive and see what happens.
Laboratory technicians point to the microbial janitors and say that they are causing the demise of the tissue. It is the artificial environment that has caused the degeneration, not the natural janitors. The janitors are not responsible for the waste and mess that they must clean, the artificial environment and the contaminated environment is responsible.
As I have explained many times, when viruses are identified, the matter being identified is particular dissolved cells by some kind of solvent. The solvents are produced by cells. Cells create non- living bio-chemical dissolving solutions to dissolve degenerative and dead cells, and cellular debris that are too toxic for bacteria, parasites, and fungus to eat.
Therefore viral diseases are not based on the “living” disease premise called the "bacteria theory". The bacteria theory has been continually proved to be false. No matter what the theory, viral diseases can only be logically and scientifically identified as being caused by industrial toxins-contamination.
So, the idea that vaccines can eradicate any viral-associated disease is based on another medical false premise. If the cause is industrial pollution, how can a vaccine full of some of the most toxic industrial pollutants cure a disease caused by industrial toxins? The concept is inane. Further, how can diseases that are considered microbial be prevented or eliminated by consuming or injecting poisons?
Because of our present knowledge of the damage to health from industrial toxins, isn’t the notion that 'adding more industrial toxins will improve health and prevent disease' preposterous and insane?
      
 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 31st Edition - page 5 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 Besides strengthening an industrially- poisoned body, detoxification of industrial contaminants must be the main focus of reversing the disease, not injecting more contaminants. Since polio is a virally-based disease, it is without a doubt an industrially produced disease.
Cause(s) Of Disease With Focus On Polio
To establish the cause of a disease, we must analyze the cells in the part(s) of the body which are affected. In poliomyelitis, the spinal cord is the tissue that is mainly affected. Since polio as it existed in its prime in the mi-1950’s when it was declared a disease, I had to find people who had had polio in the early 1950’s.
Since at least 35 years passed before my inquiry, I had to acquire the scare tissue of those people affected. Scar tissue is dead cells that the body did not dissolve and discard but mummified to use like bricks in a wall. The body uses scar tissue to mend areas when it is unable to reproduce cells quickly enough to heal properly. If the cells did not die natural deaths, most often dead mummified cells contain the properties that killed them during contamination.
When I analyzed scar tissue in the affected areas of the spinal cord in 3 people who had had polio in their youth before the implementation of polio vaccines, the laboratory found metals. The metals found were related to the amalgams wherein organotin (toxic form of tin) is prevalent. Organotin was and is used for its biocidal effects, that is as fungicides, pesticides, algaecides, wood preservatives, and antifouling agents. One such compound is Tributyltin oxide which was used for all of the above and in boats paints and steel to prevent marine microbe decay.
I was unable to use any of the tens of thousands who got polio after receiving polio vaccines because the polio vaccine gave bodies metal-poisoning and caused many people to get polio. (Please re-read Appendix D in my book We Want To Live. There I gave the facts about polio. One of those facts was that polio was almost gone when the polio vaccine was released in 1958 and the vaccine had nothing to do with polio being considerably reduced. In fact, the incidence of polio skyrocketed after the vaccine was instituted, mainly in people who received multiple polio vaccines. Those facts have been suppressed by
medicine and government.)
My next inquiry was to discover how people
in the early- and mid-1950’s acquired so much tin- related toxicity that it caused degeneration of their spinal cord, sometimes ending in paralysis. I could not find tin in any measure in medications of the time to cause such contamination except tetanus shots. But some people who got polio did not have tetanus shots. I had to exclude anyone who got tetanus shots.
I had to exclude people who worked in the tin industry who got polio because most people who were reported to have polio did not work in that industry. Wherever the tin was introduced, it had to have been introduced into the general population within 5-10 years prior to 1955.
I delved into industrial manufacturing and the most prominent enterprise at the time was canned food and roofing metal. I noticed that canned foods were sold to the world with World War II. Advertisements at the time were variations of: Support your loved ones fight the War, eat convenient canned foods.
What did canned foods have to do with fighting the war? In marketing tests done at the time with canned foods, most people with developed taste buds did not like the flavors of canned foods and stated that they would continue to buy fresh foods. Those marketing-tests revealed that the new canned- food industry needed marketing help. So, those who controlled the food-industry marketed their products disgracefully with soldiers and their housewives or girlfriends.
Despite people’s taste preferences, most opted for chemically inundated canned foods. But, why? My mother thought it was the greatest thing since the invention of automobiles. She did not have to shop for different foods, or wash them, or peel and/or slice or chop them. She simply grabbed a can from the cupboard, opened it with her new can opener, and dumped the ingredients into a pot to heat the heavily processed and precooked, nutrient-deprived foods. Even cooking-time was reduced. What a boon to housewives and bachelors in food-preparation.
Although it is reported that tin is used because of its less corrosive nature, the metals from the cans leached into the processed food, especially acidic foods like tomato soups and sauces, apple sauce, and pineapple. Was the tin coating too thin or of the

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 31st Edition - page 6 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 Tributyltin oxide variety to reduce bacterial growth in the processed food? Or are we being miseducated about industrial tin being non-toxic? Is the entire body of metallurgic science as fraudulently fixed as medicine, protecting industry from lawsuits and closures? Since I am not a metallurgist and do not experiment in that field, I cannot answer those questions.
Many of the food preservatives used in canned foods contain metals. The downside to the new luxury was gradual metal-poisoning in the general population. However, growing industry was using metals for everything from agriculture to food- processing. Identifying only one source of metal poisoning as the culprit for polio or any other metal- contaminant-based disease would be negligent.
Regardless, if a person’s body could not eliminate the metals, the body stored the metals in various places depending each individuals body. Some people stored metals in their tonsils, poisoning their tonsils and causing constant cellular damage. That cellular damage required infections (detoxifications) to eliminate the damaged mouth and tonsil cells. In many cases, white blood cells left the bloodstream to eat damaged or dead cells in the tonsils instead of eating dead red-blood cells – which is their true purpose and by which they would keep blood clean and efficient.
Resultantly, we had a greater epidemic of tonsillitis than polio that appeared instantly upon the introduction of canned foods. The tonsils are supposed to protect the mouth and brain from direct contamination from substances introduced through the mouth.
Tonsils are basically, very large lymphatic glands that protect the mouth and brain. Cutting-out the tonsils was the medical preference instead of eliminating the cause, that is, canned foods and agricultural contaminants. Eliminating the tonsils removed the body's oral defense of the brain.. The pharmaceutical preference was penicillin instead of eliminating the cause.
For those who stored the metals in the spinal cord, damaged spinal-cord cells resulted, sometimes causing paralysis. Pharma saw its chance to create another phony cure for a disease even though it had no pseudo-link to microbes and was completely industrial-contaminant-caused.
A food-manufacturing-employed medical doctor of that era told me that they were aware of the metal-poisoning and were complicit in hiding the fact that several diseases were caused by using the cheapest-grade of metal cans. Polio and tonsillitis were only 2. He said that by 1954, they had invented a trade-secret sealant-coating that would stop the leaching of metals into the food from cans. It came to be known as plastic. (Plastic causes a myriad of other diseases that can be researched online.)
Now, take a look at the 3 countries that the Care2 letter/advertisement quoted above stated were plagued with polio: Nigeria, Pakistan and Afghanistan. What do those countries have in common? They are all war zones where metal bombs were exploded and vaporized into the atmosphere contaminating air, soil, water and creatures. Starving war-torn children have inhaled those metals at an astoundingly toxic rate. Additionally, many of the bombs were made with uranium. Adding insult to injury, many of the foods supplied from aid programs to the children are metallically contaminated with food-additives and agricultural contaminants.
Conclusion: Polio is caused by industrial pollution and no poisonous vaccine full of metal will prevent polio. Stabbing children with industrial contaminants for profit and any other reason is at least violent and cruel offense, and at worst murderous.
Reversing/Curing Most Diseases, Including Polio
With all that I have witnessed inside and outside of laboratories, there is only one cause of disease: Industrial pollution in medication, food, air, soil and water. Strengthening a body’s constitution and lymphatic system is the first step to reversing/curing disease.
Our lymphatic systems' jobs are cleaning waste from the body and detoxification. Detoxification is the extraction and elimination of toxins from the body. In cases of polio, the toxins are mainly metals.
In the detoxification-processes, toxins often cause damage to tissue/cells just as they did when they first entered the body. Predominantly, the lymphatic system relies upon fats to harness, dissolve and neutralize waste, mainly for elimination through the skin via perspiration.
Almost all of the lymph’s processes are

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 31st Edition - page 7 © 2012 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 executed by bacteria and require all of the bacteria in raw foods. However, in cases of severe metal- poisoning wherein bacteria cannot fulfill those tasks because bacteria are poisoned, a solvent-oriented fat should be utilized to assist bacteria in the lymph. I discovered by trial and error, the safest and most efficient fat for detoxification is raw coconut cream.
Raw coconut cream is 93% water-soluble fat that is more concentrated in delicate vitamins and other nutrients than any other food except for raw dairy cream. However, raw dairy cream lacks the nutrients to help our bodies expedite intense detoxification. With the nutrients in raw coconut cream, our bodies have the ability to detoxify more quickly while it soothes us of many side effects that result from detoxification. Raw dairy cream should always be consumed with coconut cream to further soothe and protect cells during detoxification, especially nerves and neurons.
Although fats are needed in exorbitant amounts prior to and during detoxification, our digestive bacteria cannot digest or utilize fats properly without feeding them proteins.
Eating raw meat, raw eggs and raw milk supply substantial protein. For people with impaired or poor digestion, eggs are most helpful because they are easiest and quickest to digest.
Harnessing Metals And Other Toxic Contaminants
Lime juice has some amazing nutrients that no other food has. Our bodies can use lime juice to coat foreign substances that normally would cause ill reactions within us. When those foreign toxic substances are coated with lime juice, they are almost completely isolated from doing much damage. The coating is like a barrier. When applied to a dirty wound such as one contaminated with asphalt from a pavement wound, the coating surrounds the asphalt. Infection (detoxification) is delayed without harm.
Normally in such a condition, the body will recruit white blood cells from the bloodstream to inundate the contaminated area and puss results. Puss is mainly white blood cells with the contaminants and the cells that the contaminants have damaged. I have found that using lime juice helps control even intensely toxic accumulations such as occur in
appendicitis, preventing rupture from intense swelling. However, in such a situation, I do not rely upon lime juice alone if I have other resources.
Raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar has amino acids (proteins) that bind with toxic metals similar to lime juice. However, apple cider vinegar requires many more nutrients to be utilized properly. Therefore, I usually recommend smaller amounts of apple cider vinegar than lime juice.
A Recommended Diet For Metal Contamination, Including For Polio And Appendicitis
Once or twice daily consume a mixture of 3 ounces raw lime juice, 2 tsp. lemon juice, 3 ounces unheated honey, 2-3 ounces coconut cream, 2 ounces raw cream, 2 T. unpasteurized apple cider vinegar and 4-6 ounces coconut water (or raw milk). At least 6 ounces of that mixture should be consumed at once. Any remainder may be consumed 2 ounces at a time every 2-3 hours.
Since raw no-salt cheeses are very helpful in attracting toxins from blood, nerves and lymph as they circulate through stomach and intestines, raw cheese may be and should be consumed regularly. Consume at least 1/2 tsp. no-salt raw cheese every 30 minutes to help attract toxins to stomach and intestines. The cheese will absorb most if not all of those toxins and prevent them from harming the stomach and intestinal walls as well as prevent much contamination to digestion and recycling toxins into the body.
Sip milkshakes or smoothies throughout the day, consisting of 4-5 raw eggs, 1 cup raw milk, 1/2 cup raw cream, 2 T. unheated honey and 1/2 cup blueberries (if available; adding berries to milkshake makes it a smoothie). In cases of appendicitis, I suggest 1 cup of tomatoes in place of 1/2 cup berries.
Mix 6 ounces no-salt raw butter with 2 ounces unheated honey (3:1 ratio respectively). Consume 2 T. every 4 hours.
If strength to be active is necessary, I suggest consuming about 1 cup pureed raw meat, red or white, with at least 1.5 T. no-salt raw butter.
If appetite is low, I suggest consuming 1-2 T. fresh raw pineapple or papaya as needed to facilitate digestion.

 Why Do Most Physicians Refuse Chemo-treatments?
by aajonus vonderplanitz, hon. ph.d. nutrition
Chemo does not warrant being called therapy so I will refrain from using that misnomer.
McGill Cancer Center polled 118 doctors and medical scientists recently. Answers to the questionnaires show that 3 of every 4 doctors and medical scientists would refuse chemo-treatments for themselves because of the devastating effects.
Even though doctors are forced to sell chemo as life-extending, polled doctors and scientists noted
that refusal to accept chemo for themselves was predicated on the fact that there are very very low incidences of cancer reversal (remission) with chemo and that those few remissions cannot be directly accredited to chemo-treatments. Most of the doctors who would refuse chemo for themselves stated that they would not allow their family members to suffer chemo either.

Very recently Beth, a wonderful woman and friend passed away at a very young 67 years of age. She had been eating Primal Diet® foods since about 2003. According to her and her son, it saved her son's life and improved hers dramatically.
However, from 2008-2009, Beth was exposed to constant extremely high electromagnetic fields (EMFs) from faulty low-grade electrical power lines. It forced her to leave her new home.
It altered her body dramatically. Where she once had achieved an increase in health regularly, she became challenged daily.
EMFs alter the molecular structure of animal cells at as low as 3 milligauss for as little as 1 hour’s exposure. Beth was exposed to higher milligauss rates than her meters top measurement of 160 milligauss detected nearly 24 hours daily for nearly one year. She became extremely sensitive to everything and anything.
Her digestion declined dramatically. She told me that she was unable to eat all of the foods she ate before. She said she would bloat and have other allergic-like symptoms from foods on which she had learned to live and thrive.
The EMFs that altered the molecular structures of Beth’s cells seemed to have produced toxins similar to those produced by genetically modified (GM) foods. She experienced similar loss of appetite and slow degeneration that laboratory animals experienced on a diet of only GM foods. She not only lost her ability to manufacture digestive enzymes, she
-
lost her ability to reproduce intestinal bacteria that digest our food. She experienced frequent nausea and headaches.
Those symptoms actually belong to a long list of disorders that are always caused by industrial chemicals, especially medical drugs. Antibiotics hold the record in the category of lost digestive abilities, causing most Crohn’s, arthritis, rheumatism, as well as brain and heart hemorrhages.
EMFs are the newest addition to those symptoms, causing severe diseases. (See abstract Electro-magnetic pollution from phone masts. Effects on wildlife: http://www.pathophysiologyjournal.com/article/S092 8-4680(09)00003-0/abstract .)
Also, see Brian Thiesen: Technical Facts and Political Agenda of Smart Meters (and there is much more in this video as well about the effects of EMF exposure)
Rationale To Cope With The Death And Loss Of A Friend And Client
Through my experience with the Death-cap mushroom, I knew the consequences that Beth might experience if she followed her severely damaged instincts. The mushroom had destroyed all of my desire to eat. Putting any food in my mouth caused instant nausea. The cramps caused by mushroom- poisoning were so severe that I had to eat something to quell pain. I forced myself to eat and consequently suffer severe nausea, vomit, headaches, stomach-

 aches and absolute fatigue as a result of eating.
I completely countered my damaged instincts that told me to eat nothing. I chose rationale and reason produced from my long-term trial and errors with diets. I forced myself to consume lots of raw butter in every way I could consume it, with banana, unheated honey, tomato, cucumber, cheeses and some raw milk. From experience, I knew that raw butter would be the only food that could dramatically
increase my chances of saving my liver and of living. I related that information to Beth and suggested that she decline listening to her damaged instincts 90% of the time for rational and wise choices. She tried but often her sensual and emotional experience was so overwhelming that she would not eat the foods I suggest or as much of the foods I
suggested.
She continued to have symptoms, at times
worse than others and at times much improved. We journeyed on a see-saw health-adventure together with her body. She let me know that she was still a very intelligent person and would ultimately decide what she would eat and not eat.
Because I am not God and far from all- knowing, I do not always know what the results will be with a given individual. Usually, my ability to understand a client’s body increases as I work with it. Maybe Beth’s incredible need to placate her symptoms by listening to her damaged instincts was best for her for whatever reason. I worked within those perimeters as she established them. They changed from time to time.
Several times, I feared the consequences of her damaged-instinct-imposed limitations on her diet but I had to let her guide me. It was her life to choose as she wished. I had experienced severe ill health and made hundreds of bad choices and come through them like the fabled Phoenix. She was incredibly smart and I made the decision to trust her and not push her to my thinking or beliefs. When she sought my help, I always related my thinking and expressed it to her but never pushed or intimidated her.
Sadly, I watched her health decline over the next 3 years with occasional but not long-lasting improvements. My suggestion to alternate every 3-4 hours 1-2 T. papaya or pineapple helped her to eat more. However, those foods substituted for her lack of digestive juices but did not improve her bacterial environment that is at least 90% of digestion. High meats, high eggs and fecal matter (see article below) would be very useful in Beth's circumstance but were not utilized except occasionally out of desperation.
My suggestions would give her and her body more time to try but the journey did not appear to be going in the direction of recovery. I do not know that her life would have been saved because several of the things I suggested were not implemented but I have a lot of evidence to support that it would have. Every time I received an emphatic NO to my suggestions, I was forced to suffer sadness in my heart and fear her death because she was skin on bones from the hips to the top of her head.
However many times, I experienced people who were in gravely ill states who recovered. I was not going to be a terrorist by imposing my fear and beliefs on Beth. With freewill comes the right to be right and wrong for one’s self. I accept that premature death is right for the people who choose that for whatever reason. In that, wrong becomes right for that individual.
It is not my right or anyone else’s to judge or condemn. I do not blame although it may seem that I have done so by stated that my preferences were not followed. Freewill serves all even though we will experience losses. When freewill has been deprived of people, losses are experienced many times daily. When freewill lives without harm to others, fewer losses are experienced by everyone.
Beth is gone from my physical reality but lives inside my being. She is a part of me forever. I cherish that she lives inside me with me. I honor the experiences that she shared with me to increase my knowledge, wisdom, compassion and love but I still miss her.

 Child Is Cured By Eating His Mother's Feces; or Eat Shit And Live!
by aajonus vonderplanitz, hon. ph.d. nutrition
If the head-line were stated as I stated it in the title above, would it have been more accurate and more revealing than the actual title of the article I am about to mention? The article was entitled, Fecal transplant from mom cures ailing toddler. http://todayhealth.today.com/_news/2012/10/22/1459 8030-fecal-transplant-from-mom-cures-ailing-toddler
A 28-years-young mother had watched her 20- months-young son Jesse suffer for 9 months with what was medically labeled as infection. He was unable to digest much of anything and wasting away with diarrhea. Doctors blamed the disease on the intestinal janitor Clostridium difficile that consumes damaged cells in the intestinal walls.
Federal health officials who are controlled by the medical-mind-set describe the disease as a dangerous, contagious infection that has become increasingly common, sickening more than 300,000 patients a year in U.S. hospitals and causing some 14,000 deaths.
What those officials do not say would reveal the cause of the disease. In Jesse's case, he was born at 27 weeks’ gestation, suffering the normal hospital- induced iatrogenic diseases of premature babies. Most premature infants are fed the most nutrient- deficient sterilized processed foods through tubes. They are IV-injected with powerful antibiotics and immunoglobulin. The infants are not only deprived of nutrients but poisoned with drugs.
Common sense should tell any doctor that since the intestinal tract is resplendent with 360 bacterial genes to every 1 human gene, antibiotics will gradually or quickly destroy bacteria responsible for digestion. The symptoms of premature-infant iatrogenic complications are respiratory challenges, feeding troubles and intestinal damage both to intestinal mucous membrane walls and destruction of digestive bacteria. Pharma control of medicine has created doctors without common sense.
There are 2 ways to approach the condition since antibiotics only make it much worse:
 improve digestion with raw foods full of self- digesting bacteria or
 introduce intestinal bacteria to eat nutrient- -
deficient foods for awhile.
In the quest for lucrative medical procedures, the
child's doctor did not tell the mother to feed her child raw eggs or raw milk. He did not tell her to feed her childsomeofherpooportoputitinhimasa suppository. Instead, the doctor chose an expensive "medical" procedure to take the mother's poop and implant it in the child's colon. It worked. Jesse hasn’t been admitted to the hospital since and seems to be healing better, his mother reported. Will his body be able to reproduce the digestive bacteria from the feces? Time will tell. If he stays away from doctors and their medication especially antibiotics, Jesse might have a chance.
Now the doctors who performed the first such procedure on a child are promoting this expensive treatment. They presented their report on Jesse's case at the American College of Gastroenterology's annual "scientific" meeting in Las Vegas. They have gained attention for infant fecal transplants.
If they had reported that they fed the child the mother's feces or simply implanted it as a suppository as an outpatient, their method would have been acknowledged but ignored. Since the procedure was performed in hospital, it will make big bucks for doctors and hospitals. It may be utilized.
Those doctors are not the only ones promoting fecal transplants. Other doctors have been using similar methods for several years in adults with success as high as 90 percent, according to reviews. Researchers at Henry Ford Hospital found that 43 of 49 patients with C. diff infections recovered swiftly after fecal transplants and had no problems up to three months later.
They stopped consideration at 3 months because that is when symptoms started reoccurring. Will the doctors begin to suggest fecal implants every 3-9 months or will they somehow develop common sense and advise a diet rich in natural bacteria? Common sense should also tell everyone that diarrhea is the body's way of detoxification. If the body is not fed nutrients to improve health, a body is likely to focus on detoxification, that is, diarrhea as a way the body improves its health.

 Remedy For Infant Digestive Challenges
Stay away from antibiotics; they are the plague of digestive problems.
Normally, simply adding raw whole milk to the diet facilitates recovery of digestive abilities. Sometimes it is a gradual improvement that may take 5-7 days to be satisfactory. Sometimes, it will take longer.
I describe one case in my book WWTL where a raw egg was diluted in 2 ounces of good drinking water to start the baby on raw foods. Egg, raw whole milk (as kefir is fine) and a tiny amount of unheated honey should be the limit of exploration when trying to get an infant's or child's digestive system working properly.
If diarrhea is an issue, I suggest blending 2 T. no-salt raw cheese (not cheddar) with 6 ounces raw whole milk (no honey). If diarrhea has not reduced within 12 hours, I suggest blending 3 T. no-salt raw cheese with 6 ounces raw whole milk. As soon as the
Until my next issue, I wish you happiness along with radiant health.
To help change food policy and allow raw food, including raw dairy, to be commercially available nationally send donations to:
body stops using diarrhea as a method of detoxification, stop utilizing cheese with the milk. Otherwise, very dry fecal matter that is difficult to pass might result. If that happens, inject a little no- salt raw butter or raw cream into the sigmoid colon with a tiny bulb syringe. Bulb syringes that are used to clean ears are perfect.
If vomit or regurgitation is an issue, the infant's or child's body is using the stomach for detoxification. I suggest that you simply use the same formula for vomit as I suggested above for diarrhea. I do not suggest re-feeding the infant or child her/his vomit; it is toxic. Feed her/him more of the same fresh food. Unless the food is contaminated with industrial toxins, the food is not the problem. The toxins in the body being released in vomit is the problem. We should accept, be happy with the body's choice and work around vomit, not suppress the vomiting process. _______________________________________

The     Newsletter
32nd Edition; August 12, 2013
I struggled for four decades to recover from multiple "incurable" diseases and death-cap mushroom- poisoning. My work and Primal Diet focus on helping bodies detoxify from pollutants that cause disease, whether from medicine, cooking or other industrial toxins, and helping bodies heal themselves. Stored pollutants in our bodies can raise their toxic heads at any time in our lives and cause serious problems from infancy to elderly, including cancer. Also, I work to avoid and prevent pollutants from entering the body. My bi-monthly newsletters focus on issues that show the problem and solutions/remedies. All issues require subscription for reading at www.WeWant2Live.com. Thank you for your interest in and appreciation for my work. I continue to wish all of you wonderfully healthy futures!

Somehow, all raw nutrients and cellular life have beneficial bonds to each other. Those bonds make it easy for our bodies to deliver an entire smorgasbord of nutrients to cells, including bacteria (99.6% of our bodies' genes are bacterial), enzymes, proteins, fats, vitamins, a little carbohydrate and a myriad of health- giving unknowns. Cellular food is supplied in a smorgasbord of those nutrients. There are supposed to be 92-117 nutrients in each smorgasbord.
However, when we cook anything, we cause most of the bacterial and ionic nutrient-bonds to fractionate, even isolate. Cooking, processing and contaminating food destroys the normal bonds made by raw nutrients, mostly accomplished by bacteria in the digestive tract. After cooking and/or processing, water is no longer properly bound to nutrients. Resultantly, transporting water with nutrients to cells
becomes most difficult. Bacterial and enzymatic alterations must occur to keep cells hydrated.
Also during cooking and/or processing, nutrients are altered and adulterated, greatly diminishing their value to our cells, our bodies. Nutrients are unable to remain coupled for particular cellular activity that would translate into body energy for us.
I gave a fairly thorough list of damage in my books but did not elucidate on free-radical reactions because I did not want readers to get bogged in chemistry. Chemistry has been violated by industries and their governmental and academic lapdogs to denigrate nature into an inanimate, dissectible, lifeless Frankenstein monstrosity. It has been and is used to convince us that science is pure and knows what it is doing for our benefit. When in actuality, 95% of the time it is just the opposite. Science still
How Are Nutrients Delivered To Our Cells?

 cannot manufacture a seed from scratch that will grow healthfully and produce fruit.
Therefore, I suggest that you rein-in chemistry to make it important only as a means to an explanation. When chemistry violates life via experiment, it becomes the means rather than explanation. Our entire industrial foundation is built on destroying life rather than nurturing and protecting life. Mobility and production industries force toxic fuel use that pollutes air, creatures (including us), land and water. Agricultural and pharmaceutical industries isolate and remix compounds into life-altering substances that will pollute air, creatures, land and water for centuries.
When nurturing life is the goal, protecting life is automatic and natural. So, please consider my view of chemistry as explanatory.
In chemistry, free radicals are atoms or molecules that bear an unpaired electron. They are extremely reactive (firing, dashing and bombarding other particles). creating a virtual destructive chain- reaction. Those free-radicals are capable of causing rapid chain-reactions that destabilize other molecules, generating many more free radicals inside our bodies. Free radicals cause cellular damage, degeneration and death which result in multiple accelerated toxic conditions called diseases, such as cancer, Crohn's and 2,000 other diseases.
In biochemistry, free radicals are altered nutrients that cause radical reactions resulting in damage inside and outside of cells and is not limited to unpaired electron damage. Literal to the words "free radical" are all of the toxins (32 known) that are produced from cooking. The most notorious are acrilymides, heterocyclic amines and lipid-peroxides. (The Recipe for Living Without Disease, pages 154- 159.)
Salts in non-food form are rocks. We do not digest rock. Vegetation digests and transforms rock into living substances by diluting and linking the minerals into substances that structure life's growing potential.
Like free-radicals, salts of any kind also destroy nutrient bonds. When those bonds are broken, cells are malnourished. Cells may receive only 1/5 to 1/2 the nutrients that were intended for them because of cooking, processing and other contamination.
However, disease is the cure not the cause of the health problem. Disease is the process of our bodies eliminating toxins (accumulated industrial chemicals)
including degenerative tissue caused by industrial chemical reactions in our bodies, or by other injuries. Except in injuries incurred in mobility accidents (such as falls or collisions), the causes of diseases are always industrial chemical contamination. Free radicals inside our bodies are always the result of industrial chemicals whether from earth, such as manufacturing, agriculture, food-processing or medical contamination (especially vaccines) that contaminate air, water, creatures and land for centuries or longer.
As I mentioned above and explained in my recipe book, cooking is an industrial process that causes at least 32 known toxins (industrial chemicals) to form. Three of those have proved to be cancer- causing. They are: acrilymides, heterocyclic amines, and lipid-peroxides. The others may very well be as disease-causing but no one has spent the time, energy and money to prove and publish it. No one in business wants their processes proved dangerous.
It appears that people would rather have physical conveniences than optimal health. The price of those conveniences is their physical, emotional and spiritual health. Maybe, our dollar bills should picture various diseases so people are completely informed about the costs of the items they buy.
Antioxidants, uric acid, particular bacteria and enzymes can neutralize free-radical chain-reactions. Foods that are concentrated in bacteria and enzymes that help neutralize free radicals are all organic: no- salt raw butter and cheeses, raw milk and cream, raw coconut cream, raw berries, raw apple cider vinegar, raw coconut vinegar, raw cilantro (coriander) juice, raw liquid whey, pineapple, and lime and lemon juices. A form of raw fat must be consumed with any of those foods that are not already fatty. Fats insure that free-radical toxins are contained and do not cause more damage on their way out of our bodies. Long hot baths will insure that they are eliminated by perspiration through skin.
Consuming lots of lime juice without fat sometimes causes caustic compounds to surface on skin quickly and in large amounts, sometimes causing bumps, rashes or warts. However, it is better to rid the body and suffer some skin alterations than to contain caustic compounds inside the body.
My Sport Formula contains most of those ingredients and is a way to facilitate careful detoxification. And/or having the one fruit meal daily of 1/2 cup berries, 1/4 cup diced pineapple, 1 tsp. to 1

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 32nd Edition - page 3 © 2013 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 T. raw apple cider or coconut vinegar, 1.5 T. lime juice, 1 tsp. lemon juice, 2-3 T. coconut cream and 1.5 T. raw cream works well to facilitate careful detoxification. If detoxification gets overwhelming, I suggest that you reduce consumption of raw apple cider vinegar and lime juice daily to 1 T. each.
Aajonus' Sport Formula(not sport
drink)
3 cups of at least 2 of the following foods: cucumber
tomato
watermelon
raw milk
fresh raw liquid whey
Cucumber, watermelon and tomato are to be pureed not juiced. Whey is liquid byproduct of making cheese. Milk should be whole raw milk or kefir. You may have any combination of those to equal 3 cups. Remainder of the ingredients are:
1 T. raw apple cider vinegar
2 T. lime juice
2 tsp. lemon juice (optional)
2 T. coconut cream
2 T. dairy cream
2-3 eggs
1-2 T. Unheated honey (optional).
1-2 ounces pineapple (whole, not juice) That makes about 1 quart after blending all ingredients together.
Hot baths of 35-90 minutes at 104-110 degrees F, help the body eliminate toxins through skin readily and efficiently. Be sure to add ingredients to municipal waters to neutralize the toxins (such as chlorine and fluoride) so that they do not enter skin and body causing damage. (See Baths under Health Modalities in my book We Want To Live, for suggested ingredients.).

What Role Do Genetics and Microbes Play In Disease?
by aajonus
Genes are linear sequences of nucleotides along a segment of DNA with varying characteristics. I only partially agree with the theory that DNA provides the coded instructions for synthesis of RNA, which, when translated into protein, leads to the expression of hereditary character. I believe that nucleotides express themselves through electro- magnetic and metaphysical energies that determines appearance and behavior. It is an active energy- process rather than merely plan-execution or fate.
Take for example, a formidable athletic team. In a winning team, you will find a group of highly energized and skillful athletes working well together to accomplish the manipulation of the object of the game played. The players are not simply instructed or coded to function well, they have natural ability and
vonderplanitz
skill. Natural ability and skill are integral parts of their beings and their bodies. Therefore, it is not simply code but energy, innate intelligence and ability coupled with large degrees of muscular health.
Appearance and behavior will be similar to the people from whom they are offspring. However, the role of genes appears to be much more choice than fate, except when industrial chemicals and the free- radicals that result from industrial chemicals disrupt bacteria and other nutrients, and nucleotides, resultantly disrupting and destroying and/or altering important RNA and DNA structures. The greatest damage to genes in our "advanced" societies are all vaccines that contain very toxic and harmful adjuvants.

 Hard Look At Disease Instigated By Corporate and Governmental Tyranny
by aajonus vonderplanitz
The word adjuvant was adopted to spin the concept of toxins in vaccines into an acceptable package that seems harmless, even helpful. However, ALL adjuvants in vaccines are harmful, many extremely harmful, including liquid nano-mercury, nano-aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, detergents, squalene and up to 58 other toxic ingredients, usually unidentified on labels and packages. Each is harmful by its nature.
Mercury is consider the most toxic neurological contaminant on Earth. Who in their rational minds is going to allow themselves and their children to be injected with the Earth's known most toxic neurological poison?
Vaccines dumb-down brain and nervous systems, cause deformities of any body part or system, from knock knees to crooked teeth to visual disturbances (eyesight problems), and severe anomalies such as Down's syndrome and autism. Additionally, vaccines cause numerous other diseases such as hepatitis, yellow fever, malaria, seizures, insomnia, anxiety, depression, skin disorders including extreme acne-scarring, and about 2,000 other health issues as well as death.
How can anyone who declares that those soups of toxins are beneficial be rational and logical? Is s/he in denial, or a scoundrel for profit and/or power? Probably the answer to the follow question will answer those questions: Why would anyone declare those poisonous soups to be health-giving?
Any healthy society is of no value to the medical and pharmaceutical industries. An unhealthy society is profitable to those industries. Additionally, any healthy society is a threat to a corrupt governmental corporations. All three of those corporations promote vaccines to insure disease, profit and dominance.
While I was promoting raw milk in 1986, the FDA was using the organization Public Citizen founded by Ralph Nader and FDA's mother agency Human Health Services (HHS) in Washington D.C. to implement their 1974 rule banning interstate transportation of raw milk through a court action entitled Pubic Citizen, et al v. Heckler, 653f. Supp. 1229(D.D.C. 1986). There was a somewhat passionate conversation between two men from behind a closed door at HHS. It was a non-labeled
door near Vice Admiral Koop's office who was Surgeon General at the time and head of HHS. Efforts to see Dr. Koop for several days failed; that is, permission was not granted to me.
My frustration forced the decision to simply barge in on him, right past his secretary. However, on my way to barge-in, the argument that muddled through the wall into the hall ended that decision and I did not barge into Dr. Koop's office. The conversation coming through the wall was about vaccines being mandated for National Security.
"Think about how long and much we'd pay if they weren't vaccinated. Would you rather have more money for research and weapons-development or pay useless ex-military grunts life-long benefits? Do you know how much we pay them in benefits each year? Who are we going to get to kill when innocent women, men and children must be a part of collateral damage? We must damage the integrity of logic and conscience of every soldier," the male voice came through the wall barely audible.
It took me several months to analyze those rhetorical questions and statement. Am I correct in my analysis that the long-term purpose of mass multiple vaccination of military personnel is to cull the unhealthiest to make a fighting army, reduce conscience in soldiers, and reduce government- benefits by shortening soldiers' lifespans?
We must consider that the toxins in vaccines dumb-down rational thinking, often making individuals simple-minded for years, decades or even life. The military objective of vaccines would make sense, that is, it would more easily make most soldiers into obeying-robots of murder such as in the Vietnam war where millions of farmers and families where murdered in the name of freedom.
Who in their right minds would go to a country that has not invaded our ground and murder farming families, including infants and children? Additionally, vaccine-toxins not only damage nerves and neurons they irritate the nervous system resulting in greater impatience and intolerance. They heighten all types of emotions that drive irrational superiority, self- and ideological righteousness. Vaccines, then, are part of the Military Industrial Complex.

 The Primal Diet Newsletter, 32nd Edition - page 9 © 2013 Aajonus Vonderplanitz
 As President Eisenhower stated in his farewell address, our greatest enemy to peace is the industrial military complex. It profits most during wars. That is why the U.S. Government is always engaged in some type of war.
If all of that is true, what are government heads willing do to the public with mandatory vaccines? Would the purpose be to dumb-down, numb and cripple its citizens just enough to keep them all from being brilliant, wise and less controllable? Would one of the ploys be to reduce social security payments to citizens by shortening their lives and use the funds for other governmental expenses, ultimately for greed of wealth and power?
Rationale and non-junk science proves vaccines cannot be proved safe or effective. They have been and can be proved dangerous and harmful. There has been no proper long-term testing of any vaccine. We have volumes of evidence that mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, detergent and Squalene are extremely harmful to humans. Mandatory vaccinations are both immoral and ethically illegal.
Why did George Bush, Jr., the House and Senate give pharmaceutical companies waivers for the side effects, including disease, paralysis and death caused by their very profitable but useless-for-prevention vaccines if not to undermine the health of people? Why would our so-called protectors of the people deprive all citizens of their innate right to compensation from government-forced/mandated vaccines?
On another note but for the same rationale, why did Obama, the House and Senate just give agricultural companies like Monsanto waivers on the disasters, including public illnesses, destroyed farms and health-harmed workers caused by genetically modified crops and organisms? Why are Obama and the Congress stating that GMO foods are safe when ALL legitimate scientific inquiries have stated the opposite?
Conclusion
Vaccines and other industrial toxins are used in
infinite conspiracies to undermine citizens for greed of wealth and power. How do we counter such well- funded and perverse powers? Education with logical and rational sensibility.
We probably should avoid addressing the basic issues that I divulged above because no one wants to believe their governmental leaders are so corrupt and
harmful to it citizens. It would be best to educate those who are questioning and those who will listen that vaccines are a soup of disease-causing toxins, including non-nano and nano:
