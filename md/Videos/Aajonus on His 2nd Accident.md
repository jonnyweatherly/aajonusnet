A: I just... See the clavicle bone is cracked and broken and went through my neck muscles and then the collarbone is also broken and then two ribs here. This swelling right here like a hardened tumor is what my body naturally formed to make its own cast. To keep those muscles in place as much as possible. So those will hopefully reduce and disappear in the next year.

Q: When did it happen?

A: A week ago.

Q: Wow, that′s amazing. You want to say how you healed yourself?

A: No, I have that in there.

Q: Wow.
