There is no such thing as Lyme's disease [31 Aug 2012] . I discussed it in one of my newsletters last year.

Lyme disease is a myth. That activity occurs when a body is poisoned with mercury from vaccines and other medication. I have worked with only 13 cases but all reversed.

Lyme disease is a hoax. When you have to use 5 tests to GUESS that a person has a condition but no specific microbe or chemical for Lyme disease, then there is no Lyme disease. It is another method of the pharmaceutical and medical industries to blame nature for disease instead the the industrial chemicals that cause all disease.

I covered lyme disease (not a real disease but symptoms of other toxic problems) in WWTL.

There is no such thing as lymes disease; another fiction of big pharma. Neural damage is caused by metallic toxicity 95% of the time. Dairy is the only food in which you can derive enough absorbable combined calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium to chelate and neutralize metallic toxicity and remove it from the body. Eating about 1/2 teaspoon raw no-salt cheese every hour would help remove such toxicity. Sipping on milk throughout the day would help restore important minerals to nerves. Eating raw bone marrow with fish and chicken helps regenerate nerves.

Epstein Barr is simply the accused. Virus are a poor form of detoxification but still it is a detoxification (see my PD newsletters at www.WeWant2Live.com regarding virus). You have systemic toxicity that requires gradual detoxification. I do not suggest any changes.
