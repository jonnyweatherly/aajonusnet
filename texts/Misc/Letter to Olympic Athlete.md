###AAJONUS'S LETTER TO OLYMPIC ATHLETE WHO OFFERED TO PROMOTE THE PRIMAL DIET WITH HER STORY:

"I would love for you to promote quality health for
more people however, I think that might endanger
you. It seems that everyone who has done that in the
past shortly after begins to face hardships or death. I
will start with one of my experiences. Example, last
year and for 11 years, I lived on a wealthy ($100s of
millions) man's estate. He had lived my diet for 9
years and promoted it often, giving about 10 copies
of my books to his friends periodically, including to
the Dali Lama who recovered by switching from
vegetarianism to include meat-eating (7 years ago
because he was so sick). The house I had been
living in was built in about 1989 with the verbal
permission of the chief of Malibu Building and
Safety at that time. I received a report 2 years ago
from an investigator friend that local and federal
government agencies were investigating all phases
of my life. A month later, the owner of the estate was
told that he had to demolish the house in which I
lived because there were no formal permits. Being
wealthy, he fought them for 1 year. During that year,
the City officials and/or the LA DA called him often.
Finally they threatened him with $1000-a-day fines. 
Once I moved from the property, the government
never called or visited that house. I visited the
property last week and the building stands.
On Friday, living in another house in Malibu for only
8 months with a 2-years lease, I got an eviction
notice. The owners were wealthy Iranians but for
some reason, the property with 3 houses all
occupied by renters went into mortgage default.
Why? The rent we pay pays the mortgage. In the
past, my biggest supporters have met with trying
experiences that seem bizarre. About 10 years ago,
when Mel Gibson announced on David Letterman
that he eats raw meat, his life-problems began. I
found poison in my house and food on several
occasions. A year ago, a well-to-do, happy, jovial
woman was so fantastic on my PD for 19 months
that she began having my books translated into
Spanish; a translation that could be understood in all
Spanish-speaking countries. She was going to
publish them. After my book was only half
translated, she was found dead from a fall from the
roof and translations disappeared. She had never
been depressed, always jovial and in her 60's. She
was not suicidal. I know of half dozen more such
events. It sounds a bit paranoid but there has been
too many of these events in the last 6 years to
simply call them coincidence. I have taken the time
to explain all of this because I want you to be
successful and enjoy your life. I am afraid that
because my diet works so well and its diametrically
opposed to the second biggest profiteers in the
world, big pharma and medical, they want to
minimize its/my exposure.
I wish you all of the happiness and success in the
world." - Aajonus
