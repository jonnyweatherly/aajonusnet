The nation is fighting the last battles for commercially available raw milk on the vast open
market in theUSA. The onslaught of microbe-phobia has virtually outlawed raw milk or
bankrupt the major fresh raw dairymen with over-regulation and testing most states. In a few
states you can obtain raw milk directly from the farmer, at the farm only. In several states,
people can buy fresh raw milk products labeled for pet consumption only in a handful of health
food stores.


To give an understanding of fear versus reality, let us consider the following information. The
medical doctors and a Veterinarian who were Commissioners on the Los Angeles Medical Milk
Commission (“LAMMC”) thought and believed that they were saving the world by banning any
milk that contains any salmonella, E-coli, campylobacter and low levels of other so-called
“pathenogens”. Even though empirical evidence proved that pasteurization creates
degenerative matter in milk on which microbes, “pathogens”, feed, rendering pasteurized milk a
culprit cesspool for “pathenogenic” activity, they ordered raw milk that may somehow have
gotten bacteria introduced after milking to be pasteurized, or dumped. Salmonella, e-coli,
campylobacter, listeria, and other microbes are not harmful. What is harmful is the degenerative
matter on which these microbes feed. To point the finger and attack the microbes is the same
as blaming the vultures, crows, ants and worms for the dead carcass on which they feed. The
microbes that science and medicine term “pathenogenic” are simply the symptom that
degenerative matter exists. As soon as the degenerative matter is consumed by the microbes,
the microbes go dormant - the exhaustion theory. These microbes are part of the process of
waste-elimination.


Tests have proved that raw milk is a healthy live food with many naturally occurring
antigens. European tests have proved that the feared microbes are free of pathogenic activity in
raw milk. I, Aajonus Vonderplanitz as Executive Director of Right To Choose Healthy Food, told
doctors on the LAMMC at a monthly meeting that their dangerous-pathenogen-epidemic theory
was faulty and that they were actually harming people by depriving people of raw milk, the most
nutritious food that can be easily digested, even for the elderly and infirm; the very people that
the medical community prescribes not to consume raw milk. I was considered among the
medical community to be in the category of individuals who is in danger of severe illness and
death from pathogens because of a vagotomy performed on me by doctors when I was 20 years
of age. However, I attribute my healing of blood, bone and stomach cancers, diabetes,
psoriasis, angina and bursitis to my change to raw food at a time when he was on my
deathbed. Raw dairy was a vital factor in my recovery and long-term healing processes. I
documented my and other health-challenged people's experiences in my book We Want To
Live, published by Carnelian Bay Castle Press.


Thousands of sick people have gotten healthy by adding raw milk and raw milk products to their
diets. Hundreds of people have given testimonials regarding the improvements to health that
raw milk has had on their illnesses, even those that medical science claims are most in danger,
including of death, by pathogens. Medical science ignores the truth of this empirical information
because their entire profession is stuck in the quagmire of search, find, attack and destroy at all
costs. The average doctor does not seek to help the body heal itself by nurturing therapies. The
best example are the numerous stories about the doctors telling surviving family members that
the medical therapy stopped the infection (microbic activity) but that their relative died anyway,
and here is the bill. The truth is that an environment of degenerative tissue in an animal’s body
determines pathenogenic activity. If people eat healthfully, such as raw milk and other raw
products that constitute a balanced healthy diet, little if any pathenogenic activity is necessary. But when it happens it is always the bodies attempt, synergistically, symbiotically to
remove degenerative tissue. Therefore, colds, flus, and other viruses are detoxifications and
should not be stopped. They should be promoted to remove decay and other wastes for
healthier living and functionality.


Many primitive people ate meats full of pathogens to strengthen themselves and improve their
abilities to flourish in good health in Nature, in all of its forms.The Eskimo buried fish and
caribou for up to 6 weeks at a time until it stunk for a half mile down wind before they consumed
it. When Aajonus Vonderplanitz, a man who had always experienced extreme discomfort from
mildly cold temperature and who was considered by medical science to be in danger of death
from pathogens, experimented with the Eskimo’s bacteria-infested foods.After eating only 4
ounces of pathogen-infested raw meats, Aajonus felt warm in a cold climate, that is, for the first
time in his life he was able to enjoy being alive in cold temperatures.Laboratory tests revealed
that he had consumed enough e-coli and salmonella to kill a herd of elephants, that is,
according medical science. Aajonus did not suffer any ill effects from eating the pathogen-
infested food. (Ripley's Believe It Or Not, July 17, 2002.) He experienced mild loose bowels the
next day that could have occurred under many circumstances not associated with that food.


The American people, and people all over the world, have been duped by the pathogen-theory
and bacteria-phobia.
