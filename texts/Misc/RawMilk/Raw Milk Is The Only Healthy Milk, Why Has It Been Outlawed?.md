There is too little known among the general public about the benefits of raw milk, even though raw milk
was the foster mother of mankind. Controversial seems to be a week adjective when considering the
vehement rhetoric of individuals who lash out against it from mis-education and fear. The bacteria-phobia
has no empirical base. There have been no clinical tests studying people drinking raw milk that contains
feared bacteria, to prove or disprove the theory that pathogens finding their way into raw milk can cause
ill effects in humans drinking it. Even vegetative nutrients found in raw milk have been falsely blamed for
ill effects. The crusade against raw milk has been lethal to the empirical evidence that raw milk and raw
milk products are probably the most nutritious food most people can consume.


Pasteurizing milk, which is the process of cooking milk at a minimum 155 degrees F. for at least 15
seconds, gained popularity when farmers didn't have the technology to produce, package and deliver all
their raw milk fresh. Pasteurization LENGTHENED the SHELF LIFE of milk. Suddenly, farmers were
able to hold and transport their milk instead of dumping it or feeding it to the hogs. Until then the primary
focus of milk was that it was a healthful food. With pasteurization, milk became a commodity, an
economic issue that generated Hollywood-like unscientific horror stories about raw milk spreading
diseases.


For years health-minded individuals, teachers, professors, politicians and even doctors fought the battle
against pasteurization of milk because of the obvious weakening effects it had on humans and animals
who were fed pasteurized milk. The destruction of the nutritional properties was evident in the results.
Early in the battle, several countries outlawed the feeding of pasteurized milk to infants. Not only does
pasteurization destroy the major proportion of vitamins, enzymes and minerals, it creates contaminants,
such as transitional lipid oxides and protein toxins. Pasteurized milk cannot maintain the biological
antibodies and enzymes present in raw milk, some of which can prevent a large variety of diseases,
including cancer.


The campaign by large financial interests, greedy people, focused on making the dairy business huge by
centralization eventually scared people into believing that pasteurization destroyed the great bacterial
enemies of health that swarmed in raw milk. They pointed to bacteria and said, See what awful bacteria is
in raw milk? They, of course, did not reveal that raw milk has enzymes and lactic acids that prevent
bacteria from pathogenic activity. They did not reveal that the same feared bacteria enters pasteurized
milk, and that the bacteria grows quicker and becomes harmful because it is fed on the mutations and
contaminants caused by pasteurization. They did not reveal that they would sell dirty milk while telling
people that is was safe because harmful bacteria were destroyed in pasteurization. With pasteurization,
milk contaminated with bovine fecal matter and bovine disease could be sold as long as it had been
pasteurized. The bacteria-destruction campaign rampaged. People were frightened and brainwashed into
believing that pasteurization could save them from anything harmful. These beliefs are the
misconceptions of the majority of society today.


How many of us are willing to drink cooked puss from diseased cows and cooked cow dung? Even if
milk is clean, how many of us, if we understood, would drink milk destroyed of the majority of its
nutrients, and toxic with pasteurized contaminants that promote disease? Would you go to a car dealer
expecting that the wrecked car will perform as well as the new and not give you problems?
