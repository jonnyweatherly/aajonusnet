Meat, cholesterol:
Carcinogens in red meat are all caused by cooking

French paradox, Israeli paradox

YT: Maasai Health Secret to leanness and longevity

Book:
Weston A. Price: Nutrition and Physical Degeneration
A book about a dentist who has examined primitive tribes all over the world, none of them suffering from any degenerative diseases. All of them consumed very high amount of meat, saturated fat and cholesterol. He compared these populations with people from their tribes who have adopted the modern western diet, who then always developed the same degenerative, cardiovascular and diseases that people in the west suffer from. Native people on their native diets have no cancer, tooth decay, insomnia, cardiovascular disease, painful births, and etc. They have better developed skulls and bones, and calmer, happier children.

Maasai who consumed raw milk and raw blood were very superiorly built compared to other tribes living in the exact same environment as them, who were agricultural-based and ate more vegetation than animal products. Maasai prove raw animal-based diet influences your development, not just clean environment.

Cholesterol was high in blood of centenarians:

Saturated fat was demonized by sugar industry:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27617709/

Book: The Great Cholesterol Myth
by Jonny Bowden

First Eskimo diagnosed with cancer was in 1936, after 80 years of consuming sugar in the colonies, first eskimo diagnosed with heart disease was a similar case - long consumption of western diet. Otherwise, Eskimos consume seal and whale blubber - pure saturated animal fat as most of their diet, and have no heart disease.

Same with the Maasai.

Vegan diet lacks: A, B6, B12, D, F, K2, Creatine, Carnitine, Carnosine, Taurine, Heme-Iron, CoQ10, CLA

Hong Kong, highest red meat consumption in the world, one of highest life expectancy in the world

Okinawans eat a lot, lot of pork, by a lot, I mean most of their diet

Accutane is synthetic vitamin A, where do we get real vitamin A? Liver

Dexter Kruger lived to 111+ and ate chicken brains often, extremely high in cholesterol

Cholesterol is an anti-oxidant, and it's present in every single cell of your body.

All scar tissue, including scar tissue in your arteries is made from cholesterol.

Our body only produces saturated fatty acids, never linoleic (seed oils)

LOWER cholesterol is associated with MORE heart attacks:

Study that demonized saturated fat in the first place, cherrypicked countries to pick data from, and ignored countries that had different data, that links to French and Israeli paradox
Later studies debunked it

First heart attack was documented in 1912 by James B Herrick, seed oils were getting popular by then, in 1924 heart disease was getting very common, so were seed oils, Procter and Gamble paid 1.7 million dollars (back then a lot of money) to American Heart Association to demonize animals fats and push seed oils, despite there not being a correlation between animal fats and heart disease, in 1900 everyone was consuming animal fat and heart disease was very rare.

Seed Oils
1900 - 99% of fat consumed in US was animal fat
2005 - 86% of it is now seed oils

YT: Max Demarco - these Oils are Slowly Killing You

Procter and Gamble paid today's equivalent of 20 million dollars to American Health Association to promote seed oils

Animals with fats that are harder to oxidize live longer, but we consume seed oils that fill us uo with very easy to oxidize linoleic acid

Minnesota Coronary Survey
fromIvan D. Frantz.
Over 9000 people were fed identical meals for 5 years, one group with seed oils, other with animal fats, seed oil group had lower cholesterol blood levels but wasn't living longer, in fact, in the seed oil group people over 65 were dying more.

Seed oils cause Alzheimers in mice:

Best study in the field:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/4176868/
-2 groups over 60 were fed either animal fats or seed oils, people in seed oil group were dying more, despite there being twice as many heavy smokers in the animal fat group, the study took 8 years.

Breast milk containing more linoleic acid (From mothers consuming seed oils) causes children to be less intelligent:

WESTON A. PRICE FOUNDATION - Dangers of Statin Drugs: What You Haven't Been Told About Popular Cholesterol-Lowering Medicines
"Recent study indicating that patients with chronic heart failure benefit from having high levels of cholesterol rather than low. heart failure patients for at least 12 months.17 Survival was 78 percent at 12 months and 56 percent at 36 months. They found that for every point of decrease in serum cholesterol, there was a 36 percent increase in the risk of death within three years."

"Low cholesterol levels are associated with increased rates of cancer."

Tens of studies proving high cholesterol levels to be safe, and Statin drugs to be dangerous, causing ton of physical and mental issues, because they suppress the NATURAL production of cholesterol and other compounds by the body.

Sugar and processed foods:

Aspartame is dangerous:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1474447/

A High school replaced processed food, candy, soda, sugar and junk food with healthy organic food, and the average student IQ became higher, behavior, grades, satisfaction, and cooperation between the students and teachers became better:
Case Study: Appleton Central Alternative Charter High School's Nutrition and Wellness Program

"Sugar and the Criminal Mind" - J I Rodale
Doctor that worked with prisons. The more sugar, fried and processed food they fed to prisoners, to more violence they experienced in the prison. The more natural food, such as meat and potatoes they fed them, the more cooperation they experienced,

Toxic by-products created by consuming sugars and ALL carbohydrates accumulate in you and age you:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9572209/

Sugar kills/disables your red blood cells via glycation:

Processed diets cause less satiation, and more calorie intake, even with the same macronutrient content:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31105044/

Approximately 99 percent of the world's production of manufactured citric acid is developed from the Aspergillus niger fungus, also known as black mold.

Do you think eating raw meat is disgusting?

I think drinking fluids from a black fungus every time you have a soft drink is disgusting.

Feeding kids garbage makes them more stressed and hungry:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/10049982/

Consuming sugar increases fat stores all over the body, it's not just calories in and out:
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002916523026588?via%3Dihub
Fructose inhibits 3 enzymes that your mitochondria need to function well, which equals to LESS SUGAR AND CALORIES OUT, therefore it's not just calories and out.
That's a minor problem though, hurting your mitochondria is worse problem than burning less energy.

Junk food inhibits bone growth and development (in children):

https://biochem-food-nutrition.agri.huji.ac.il/efratmonsonego

"The definition of food is "substrate that contributes to either growth or burning of the organism." What if a substrate inhibits growth AND burning? Is it food? No, it becomes poison. And that's ultra-processed food - because it hijacks the cellular pathways of growth and burning."
-Robert Lusting

Noncaloric sweeteners still make you gain weight, through insulin and increased hunger

Raw Meat

Only carcinogens in Red Meat claimed by the WHO are created by cooking

Digestive leukocytosis: Every time you eat cooked food, your body draws a ton of white blood-cells into the digestive track, when you eat a raw food together with it, it mitigates it
Eat raw food - it doesn't happen

Cooking destroys, water-soluble vitamins, stem cells, creatine, Phosphorus, magnesium, and other nutrients.

Cooking cauterizes most of the minerals.

Cooking destroys all enzymes and kills all digestive bacteria.

Cooking creates Lipid peroxides, acrylamides, and heterocyclic amines, these 3 are carcinogenic, then it creates advanced glycation end products, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other toxins.

Italian, Emma Morano lived to 117 years eating raw steaks and raw eggs

Maasai, Inuit, Nenet and other tribal people all eat raw meat worldwide, Japanese people consume lot of raw meat including raw chicken, Europeans consume lot of steak tartare and carpaccio, Ethiopians eat lot of raw meat, so as it seems, the whole world consumes raw meat regularly without any issues.

Pottenger's cats was an experiment where controlled groups of cats were fed cooked vs raw meat, raw meat cats remained healthy, cooked meat cats developed degeneration over generations. Their bones grew weaker, infertility was rampant, females became masculine and males feminine, they developed diseases and after several generations died out because of their inability to reproduce. Raw meat was able to reverse degeneration caused by cooked meat. We are not identical to cats, but this proves that cooking food messes with their nutrient content.

If cooked meat caused us to evolve, Inuits who only eat raw meat wouldn't undergo evolution and wouldn't be as developed as us. If raw meat caused us to evolve, it would be requirement for our organism to keep consuming it, because our body evolved based on the consumption of cooked meat, however people who stop consuming cooked meat have no problem whatsoever. If we do not need cooked meat, then how did it make us evolve?
How come cooking meat caused us to evolve, if every other animal that is fed exclusively cooked meat/their natural diet cooked rather than raw degenerates instead of evolving?
Where is the scientific evidence supporting the claim raw meat made us evolve?

Dr. Hardin B. Jones testified that cancer patients who didn't go on chemotherapy and didn't follow doctors advice lived for longer

Dr. Michael Farley, in his extensive career as a forensic pathologist, has reportedly conducted numerous autopsies on cancer patients. Based on his findings, he concluded that in none of these cases did the patients actually die from the cancer itself.
Instead, the cause of death was often related to the aggressive treatments they received, such as chemotherapy and radiation. He observed that these treatments weakened the immune system and vital organs to the point where patients succumbed to complications like liver failure, cardiac failure, renal failure or other organ failures rather than the cancer progressing naturally

8-prenylnaringenin (8-PN) is a prenylated flavonoid, occurring, in particular, in hop, but also in other plants. It has proven to be one of the most potent phytoestrogens in vitro known to date, and in the past 20 years, research has unveiled new effects triggered by it in biological systems.

The presence of 8-prenylnaringenin in hops may provide an explanation for the accounts of menstrual disturbances in female hop workers.

After saying this, they go on to say:

"This phytoestrogen can also be detected in beer, but the levels are low and should not pose any cause for concern."

Vegetables and fiber:

Adding fiber makes digestive issues worse, subtracting fiber makes digestive issues better:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2862371/

Removing fiber cures constipation:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3435786/

There are meta-analyses showing fiber helps people move, but these seem unclear to me, they look which fiber makes people move best, they don't try to give patients high fiber vs no fiber diet to see the results. Plus it is never explained why arbitrarily having more frequent or bigger stools of undigested animal matter is beneficial to humans, we just move more undigested and unnecessary matter, which is ton of useless work for our intestines.

We produce acid for animal matter strong enough to digest bone, but can't digest fiber.

It is acknowledged we can't digest fiber, and it was never proven it helps our bacteria to move and digest, it's just blindly assumed and rehearsed.

Fiber alkalizes your digestive track, making you unable to digest animal matter properly, for which you need acidic tract. Aajonus recommends eating vegetation with cooked meat to add enzymes, because it's desd and over acidic, but getting such alkaline food will make you unable to digest raw animal matter for a day.

Vegetarians have more cancer, allergies, tooth decay, mental illnesses and worse quality of life:
https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0088278
There are studies showing the opposite, but they don't take healthy user bias into account and compare vegetarians with general population that consumes seed oils and alcohol. I don't know how did they manage to overcome healthy user bias here.

Women fed soy formula have worse menstrual cramps later in life:

Oxalates promote kidney stones:
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC10278359/

Glucosinolates and Isothiocyanates: These are found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and kale. When the plant tissue is damaged, enzymes called myrosinases convert glucosinolates into isothiocyanates, which are toxic or unpalatable to herbivores.

Oxalates can bind to calcium, this binding can reduce absorption of these minerals.

Eating anything together with phytic acid containing foods makes you unable to absorb iron, zinc calcium, magnesium and manganese from these foods eaten alongside it:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227659086_Minerals_and_phytic_acid_interactions_Is_it_a_real_problem_for_human_nutrition

Sulfurofane is a toxic compound in many vegetables, which is not present in them until you chew them/chop them, the cells then create this poison when you destroy integrity of the cells in order for you to not eat the plant. Don't eat it then.

Grains contain phytic acid. Eating oysters increases zinc, and other mineral levels in the blood, however eating oysters together with maize, corn, tortillas or similar grain products containing phytic acid makes the zinc in blood not rise, and makes zinc and other minerals bot get absorbed. Phytic acid is contained in nuts, grains, seeds, legumes, and more.

It causes ataxia even in non-celiacs:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26676361/

For 28 modern human specimens from 190 to 25 thousand years ago, average brain volume was estimated to have been about 1,478 cc (90.2 cu in), and for 13 Cro-Magnons about 1,514 cc (92.4 cu in). In comparison, present-day humans average 1,350 cc (82 cu in), which is notably smaller.
Why?

Gluten destroys your gut:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC11053402/

"Our data revealed a decrease in the overall well-being and quality of life of individuals with functional GI symptoms while unknowingly consuming gluten, thereby confirming that GI and extra-GI symptoms were triggered by gluten and that a GFD can have a beneficial effect on health."

Gluten destroys your gut, even in people who do not have celiac disease:

https://drruscio.com/gluten-cause-leaky-gut-everyone/

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25734566

Having leaky gut makes undigested and undesirable particles leak into the blood stream and easily cross the blood-brain barrier:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30340384/

So Ataxia is when antibodies that try to fight off gluten accidentally attack your brain supposedly, after gluten presumably enters your blood brain barrier through the blood after leaking through the gut into the bloodstream

Corn tortillas make you unable to absorb any zinc from oysters consumed alongside with them:

https://www.atherosclerosis-journal.com/article/S0021-9150(12)00522-9/abstract




Very comprehensive article talking about dangers of statins, which include lowered libido, muscle pain, neuropathy, memory loss, and worse:

"Recent study indicating that patients with chronic heart failure benefit from having high levels of cholesterol rather than low. heart failure patients for at least 12 months.17 Survival was 78 percent at 12 months and 56 percent at 36 months. They found that for every point of decrease in serum cholesterol, there was a 36 percent increase in the risk of death within three years."

"Low cholesterol levels are associated with increased rates of cancer."

Tens of studies proving high cholesterol levels to be safe, and Statin drugs to be dangerous, causing ton of physical and mental issues, because they suppress the NATURAL production of cholesterol and other compounds by the body.

DECREASING BLOOD CHOLESTEROL LEVELS DID NOT SLOW DOWN NOR SUPPRESS THE BUILD UP OF ARTERIAL PLAQUE IN ANY OF EXPERIMENTAL GROUPS TAKING STATINS.

"We confirm from the review of the literature on epidemiological data, meta-analysis, and clinical interventions where dietary cholesterol challenges were utilized that there is not a direct correlation between cholesterol intake and blood cholesterol. This lack of correlation is mainly due to the compensatory mechanisms exerted by the organism to manage excess dietary cholesterol, including decreases in cholesterol absorption and down-regulation of cholesterol synthesis. A great number of epidemiological studies and meta-analysis indicate that dietary cholesterol is not associated with CVD risk nor with elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. Clinical interventions in the last 20 years demonstrate that challenges with dietary cholesterol do not increase the biomarkers associated with heart disease risk."

This book contains a staggering amount of scientific literature, some of them with implications for your health and some of them directly about health

It discusses ability of will influencing events, your DNA experiencing your emotional response even when removed from your body, plants being conscious, and able to completely measurably register your intentions (they register emotional distress on a polygraph not only when you harm them, or when are exposed to person that harmed other plants in her proximity, but show emotional distress on a polygraph after you only start thinking about harming them, how crazy!), measurable light auras that living beings emit, "morphic resonance", or something as Jungian collective consciousness, your body receiving an emotional response several seconds before receiving the information that is supposed to trigger it, being able to experience emotional distress of your relative who is hundreds of miles away, near death experiences, and way more.

Anyone who is not on his death bed, and is going to continue living for several decades at least, will benefit from being more aware of the nature of reality that he is living in, and thus I recommend anyone to listen to this book.

Near infrared saunas:

Aajonus talked about Saunas not being good for detoxification of heavy metals, because they damage your eyes, lungs, skin (with too hot of temperature), and at the same time don't warm your tissues very well to detox you because of your temperature buffer around your body.

Near infrared saunas however, don't force you to breathe in hot steam, and the heat/light penetrates deep into your tissues, unlike other saunas, making you actually detox metals and chemicals from your tissues similarly to the Hot Bath protocol, although I don't know if, and suppose it doesn't actually melt the crystallized vegetable oils in the lymphatic system as the Hot Baths do, and therefore could substitute the 45 minute hot baths for detoxification, but not the lympathic baths for melting the crystallized vegetable oils.

Firefighters use infrared sauna therapies to detox heavy metals, and often they place white towels under themselves, and their sweat colors these towels in grey metallic colors.

Varis Ahmad describes the same experience, and heavily recommends them, claiming it helped him to reverse autistic-like symptoms from accumulated toxicity.

Varis Ahmad warns about far infrared saunas, claiming they will microwave you, stressing it has to be near infrared.

Aajonus didn't recommend infrared therapy, and I find anyone not open to it reasonable.
I myself however, after seeing all the scientific literature about near infrared light therapy (Which I provided in the pinned "Sun" posts, since near infrared light is an inherent part of Sunlight), and having heard all of the anecdotal data about it, am completely convinced in it's benefit for the human health, both for the sauna detoxification aspect, and the near infrared light aspect, despite being artificial.

Seed Oils 2:

Seed Oils damage mitochondria in rats:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17023268/

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6121934/

Seed Oils inhibit Mitochondrial function, making you literally produce less energy, making you less of a capable being overall:

Linoleic acid metabolites, such as 4-hydroxynonenal (HNE), can bind to and modify components of the ETC, specifically Complex I. This inhibits the ETC's ability to transfer electrons effectively, reducing the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation and thus the amount of ATP produced.

Cardiolipin is a unique phospholipid found in the inner mitochondrial membrane that is essential for the function of Complex III and IV in the ETC. Linoleic acid is one of the fatty acids that make up cardiolipin, but when oxidized, it leads to cardiolipin degradation. This degradation disrupts mitochondrial bioenergetics, reducing ATP synthesis efficiency

Seed oils increase heart disease:

Summary: Before seed oils were invented, when the whole world ate 0 seed oils and mostly animals fats, there were no heart attacks, they only appeared and risen with seed oil consumption.

As shown in the statins folder article I pinned from WPF, drastically decreasing blood cholesterol doesn't reverse atherosclerosis nor slow down plaque build up.
Atherosclerosis isn't caused by cholesterol, but by LDL being oxidized, which is caused by seed oil consumption.

Why is there cholesterol in the plaque may be because all scar tissue is made out of cholesterol, however increasing cholesterol increases survival of atherosclerosis and decreasing it does otherwise as documented in the studies from Cholesterol Myth book or WPF Dangers of Statin Drugs article

This study shown that seed oils lower cholesterol, great! But what isn't included in the abstract is that the seed oil group had more deaths than saturated animal fat group, despite their lower cholesterol, or maybe because of it.

Saturated fats don't cause heart disease:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9794145/#R2

American Heart association was to demonize seed oils, but was paid off by Procter and Gamble not to, someone from PaG even sent them a letter to not do it which still exists, I wasn't able to understand from the audio file tough who sent the letter.

It was in Sally Fallon's "Oiling of America Presentation".

Contrary to what does the abstract say, the findings of this study are:

Those who ate the most saturated fat, cholesterol and calories weight the least and were most physically active.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/1342260/

The lower the cholesterol levels, the more CVD and total deaths:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3560398/

This study, discussed very well in Oiling of America by Sally Fallon supposedly proved huge correlation of cholesterol and CVD, despite lower cholesterol causing more cancer, violence, suicide and other deaths, but Sally Fallon explained in detail how it didn't hold up in the presentation, which Im too lazy to do myself.

Water

https://youtu.be/PUHNb9jDf3M

Several interesting points:

If you speak certain words, or hold container of water next to your heart, and project certain emotions to it, after you freeze the water, it will have different structure under the microscope.

This study supports that:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16979104/

Masaru Emoto was the first to study this topic.

Your mitochondria are supposed to process hydrogen, deuterium is a kind of heavy nitrogen harder for your mitochondria ti process, the more deuterium you consume, the worse health you will have.
The closer you are to the equator, the more deuterium is in the food and water, but equatorial sunlight helps your body to handle it.

The farther away from equator, the less sun you get, you get as well less deuterium.

Then of course, Aajonus take on water.

Water hydrates you very poorly if h2o isn't bound to any nutrients, therefore it's better to drink raw milk, or always mix water with honey, raw eggs, and other substances, so the water becomes richer and easier to be consumed by your cells.

My favorite combination is honey, apple cider vinegar, several raw eggs, and naturally sparkling mineral water, although the mineral water being stored in glass rather than plastic is even more important than the sparkle being natural.

Consuming acv or lemon, which are great to make water really, really hydrating and tasty is my favorite thing to do, it tastes like lemonade, but, such acidic substances demineralize your body, and can make your teeth hurt or slowly cause deterioration not noticed at first, therefore these mustn't be consumed in excess.

I wouldn't care about this claim neither, but after consuming acv in this combination daily for months, I sprinked my ankle during work, during A small fall I think I was supposed to not get injured by, and don't know if possible ACV induced demineralization played a role in it.

Using honey and raw eggs alone with the water can make the water taste like sweetened banana milk from Müllermilch which I've tasted in childhood.

Placebo effect:

Hotel cleaning maids that were deliberately gaslighted/convinced/educated by the scientists that they are actually doing a big amount of very healthy physical labor in their job, which makes them very fit, became healthier and lost more weight, than the hotel maids that weren't educated on, and didn't realize/didn't think about how the job their are doing makes them physically fit.

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17425538/

13 boys who had severe allergies to a Japanese plant similar to poison ivy. On one arm, they rubbed a harmless plant leaf that they were told was from the poisonous plant and all 13 developed severe reactions. On the other arm, they rubbed the poisonous plant leaves but told them it was a harmless plant. In this scenario, only two of the boys showed signs of a reaction. So not only did these boys develop a reaction from a harmless plant, but 11 of the 13 boys altogether avoided a reaction from the plant that they were confirmed to be hypersensitive to. Additionally, the two boys who experienced reactions had much milder reactions on the arm that was exposed to the harmless plant.

Study was done in Japan in 1962 by Ikemi and Nakagawa, I find lot of mentions of it online, including pubmed, but fail to find the study itself.

The book "Spiritual Science" by Eric Dubay has a good chapter on placebo effect I recommend to listen to to those who are deeply interested in the topic.

Vision:

Birth control:

Women on Birth Control prefer men with less masculine faces;

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23528282/

Women who take birth control are more stressed out, a d have higher stress hormone levels:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0889159123003331?via%3Dihub

Women on birth control are more depressed:
https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC10294242/

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9218393/


Studies show ( https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC6055351/ ) that after quitting contraceptives, women are as fertile as ones who never took them. But I haven't seen anyone explore how does taking contraceptives affect the women's fertility long-time, especially after prolonged use, or if it can cause a sooner menopause.

Without any scientific backing, my common sense tells me, that fertility and children of a woman that has taken an artificial pill that is supposed to hormonally change her body in a way to be temporarily infertile because of her biochemical state for a prolonged time will always be inferior to fertility and children of a woman that hasn't.

Women can only get pregnant few days out of the month during and around ovulation, it is not worth it to take synthetic drugs that turn you temporarily infertile, when you can simply track your ovulation cycle

There is a study that I failed to find, about how men find body odor on clothes wore by women during ovulation more attractive. The same way, women find body odor of all men more attractive during ovulation + they find body odor of men with more symmetrical faces more attractive (without seeing their face), which hints that women can smell males with better genes.

This study also shown, that women who are taking birth control do not experience this extra attraction towards male body odor neither during ovulation, nor they felt more attraction towards body odor of men with symmetrical faces over other males, which hints that birth control affects mate seeking behavior of females who take it, to not be more active during ovulation and to not be more attracted to males with better face symmetry (which probably correlates to better genes)

Strippers on birth control get tipped less than strippers not on birth control:

Hormonal Contraceptives Increase Breast Cancer Risk

A 2017 Danish study published in The New England Journal of Medicine examined hormonal contraceptive use in 1.8 million women aged 15-49 over 10.9 years.

- Overall Risk: Women currently or recently using hormonal contraceptives had a 20% higher risk of breast cancer compared to non-users.
- Duration Matters: Risk increased with prolonged use, with women using contraceptives for over 10 years experiencing a 38% higher risk.

Insect consumption:

Edible insects contain lot of parasites:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31283777/

Exoskeletons of insects are made from chitin, which is allergenic, completely indegistable and damages our organs:
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28093332/

I know a someone who has an edible mealworm farm, and from observing dogs that eat those mealworms, you can see these mealworms 100% undigested in their feces, looking exactly the same as before ingestion, and through confession of that someone, when you don't chew the mealworms thoroughly, you can observe them completely undigested and unchanged in your own feces, similarly to corn.

That, apart from being completely disgusting, tells you that you shouldn't eat it, since you do not digest it. If you grind something completely indigestible into a powder, it just becomes a fine indigestible powder, and you still shouldn't eat it.

The problem lays in the exo-skeleton made from chitin.

Therefore, the consumption of worms or maggots which do not have a pronounced exo-skeleton isn't as problematic.

A2 Milk

A2 Casein Milk is better than A1 Casein Milk:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31305326/

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27039383/

If there are any symptoms caused by A1 milk, A2 milk reduces them.
https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38931316/

Muscles, and aesthetic physique:

Men who receive artificial testosterone and don't exercise develop more muscle mass than men who exercise:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/8637535/

Obviously, men with both artificial testosterone and exercise gain even more muscle size.

The amount of testosterone these subjects had was very high, some 3000 units per unit while today's average are some 500 units per unit.

Regardless, increasing your testosterone levels is just as / more important than exercise in order to gain muscle size.

Focusing on hormones makes sense.

Another good point is that Paul Saladino's colostrum supplements are banned in sports because growth hormones in the colostrum do not pass the doping test.

Many people have anecdotally reported that regardless of training style, as long as one trains with intent to gain mass, if that individual gets huge amount of his nutrition from raw meat, he gains very significant amount of muscle very fast.

One person I know said he gained 20 kg in a year after starting to eat raw meat, and I've gained over 15.

Overall, spamming one movement that works all year is better than having 20 different movements that are supposed to do more or less the same thing.


Nutrition:

Rely on fermented raw dairy (don't wash your bottles and it will ferment fast) for hydration instead of water, mix it with raw eggs and raw honey if you are bulking.

Avoid cold exposure, because it removes lactic acid, which makes you sore but is anabolic. It also wastes and draws energy from muscle repair to fight the cold and heat you up.

Vitamin A:

Vitamin A comes from nasty animal foods, like their fat and liver.

When you eat protein without fat, your body takes vitamin A from your own liver to be able to utilize it.

Every tribe Weston Price documented always ate meat with fat

Vitamin A is not toxic, poisoning from vitamin A happens from synthetic vitamin A, not real vitamin A.
You might get poisoned from eating Polar Bear Liver, however it is not known that any other animal's liver will give you vitamin A poisoning, therefore it's not a concern if you aren't eating a Polar Bear.
It hasn't been proven either, that vitamin A is the cause of Polar Bear liver poisoning, where is the conclusive evidence that it's caused by Vitamin A, and not let's say Cadmium, that the Polar habitat is full of?

This means, it doesn't seem as it's necessary to have your glasses block it. However, I am still fan of blue light glasses that block out green light as well, because they make your vision way darker and way more pleasant to see any lights in than the orange ones.

Blue Light, 2:

People with less natural light exposure during the day, and more artificial night exposure during the night are dying more, and vice versa, 88 000 subjects with light meters on them. They have worse heart health, more blood sugar and diabetes:

I share this information in bulk like if it was just data to take note of, but most of the studies I share are a reason to lean back in exhaustion and inability of comprehension of what evil is being done to millions across all of the Earth because of ignorance of the masses, and malevolence of those the masses let rule over them, and chain smoke with face expressing serious concern.

Anthony Fauci called RFK Jr. a liar for stating that not one of the 72 vaccines mandated for children has ever been safety tested*.

In response, RFK Jr. took legal action, and after a year of delays, Fauci's lawyers conceded that RFK Jr. had been correct.

"There's no downstream liability, there's no front-end safety testing... and there's no marketing and advertising costs, because the federal government is ordering 78 million school kids to take that vaccine every year."

"What better product could you have? And so there was a gold rush to add all these new vaccines to the schedule... because if you get onto that schedule, it's a billion dollars a year for your company."

"So we got all of these new vaccines, 72 shots, 16 vaccines... And that year, 1989, we saw an explosion in chronic disease in American children... ADHD, sleep disorders, language delays, ASD, autism, Tourette's syndrome, ticks, narcolepsy."

"Autism went from one in 10,000 in my generation... to one in every 34 kids today."

Frequencies:

528Hz reduces oxidative stress and induces testosterone production in rats brains:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30414050/

Listening to 528hz music increases oxytocin, and decreases stress hormones in the blood, unlike listening to 440hz music:

https://www.researchgate.net/publication/327439522_Effect_of_528_Hz_Music_on_the_Endocrine_System_and_Autonomic_Nervous_System

432Hz music was more satisfying, and lowered blood pressure and heart rates of the participants of this study than 440hz music:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31031095/

Natural sounds are (very unsurprisingly) tuned into natural frequencies, so is the human voice.

Religious hymns and songs, although not always tuned to the frequency, are high vibrational.

These tests have been repeated on many kids between 5 and 6 years old, and every consecutive test has confirmed that kids who spend more then 3 hours watching television or playing video games, were less imaginative and creative, than kids who don't.

TV is definitely poison for the young minds in development, and it is ruining the natural creativity and the imagination.

Ultrasounds:

Ultrasounds heat the fetus, safety of something like that is unclear:

Infrared light present in sunlight gives energy to "Cytochrome C Oxidase" which stimulates it.

This causes enhanced ATP production in the mitochondria.

Which then causes:

1. Improved cellular repair and regeneration
2. Reduces oxidative stress

Caffeine is an insecticide the plant has to kill bugs trying to eat it, the energy you get is a stressful adrenaline rush of your body getting shocked from being poisoned.

Love:

In Eric Dubay's Spiritual Science, 2 studies which I am TOO LAZY to find right now, one in Kirlian Photography, other in I believe PSY Science, showed

-light emitted by couples in love radiated way stronger than individual lights, and merged

-Light emitted by couples not in love sort of rejected each other

-If one set his intention, he could influence a computer generating 2 kinds of results, to generate more of certain results, just by willing it to.

-Couples in love doing the same experiment, increased the amount of certain results generated 12 fold - 6 times fold for each of them.

That one blows my mind.

Studies showing that people with plenty of love live longer:

https://ccare.stanford.edu/psychology-today/the-best-kept-secret-to-longevity-love/

I am not going to look about studies showing that having higher oxytocin in blood reduces stress hormones and having lot of love makes you more relaxed and less stressed in life. Because, DUH, OBVIOUSLY.

I am instead going to point out, that vast majority of divorces ever, happened only to people, who haven't hugged their partner while telling them they love them and asking them what can they do for them to make them happier every day they were together.

I do not understand, how can people be in relationships, without constantly hugging, cuddling with, caressing nor expressing affection to their partner.

The more you will do these things, the happier your lives will be.

Oxytocin, the hormone of love literally makes you feel good.
Increase in oxytocin - increase in feeling good, joy, happiness, the feeling of love.

There is no downside to oxytocin, it just makes you feel happy, and the more you have of it, the more you will be happy. Increasing it, is like increasing happiness, and it's free and limitless, just like the sun.

If you have a partner, then maximizing bonding activities with that partner, to maximize the amount of oxytocin you produce makes you both happier, for free.

There is no reason to not completely take advantage of this free source of happiness, besides laziness and lack of love towards your partner.

Hug, and express affection with your partner every day.

Not doing so, is exactly like not going into the sun every day.

Love against pain.

When asking your doctor for vaccine ingredients of vaccine for your child, the ingredients will be similar.

Vaccines 2:

Dr. Exley looked into brains of autistic people, and they were full of aluminum, which the body dumps into the brain through lympathic system when it receives aluminum (in form of vaccine):

https://youtu.be/lvIwnKK2k9Y

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32385326/

Couple that with Thomas Burbacher study that shown that mercury from vaccines goes to the brain tissue as well.

Mortality from infectious diseases was drastically lowering with modernization of our lives decades before vaccinations were implemented, and vaccines did not contribute to the decrease:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/413067/

While one in millions might die from whooping cough, making it statistically unreasonable to undergo such treatment.

A Slovak study pointing out that there is no proof for vaccines working to give us a collective immunity:

https://rizikaockovania.sk/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/kolektivna_imunita-myty_a_fakty.pdf

The study reached a conclusion, that if the vaccination works, the vaccinated individuals have nothing to fear from the unvaccinated, and if it does not work reliably, it is not permissible to force anyone to do it.

Attached to this post, there are images of graphs showcasing decreasing mortality of various infectious diseases from several different countries, and when was the vaccine for such disease implemented

Most of the time, it was implemented After the mortality was reduced drastically.

Top right in every image, you can see the sources from which the data were taken.

1. Look at typhoid a scarlet fewer, which's mortalities dropped despite no widespread vaccination for them.

2. More detail on Measles in US.

3. England and Wales, no vaccination for Scarlet Fewer, and it dropped, vaccines for other diseases came when there was basically nothing to vaccinate form.

4/5. More detail for England and Wales, no contribution conceivable.

The graphs below are based on official death toll figures recorded in the Central Yearbook of the Commonwealth of Australia and are taken from Greg Beattie's book "The Vaccination Parent's Dilemma." The graphs represent the decline in infectious disease deaths in Australia and clearly show that vaccination has nothing to do with the decline mortality.

The leading causes of child death in Australia between 1911 and 1935 were diphtheria, whooping cough, scarlet fever and measles. By 1945, in which mass vaccination programs had not yet been introduced, the combined mortality from these causes had dropped by as much as 95%. The author goes on to state that graphic evidence of the decline in mortality from infectious diseases in the USA, England, New Zealand and many other countries shows exactly the same trend.

For both diseases we vaccinate for, and diseases we dont vaccinate for.

The lack of worth of the flu vaccine is shown in a nutshell.

First Vaccinations were given in World War 2, but the number of vaccinations rise significantly in 1990.

"The government's Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) annually receives about eleven thousand reports of serious adverse effects of vaccination, including one to two hundred deaths and several times higher numbers of permanent disabilities. Despite the fact that these numbers are already alarming, they are only the tip of the iceberg because:

According to FDA estimates, only 1% of serious adverse reactions to vaccinations are reported.
The CDC admits that only about 10% of the listed problems are reported.
There has been testimony in the US Congress that medical students are advised not to report adverse reactions.
According to the NVIC's own study (the non-profit National Vaccine Information Center), doctors in New York would report vaccine-related deaths in only one out of every forty offices.
In other words, 97.5% of vaccine-related deaths and/or disabilities go unreported."

In December 2010, a study comparing the health status of vaccinated and unvaccinated children was launched in Germany. The study is still ongoing, here are the first interim results:

Almost 8,000 unvaccinated children have participated in the study so far.

The data are obtained from the German-wide KIGSS study of the health of the general population of children.

The collected data show a two- to five-fold higher morbidity in vaccinated children compared to unvaccinated children.

According to the authors, the results of this study may be distorted by the fact that parents of unvaccinated children also feed their children a healthy diet more often and prefer natural medicines instead of conventional medicines.

Graph from this study is attached to this post.

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3057555/

Other than this study, in 50 years, there was not a single government study comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children's health in the US by a government agent like CDC

What is the main argument of pharmacists, why it is not possible to carry out studies comparing vaccinated and unvaccinated children? Because vaccines are such a wonderful life-saving medicine that it is impossible not to give them to a child. They ignore the fact that there are thousands of unvaccinated children in groups that gather, for example, around alternative education or some religious beliefs.

Below is a chart tracking the dramatically increasing numbers of autistic children in the US. Modern medicine cannot explain this trend, but according to doctors, it certainly has nothing to do with vaccination! Vaccine manufacturers and their providers are surprisingly sure of this.

Despite Dr. Exley disagreeing heavily, since he found Aluminum from vaccines in the brains of autistic children.

Countries requiring more vaccinations have higher infant mortality rates:

https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC3170075/#:~:text=Linear%20regression%20analysis%20of%20unweighted,0.992%20(p%20%3D%200.0009).

"Linear regression analysis of unweighted mean IMRs showed a high statistically significant correlation between increasing number of vaccine doses and increasing infant mortality rates"

The lack of education of the opponents of vaccination is easily refuted by pointing to the fact that among the activists who demand free choice in vaccination are a number of experts, including those with medical training.

I cite The International Medical Council on Vaccination as an example of a medical organization rejecting mandatory vaccination. It is an association of doctors, registered nurses and other qualified health professionals who oppose the claims of pharmaceutical companies, the government and medical organizations. Among other things, this association considers vaccination to be an unacceptable risk for everyone, does not recognize the theory of collective immunity and demands that the right to refuse vaccination be enshrined in the constitution.

1992 Survey from New Zealand has shown that unvaccinated children have drastically less diseases:

https://pub.mednat.news/vaccini/The-1992-IAS-NZ-Survey-of-Vaccinated-vs.-Unvaccinated-Children.pdf

Results of the survey with 254 children:

Asthma:
20 (15%) Vaxxed
4 (3%)
Eczema or allergic rashes 43 (32%) 16 (13%) Unvaxxed
Chronic otitis:
26 (20%) Vaxxed
8 (7%) Unvaxxed
Recurrent tonsillitis:
11 (8%) Vaxxed
3 (2%) Unvaxxed
Shortness of breath and sudden infant death syndrome:
9 (7%) Vaxxed
2 (2%) Unvaxxed
Hyperactivity
10 (8%) Vaxxed
1 (1%) Unvaxxed

Parents who refuse vaccinations reported less asthma and allergies in their unvaccinated children:

Children in West Africa who received the DTP vaccine were twice as likely to die:

https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11110734/

Coming back to the before mentioned German KIGGS study:

According to the data, only four of the 8,000 unvaccinated children that were included in the 2011 release of the study responded as having severe autism, which is a mere 0,5% of the overall population. Meanwhile the autism rate among the general population, as tabulated in the German KiGGS study used for comparison, is about 1.1% percent.

This means that vaccinated children are about 2.5 times more likely to develop severe autism compared to unvaccinated children.

"We confirm from the review of the literature on epidemiological data, meta-analysis, and clinical interventions where dietary cholesterol challenges were utilized that there is not a direct correlation between cholesterol intake and blood cholesterol. This lack of correlation is mainly due to the compensatory mechanisms exerted by the organism to manage excess dietary cholesterol, including decreases in cholesterol absorption and down-regulation of cholesterol synthesis. A great number of epidemiological studies and meta-analysis indicate that dietary cholesterol is not associated with CVD risk nor with elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. Clinical interventions in the last 20 years demonstrate that challenges with dietary cholesterol do not increase the biomarkers associated with heart disease risk."

There is also small density lipoprotein LDL cholesterol, which is produced by the liver when you eat carbs, which is associated with metabolic syndrome, and large buoyant LDL cholesterol, which is the one that statins reduce, and which is the one which comes from dietary fats, and this one is completely UNRELATED to any health issues.

What are those

Not only that there isn't good and bad cholesterol, the cholesterol that was presumed to be bad is good, but also is divided into 2, one of which is indeed bad, but is caused by eating carbs and low fat and low cholesterol food.

When you capture certain birds, they still try to move the direction they usually migrate towards even in captivity, when time of their migration comes, even in closed buildings.

Raw Milk Safety:

The table below contrasts pathogen test data from pre-pasteurized milk vs. carefully-produced raw milk intended for direct human consumption. As illustrated in the table, pathogen testing of pre-pasteurized milk samples has detected pathogens in up to 33% of samples.  In contrast, there were zero pathogens detected in thousands of milk samples from raw milk intended for direct human consumption. It is clear from this test data from bulk tanks or milk silos that the risk profile of pre-pasteurized milk is categorically different from raw milk intended for direct human consumption.

Why the cattle being "infected with avian flu" or other horseshit doesn't make raw milk unsafe:

"The CDC readily acknowledges that mothers should continue to breastfeed their infants because “flu is not spread to infants through breast milk.” They know that breastmilk contains “antibodies and other immunological factors that can help protect her infant from flu.” Similarly, studies performed at the UC Davis dairy lab during COVID found that exposing a cow to coronavirus resulted in antibodies to coronavirus in her raw milk.

These studies were a further confirmation of what doctors and the owners of Alta Dena dairy knew way back in the 1960’s: cows that have been exposed to illnesses create antibodies to the illnesses which are then passed through their raw milk.

Further back in history, it was observed that the milk maidens of the 1700-1800s did not catch smallpox because of their exposure to cowpox by being around dairy animals and drinking raw milk.

The pioneering PARSIFAL and GABRIELA studies of more than 55,000 kids in Europe really set the international high bar for studies on raw milk. The overall findings included reduced rates of asthma, eczema, respiratory illnesses, fevers, allergies, and ear infections in children who drank raw milk.

At the symposium, it was emphasized that during all of those studies and over twenty years of research, there was never a “red flag event.” A red flag event would be a reported illness from raw milk consumption. The studies included data from more than 20,000 children who drank raw milk, and there was not a single red flag event!

Raw Meat:

Only carcinogens in Red Meat claimed by the WHO are created by cooking

Digestive leukocytosis: Every time you eat cooked food, your body draws a ton of white blood-cells into the digestive track, when you eat a raw food together with it, it mitigates it
Eat raw food - it doesn't happen

Cooking destroys, water-soluble vitamins, stem cells, creatine, Phosphorus, magnesium, and other nutrients, all light emitted by the meat, and all exclusion zone water

Cooking destroys, water-soluble vitamins, stem cells, creatine, Phosphorus, magnesium, and other nutrients.

Cooking cauterizes most of the minerals.

Cooking destroys all enzymes and kills all digestive bacteria.

Cooking creates Lipid peroxides, acrylamides, and heterocyclic amines, these 3 are carcinogenic, then it creates advanced glycation end products, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, and other toxins.


Raw meat has more nutrients:

Italian, Emma Morano lived to 117 years eating raw steaks and raw eggs

Maasai, Inuit, Nenet and other tribal people all eat raw meat worldwide, Japanese people consume lot of raw meat including raw chicken, Europeans consume lot of steak tartare and carpaccio, Ethiopians eat lot of raw meat, so as it seems, the whole world consumes raw meat regularly without any issues.

Pottenger's cats was an experiment where controlled groups of cats were fed cooked vs raw meat, raw meat cats remained healthy, cooked meat cats developed degeneration over generations. Their bones grew weaker, infertility was rampant, females became masculine and males feminine, they developed diseases and after several generations died out because of their inability to reproduce. Raw meat was able to reverse degeneration caused by cooked meat. We are not identical to cats, but this proves that cooking food messes with their nutrient content.

If cooked meat caused us to evolve, Inuits who only eat raw meat wouldn't undergo evolution and wouldn't be as developed as us. If raw meat caused us to evolve, it would be requirement for our organism to keep consuming it, because our body evolved based on the consumption of cooked meat, however people who stop consuming cooked meat have no problem whatsoever. If we do not need cooked meat, then how did it make us evolve?
How come cooking meat caused us to evolve, if every other animal that is fed exclusively cooked meat/their natural diet cooked rather than raw degenerates instead of evolving?
Where is the scientific evidence supporting the claim raw meat made us evolve?

Kirlian photography shows that all living cells emit natural light, cooking any food, including meat reduces the light that is emitted.

Many people have anecdotally reported that regardless of training style, as long as one trains with intent to gain mass, if that individual gets huge amount of his nutrition from raw meat, he gains very significant amount of muscle very fast.

One person I know said he gained 20 kg in a year after starting to eat raw meat, and I've gained over 15.

1900 - 99% of fat consumed in US was animal fat
2005 - 86% of it is now seed oils

Minnesota Coronary Survey
fromIvan D. Frantz.
Over 9000 people were fed identical meals for 5 years, one group with seed oils, other with animal fats, seed oil group had lower cholesterol blood levels but wasn't living longer, in fact, in the seed oil group people over 65 were dying more.

2 groups over 60 were fed either animal fats or seed oils, people in seed oil group were dying more, despite there being twice as many heavy smokers in the animal fat group, the study took 8 years.

Grains contain phytic acid. Eating oysters increases zinc, and other mineral levels in the blood, however eating oysters together with maize, corn, tortillas or similar grain products containing phytic acid makes the zinc in blood not rise, and makes zinc and other minerals bot get absorbed. Phytic acid is contained in nuts, grains, seeds, legumes, and more.

It Wasn't Always Like This:

Weston A. Price: Nutrition and Physical Degeneration
A book about a dentist who has examined primitive tribes all over the world, none of them suffering from any degenerative diseases. All of them consumed very high amount of meat, saturated fat and cholesterol. He compared these populations with people from their tribes who have adopted the modern western diet, who then always developed the same degenerative, cardiovascular and diseases that people in the west suffer from. Native people on their native diets have no cancer, tooth decay, insomnia, cardiovascular disease, painful births, and etc. They have better developed skulls and bones, and calmer, happier children. Painful birth.

Maasai who consumed raw milk and raw blood we very superiorly built compared to other tribes living in the exact same environment as them, who were agricultural-based and ate more vegetation than animal products. Maasai prove raw animal-based diet influences your development, not just clean environment.

First Eskimo diagnosed with cancer was in 1936, after 80 years of consuming sugar in the colonies, first eskimo diagnosed with heart disease was a similar case - long consumption of western diet. Otherwise, Eskimos consume seal and whale blubber - pure saturated animal fat as most of their diet, and have no heart disease.

Same with the Maasai.

"We confirm from the review of the literature on epidemiological data, meta-analysis, and clinical interventions where dietary cholesterol challenges were utilized that there is not a direct correlation between cholesterol intake and blood cholesterol. This lack of correlation is mainly due to the compensatory mechanisms exerted by the organism to manage excess dietary cholesterol, including decreases in cholesterol absorption and down-regulation of cholesterol synthesis. A great number of epidemiological studies and meta-analysis indicate that dietary cholesterol is not associated with CVD risk nor with elevated plasma cholesterol concentrations. Clinical interventions in the last 20 years demonstrate that challenges with dietary cholesterol do not increase the biomarkers associated with heart disease risk."
