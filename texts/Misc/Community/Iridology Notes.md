thick fibers=good life

thin fibers=low cellular life

mercury: black

Aluminum: silver lavenderish
blueish sclera indicates that aluminum is in the bone marrow

grey eyes: full of metals throughout system

arsenic: green radiant compound

heavy white: possible scarring which is dead cells collecting 

white dots: infection

yellow: penicillin often in nervous system and intestines, can be throughout whole body. it causes 90% of all crohns and ibs

if your eyes are supposed to be blue but they're green, it's a massive amount of penicillin

brown spots: could be penicillin shots that the body used iron or iodine that's oxidized (same as rusting) to destroy penicillin molds. this could cause a lot of problems such as anemia because it's a great loss of iron in the body. if it is black under the brown then it's vaccines or other injections where mercury is stored and the body used iron and/or iodine that's oxidized to seal it. (seal it in)

iodine seems to be brown orange or red

ALL eyes show signs of penicillin nowadays, profusely. some less then others.

the people with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue either have the largest amount of penicillin in their eyes or heavy metals all over the place

windex: likely chartreuse (he may have been talking about palms, i doubt it)

cancer: "Well, she has a more of an orange circle around the pupil. It’s not dark brown anymore – it used to be dark brown – it is mainly orange right now, which is indicative of cancer. Anyone who has a complete orange circle around the pupil is already starting to develop cancer, whether they have tumors or not."

orange stuff might be from antibiotics, maybe fungus

Pupil: If it is not a flat black, you’ve got shiny green behind it, or silver-lavenderish colors, or usually all three, with mercury, then you have the soup of vaccines: the formaldehyde, the mercury and the aluminum.

Grayish white tissue indicates mass cellular death, organic debris and scarring.

sulfur: likely yellow or orange

brown and orange:  "That brown/orange patch at around 11:30 looks similar to my patch which Aajonus said was a toxic combo of iodine and sulfur. He recommended raspberries for the detox." 

Aajonus: Well, you will see either a discolored brown area over that whole space. That means that it could metastasize, the whole area. Or if he has just a brown spot, that means it’s very localized. Or, if it’s a hole, it’s a lesion and it doesn’t show up with yellow around it, then it’s not likely to metastasize. But that particular area, being that dead ... because when it’s a lesion, you have no idea what’s in there. You have no idea what’s in that dead tissue. And let’s say somebody stored a massive amount of all their life’s X-rays, stored all the radiation in that one part of the body. When that starts decomposing and getting into the system, or a tumor starts building around that area and starts secreting its fluids to decompose it, massive vomiting. It’s not pretty. So you really don’t have any idea what’s in that area. That’s why I like to ask as many questions as I can, just to get all the information. "Have you taken a lot of aspirin, antihistamines?" Just anything, so you know what might be stored in that area.

purple: too much radiation 

stomach halo: overly acidic 

Ideally we want the iris fibers to run straight and tight from the pupil to the iris edge.

AV: A transversal is an iris fiber that has gone askew; it runs sideways. About 25% of the population has them. (should be because of toxicity from the mother. what she was eating while she was pregnant too) Ideally we want the iris fibers to run straight and tight from the pupil to the iris edge.
 
AV: The outer half of each eye applies to the respective quadrant, outer quadrants of the body and the inner half applies to the opposite inner quadrants of the body, except in some engineers and almost all inventors.

AV: Particular areas where fibers are fractionated, divided, it's like pointless art. That shows that the poisons are going intracellular rather than extracellular.

this suggests that these industrial solvents may be green in the eyes: 

AV: Like a lot of people when they return I'll see lots of aluminum in their stomach lining and their body will have detoxified a lot of that loose aluminum. And then all of a sudden it's green in those industrial solvents. So then they have formaldehyde or bleach or some kind of industrial solvent, DDT pesticides in their stomach lining.

grey in the sclarea: tin or aluminum, possible other things too
  
bright blood red spots are hemorrhage

dark red spots could be iron deposits that are rusting

when lymphatic rosary is yellow, that means it has penicillin in the lymph glands

Aajonus: Well, you will see either a discolored brown area over that whole space. That means that it could metastasize, the whole area. Or if he has just a brown spot, that means it’s very localized. Or, if it’s a hole, it’s a lesion and it doesn’t show up with yellow around it, then it’s not likely to metastasize.

So you really don’t have any idea what’s in that area. That’s why I like to ask as many questions as I can, just to get all the information. 

Aajonus: But I couldn’t tell without looking in the eyes. If she has cirrhosed tissue, then maybe not. So I wouldn’t know without seeing her eyes. — So there would be a lot of dead spots in the eyes in that case. A lot of lesions, if there were a lot of cirrhosed tissue. Aajonus: No, cirrhosed tissue usually comes up as brown. Yellow throughout.— (Inaudible.) are pervading the whole... Aajonus: Pervading. You know areas are that off color brown, covering that area where those deep holes are, where the lesions are.

irises only show the outside of cells

palms only show the inside of cells

palm reading is more important according to aajonus
