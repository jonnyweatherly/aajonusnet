I have seen them and been aware of them since 1997. From the mountains of Malibu, California, at 8:00 am on Friday, November 18, 2005, I watched jets in the skies over Ventura and Los Angles Counties streaking the skies with chemtrails. They have occurred almost everyday since. Some days as many as 80 patterns existed, going from the ocean to 40 miles inland. The chemtrails drifted from as far as Oxnard and fall on all Los Angeles County inhabitants. Chemtrails are frequently sprayed directly over all areas of Los Angeles County. They are being reported in most areas of the USA. Nearly daily since Friday, November 18, 2005, chemtrails streaked the skies at Venice Beach, drifting inland over Los Angeles residents.

When we see a cloudy tail following a jet streaking the sky and that tail dissolves within minutes, that is a contrail. Contrails form above 33,000 feet when hot engine exhaust momentarily condenses ice crystals into pencil-thin vapor trails that quickly vanish behind a jet. However, chemtrails, looking initially look like contrails, are thicker, remain extended across the sky and are sprayed in varying patterns:  x's, tic-tack-toe grids, cross-hatch and parallel lines. Instead of quickly dissipating, chemtrails expand. Usually within thirty minutes, they open into wispy formations, looking like cirrus-type clouds (thin veil clouds) that persist for hours but slowly waft from the skies on our families, friends and strangers below.

Laboratory examination of those chemicals found that they were manufacturing wastes from military industry and biowarfare substances. In several laboratory analyses, the composition of chemtrails was revealed:

1. Aluminum barium
2. Aluminum Oxide
3. Bacilli and Molds
4. Pseudomonas Aeruginosa
5. Pseudomonas Florescens
6. Bacilli Amyloliquefaciens
7. Streptomyces
8. Enterobacteriaceae
9. Serratia Marcscens
10. Human white Blood Cells-A restrictor enzyme used in research labs to snip and combine DNA
11. Enterobacter Cloacal
12. Other Bacilli and other toxic molds capable of producing heart disease and meningitis as well as acute upper respiratory and gastrointestinal distress.
13. Carcinogen Zinc Cadmium Sulfide.

###After chemtrails lingered, spread, covered entire skies and fell, reports of illnesses increased substantially...

such as persistent hacking coughs, upper respiratory and intestinal distress, pneumonia, fatigue, lethargy, dizziness, disorientation, headaches, aching joints and muscles, nosebleeds, diarrhea, bloody stools, depression, anxiety, loss of bladder control, and nervous tics. **Much of it is reported as flu and everyone but a few know that much of it is poisons dropped over our heads, inhaled, absorbed through our skins, and consumed in our food.**

Using both electrostatic precipitation devices and hepa air filters to collect outdoor atmosphere samples, chemtrail researcher Cliff Carnicom and his associates have documented desiccated blood cells floating in the atmosphere in populated areas of both New Mexico and Colorado. With so many atmospheric samples containing biological components, Carnicom concludes that **crimes of the highest order** are being perpetrated against citizens without their knowledge or consent.


Witnesses have documented and photographed military KC-135’s, KC-105 and white unmarked jets spray chemtrails. Airport personnel and pilots confirmed specific commercial airliners leaving the long-lasting chemtrails. Although chemtrails are frequently reported, the US Government continues to deny the existence of chemtrails.

###In 1994, it was established in a senate committee that the military was developing genetically engineered pathogens since the 1960’s...

when the military initiated a special viral cancer program with the intent to create contagious cancers for biowarfare? There is much laboratory evidence that gels, webs, powders and blood cells have been used to harbor viruses, mycoplasma and/or other bio-engineered toxins until they reach their host. Who besides the department of defense would have the money, power and inclination to besmirch our atmosphere with biological materials and have legal and media immunity?

**In August 2000**, observers began to report jets deploying chemtrails that looked like normal cloud formations. Three reports stated cloud formations dripped feathers and mare's tails. Citizen-based investigators believe that, since the military and government has received complaints about the chemtrails, they adjusted the chemtrail mix to be more clandestine. Chemtrail observers, including I, continue to see fake cirrus-type clouds on top of and surrounding real cumulus clouds.

###Generally, chemtrails spraying increases as clouds build.

They have been spraying most areas intensely in the USA, Canada, Europe and England since 1998, including areas with no commercial path's overhead. Even if you do not see chemtrails in your area, our food supply is being sprayed in farmlands across the USA. Frequently, I travel throughout the USA. I have observed chemtrails in at least 60 cities and farm towns that I visited since 1997. Many Americans reported seeing and feeling chemical mists fall from the sky following chemtrails. The media fails to cover the issue even though the health consequences are enormous. Environmentally conscious groups have had no luck pressing the media for coverage. Why is the media refuses to investigate and cover the story? Could it be pretense of "national security"?

Chemical weapons encapsulated in protective **coatings like synthetic webbing** would explain why many people who saw **web-like filaments** drifting down from the skies reported illness after contacting the webs. When webs were closely examined, they proved to be a man-made filaments of the type developed by both industrial and military entities. South Africans reported web-like filaments falling from an aircraft, forming a blanket like appearance across vegetation, telephone poles and fences, and E-boli soon followed. When cattle ate it, some developed large lumps on their hides, became listless and/or went blind. Examining collected material from the spray, a University of Michigan lab found pseudomonas fluorescens. That is the bug tested on Oakville residents.

It can cause human infections including fatal shock. The military likes it because it glows and allows them to track its path. Pathogens, including staph and several fungi that can cause lung disease were found in the chemical mix. In what must have been in bolder military arrogant fashion, during numerous chemtrail sprays, the small town Sallisaw in Oklahoma was saturated when a web like material covered the town. Lab technicians discovered large enterobacteria. The critter was a man-developed combination of E-Coli, salmonella and anthrax that could only be a U.S. military designer bug for biowarfare.

Standing before government officials in Louisiana where the military had determined to conduct open-air germ tests, **Captain Joyce Riley boldly told officials that the only acts of terrorism ever conducted on American soil were perpetrated by our own government. Is the US Government warning about terrorism yet committing acts of terrorism against its own citizens?**

During tests to perfect the technology, reports that aerosol barium titanate salt mixture was released from military aircraft, forming chemical trails in the atmosphere across America. **Barium salts** – radioactive material – were used in Libya, Panama and Desert Storm where they were sprayed and exploded over head to make people extremely sick and weak. Barium effects were accelerated and magnified by mixing and altering with other chemicals. Spectrum analysis revealed barium compounds but the other compounds were initially hidden by a shell around them. The shell, however, eventually released the other chemicals, **like time-released disease-pills**.

Is the military continuing open-air-testing in populated areas across the USA with dangerous chemical biowarfare, or arrogantly dumping military chemical waste on us? Whatever it is, we must stop this mass poisoning of us and our children now!

**Please call and fax them once a week! We must be insistent**: Contact your local and U.S. Senators and demand that they introduce and pass legislation to stop the chemtrails-poisoning of U.S. inhabitants.
