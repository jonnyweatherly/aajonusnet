### Aajonus answers regarding MMS (Miracle Mineral Solution)...

in an email.

It [MMS] is so toxic to the symptoms that very often all other detoxification stops and all nutrient resources for further detoxification are spent. As long as MMS is continued, any new supply of nutrients will be used to detoxifying MMS. People will go decades without symptoms and then suddenly fall hard to the accumulated toxins within their bodies.

There is plenty of research on the toxic effects of concentrations of chlorine intake.

appreciatively and healthfully,
