### Raw Cheese, No Salt Added

Sonnet Farms and Landmark Raw Milk Cheeses are fraudulently labeled; they
heat the milk to 137° F.

and sodium chloride as it is required for commercial sales. Some farmers make
their own homemade rennet that is completely natural and raw. Inquire with
each source to learn their sources of rennet.

### Raw Fresh Beef, Bison, Poultry

Soy must be heated and chemically processed to feed poultry, therefore **eggs
and meat from less soy-fed poultry is better**.

Most meat and poultry butchering facilities are inspected by the USDA and
therefore are required to treat the carcasses during processing with either a
citric acid solution or hydrogen peroxide solution and some bathe the carcass
in 180°F baths to disinfect and destroy bacteria. Some of the listings below
butcher their own animals and use no treatments at all so it is a good idea to
inquire how the butchering is done.

Also, when it comes to shellfish, it is required in the USA that all shellfish is
soaked in ultraviolet water tanks for up to 48 hours before the shellfish can be
sold. This included oysters, clams, mussels. The UV tanks are used to disinfect
the shellfish and destroy bacteria. Other countries including Canada do not put
shellfish in tanks and therefore are completely natural. You can request your
local market orders from Canada or you can try to get shellfish from a local
source directly before it is soaked in the tanks.

### Eggs

Soy must be heated and chemically processed to feed poultry, therefore eggs

Some egg farms listed here use fish meal and crab meal which is heated and
chemically processed in place of soy. Non heated and chemically processed
alternatives are raw meat scraps, and raw skim milk for protein sources.

### Sun-Dried Unsulphured Fruit

If you cannot get sun-dried fruit from your local health food store you can mail
order it from the source.

Most grocery stores sell organic tomatoes, cucumber, pears, apples and possibly
other produce with a wax coating to try to prevent mold and to make the
produce look better. The waxes can be paraffin or other so-called organic wax.
Paraffin is made from petroleum. It is a good idea to ask your grocer whether
the produce you get is waxed or not. Farmers markets generally don't wax
produce.

**_Jaffe Bros. Inc Natural Foods, CA_**

https://organicfruitsandnuts.com/

Tomatoes are sun dried. Some other fruits are sun dried and some dehydrated.
If a dehydrator is used, the temp is kept below 100°F. However, the medjool
dates are heated too high in rooms at 130-140°F.

Ask if their tropical dried fruits are artificially dried; I suggest that those not be
eaten.

### Raw Nuts and Seeds

Because nuts and seeds contain enzyme-inhibitors that may prevent proper
digestion of any protein eaten for up to 36 hours, nuts and seeds should be eaten
in a blenderized mixture with whole raw egg, unsalted raw butter or coconut
cream, and honey. That nut-formula neutralizes the enzyme-inhibitors. if you
cannot get nuts and seeds from your local health food store you can order them
online.

### Clay Sun-Dried

**Ask for nontreated clay**. Bentonite clay is too often from volcanic lava and
consists of toxic molten metals even though it may be metabolically reduced to
a fine clay powder. I recommend AGAINST all bentonite clays, including Aztec
Secret Healing Clay, and Pascalite Clay.

**_Terramin Clay, CA_**

Very light, mined from an old aqua-spring bed. This is the best clay. Order their
“Nutritional Clay” for consumption; “Silk Clay” for toothpaste/tooth polish and
face mask.

### Juicers

Aajonus recommended juicing vegetables, bland fruits and coconuts only. He
warned against juicing and drinking high carbohydrate foods such as carrots
and fruits that are high in fructose (fruit sugar) because they tend to create
bipolar emotional behavior.

Best juicers for leafy vegetables and coconut meat are:

- Green Star Elite
- Green Power Gold (also called Green Star Gold)
- Green Star 1000
- Green Life.
- Zstar, Z-710 Manual Juicer — juices celery, parsley, vegetables. **Not for**
    **juicing coconuts**. Good choice for people with EMF sensitivities. Can be
    used to grind meats using the homogenizing screen that comes with it.

_Green Star Elite_ and _Green Power Gold_ are heavier duty juicers than _Green Star
1000_ and _Green Life_ for people who juice for more than one person.

Check https://www.tribestlife.com/ , Amazon.com and other online stores.

The **Angel juicer** is poorly designed and difficult to clean; some parts may cut
your fingers.

### Canning Jars & Glass Containers

Check your local grocery stores and online retailers for Ball canning jars in 4, 8,
16 and 32 oz. jars. Do an online search for ball jars — numerous sites will show

**Aajonus’ Chronic Constipation Remedy**

```
Place 1/4 teaspoon unheated honey with 3 tablespoon each of unsalted raw
butter, raw cream and raw coconut cream into an 8 - ounces jar. Screw the cap
on the jar and let stand in bowl of hot water (not hot enough to bum your hand)
for 4-5 minutes.
When ingredients are a little above body temperature, shake vigorously and
suction into bulb syringe. Get on hands and knees and insert bulb syringe into
rectum and squeeze mixture into rectum, and hold mixture inside all night while
sleeping. That will coat the sigmoid colon where most constipation occurs and
mixture will gradually move into the upper colon where it will feed the E.coli
that is responsible for making food for brain and nerves.

**Aajonus’ Remedy for Ex-smokers**

```
This is a remedy for ex-smokers and second-hand smokers who want to
dissolve and cleanse the hardened and crystallized tobacco tars from their
bodies. It would be best to juice the green tobacco through the Green Star or
other Green model until you have 12 to 30 ounces.
Light and second-hand smokers may consume 3 drops per day; that will be 12
ounces over 9 months.
Heavy long-term smokers may consume up to 7 drops per day; that will be 30
ounces over 9 months. Keep in glass jar.
Add 1 or 2 ounces respectively of good water from well or glass-bottled water
(if carbonated, shake until carbon evaporates), 3 or 6 drops respectively of raw
apple cider vinegar, 3 or 6 drops respectively of lemon juice, blenderize for 20
seconds, and let ferment in a dark cupboard for about one week, or longer if
necessary to produce gas in the jar.
Refrigerate it after a week, or when it gases.
Remedy : I suggest adding 3 or 7 drops fermented green tobacco-juice mixture
to a green vegetable juice once daily sometime between 1 1 am-1:30 pm.
Consume every day for 6 weeks, stop for 1 day, resume for 6 weeks, stop for one
day, resume for 6 weeks, stop for one day, resume for 6 weeks, stop for 1 day,
resume for 6 weeks, stop for 6 days, resume for 8 weeks.

**Aajonus’ Laundry Soap Recipe**

1. Start with very **fermented coconut cream.**
2. Add **1 table spoon of lemon juice** to one cup of coconut cream, letting it
    stand in heat for at least 2 days.
3. Pour it into 1 quart of water.
That means you will have 4 cups of water and one cup of fermented coconut
cream. If you have a laundry ball, use about 1/4 cup of fermented coconut
cream/water with each laundry load.
(email, March 26, 2013)


“I suggest that we do not use soaps for cleaning anything except laundry. Many
“ecologically” friendly soaps and cleansers are not friendly to us or the
environment. They may contain on the average 30% biodegradable substances
and the rest are the same chemical toxins used in commercial products.

**To clean my dishes** , I simply use warm water with 2 tablespoons raw apple
cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon sea salt and 1 teaspoon coconut cream.

**For my body** , I use fresh or fermented coconut cream that leaves my body
moisturized and protected against environmental toxins.”

```
(Primal Diet Newsletter# 12, October 7, 2008)
```
“Keep natural. **Use coconut cream as soap**. If you do not want your hair to be
so oily from using coconut cream as shampoo, simply let it ferment out of the
refrigerator until it turns pink and dilute it with water. Then wet your hair
before applying the diluted coconut cream.

**Wear and use only natural materials, cotton, wool, silk and hemp**. The
same natural fabrics should be used for bedding, furniture and rugs. We must
avoid industrial and medical contamination. We should eat a balanced raw diet,
such as my Primal Diet. “

## QUALITY FOODS FOR PRIMAL DIET™

Aajonus was a teacher. He gave his wisdom so that people could take care of
themselves and would be aware of how many layers exist to being healthy and
having high quality foods.

When Aajonus created his original Product List he had methodology and criteria
for food evaluation and locating the best foods. When inquiring with a potential
producer, he would ask the owner of the farm to send him a signed letter stating
the details of how the farm does things and/or how a particular product was
produced, such as olive oil, honey extractions, and so on.

For every product listed here, Aajonus would say to always stay on top of the
source regularly, to make sure the methods remain at Primal Diet quality. Good
farmers are very open to questions. Farmers that are not focused on quality are
usually not that open to questions.

Requiring a signature documents the owner’s statement. For instance, several
farm owners have said things over the phone or by email such as “we don’t feed
our bees sugar syrup or corn syrup”. When then asked for a letter stating that
with the owner’s signature, the owner ignores the request or says "why does it
matter to sign it?" or "I don't have time to draft it.” On several occasions those
farms have later been found to have been feeding the bees sugar syrup.

Aajonus had high standards for foods that are good for your health, such as:

- Raw honey should never be heated above 93°F. The enzymes are damaged
    starting at 93°F and start to convert to processed sugar.
- Cold pressed oils should be processed below 96°F.
- Always ask for fresh, never frozen meats and dairy. When meats have been
    frozen, they lose the regenerative elements involved in cellular division,
    nutrients are damaged, and byproducts form.
- Eggs should never be washed or refrigerated. Unwashed eggs last longer and
    the bacteria is healthy; you avoid chemicals that may be a part of the
    washing. Egg shells are transparent and eggs absorb chemicals to which the
    shells have been exposed. Even brand-new cardboard cartons can create
    toxins in the eggs from the outgassing fragrances.


- All ground meats should be ground **once**. When ground more than once, it
    homogenizes the fats and turns the meat into a fuel instead of
    building/regenerating substance.
- Not all cheese is made the same. All rennet from commercial sources is
    cooked and sanitized, has salt, additives and preservatives. The old way to
    make rennet was from a calf’s stomach lining where the natural rennin is
    found. Old cheese makers just cut a piece of the stomach and put it into a big
    vat of milk to make cheese. Miller's Organic Farm makes home-made rennet
    cheese according to Aajonus’ instructions. Other farmers are open to making
    rennet if requested. You must request that they try a traditional method.
- Commercial cultures such as kefir are not as healthy as natural cultures.
    Inquiring about the cultures used in cultured butter, cream, cheese and other
    products would be something he would suggest. Commercial cultures are
    sterilized/caked just like rennet.
- Don’t store food in very cold refrigerators. Aajonus would not store milk
    below 42°F. Colder than that can alter the nutrients and bacteria, and reduce
    absorption. He would always choose bacteria over sanitation. The body is
    99.99% bacteria.
- When you have a choice between a USDA inspected and treated meat and a
    small farm that butchers the animal without any treatment or USDA
    inspection, always choose the non-treated meat. USDA inspected meats are
    all treated in some way. Examples are that the meats have been washed in
    180°F water to disinfect and destroy bacteria, and/or have been sprayed
    with citric acid solution or hydrogen peroxide.
- When getting fresh bone marrow, make sure the farm never vaccinated the
    animals or gave them dewormers. The chemicals and heavy metals from
    those solutions store in the bone marrow in the animals. When you eat the
    marrow, you absorb those metals and chemicals. Non-vaccinated animals
    have very healthy bone marrow. Eating healthy bone marrow with meats
    creates 2-3 times cellular division and regeneration of the body because of
    the stem cells.
- Many grocery stores carry organic produce that is waxed with Paraffin wax
    which is made from petroleum, coal or shale oil. Produce which are
    confirmed to be waxed are organic tomatoes, cucumbers, pears, apples and
    likely others. Some markets do offer non-waxed so it is a good idea to ask
    your market. Most farmers markets do not sell waxed produce.


## Checklist for Pure, Organic Dairy Practices & Products for Primal Dieters

✓ Cattle are grazed on **open, organic pasture**.

✓ Cattle are fed only organic, unheated grains.

✓ Cattle **do not have salt added to their feed**. No salt is optimal; salt blocks
are acceptable.

✓ Cattle are **not fed soy beans**. Cattle may eat soybeans raw; they digest it fine.
It just makes the milk and meat taste like cardboard. Fowl and humans
cannot eat raw soybeans.

✓ Cattle are **not vaccinated**. After calfdom because you are unlikely to find a
cow or steer that has not ever been vaccinated. And **no dewormers** given to
cows including applied to the hide along the spine.

✓ Cattle are **not given Vitamin C or any other type of injection**.

✓ **No bleach** is used on milk collecting equipment. Bleach is a neurotoxin and
chloroform is carcinogenic.

✓ **No iodine** is used on cow’s teets for mastitis secretions or prior to milking.
Isolated iodine is a very toxic chemical for both cows and humans. It is a free
radical and accumulates in the body causing thyroid and other glandular
malfunctions as well as internal lesions and irritation. Diluted unpasteurized
raw apple cider vinegar is preferred for cleaning the teets prior to milking
and for mastitis secretions.

✓ **No detergents** are used in bottling or in cleaning milking equipment but if
used, the equipment must be rinsed many times. If it is necessary, use soap.

**Consider** : All chemicals used in the feeding/treatment of cattle or the gathering
of milk make the cows and their products non-organic!


## DAIRY FEED ANALYSIS

October 6, 2000

Re: Dairy Feed

Hi,

Thank you for your wonderful milk. It has provided many people with a means
to recover from varied levels of illness and improved the health of others.
However, I have been receiving reports from a few clients since they started
drinking Claravale 18 months ago. They say that they get nausea right after
drinking it. I theorized that their symptoms were a response to the increased
fat content of Claravale milk, causing bile and other detoxifications from glands,
such as the liver, pancreas and gallbladder, to dump into the stomach. However,
even a few patients who have fairly healthy glands, but have other sensitivities,
are experiencing symptoms. Stueve’s milk never produced that reaction, so I
decided to analyze the feed you have been giving your cows during milking, and
here is what I found:

**Steam-Rolled Barley and Corn**

In order to flatten grains, without having them crumble, they steam them. They
are a cooked food at that point and the grains cannot truly be considered raw.
They do this mainly for 2 reasons: 1) so that a certain percentage of grain
berries and kernels will not pass through the animals’ digestive system
undigested, and 2) so the feed doesn’t look like ground chicken feed. Not raw.

**Wheat Millrun**

Usually, the waste after milling wheat, containing bran and other pulp that
usually has absorbed the bulk of pesticides.

Often steamed because of molds. Not raw

**Whole Pressed Safflower Seed Meal**

This is the waste after heat pressing to remove the oil from safflower seed. Not
raw


**Ground Barley**

Usually low-grade grain for fodder. Not raw.

**Rice Bran**

Waste from hulling rice. Not raw.

**Cane Molasses**

Used to sweeten the feed to make it smell good to cows so they will eat it. It is
the garbage left at the bottom of the tanks after boiling sugarcane between 350-
600 º F.

It is heavily laden with free radicals and other toxins. Not raw.

**Vegetable Oil Blend**

The low-grade oil left after heat pressing and filtering vegetable oils. Not raw.

**Cottonseed Meal**

Usually the pulp left after heat pressing the oil out of cottonseed. Not raw.

**Molasses Dried Beet Pulp**

The garbage left at the bottom of the tanks after boiling sugar beets between
350 - 600º F, and dried. Heavily laden with free radicals and other toxins. Not
raw.

**Cotton Hulls (3.5%)**

The waste after hulling cotton (not cotton seed), containing most of the
pesticides applied to cotton crops. Basically, cotton hulls are indigestible in
herbivores. Contaminated fodder.

**Cane Molasses**

Repeat of above. Not raw.

**Calcium Carbonate**

Not a food. Usually the calcium separated from solid mineral-salt waste from
industrial processes.

**Salt**

Not a food. Sodium chloride dehydrates red blood cells and swells all other cells
without benefit in animals that eat raw food.

**Vitamin A Supplement**

Not a food. Processed and inactive waste product of food processing.


**Vitamin D3 Supplement**

Not a food. Processed and inactive waste product of food processing, especially
irradiated oils, including petroleum oil (motor oil).

**Vitamin E Supplement**

Not a food. Alpha tocopherol that is a by-product of developing film (Kodak,
Fuji).

**Zinc Oxide**

Not a food. Indigestible rock. The earth and rain must first dissolve rock by
bacterial and enzymatic processes before a plant can absorb it. Then the
herbivores eat and utilize the bio-active minerals properly. Oxides in animals
cause mineral loss and clustering.

**Manganous Oxide**

Not a food. Indigestible rock. The earth and rain must first dissolve rock by
bacterial and enzymatic processes before a plant can absorb it. Then the
herbivores eat and utilize the bio-active minerals properly. Oxides in animals
cause mineral loss and clustering.

**Iron Carbonate**

Not a food. Usually, the iron separated from liquid or solid waste from industrial
processes.

**Ethylene Diamine Dihydroiodide**

Not a food. Ethylene Diamine is a semi-volatile chemical used to lengthen shelf
life, and reduce shrinkage and spoilage. It can affect the brain, damage skin,
damage sperm in males, and even cause death if exposure is very high. In some
cases, an extremely small quantity of ethylene can cause irreversible damage!
Often, not immediately noticeable, ethylene will have an effect even if exposure
time is short.

**Ethylene Diamine Dihydroiodide (EDDI)**

EDDI is iodine from soil, not food, combined with Ethylene diamine. The source
is usually methyl iodine that is a byproduct of industrial waste. Many claims
have been made for 50 years that it protects certain animals from disease, such
as "foot rot”, “soft tissue”, "lumpy jaw" and "wooden tongue" in cattle. No tests
of any kind were performed to make these assumptive claims.


**Copper Oxide**

Not a food. Indigestible rock. The earth and rain must first dissolve rock by
bacterial and enzymatic processes before a plant can dissolve it further and
absorb it. Then the herbivores eat and utilize the bio-active minerals properly.
Oxides in animals cause mineral loss and clustering.

**Cobalt Carbonate**

Not a food. Radioactive or paint-manufacturing waste.

**Sodium Selenite**

Not a food. Selenium from plastic-manufacturing waste.

**Ethoxquin (As a Preservative)**

Not a food. Many pet food manufacturers use it as an anti-oxidant. However, an
ongoing controversy surrounds issues related to its safety when repeatedly fed
at permitted amounts, particularly when fed to genetically susceptible breeds
of inbred or close line-breeds. It is readily absorbed and metabolized, with
residual levels in the liver, gastrointestinal tract and adipose liver.

Ethoxyquin is assigned a toxicity rating of 3 or "moderately toxic", indicating
the probable oral lethal human dose is 0.5-5 g/kg, 3 to 33 times the maximum
allowed in pet foods. This toxicity rating is slightly greater than ratings for
tetracycline and penicillin, lower than for aspirin and caffeine. Susceptibility of
laboratory animals to anti-oxidant toxicity increases with the nutritional stress
of variable dietary constituents, such as dairy cattle. Increased dietary fat, for
example, increases susceptibility to toxicity of ethoxyquin fed to chickens and
BHT (as well as DDT) fed to rats. The response in chickens to increased dietary
fat appeared to be due to the resultant lowered protein. Chickens fed 17 vs. 23%
protein showed increased susceptibility to ethoxyquin toxicity. Ethoxyquin
levels fed to chickens were, however, almost 17 times the maximum allowable
level for pet foods.

In laboratory animals, ethoxyquin increased hepatic vitamin A levels 2 to 5 - fold,
and at levels 3 times that found in pet foods, and increased blood vitamin E
levels 2 - fold. These data suggest that ethoxyquin assumes some in vivo toxic
activities and thus requires more fats and anti-oxidants such as vitamin A & E
to bind and harness the resultant toxicity.


Since the late 1980's, the incidence of chronic disorders in purebred dogs
appears to have increased. These disorders include dysfunction of the liver,
kidney and thyroid, reproductive problems, autoimmune diseases and other
immune dysfunction, birth defects in pups, increased stillbirths and neonatal
mortalities, neoplasia, allergies and problems with the skin and coat condition.
Most concerns have focused on inbred or closely line-bred dog families.

Suspicions about the safety of ethoxyquin and any association with these
disorders would be difficult to corroborate because the affected animals may
have received drugs or other medications to treat their symptoms and other
diseases may be present. Furthermore, ethoxyquin has been used in some
animal feeds since 1959, some years before the controversy arose.
Nevertheless, the additive or cumulative effects of several environmental
insults could explain the increasing frequency of debilitating illnesses in these
dogs. Cumulative effects of metabolites and their interactions may place inbred
or closely line-bred animals exposed to other inducing agents at significantly
increased risk. The Food and Drug Administration of the USA Center for
Veterinary Medicine states, however, that there is insufficient scientific
evidence to show that ethoxyquin is unsafe when used at approved levels or to
warrant action against its use in pet foods. Future studies incorporating modern
toxicological techniques, appropriate medical and epidemiological assessment
of cases and consideration of multifactorial interactions in inbred or closely
line-bred animals, should help to clarify the issue.

After reading the above, you might come to the same conclusion as I did that the
ingredients above are merely a means of one company making money from the
wastes of another, much like fluoride is an industrial waste sold as a dental
asset, when it is actually a poison.

When I was in charge of fodder for milking herds in 1976, I experimented with
various feeds. I learned that they were all byproducts of manufacturing and
gimmicks. I chose to formulate a fodder. I started from an idealistic perspective.
Millet was considered the most nutritious grain produced by nature, however,
not even a goat herd would eat it on a regular basis, unless it was crushed and
either sugar or molasses coated. I tried millet as only a 2% ingredient and they
still would not eat any of the feed. Peas were favorable from a scientific
perspective, but again, cattle would not eat it on a regular basis.


I resorted to simple whole grain berries that were less likely to become rancid
and to mold. My most successful blend was simple whole oat berries (20%),
whole corn kernels (60%), whole carob pods (18%) and raw carob powder
(2%). The raw carob powder acted as a moisture absorbent and prevented the
berries from molds and yeasts. The carob and the oats made the cream richer
and sweeter, and made the milk taste almost maltish. Another excellent blend
was whole oat berries (20%), whole barley berries (10%), whole corn kernels
(50%), whole carob pods (18%) and raw carob powder (2%).

I have not shared these formulas with anyone. You may use these fodder
formulas if you wish to improve the health of your herd and improve the quality
and flavor of your milk at no charge. However, I do not give license to share, sell
or exchange these formulas with anyone.

I hope that you take this information as it was intended: with the desire for
better health and better communication. Again, thank you for all of your hard
work and tenacity to make your dairy work and grow. You have been very
important to a lot of people.

```
Healthfully and lovingly,

## GETTING HEALTHY FOODS YOU WANT

There are several options to get the foods you want:

1. **Join an existing Food Club or Co-op** following the links to Food Clubs & Co-
    Ops on page 2 of this document.
2. **Order directly from the farm of your choice**. Some of the farmers on this
    list may have deals for shipping rates with UPS or FedEx. To get these foods
    at an affordable price, you can get foods shipped by UPS Simple Rate. With
    Simple Rate you can have a 12 x 12 x 12 box up to 50 pounds sent to you for
    only $25.00 shipping plus the box. It is a little faster than ground shipping.
    FedEx may have a flat rate also to inquire about should your source only ship
    with FedEx.
3. **Hire a refrigerated truck to deliver your food.** For people with a bigger
    group around them that want high quality foods shipped in, you can hire a
    refrigerated truck to bring a pallet of food from the farms you like the most.
    It can cost $300-$600 depending on how far you are from the farm, yet with
    enough people it may be affordable.
    A couple of truck companies in Pennsylvania:

4. **Organize your own Food Club**. If you want to organize your own Food
    Club or you are a farmer selling high quality raw foods to customers, Co-
    ops and Food Clubs, you might want to use the original Food Club
    Membership Agreement drafted by Aajonus as a blueprint.

### Aajonus’ Sample Food Club Membership Agreement

**Part 1. Food Club Membership Agreement**

I attest that as a member of this club, I demand access to food that:

1. is produced without exposure to chemical contaminants such as
    industrialized pesticides, fertilizers, cleansers or their gases;
2. is not subjected to artificial temperatures above 105 0 Fahrenheit (F.),
    dairy not below 42 degrees F., and meats not below 380 F.;
3. is complete with its natural unadulterated enzymes intact;
4. may contain microbes, including but not limited to salmonella, E. coli,
    campylobacter, listeria, gangrene and parasites;
5. the cows are grass-fed;
6. fowl are free-range outdoors and not fed soy products;
7. the eggs are unwashed and may have bacteria and poultry feces on them.

I fully understand that these features represent a different paradigm for food
preparation, storage and safety than those that are currently enforced by all
local, state and federal government agencies. As a member of this club, I fully
trust its administrative members to ensure that the preparation, handling and
packaging of the food obtained through this club meet the standards I set forth
above. I affirm that no government regulations apply to our products and that
regulatory agencies have no jurisdiction over any of our products I obtain
through this club.

Because the standards currently enforced by government agencies cause
industrial chemical contamination whose effects on my health may be severe,
immediately or cumulatively, and have the effect of denying me access to the
quality of milk and other foods I require to improve and maintain my health, I
reject those standards and any attempt by government agency to regulate food
production, preparation, packaging or labeling for this club. I affirm that any
government-agency would exceed its authority if it were to require members of
this club to testify on any such matters. Also, in case of any government-


proceeding relating to the application of government standards or interference
to this club, I will be available to testify about any activities by government
employees that overreach their authority, including trespass, conspiracy and
kidnapping (false arrest).

I attest that I am not acting under color of law or in any way disguising my
motives, acting on behalf of any agency, person, or other entity in order to
entrap, hurt, gather information about, or testify against the members of this
club and therefore affect this club, [Co-op/Food Club Name], their members or
their purposes.^1

By agreeing to the Terms of Use below and with payment of thirty dollars
($30.00), I join this club and testify that I fully subscribe to the Club Membership
Agreement. This agreement confers on me an ownership interest in farm
animals and other food products produced for distribution among the members
of this club. Any money I pay upon acquiring my food is payment for services
rendered by farmer, workers and his/her agents. I agree that my food I acquire
through this club is for my household's use and I am fully responsible for its use.
I will not hold this club, or [Farm Name] responsible for any effects of its use. I
reaffirm that the food I acquire through this club is not subject to government
regulation because I own the food on the farm and am not engaging in
commerce.

I understand that my membership in the club requires annual renewal in the
amount of $30.00 and pays for my membership in [Farm of Food Club Name].
Payment is given or mailed to [Farmer’s Name], [Farms Address] or paid
electronically via [Payment Site Address].

**Part 2. Public Servant, Member Affirmation**

If you, or anyone in your immediate family work for the state or federal
government (public servant), the following applies:

Public Law 93-579 states in part: "The purpose of this Act is to provide certain
safeguards for an individual against invasion of personal privacy by requiring
Federal agencies ... to permit an individual to determine what records
pertaining to him are collected, maintained, used, or disseminated by such
agencies."

(^1) See U.S.C. Title 18, Sections 241 and 242. Conspiracy against rights and Deprivation of Rights is
under color of law.


I affirm that I will uphold the constitution of the United States. (All public
servants have taken a sworn oath to uphold and defend the constitution.)

I guarantee that the information gathered at [Farm/Co-op/Food Club Name]
will not be used against [Farm/Co-op/Food Club Name] or anyone affiliated
with [Farm/Co-op/Food Club Name].

I affirm that if any request for information relating to [Farm/Co-op/Food Club
Name] is received from any person or agency, I must advise Vernon
Hershberger in writing before releasing such information. Failure to do so may
subject me to possible civil or criminal action as provided by the act.

**Part 3. Terms of Use**

I have carefully read the preceding Part 1 - Club Membership Agreement and
Part 2 - Public Servant, Member Affirmation and I agree to these Terms and
Conditions.
