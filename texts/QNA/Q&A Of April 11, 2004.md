Note: Several people have mistakenly uploaded clips from this Q&A labeled as "April 2006" even though it actually took place in April 2004.

A: Okay, hello everyone. Welcome to another potluck, Q&A. Okay, first I'm going to start by talking about my accident. "Accident". There are no accidents. Let me start with what I think caused the accident, of course, according to myself. Last summer I was working on the third book, the detox book, and I'm saying to myself, I've had no serious accidents since I've been on this diet. I've only handled people with accidents. I really don't know what to do. I've had two serious accidents because I didn't know how I'd handle the doctors. I didn't know what happened if I went unconscious. All these things, and I got everything I had thought, everything I had a question for. So what happened was, I was in Ubon Ratchathani in Thailand, which is a very small farm town. They have no chemical agriculture anywhere within 90 miles of that land. And they're right on the Thailand-Cambodia and Laos borders right there. They're all just connected right there. And these two men that just came out of nowhere, that are high in politics and everything in this town, are trying to get me to build my health center there. And they're offering me 300 rai, which is 120 acres. And it's on a river, lake, and it's got everything. So they took me out after they showed me the property, and we went to a karaoke bar. Everybody drank but me. And they got snarkered... We were close to the hotel, so I wasn't worried. And the guy was just driving slowly. I mean, we're going at 25 miles an hour. It's like a 35 mile an hour zone. And everybody's talking and having fun. There's a driver and a passenger seat, and then there's a monk. And the monk was drunk, too. And another passenger. And then my real estate broker, which I called my girlfriend. She's a friend who's a girl. And she was sitting to the left of me. We're in an RV, and I'm in the third seat with her. I've got the harness, the seat belt harness, across this way. And all of a sudden, everybody's talking, and I'm looking at the scenery. It's like 1.15 in the morning. And I was looking around, and I see this car coming with no lights. About 50 miles an hour. Hit us. And as soon as he came to the impact, I lost consciousness, because the harness didn't keep me in. Because it was on this shoulder. We got hit on this side, so I flew this way. And my head hit the window past her, because she was leaning forward. Otherwise, I would have smashed her. And I wouldn't have been hurt as badly, but she would have been killed. But I went over here, and my head went through the window, and caused a concussion. I've got an indent in my skull there, so it broke the skull. And in fact, a piece of glass came out yesterday. I woke up this morning, and I went, oh, what's this? A piece of glass. But it had been completely buried, because I couldn't feel it. And my shoulder hit the molding, the side molding, and broke the clavicle and the shoulder blade. The shoulder of the, what do they call that? The collarbone. And the clavicle, when it broke, went through my neck muscles. And it bounced back. And then I was out. I felt all that without pain. And then when I woke up, the car's upside, the RV's upside down, and that was an RV of his. We flipped over a couple of times, and when I woke about 40 minutes later, they're prying the doors open, and I'm barely coming to, I'm hearing all this going on, and they're smashing the other window to pull me out, because I'm in the back. And the girlfriend was on top of me, and her feet, I guess, broke my ribs. I got two broken ribs here when we flipped over a few times. So she's in pretty bad shape. She got a serious brain damage. She lost her vision.

Q: She can get it back, can't she?

A: I don't know. She's not going to die, but she's not going to be fine.

Q: Does she still have her personality? Is she still who she is?

A: Yeah, she's still there. She's not bubbly and happy. But she did something that I thought was rather ridiculous. After the accident, we went to the hospital, and they were starting to break everything in the car to get me out, because I'm way in the back. And they were able to pull her out through a door that they opened about this much. So they were starting to break all these other windows, and I'm getting glass across the eyes and face. So I screamed at them to stop. And then I worked my way, even with this shoulder in excruciating pain, out through the door. And then I tried to stand up. All this time, my vision is not—I'm seeing, I'm not seeing. I'm seeing other things that aren't there. And my vision was just crazy for a while. And when I got out of the—you know, when I went to stand up in the vehicle, it was an immediate collapse, so they grabbed me, put me on a stretcher, strapped me in, and took me to the hospital. So in the hospital, I knew I said, I've got to come too. You know, I've got to really stay in tune and keep them from doing anything to me. So they put me in a wheelchair. After I got off the gurney to have x-rays done, I told the guy, I said, you have two shots. I told him in Thai, you have two shots to take. That's all you get, two shots of this x-ray. So he took two shots, and it showed the broken bones, but nothing was dislocated. So I didn't have to do anything. They gave—they want to put a cast on it. Don't need a cast. Because the body, when you don't have a cast, the body will build its own cast. It builds like—you can see a tumor here. It's as hard as a rock, and it's sealed right where the break was. And as it gets well, that bone growth goes back into the center of that bone and seals it harder. So that's how the body does it naturally if you don't use a cast. You have to be more careful so you don't dislocate it. So I had to sleep on my right side for a few days, and I took very thin slices of steak and, you know, wrapped them here on my neck and around here. So I slept for two days with steaks. I had to get like a box of those. Let me tell you, I was in excruciating pain, and I put a steak on within 10 minutes of pain is gone. I'd take the steak off, or I'd fall asleep, and it would fall off. I'd wake up in excruciating pain, put the steak back on 20 minutes later, 10, 20 minutes later, pain's gone.

Q: Wow. How does that work? How did you discover that?

A: Well, no, it's from the boxers. Boxers used to put steak on their injuries.

Q: Interesting.

Q: Your skull is better now?

A: Yeah.

Q: It came back?

A: I mean, I had a huge bruise here, and the ear was broken. All the cartilage was crushed, and it's still just a little sore right here. And then I've got a huge indent right here that's probably 2 1⁄2 inches by about 3⁄4 of an inch.

Q: That's going to go fast?

A: I don't know. We'll see.

Q: What did you say your girlfriend did that was stupid?

A: Oh, the next morning, you know, we went to the hotel about 2.30, and we were sharing the same room. She had one bed, and I had another bed. And I heard her at 6 o'clock in the morning, she's going to get on a plane, because she lives in Chiang Mai, which is 700 miles from where we were. She had flown to Bangkok and then to where we were, and I had flown from Cambodia to Bangkok to where we were to look at that property. And she did not want to be stuck in a foreign town for her, so she got on a plane. You do not get on a plane when you have a concussion, because the brain expands. It causes pressure, so that probably causes more brain damage. She flew to Bangkok and from Bangkok to Chiang Mai.

Q: She couldn't stay back for a while?

A: She should have.

Q: Did you tell her that?

A: Of course I told her. So did the doctor. She did it anyway. And then she wanted to see me before I left, so she flies back from Chiang Mai to see me, and then has to fly back to Chiang Mai again. You know, she just kept getting worse every time she got on a plane. Not a smart thing to do. Some people don't listen.

Q: Going on the diet would change her back to feeling better.

A: Probably.

Q: So was it difficult when you tell the doctors, well, they've taken this x-ray, I don't want any treatment [unintelligible].

A: Yeah, they act pretty crazy.

Q: They don't say, his head is not thinking right, and try and attack you.

A: Well, I wouldn't let them touch my head. I didn't want them to know that I had a concussion. So I had to be clear by the time we got into the hospital room. So we were in the emergency room, I was... forced myself to think clearly, to stay focused, and I would only allow myself to drift in and out and get vision problems when I wasn't talking to the doctor. And first what they do is they go to everybody, where do you hurt? So they look at everything that hurts, and then they'll search other places if you let them. I said, I'm not hurt anywhere else. I'm hurt here, here, but this is just bruised, you can see it's a little knot there. You know, how this got broken, like I said, I don't know, I was unconscious from that.

Q: What did you say, how long it's going to take?

A: How long?

Q: The pain to go away.

A: Don't know completely. But mainly the pain is if I lift this arm, I used to be able to not lift it at all. I couldn't move it for the first week, and I had to sleep on my right side for the first two days. I couldn't sleep on my back or stomach. And then by the third day, after a day and a half, I was strong enough to get to Bangkok, where my partners and other people I knew were, who knew my diet, knew how to get food and feed me. And they did fine, and those people knew, I told them what I needed. They got me very, you know, the freshest meat, you know, it was butchered within hours, and, you know, like two hours, an hour and a half. Sliced it very thinly for me, one of the wives, Thai wives did that. And they mixed my honey and butter, because I had honey and butter with me. And they brought me some unripe bananas. So that's all I ate, was butter, honey, and bananas, and the butter and honey with the meat. And I was well enough, 36 hours to get on a plane and get back to Bangkok. And then I spent three days in the bed, mainly, there. I walked, you know, a few blocks a day to go to a massage place. And they do Thai massage for like $8 for two hours.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, definitely. But I had them do it bao bao, which means very softly and gently. Otherwise, they give you a pretty tough, pretty strong, bao bao, bao bao. They forget, they start digging in, bao bao. Makes them go softly. And then I met a new girlfriend, and it was pretty hot and heavy. So even though the last two days were heavily into sex, even though I was doing, you know, all this [unintelligible], I knew I wasn't doing too badly. So I got on a plane, and I got stuck in, the plane broke down in Japan. So I got stuck in Japan for 14 hours at the airport. But they have a lounge there, executive lounge, with these bed chairs, which are pretty soft and comfortable. But, you know, I had that. Since the accident, they wheelchaired me into the airports, onto the plane, and then from the plane, you know, they pick up my luggage and the whole thing. So that's how I returned so I didn't have to lift anything because there's no way I could have lifted anything, even with this arm. If I lifted with this arm, pull on the muscles there.

Q: I have a question about your concern about your concussion. It was like you were willing to expose your other wounds and hurts to the doctors. What was it about the concussion that bothered you, that you wanted to protect it from them? And also, it's like doctors, it seems like one of their skills that's useful is they can do things like, you know, patch together nerves and certain, you know, triage handling and stuff like that.

A: Usually in the brain, they can't do a good job.

Q: But I mean, how was your thought about your diagnosing yourself?

A: Well, the only reason I was going here was if something was dislocated, I needed to get the bones put back in place. There was nothing dislocated. They were broken, four breaks, but nothing dislocated.

Q: I'm thinking about your head.

A: The head, there's nothing to dislocate. There's only a bruise in the brain. You may have a blood clot and there's really nothing they can do about it. And anyway, on this diet, you can get a blood clot.

Q: But it was dented, right?

A: Yeah.

Q: But you were confident that the dent wasn't significant.

A: Yeah.

Q: Oh, got it.

A: Even if it were, I knew that they would not be able to help that. I just had to let my body clear. 

Q: And if you had told them that you had hurt your head, they would have x-rayed your head.

A: Yeah, you know, that's what they did to the other people. All the other ones got concussions except for the monk. He didn't get a scratch.

[laughter]

Q: Something to learn from that monk.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: He was so drunk, he was so relaxed.

A: The thing was, he was leaning against the door that he was hit on. In his head, everything was already solidly against. So he had not slammed. I went from the passenger side, the right side of the car, all the way to the left side of the car, when that car hit us. So, you know, I had a huge impact. He was right there all cushioned up against the door. He didn't get hurt.

Q: You have great flexibility and you look great for having sustained surgery.

A: I've got a bruise all the way down here. The bruises are dead cells, mainly red blood cells, that have been damaged and are coming out the skin. The body throws it out through the skin. It doesn't take it all through the blood because then your blood would be quite thick and coagulated and rank. So it sends it out through the skin.

Q: What if we do something like this happens to us? We don't have all the knowledge that you have.

A: Well, that's why I'm putting it in the book. See, that's why when I was writing the book I had these questions. They're all answered. Every question I had. That's why I can take people step by step, you know, through it.

Q: You better phrase the question a little bit differently this time.

A: I deliberately said, and I knew it, that I had no personal experience with severe accidents on this diet. I took care of it. Hammer in the jaw, knocked my teeth back. I had a car accident three months after that.

Q: What you won't do it for science.

Q: I was doing it the way I was happy with how it happened to me. That was the way to prove this diet works.

A: Well, I know the diet works. I don't have to worry about that. It's just what to do in a situation where you're limited with food, you're in a foreign place. I mean everything. I didn't know anybody there. I didn't know any of these people.

Q: So why can't you not have a blood clot on this diet?

A: Pardon?

Q: You say you cannot have a blood clot on this diet?

A: If you're following the diet rigidly, there's no way to get a blood clot. Because everything is pretty resilient and elastic, so it will expand without cracking and breaking. See, when you break something, you have a blood clot. It means that you've ruptured something and it's broken and there's no elasticity. It won't go back in place. So it creates a collapsed vein or artery and the blood will back up around that area and create a clot. And it will keep going until the body cuts the passage of blood off into that particular vein or artery.

Q: So can you be on the diet for six months and have us be confident that your body works that way?

A: I wouldn't say six months. I'd say maybe a year, year and a half. It's doubtful, but I can't say for sure. And that I can never find out because I've been on the diet too long. But I've had other people who've had severe accidents. One fellow who'd been on the diet probably about nine months and he had a severe bicycle accident where he opened his head like I did and he took the skin off of the hair and everything just slid. He hit a rock and his whole collarbone was broken here like mine, but the whole skin was taken off. So he had a hole, a gap in his shoulder here, with the skin gone. So he repaired it in about six weeks. And what I did was I had one pretty open cut on my shin and on my chest. So I took a piece of meat and put it over it like a bandage, sealed up. The next day I opened it and the skin was all over again. We're talking skin missing. The steak, just like all the cells around were able to take all the nutrients from the meat and rebuild that tissue. That could be overnight. We're talking overnight in about 12 hours.

Q: You know, I've noticed since I've been on this diet, it's been about four years or more, four and a half years.

A: Which you've been on and off?

Q: Not very much. But what I found is band-aids stick to my skin. I can't use band-aids anymore. Have you noticed that?

A: I don't use band-aids.

Q: I mean, it's like something that's alive. Something that's alive within my skin is trying to work on the chemicals in the band-aid or whatever. And it's so stuck I can barely peel it off.

A: Because your body will absorb those adhesives and they're polymers in those adhesives. All polymers are carcinogenic.

Q: Oh, you're not supposed to use band-aids.

A: No, not a good idea. And this reminds me, also, somebody had a huge, what did they call those, tabs or skin...

Q: Skin tabs.

A: Skin tabs, what do they call them? 

Q: The little moles or something?

A: Yeah, they're like little warts or huge warts.

Q: They call them tags.

A: Tags. Yes, tags. I took a scissor and cut one off and put the meat over it. Five hours later, it was sealed. Skin grew back.

Q: So you got a cut it in your fingers and put meat on it.

A: Yeah, we'll wrap it around so it doesn't... I've tried chicken that doesn't do this.

Q: You don't eat that meat, I see.

A: No, it's pretty dry by the time you get it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I don't know about that.

Q: What if you have a small cut there to lick it and...

A: Yeah, but you have to understand the ptyalin enzyme in the licking will keep taking the vitamin K, the vitamin U out, so you're not going to continue bleeding. Put the meat on, within a minute or two of putting the meat on, it stops bleeding.

Q: Not ground meat, just ground.

A: I put ground on the one here. I just smashed it and put it on.

Q: That's cool.

A: And it adhered. It infused like, you know, it was part of my system then, you know. But I got in the bath and it just came off and all the skin was all replaced. Twelve hours later.

Q: Did you try egg white? Or eggs, raw eggs?

A: No. It doesn't dry quickly enough, so it mixes in the blood and you have to bleed inside.

Q: Oh, you said urine. Who put urine on a cut?

A: There's a... I gave a seminar, a lecture in Georgia in 1981, I believe it was, and there was a retired police officer, he was about 80 years old, that... because people were asking if you got urine there, if you drink your urine, to recycle your protein. A lot of people don't eat enough protein, they don't digest their protein the first time through. So if you drink your urine, you know, you can provide that. A lot of Indians do that who can't get meat, you know, maybe once a month or something like that, they drink their urine frequently in India. But he was telling me that before 1928, on the... he was part of the Miami Police Force, that if somebody, if they, you know, went to an accident or somebody had a severe cut, jugular vein or anything, one of the officers would urinate into a cup, one would pour on it, pour it on the wound while they held it. In 1928, the medical profession had it outlawed. He said, we watched thousands of people die in the next 20 years, because we couldn't do that. And just putting pressure on it doesn't work. He said, but for some reason, we pour that urine on and it stops.

Q: That's just for a severe cut?

A: That was what he was telling me.

Q: I've been doing this for the last one year.

A: Pardon?

Q: I've been doing this for the last one year.

A: What?

Q: I [unintelligible] my own urine. Every time I pee, I have a cup.

A: Well, some people do that.

Q: I was in prison, jail last week, and they hold me for 8 hours, and I start thinking about going in front of them and [unintelligible]. And after 8 hours, they ask me, please go. They're starting to run.

Q: Why did you go to the prison?

Q: I was tricked by cops. I was walking the street, somebody, a woman, asked me to go after her. I said, no. [unintelligible] And then I wanted to shake her hand to leave, and then they jumped at me, and they said, they called me a [unintelligible]. Oh. I told them if you don't let me go, I want chicken, I want beef, I want eggs. They're all in my car, and go get one. After 8 hours, they asked me to leave. And everybody else was innocent, too. They all said no to her, and they're all kids.

Q: Just so they can get money through the cops?

Q: Yeah.

A: That's a whole other subject.

Q: What about urine [unintelligible]?

A: Well, I don't... I used to drink, when I was a vegetarian, I used to drink my urine because I had a problem digesting, you know, a problem with proteins. So I did drink my urine every day. But when I started on this diet, I had to stop, because I got too acidic and irritable, and I would get fatigued from drinking it.

Q: What about your homeopathic urine? [unintelligible]

A: A tincture from it?

Q: Yeah.

A: Well, any time they make a tincture, they use alcohol or some other ingredient to alter the chemistry. So it becomes a chemical.

Q: Okay.

Q: Well, she was mentioning a homeopathic preparation.

A: All homeopathics are just low-dose drugs. They have to use drugs. They always use some chemical. Always a chemical, whether it's alcohol or something else.

Q: So, Aajonus, you were saying on this diet, you found that it wasn't beneficial to drink your urine.

A: Correct.

Q: That's because you get so much protein that the body is constantly detoxing the old stuff out of the tissues.

A: It could be, and there's just too many toxins in the urine. Some people still do it, and they're okay, but most people have found, you know, in experimentation, it wasn't good. And animals, you know, animals will drink their urine and eat their feces, only if they don't get the proper food. Once they get the proper food, they stop eating it. It's like the Howell, you know, Edward Howell. He did the experiments to repeat what Pottenger did. Pottenger took the 900 cats over a 10-year period, fed one group cooked, one group raw, and over that period, 10 years, all of the cats that were fed cooked meat and cooked dairy, all got diseases, all the diseases of man, and the cats that were fed all raw had no diseases. Well, Howell wanted to do the same thing, but he didn't want to have the life expansion of a cat. And all the cats lived one-third the normal life that they would live if they were on autopsy before, just to check their organs and everything. Because Pottenger let very few live their life span, just a few in each group. But Howell wanted to see how they would all live if they had their full lifetime. So he used rats, which lived three years, normally, healthy rats. And he found that the rats who lived, who were fed the cooked foods, had all the diseases of man, the rats who had the raw foods had no diseases, but they all lived three years, both groups. And boy, it really confused him. So he went around for a year, scratching his head, trying to figure it out. Then all of a sudden he realized a note that appeared almost every day, these rats are eating their fecal matter.

Q: Oh, wow!

A: And it was only the rats who were eating cooked foods. So he redid the test, put a screen down, and they only lived two years instead of three years, plus all the diseases. So the fecal matter was very important for giving them protein, because in the bowels, your last stage of protein digestion, that's where the E. coli converts those proteins into B vitamins and compound amino acids that backs up the nervous system. That's why almost all animals eat fecal matter. You get the E. coli growing quickly. The pharmaceutical and medical profession wants you to believe that bacteria is the whole problem of everything. Well, it's got nothing to do with bacteria. All animals have lived eating with bacteria for millions of years in complete harmony. No disease and no death. The pharmaceutical and the medical industry, the pharmaceutical runs the medical industry. They dictate what happens in the schools and everything. So the doctors can't really blame them, need to blame the pharmaceutical houses. So they want you to believe that bacteria is your problem. When bacteria just occurs as a consequence of disease, but does not create disease, but they call it just the opposite. They got all of their drugs creating more diseases, and there's no cure with the disease, when you go their way. But if you look at other doctors of the period around Pasteur, who didn't believe in the germ theory, that believed in spontaneous eruption or transformation, or transmogrification of one life form to another. Like you could take a certain bacteria, and it could transform from a certain kind of salmonella to another form of bacteria, another type of amoeba that would help eat up certain decaying tissue.

Q: Yeah, there were studies where they would show that the bacteria would convert from rods to spirals and so forth.

A: Right. And if you wanted, you would have a different diet, you'd need to clean up the garbage in the system. So all of these bacteria and parasites are very important for health if you're diseased. And the only animals that have disease are those that are poisoned by chemicals, or those that are fed raw foods. So the diseases that, you know, like mad cow and mad deer disease, that's a fallacy. The military was going around doing chemical warfare testing in the, in the, in Arizona, I mean in Wyoming, Utah, that entire area, all through the 50s. And of course, those chemicals work over time, and each generation keeps collecting more of them and damaging the system. Yet, the deer don't get crazy. Their systems don't dissolve like that. They found the prions in them and said, oh, these are bad deer, because we found the folded prion. But the deer's weren't, their brains weren't dissolved. They didn't have the, like the humans had CJD, C-J-D, which means that the brain starts melting and turns into a sponge, and just dissolves, you know, melts. And the reason the cows have it is because they're injected with vaccines. They have mercury in them, thimerosal, all vaccines. And these cows are getting injections every month. So that mercury starts collecting in a lot of them in the brain and nervous system, because mercury, especially liquid mercury, has a propensity to go into the nervous system. So when it collects in certain of these animals, and the worst diets that they have, that they're eating byproducts of, you know, of food processing, which is no food at all, no live food, no enzymes, no vitamins, no nothing live, they're eating this bad food, and then the mercury gets in the nervous system. There's nothing to prevent the mercury from dissolving the brain and nervous system. So that's why there's mad cow. And it's not the prion that causes it, the prion is a result, not the cause.

Q: Now, wouldn't you have to argue that a little bit further, because I mean the initial breakout was like in England, right? So, I mean, those practices have been going on in the United States for a long time, so how would you explain that?

A: England has been vaccinating cows since the late 1800s. In this country it mainly started about the 1950s.

Q: So you think it's a matter of the longevity of that? Do you have any other proof of that speculation?

A: No, there's actually documented evidence, you just have to find it on the internet.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah, definitely. And also, there's another factor involved. Dow, Monsanto, and some of the other genetic engineers want all these natural animals dead, because they're allowed to develop genetically altered, even if it's just one gene, they alter, they can patent that animal.

Q: Patent it?

A: Patent that animal. What happens with the patented crops? There's a case, you know, two years ago in Canada.

Q: Oh yeah, beautiful story.

A: This guy, you know, he's got an organic farm, the next door neighbor has got genetically grown crops. The seed flies over to his, just along the border. Monsanto goes in and sues the farmer for growing his crops. So he wins. Monsanto wins. So this farmer has now lost his farm to Dow, because he was growing, not purposely, those crops along his border.

Q: And the reason they know that is because Monsanto, whenever they do the growing, they send out guys that examine and take samples of it. It's so fucking evil, I can't believe it.

A: And the courts are backing them up. So the same thing is happening with animals. If you want an animal or a cow to grow it, and it's genetically engineered, guess who you have to pay royalties to? You have to pay a percentage of every pound of meat that you sell to Dow or Monsanto.  They want to get rid of all the natural cattle. They have patentable agriculture.

Q: So they have the death seeds, right? Monsanto has the death seeds that won't propagate, right? So the way you're talking, so the next step is, we'll patent the men and the planet. Okay, the sperm won't have any viability, so if you want to become pregnant, you're going to have to buy the sperm from Monsanto, right? That's the way it's going.

A: It's true. It is very true. And if you want to breed your animals, they won't breed.

Q: Yeah.

A: So you have to go to Monsanto. They have them artificially inseminated. $10,000 implantation. That's it. So they're just greedy.

Q: It's beyond greedy. Oh, it's way beyond greedy.

A: Anyway, that's the picture of how it's going. So I'm getting the frick out of this country. That's why I'm looking for land in Thailand and Cambodia. These places were still very primitive. Cambodia is phenomenal. I mean, they're still living in grass huts. You know what I mean? In the major cities, there's like eight major cities, and even it's pretty primitive there. They're eating, you know, meat, raw meat on the streets, and everything's got flies on it, they've got no disease.

Q: They butcher it on the streets, too, don't they?

A: No, they butcher it and then bring it. I mean, some of them, they cut some of them right there in front of you. Flies are all over it.

Q: Don't you think that the real war is here in the United States? I mean, this is where battle is going to be won or lost, right? You can't let go of it.

A: In Canada, here, in England, yeah, in Europe.

Q: When are you moving?

A: Well, it's going to be a long process. Because I'm going to build 12 health centers over the planet. But the place where I will probably live is the most primitive. But each one of these locations is going to have a farm, because that's part of the health center. So it's going to be completely self-sustaining, solar-generated, everything. So they're not going to be, in fact, doing a declaration of independence for this little, for each of these little centers, they're going to be like the Indians, you know, or like a certain religious sect, where we can be completely autonomous.

Q: So you really want to leave?

A: Well, the United States is getting pretty bad.

Q: No, but you personally must really want to live.

A: I want to live?

Q: I know that's a stupid thing to say, but you really want to live. Like, you don't want anybody to...

A: Right, nobody's going to dictate the kind of health I can have. I'm going to dictate that.

Q: Good for you. Absolutely.

Q: And Iran also, in nature, is becoming very strong.

A: What?

Q: Iran.

Q: Iran, and Kurdistan [unintelligible].

A: So, anyway, let's start with Q&A, we can get through here. So do you have a question, Kathy?

Q: I wanted to know, when I went to the Ocean Avenue seafood place yesterday, I was talking to the guy at the oyster bar, and he was saying that when the oysters come in, what he does, he takes cold water and he washes them through all around to take off the sand and any kind of smell, because the oysters come in very smelly. Well, I wanted to know, but since I ate that oyster, is the water going through that oyster? Because they open it up, and then I pick it up with my hand, and I go like this, is that water going through?

A: The oyster only eats one time a day, and it will only eat one time a day, and what it does is it absorbs sea water, and it filters the sea water.

Q: No, I'm saying he washes it with cold water.

A: I'm telling you. So, when they wash it with city water, if that oyster absorbs any of that water, it will kill the oyster. Oyster cannot live on fresh water, especially contaminated by the city water. So, no, it does not get into the oyster.

Q: So, should I hold it like this and slip it in my mouth? I get any water that's in the oyster?

A: When they wash it off, it's all off. Any water that comes out of the oyster is sea water.

Q: No, I'm saying it drips. I'm saying, is it I can go like that and drip it on the plate?

A: When he washes it, it's early, it's when he gets it in.

Q: Yeah.

A: So, when it's dripping, it's going to be sea water.

Q: No, they do that in the sushi bars. They'll open up the shell, they'll take the oyster and wash the actual oyster.

Q: No, he washes it beforehand.

Q: Oh, before it's shucked.

A: So, there's no water on there.

Q: No water on the shell.

A: The water on the shell, if there's any water on the shell by the time you get it, it's just the water from inside the oyster that's broken.

Q: So, whenever I slip out like that, I can pour it out on the bowl and then drink it off.

A: Yeah, you can drink it off if you want to.

Q: Okay, so there's no city water that stays on the shell.

A: Right, city water, that's ocean water.

Q: I know.

A: It's already in the highly filtered from the oyster.

Q: I'd like to think about it.

A: Okay.

Q: Yes, I have a question about chiropractic and Rolfing.

A: Okay. For me, now when you're at a place, when I had this happen, you know that I had some damage along my spine because of the pressure. When I broke this rib here, one of the ribs that went back to my spine right about here got bruised. So, it felt like a knife was in my back. So, I suffered with it for a while. I didn't want to adjust right away because I was in too much pain to be adjusted. But as soon as I could, I had a chiropractor adjust that spine and got rid of the pain, most of the pain just like that. So, I'm for chiropractics, very helpful. But I think that what you should do is, what I did was I applied a hot water bottle on, you know, an area that I'm going to be adjusted in or if I'm going to have an entire adjustment, I get in a hot tub before I go. So, all the muscles are relaxed. Because if you're out of place, it's because the muscles are very tight. And if they're tight, you're going to be, let's say the spine is like this, it's out of place. Normally, it's like this. When it's like this, it's pinching on the nerves in between causing the pain. So, if you go to a chiropractor and he adjusts you, all those muscles are still tight. So, it's going to wrench right back out of place. So, if you take a hot bath and relax the whole body, those muscles relax. So, then when he goes back and puts you back in place, you're going to stay in place a lot longer.

Q: One thing I want to say before I go on, you mentioned your question. My turn was if anybody wants any monkfish liver or glands, I'm getting grass-fed buffalo from North Dakota.

A: Yeah, Kathy supplies us with glands and other stuff.

Q: And also I wanted to know if you wanted the brain because since you had that problem with your head, you want to have some brain.

A: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

Q: Come on, you're not afraid of prions.

A: When will you get it?

Q: I'm going to talk to you on this coming Thursday. Hopefully, you'll set a date for me when it would be next.

A: Well, I'm leaving for [unintelligible] the 23rd.

Q: Okay.

A: It's got to be before or after that.

Q: I mean, you know, the brain, I can seal the brain in a glass jar. And the time comes when you're home, I bring it to James.

A: Okay.

Q: And have it sent to you in your name.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: I'll tell you after.

A: No, go ahead.

Q: All right, it's 310 if anybody's interested in calling me. 657-5174. Also, the monkfish liver, you said it's good for the neurological system and the vision. And it comes from the Atlantic area of anywhere from Maine all the way down to Virginia up to the coast around that coastal area. So you're getting a fish liver that we can rapidly use. I mean, we can, we can, it will help us rapidly get, help us get well in a better way.

A: Yeah. All right. Okay, as far as the rolfing goes, rolfing is a very brutal, painful manipulation. Massage. People stick their entire thumb up your nose and they'll work it and they'll crack everything. And they'll dig in until you bruise. And they bruise you. If you've got any lymphatic congestion and lymphatic dryness or even veiness, dryness, it will break all these canals. And what happens is you will bleed and you will get all these serums in between. That can lead to lupus, cancer, all kinds of problems. If you've got a lymphatic congestion, you can really push yourself into lymphoma quickly. So rolfing is the worst, worst physical therapy that can be done. The worst physical therapy that can be done.

Q: What is that?

Q: Rolfing.

A: Rolfing. Rolfing. The best physical therapy is right touch massage. It's like electric. You just have somebody go like this over you.

Q: That's more fun than... You know that?

A: It just stimulates everything.

Q: That's lymphatic dryness. [unintelligible]

A: Well, it's not lymphatic. It gets your nervous system, it gets everything. See how it stimulates? I just call it right touch.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: I can do it easily. It's easy to do.

Q: Yeah.

[unintelligible, multiple conversations]

A: Okay, next question.

Q: I wanted to ask about the high meat, yesterday you told me I have a condition that the high meat won't work as well, but then you said keep eating the high meat. I wanted to...

A: Well let's take on at a time. Okay the high meat, for those of you who don't know, is you take meat and let it get full of bacteria until it's stinky. Those who saw me... how many of you saw me on Ripley's Believe it or not?

Q: I missed it.

Q: We wanted to record it.

A: Nobody saw me. They showed it again, I just got an email, they showed it twice in the last three months.

Q: Why didn't you forward it to us?

A: Because I was in Thailand. They didn't notify me, but they aired it about six times since they made it a year and a half ago. They showed it on July 17th 2003... 2002, 2002 I guess it was. July 17th 2002, that's the one I was originally on. So if you ask them for a copy of that tape, they might be able to send it to you. But I took some meat and glads that were up to a year and three months old, they were black and green with mold an bacteria and I ate about two cups that day. And the poor cameraman was vomiting.

[laughter]

Q: You don't know what TV station they aired it on?

A: Ripleys Believe it or not.

Q: So you don't know what station...

A: Anyway, high meat is meat with high bacteria in it. What it does, is it goes up and eats decay in the body. We are very overly cleanly in our society, we anti-bacterial everything. Vapors in the air, pollution, everything destroys bacteria in the body. So your body has to make solvents, which are viruses, to go out and wash out the decay. So it will help nurture these bacteria in the body if you eat high meat. High meats will encourage the bacteria to help you clean easy with less decay. Because when bacteria or parasites eat a decaying tissue, a diseased or damaged tissue, it will reduce... It's like we eat 7 pounds of food a day and we have less than a pound of fecal matter a day. And bacteria and parasites are the same way, only they can take a hundred times the matter and reduce it to 1% of what they've eaten. So you've got very little waste matter if they're doing it. If your body has to use a virus, which is a soap or solvent, to clean it out, then you've got all this waste product that's accumulated because there's nothing to reduce it. Viruses are not alive. The idea that they're contagious is absolutely the most ridiculous thing ever postulated. That's like saying tied soap is contagious because it's in so many homes. No. Viruses are produced, they're proteins, combinations that are produced are dissolved matter. But it takes lots of fluid in conjunction with that to spread out and dilute the poison and to dissolve it. So you've got a lot more mass of poison. That's why viral infections are usually a lot worse than bacterial infections because when you've got a bacteria or a parasite, it reduces the waste and the contamination to a small amount of toxicity. But when you're using viruses, it spreads all this contamination and dilutes and permeates every part of your body.

Q: That's also why [unintelligible].

A: That's right. They're never alive to kill. Yet 90% of all doctors give antibiotics to viruses.

Q: Really?

A: They do. And the idea that you can vaccinate for a virus is the most absurd thing in the world. That's got to be alive again. And there's no life to a virus. So it's an absurd thing. So the raw meat thing was... the high meat thing. I said that her condition where she needs the bacteria, it's not going to grow in that area where she needs it most because she's got metal poisoning. Bacteria goes in there and eats a little bit of that bacteria. I mean it eats a little bit of that decay and the metal poisoning will destroy the bacteria so it can't thrive. That's why so many people are getting so diseased is because there's so much pollution in their body, their bodies cannot utilize bacteria and parasites easily in the system. So they have to use virus, soaps, solvents to dissolve this matter. So people are getting sicker and sicker and weaker and weaker all the time. But if we just let bacteria do it, keep ourselves clean, let bacteria do it, we heal like I do, quickly. The doctors said that I wouldn't be able to move and work for six weeks. I was working within two weeks. I was working within a week actually, but not many, you know, an hour or two hours at a time. Yesterday I did full consults. And then this morning I did a full consult before I came here to do this. And it's only been 18 days since the accident. So if you take care of yourself, you'll be able to be much healthier. 

Q: So first we need to pull the metals out before the high meat can fully work.

A: Correct. But there are areas in the body that don't have the metal poisoning, but there's another area. But the areas where you're the weakest is where you've got all that metal poisoning, the bacteria can't help you there, but bacteria can help you in other areas. So what I was talking about, that particular process would not help, the high need would not help that particular problem.

Q: So, and then can I ask the next question?

A: Go ahead.

Q: About the electricity, the things that emit electricity, I'm not clear, even though I know you've written about what that electrical charge, or there is, what is it, what does it do to the body?

A: It's a radi-... any electrical field emits irradiation, whether it's radio waves or whatever. You can take a meter, I let my meter out on somebody before I left, you know.

Q: What's it called? That magazine, I forget.

A: The magazine? You mean the meter?

Q: Yeah.

A: Yeah, it's called a tri-meter.

Q: Tri-meter.

A: T-R-I-M-E-T-E-R. Tri-meter. The tri-meter can gauge electromagnetic fields, radio waves, and other types, like radiation from microwaves, like ionic.

Q: I know a guy in the Rockwoods who actually does that professionally. He's a phone, works with phones, but if he goes to your house, he'll, I think he did it for Kat, you know.

Q: Oh yeah, right, he did.

Q: I live in Arizona.

Q: Well, you can do it yourself. You can order those.

A: Yeah, she got that tri-meter name. So you can take that meter and you can put it on your computer or whatever, and you can find out how far that field goes. It's damaging to the body because it alters the molecular structure of cells. The city of Los Angeles, the power department, ten years ago, put out a warning with your bill, with your electric bill, saying, it's been proved that electromagnetic fields alter the molecular structure of cells, of animal cells, including human. If you're using an electric blanket, do not sleep with it on. You turn it on, heat your bed, turn it off before you get in. Let me tell you, they would not have issued that if it wasn't scientifically proved that it kills and damages harmfully human cells. And it's been proved anything over three gauss is harmful.

Q: Three gals?

A: Gauss. G-A-U-Z-E. Gauss. That's the measure for the electromagnetic field.

Q: G-A-U-S-S. G-A-U-S-S. 

A: S-S. 

Q: S-S. 

A: G-A-U-S-S-E. 

Q: No E. 

A: No E?

Q: G-A-U-S-S. Gauss. It's a name of a man.

A: Because I've seen it spelled differently. Maybe that was in another language. Anyway, like in my laptop computer, when I first got a laptop, I got a new house in Venice, and I'm working away and all of a sudden terrible pain, body, all of a sudden, carpal tunnel syndrome, all the way up to the elbow and even higher. So I'm thinking, oh, am I getting bone cancer again? Then I realized, wait a minute, it could be something environmental. So I called an environmental specialist. He came in, whatever that is, there's no radon, there's no nothing here, except your laptop computer is emitting about 75 gauss.

Q: Oh my goodness. 75?

A: And he showed me.

Q: This is a desktop.

A: Pardon?

Q: Is that more than a desktop?

A: No, a desktop is worse. A tower is worse. You have to keep that three feet away. So he said, and he took the meter and he went from the laptop and he says, you need to get yourself a separate keyboard. And here's how far you need to keep it. And when the needle went down to .5 to zero is where I keep the keyboard from my, plug it into my laptop. Next day, after that, all the pain went. Completely. So all this carpal tunnel syndrome is all bullshit.

Q: I have it.

A: But I mean, it's not from being physicians. It's not from ergonomics. It's from the electricity coming from these machines. People used to have these old fashioned typewriters where you had to pound. Can you imagine how much energy went into it? No carpal tunnel. Electric typewriters came in. And then computers. And everybody's got these electrical fields hitting them all over their hands while they're working.

Q: So you get the tower too?

A: The tower's worse. You have to keep that three feet away. I only have to keep my laptop six inches from the bottom of the, my keyboard six inches from the bottom of the laptop. So I'm like a foot and a half away from the processor, you know, the drive that's in the computer. But a laptop sends out 150, 200 gauss. So you have to three feet away from it.

Q: The [unintelligible] cord doesn't allow you to do that.

A: All you have to do is get a longer one.

Q: Oh, you can get a longer one.

Q: What if the tower's hidden inside a cabinet?

A: Doesn't make any difference. You can take a meter and you can see it. And if you've got a special, let's say you've got a special chamber, it would cost a fortune for one of those. And you can just take your meter and just see, protect yourself. Let me tell you, that meter costs about $150, $135-140. But let me tell you, for your health, you can go around your house. If your bed is near one of those fields, move it away from that field. Because you've got the wires running through your house. And some of them can be pretty bad.

Q: Yeah, refrigerators are pretty intense.

A: Yeah, refrigerators and blenders.

Q: Oh, yeah.

A: Blenders are the worst. But you don't blend for very long. That's why in my book I say you blend five seconds, you blend ten seconds, you blend a minimum of 30 seconds if you have anything harmed. And you don't stand there looking at or holding it. You get away from it a lot of the time. But you have to really be exposed to those fields for four or five minutes at a time.

Q: Yeah, I run my blender with a keyboard, actually.

A: You do?

Q: Yeah.

A: Remote control.

Q: That's a good idea. Have you heard that you can take a little portable transistor radio and tune it off of a station so you can hear static? And then that works like a meter. So when you hear it get more intense static, you know, there's more...

A: Yeah, but that's certain fields.

Q: That would be for ionizing radiation purposes.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: Okay, you have a question. Did you come up with a question?

Q: Yeah, I came up with my question. Okay, concerning menstrual periods for women, have you noticed that some women, when they're on the diet, that they have a period of time where they go without their period, like a long period of time, and then it comes back, and maybe the body's healing in that area for a while or something? 

A: No, most of the time I find on this diet that women who haven't had periods even in their 50s will go back to menstruating.

Q: They will?

A: Very few people have ever said they stopped menstruating on this diet.

Q: Okay. And when you eat cooked food, that produces hormones, right?

A: Well, when you eat cooked food, you can produce poor hormones.

Q: Yeah, poor hormones. I was just wondering if those hormones could create a period, or if it's just the natural hormones that create the period. You know, if it's the hormones...

A: Any hormones can do it, but certain kinds of chemical constituents that get into those hormones can cause a cessation in menstruation.

Q: They said that it's not the eggs that they run out of, it's something in the brain, within the brain channel.

A: It's a hormone.

Q: No, I'm saying...

A: It's a hormone change.

Q: No, I'm saying that they said the ovaries don't stop working because if a woman doesn't run out of eggs, they came out of that recently. In the paper.

Q: It's from the pituitary gland or something.

Q: No, I was just wondering if...

A: But it's a hormone.

Q: Yeah, I was just wondering if maybe sometimes the reason the woman's having her period is because she's cleansing. It's a way of her cleansing out.

A: Well, that's normally... But all other animals, other than humans, menstruate at the same time they are fertile. So the eggs that don't get fertilized get dumped immediately. And that's the flow. But humans, because we've been eating cooked food so long, we have a different cycle. We have the fertilization period and the menstruation that follows 12-15 days later.

Q: That's because of cooked food?

A: Yeah. Because of the contamination in the body.

Q: So the healthier we become, then we'll start...

A: You're talking about 10,000 years of change.

Q: Really?

Q: I have sort of an interesting comment on that. There's a technique called lunaception. And the idea, very briefly, was that women used to be in cycle with the moon, with the new moon, and that they would all experience periods at the same time. And what messed it up was interior lighting and unnatural lighting of one kind or another. And there's actually a little book out there called lunaception that explains how you can utilize like a 40-watt light bulb or something like that, and just as you're sleeping, you synchronize the exposure of your skin with the new moon so that, you know, you have your light sticking out from under the cover or something like that. And you'll go back and synchronization with the moon. And I was married at the time, and there was this girl that had... She'd had her period regularly since her first menses. And suddenly we started doing this, and then the first period was like way overdue. And then suddenly within a week she had a second period and it was really intense. And the third period, bang, fell right on the new moon and we just stayed with it.

A: Maybe a diet changed that cycle without the effects of using a light chain. A lot of women were in the cycle.

Q: So you're saying on the diet it's more likely the woman is going to get her period again rather than stop her period. Did you ever have anyone say that they stopped having their period?

A: Probably had one that I remember that had probably 40 women who were in menopause already, had gone through it, went on the diet and started menstruating. She wanted to have a baby, she went through menopause, thought she was never going to have a baby, and then started her period again and got pregnant. So she had her baby at 56. Just remember women, you can only get pregnant five days a month. That is it. That is all.

Q: So is there food that would actually produce healthy hormones to nurture the uterus and ovaries?

Q: Is the placenta, is it?

A: Well it's any glandular tissue that will stimulate that.

Q: And you mentioned the nut butter formula too, right?

A: No, the nut butter formula helps bind with excess hormones.

Q: Oh, I see.

A: So the nut butter formula is not for somebody who has a low energy level. If you've got psychological problems, yeah, a little nut formula will help bind with those psychological, chemical by-products. But if you have too much nut formula, it's going to arrest a lot of hormones in the system and bring your adrenaline level and your energy level down.

Q: It'll bring your energy level down if you eat too much nut butter? Because I've just been doing tons of nut butter and then I've gone without my period now for about three months.

A: Yeah, you just keep arresting your hormones.

Q: Oh, that's what is going on. That's what I was trying to figure out. I had this idea that the nut butter formula was healthy for my hormones. So what kind of food do I need to eat to help my energy?

A: Like I said, glands. Any glands.

Q: And the just red meat and eggs won't do it?

A: Oh, it'll help. But if you want concentrated, glands produce hormones. That's why they're called glands. So if you get a gland, you're going to get a hormone, lots of hormones within that gland. The body can take any hormone as long as it's raw and convert it to another hormone. We can take adrenaline and make it a pituitary. We can take a pituitary and make it into an adrenaline. Your body can convert any of them.

Q: I was talking about specialized glands and that's the placenta and the ovary. When you eat those glands, doesn't that reproduce the body to replace, to repair those tissues?

A: No.

Q: When you take aged ovaries or aged placenta?

A: You mean for menstruation?

Q: Oh, whatever you're doing.

A: No, if you're talking about the reproductive glands, then you can look to the reproductive glands to help. But if you're looking at pituitary or adrenal, if you want to the body to focus on that, then you eat the adrenal gland. It's the adrenal gland if you want. If it's the pituitary, you eat the pituitary. The American Indians knew that. That's why anybody who had a disease of a particular gland got the gland of that animal. Any gland would help, but they knew that it would help that gland specifically to be...

Q: That's the gland that...

A: Yeah, the gland you're having a problem with.

Q: Thank you very much.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Hold on a second. My publisher is here. He's been bringing some books for me. Pardon?

Q: Um...

Q: Maybe he's got some books you can buy.

A: This is the kid he got my book from. He published my book. That was seven years ago when he published the book. He was a baby.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, he's just going to bring...

[audio cut]

Q: So I need to just kind of pick your brain for a minute. I'm going to be talking to as I mentioned the Medical Society of Canada, San Bernardino County. I represent obviously a divergent point of view from where they are. I'm not looking for a so-called bullet. I'm looking for a way to kind of encourage them to look outside the box. And I'm trying to give them just a few ideas of how I heal myself and process I'm in. So I'm trying to make a connection between where I am and where they are. And what's the... Where do I go out of... I go in there you know, how do I begin to communicate with them? Because in my mind you know, they're doctors, they're nurses, they're all this. How do I get in there? They're doing research. And so what I know about what they don't know, and [unintelligible] what they're doing, so I have to kind of watch myself and what I say. And you have a great wisdom, how would you approach...

A: When I'm dealing with a medical body like that, I take the facts with me. And in the back of one of the chapters, the very last chapter I think it is, in the recipe for living without disease, it talks about all the universities that use raw milk to reverse diseases. And you can open their minds with that one and say, oh you can reverse diabetes by drinking raw milk? And pasteurized milk causes diabetes? You know, and when you've got these tests going on, you start giving them this information, you give them just a little bit of it at first. And the weeks go by and they absorb that and they can't counter it, but it grows. It starts growing like a plant in your brain and then it opens them up and then they want more and more. Some of them will just shut down completely, but most of them are very open. Because the human mind is very quick.

Q: What are the universities that are listed? In the recipe for living without disease?

A: Yeah.

Q: Thank you.

A: Okay. Ebrahim, do you have a question?

Q: No, I'm not going to.

A: Nim, is that what you call yourself? Nima?

Q: Nima.

A: And Fran?

Q: I have a question for myself and a question for my stepfather.

A: Well, your stepfather can't ask it.

Q: Well, the question for myself is my sleeping problem has always been that I sleep way too much. So, once I'm on the diet, at least my energy during the day is pretty good, but I still need like 9 or 10 hours sleep every day. And if I have to wake up early, if I go to bed late for a reason and I have to wake up early for something important, it's one of the most difficult things for me. It's always been that whole life. And I haven't noticed a change yet. Even though I'm being pretty good.

A: How long?

Q: Um, mid-February.

A: February? Sometimes it takes much longer. 90% of healing happens in the sleep state. Normally, I only sleep 4 and a half hours a day. Totally. 3 hours a night, 3 and a half hours a night, half an hour to an hour during the day. Sometimes I go with an hour and a half sleep a day and continue to [unintelligible]. During this healing period, I'm sleeping 12, 14, 16 hours a day. Can't heal quickly without sleep state. You know, with Cleopatra, her beauty sleep, that was true. She would force herself to take an hour or two hour nap during the day to get her beauty sleep. Because it rejuvenates the whole body. So, sleeping, you should take advantage of. Because very few people get to heal like that. But, you know, once you're on the diet, after a while, then you'll break through. I've seen people who are very sick take 3 years to break that. You know, I've had one woman, 28 year old girl, who had 30 tumors in her breast, tumor in her right kidney attached to her adrenal gland and in her hip bone. You know, she's [unintelligible] for 8 years before she went on the diet, more than 6 hours a week. That's all she could work. Slept 12, 14 hour a day. After 2 and a half years on the diet, that changed. Went down to 8 hours, 8 and a half most. Now, 6 years on the diet, she sleeps maybe 6, 8 hours and she goes all the time. All this energy goes, goes, goes. So, it depends upon your health and what's happening in your body. But, count your blessings that you can sleep.

Q: Don't fight it yet.

Q: I guess I've always felt kind of envious of people who are really sharp in the morning, that they don't even need an alarm clock. They just see the light coming through the window and they're up. And I'm, for me, I'm literally fighting the sheet. I have wars in my mind when I'm waking up. My mind wants to wake up and my body just can't wake up.

A: You've got a low hormone. That's a helpful way. But you have to eat a lot more meat and butter with your meat. Butter and meat together, no matter what kind of meat it is, white or red, chicken or fish, beef, but a combination of all three, along with butter, will manifest, will allow your body and help your body produce more hormone. Then if you use cream or olive oil or any of the butter, this is the key to building hormone. Butter with meat. Doesn't matter.

Q: What about sauerkraut or acidophilus or even cheese? Does this do the same thing as high meat?

A: No, well, they do. But in a different way. The mold in cheese will help break down exterior and interstitial properties. It won't help in glands, it won't help with any of that. But it will help in, let's say you've got connective tissue or skin, it will help those areas, that bacteria. But it can cause, you know, it can affect you like candida, it can cause athlete's foot, something like that. But those are good things. Athlete's foot is a good thing, but the pharmaceutical industry doesn't want you to believe that because they want you to have the chemical, they want you to eat the bad foods which cause it, that the fungus eat that bad food, and they want you to keep buying their chemicals. So they want you to have the fungi. And they never create a drug that will completely get rid of your problem. Only one that will take care of it for a few hours or a day. So you have to keep taking the product. If you don't want athlete's foot or other kinds of diseases, you have to stop eating the foods which generates that kind of bacterial need. Now if you're talking about sauerkraut, that's a vegetable. Yes, I encourage people to eat sour vegetable juice because it will help go in and clean out the vegetable oil. Vegetable, as I told these three yesterday, during the consult, or one today, that in the consult that hardening of the arteries and tissue in the body comes from vegetable oil, not animal fat. If you take animal fat, butter, cream, and even put them with dirt, it will mold and turn into earth. If you take vegetable oils and put them with dirt, it will turn into rock. That's what amber is. That's what most of your stones are. Your precious stones. It's plant fat under high pressure for a long time. And when you hydrogenize a fat, like hydrogenized peanut butter, or, you know, safflower oil, and you use those, you're basically creating rocks in your body. Anything that's built into it hardens. Pardon?

Q: If you heat the oil it has the same effect?

A: Even if you don't, yeah. It's worse. If you heat it, it's worse. If you hydrogenize it, it's even worse because it forms the same molecules or structures as plastic. That's how plastic was invented. This guy went to sleep when he was hydrogenating some fat. Went to sleep. It stayed six hours beyond its normal hydrogenation. He had plastic. That's how plastic was invented.

Q: It's a whole new meaning of plastic surgery, wasn't it?

[laughter]

A: Exactly. So, these fermented, you know, things like cabbage juice in small amounts will cause a internal cleansing. And that's good. Especially if you've been a high vegetable oil eater in your lifetime. Margarine and garbage like that. All of the tribes that eat lots of fat, even cooked, have no heart disease, no cholesterol problem.

Q: So, would you suggest making cabbage juice once a month?

A: No, I'm not going to get into that. It's so specific. You know, it's a control to keep yourself from going off the deep end. That's why I'm writing the next book, the Detoxification Book. That's going to probably be Christmas.

Q: I'm excited.

A: So, I'm not going to give you pieces of information that will make it deadly for you.

Q: How about acidophilus?

A: Acidophilus is really a waste. Acidophilus normally is in milk. If you want natural acidophilus, it breaks down the sugars only. Bulgaricus breaks down the fats. Caucasicus breaks down the proteins. So, you need all of those bacteria. People say, oh, I take enemas and colonics. I'll drink lots of acidophilus. Hello! Acidophilus doesn't exist in the bowel. E. coli exists in the bowel. Acidophilus exists in the small intestines and the stomach to digest milk fats and other sugars. Bowel is a place to digest your proteins.

Q: Now, do E. coli survive the trip through the stomach acids and everything?

A: E. coli is generated in the bowel.

Q: Well, no. What I'm saying is that like with the high meat, that's the reason that you're taking high meat is for the E. coli.

A: No, it's for other bacteria. You're not going to have E. coli in high meat unless you take some fecal matter and spread it on it. I do that. If I want E. coli in my meat and I want to breed E. coli, I take some fecal matter from the cow and I'll rub it on the meat and then I'll have E. coli. Otherwise, E. coli doesn't exist on meat unless fecal matter touches it.

Q: But they'll survive the trip through the stomach?

A: Well, then, hydrochloric acid will destroy it here, but not in the bowel. See, you have most of your hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the intestinal tract. You're going for other bacteria, you're not after the E. coli.

Q: But those bacteria are going to survive?

A: Yeah. They're part of your small digestive tract.

Q: But if you want to increase your E. coli, I think it was in a recent email you sent out, you talked about the eating of the fecal matter.

A: Yes, but you have to eat fecal matter.

Q: But that's going to survive?

A: Because it gets so deep in the vegetable matter of the animal that's eating it, your hydrochloric acid won't penetrate it. It takes a certain kind of enzyme that only exists in herbivores.

Q: Somebody needs to come out with a time-release shit capsule.

A: Well, my fourth book will be called Eat Shit, Live. 

[laughter]

A: Maybe I'm going to make it. It's a comedy. It's spoofing everything that's backward about our civilization. It's showing that the University of Toronto in association with the Children's Hospital of Toronto has been using E. coli for over 30 years now to completely dissolve human brain tumors in 2-7 days. Including the vessels going to the brain. That's how they've used it all. Yale's been using Salmonella to dissolve other tumors. Salmonella. So with the medical profession and pharmaceutical house wants you to get rid of all bacteria in your body so you have to go to them. One injection of that attenuated Salmonella and buy on products for that lecture cost you $8,000.00. You use egg rot, chicken rot, and eat it. Then they attenuated the Salmonella so that it cuts off the oxygen to the tumor but no longer eats the tumor. So what they do now is charge you $12,000.00 for an injection of the solvent to dissolve the tumor. $20,000.00 of treatment when you can just eat high meat, high eggs and get rid of your cancer easily. At pennies.

Q: Anybody that's interested in getting the large intestine with the contents I also get that from the buffalo. So again you can see me at the...

A: And I hope a lot of people are doing shit.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: I have my box ready. I'm just sending it to you.

Q: Aajonus, what does attenuated mean?

A: Altered. Genetically altered.

Q: I see.

A: So there's lots of people who have severe mass depression. It's usually because they don't digest proteins properly. So eating fecal matter gets rid of it the easiest, so does high meat. But fecal matter will get rid of it longer. It creates a high.

Q: So do the metals affect the fecal matter? If I eat buffalo shit. Will that affect...

A: The place where you need the breaking down heavy metals, it's not going to get there.

Q: This is shitty.

A: Hot baths are the only old way you're going to get rid of yours... hot baths and the juice, the cilantro with the coconut cream in it.

Q: So the question for him.

A: Okay. 

Q: He has bone loss. That's all he wants to know about. He has bone loss in his hip from the doctor said it's chemotherapy.

A: He has what?

Q: I've had to replace my hip.

A: Oh, so you've got a femur joint replaced.

Q: He hasn't done it yet. That's what the doctor is saying. But they even said that it's not going to be effective but it's the only thing they can think of.

A: Even my father... well let me tell you last year September I was in Florida and I was doing a seminar in Fort Lauderdale or West Palm Beach and I said you know I've never been here to Florida before and yet they had like 70 people in this room and they were all ages. Fort is full of a lot of elderly people. And I said how did you people find out about this diet? Why are so many of you here? And one man stood up and said I got a hip replacement and I was in pain for two years and they replaced it again and they did all kinds of things and nothing could stop it. Drugs couldn't stop it. Nothing. They said I ate your meat for ten days, raw meat for ten days and the pain was gone. Another guy stood up and said I didn't need replacement. Same thing. He ate the raw meat pain was gone. These people had suffered for years with pain. Raw meat, pain was gone. Very simple.

Q: So does it have to be raw red meat or can you eat chicken and fish?

A: It should be a combination. You have to understand that the bone marrow in the joint is like butter but it is fed a lot by the red meat because the bone marrow breeds your red and white blood cells. So for some reason red meat is still very important for the bone marrow. And the bone marrow is usually pushing off the poisons to the joint that's causing the pain. And when your body gets the proteins then it can bind with those poisons and then they're not irritating the joint. So red meat in combination with other meats is the best way to do it.

Q: Now what about eating bone marrow?

Q: My question is how strict do we need to be on this diet and how long to [unintelligible]?

A: It depends on every individual. It's an individual situation. The man who had the hip replacement had two years of suffering. A year and three months, a year and seven months something like that. A year plus three quarters of a year so it must have been nine months. A year and nine months of pain. He did the diet probably 75%. But he made sure that he ate a pound and a half of meat a day. He was about your size. A pound and a half of meat a day.

Q: What about eating bone marrow? Would that help?

A: If you get bone marrow you have to get it from an organic animal. And that's difficult to get. I get it from her when I get it.

Q: They have it down at the co-op now from the bison people. Northstar Bison.

A: Northstar Bison is not organic.

Q: It's not? So you don't recommend it?

A: Not for bone marrow and gland. They use dewormers monthly and they give the females vaccines.

Q: So because James is selling it now.

A: I know, I told James. James knows. He's selling it because he wants to offer it. He says if I give him some other people, some other sources he'll carry those other sources. But I don't... The only sources that I have are Kathy's and they're Kathy's sources. So she's the source for that so I go to her. If somebody else wants to find other sources, they have to do what Kathy does. Search them out. Kathy's been very diligent in helping us do that. Finding the best. This is a woman who five years ago was catatonic and couldn't talk. Now you can't shut her up.

[Laughter]

[Applause]

A: Serious catatonic.

Q: My diet, a lot of pasta.

A: Okay, do you have a question?

Q: Yeah. Is it toxic to wear rubber flip flops?

A: What?

Q: Rubber flip flops?

A: Not necessarily. Are they truly rubber? Are they truly rubber or are you talking about nylon plastic?

Q: If they're nylon or plastic, they're toxic?

A: They've got BPAs in them. BPAs are polymers. They're used to harden plastic. A test came out nine months ago and showed that 82% of the animals subjected to polymer gas that leach from plastic, nylon clothes, anything, 82% of them got brain tumors. Guess what? They're allowed to use the BPA for another five years because of finances. Industry will go under and lose tremendous amounts of money if they can't put out this product. So they have five years to find an alternative while babies get brain tumors and all of us get brain tumors and other cancers because of these plastics. If you gotta wear clothes, wear no nylon, no rayon, nothing but silk, wool, and cotton. Period. And linen. All those four. That is it. Everything else is cancer-inducing. Can you imagine? The fibers are just like cotton. They won't flake. They dust. You look at the lint in your dryer. It's the same with natural as with any synthetic fiber. That gets into your lungs. That's plastic in your lungs. What do you have to do to break down plastic? It has to turn into a [unintelligible]. Everybody's breathing these and we have only had 20 years of it. And each year there's less and less natural cloth available. So you can imagine in the next 20 years the amount of brain tumors that children are going to have because that's all they'll have is synthetic clothing. Plastic. Constantly breathing plastic.

Q: Only cotton?

A: Cotton, wool, silk, linen. And hemp.

Q: What about the shoes?

A: I consider hemp a linen.

Q: What's the shoes then?

Q: Leather?

A: Leather and rubber.

Q: Only leather and rubber.

Q: How about the tennis shoes?

A: Well, the plastic is still going to gas. Whether you've got socks on or not, you're going to have the gas penetrate your foot.

Q: So how do I know if the rubber is from the good source? Do I have to inquire from the company? It's got to be directly from the rubber tree?

A: Rubber only comes from that tree. You know, you can see my shoes wherever they are. They're leather tennis shoes. These are not plastic. These are leather. All leather. I got these in Costa Rica for about $25. In New York City, they're $110.

Q: Where would I know leather tennis shoes from here?

Q: Some of the soles are pure rubber.

A: No, well, yes, the sole is pure rubber. And this is all leather.

Q: Aren't they hot?

Q: You can find leather tennis shoes here?

A: And I always get shoes that are at least a half a size bigger than my foot. There's lots of air and cooling.

Q: Do you know if the [unintelligible] is leather?

A: I have no idea. Whenever I go into a store, I look what's there. What they're producing right now, and I find what's leather. So they get leather and rubber. But I would say the shoes are the least of your problem. It would be, you know, the cloth, the lint, and you're breathing it. That's the major problem. You're breathing that plastic. I mean, the sheets, your bed. You know, I have to take my sheets with me now because every hotel is buying synthetic sheets. You know, so I have to take my sheets with me when I travel. Because you're breathing plastic. Guess what's going to happen to plastic when it starts melting in your lungs? Because your lungs have to melt it. Your body has to dissolve it. That means you've got all these polymers, and all these, what do you call those, glues, like a rubber of cement? Yeah, well, cements, but they're called, I forgot what they're called, certain kinds of epoxies. Epoxy. You're going to have all that part made up in part of your lungs. It's going to get into your bronchioles. It's going to get into your brain. It's going to go throughout your body. Stay away from plastic clothes, plastic sheets, plastic towels. You're just asking, you know, for disease. Why do you think so many children are so diseased now? We're talking five out of eight children now have a disease, a serious disease, at birth. At birth.

Q: They're putting that fire retardant stuff in their...

A: In the beds, too.

Q: In the pajamas for babies.

A: Yes, for babies, yes.

Q: And in the futon mattresses.

A: Borax, too. And this, you know, the chemical industries are behind it. They're going to the fire department and saying, use this as a fire retardant. This will save lives. Let's put it in clothing. Let's put it in this and that for babies. They know what it's going to do, because they've done the laboratory test. They know it's going to create a disease, but they get to sell it. They make fortunes.

Q: I read they already...

A: No scruples.

Q: I read they already found that fire retardant stuff in breast tissue and thyroid.

A: Yes, yeah, that came out about three months ago. Fire retardant is increasing breast cancer by something like 12%.

Q: What about magnetic mattresses? Where you have the magnets...

A: You're asking an awful lot of questions. I have to go around a little bit.

Q: I have some questions, but I don't want to... We'll just see where it goes. I have some questions about high meat. I guess my first question is... I followed the instructions in one of your books, and I'm about ready to start eating. I had heard that... I'm putting it in the refrigerator, and I pull it out and put it back in. I had heard that you don't need to put it in the refrigerator.

A: You can go faster if you don't want to put it in the refrigerator.

Q: Okay. My first question is, what are the limits? You talk about eating a marble size. I'm not looking for a specific condition. Let's just say I feel like a sorcerer's apprentice and I want to get in the laboratory and mess around. Let's see what I can do. I like to play with things, right? I'm up for... First of all, I want to experience the unusual experience of it. That's one thing. But I mean, is there an upper limit? Like if I... In other words... Is it a medicine or a fool's...

A: It's a medicine.

Q: It's more a medicine, so I should treat it like a medicine.

A: Because if you get an awful lot of bacteria in your body that isn't just going to help you digest, it's going to start eating toxic tissues throughout your body. You have to get rid of that waste product. And your body can only handle so much waste product in a day.

Q: Give me a boundary though.

A: It's on the individual.

Q: So I'll just proceed.

A: I've eaten as much as a half a cup a day repeatedly for 28 days without any reaction. I've eaten as much as two cups at a time like when I did the show for Ripley's and for the German. A German company in Germany, because they went worldwide. People saw me eat bad food, so-called bad food all over the world. And this German company flew over here to film me doing it again. That poor camera man was puking all over the place. The camera man had to get close to see the bugs and everything on the floor. And he had to even smell it. He was puking. Both of them.

Q: You should have gone over to him and explained the benefits of licking up his own vomit.

A: I got some cotton balls with some clove oil on it and stuck it up his nose.

Q: I was going to ask, how did you break into it initially? When you started doing it?

A: I used musk oil and cotton balls. I was with the Eskimos in Alaska. And they introduced me to it. But I couldn't get within five feet of it without choking. And the children are jumping up and down like this is some phenomenal candy. So bad I was getting a headache. So they put musk oil on some cotton balls and I stuck it up my nose. And that was my introduction.

Q: That's where you learned about high meat from the Eskimos. That's a cool story. Okay, another aspect about the high meat. Wait, what was that? I just went blind. Well, here's another aspect. The high eggs. How do you make the high eggs? 

A: Well, if you want to make them fast, you take the egg and you just tap it until you know it cracked. Just hairline cracks so you can see it. And then you just let it sit in the sunshine or in a carton with a sunshine beading on the carton. And it usually takes about six weeks and you have some pretty rough sticky eggs.

Q: But you told me once that when the sun was so hot I cooked the egg.

[laughter]

A: You didn't have it inside a closed container. You had it exposed right to the sun. The sun hit the egg directly. So leave it inside the carton and let it, you know, the sun hit the carton, heat it up.

Q: Hairline crack, about six weeks. Just leave it out no matter what the weather. Just stick it out.

A: Well, if it's cold, you don't want to leave it out. It's got to be in a semi-warm place. It can't be too cold, or it will retard the bacterial growth. That's why I don't refrigerate eggs.

Q: Okay, and then are there...

A: And the high eggs taste just like hard boiled eggs with a whole bottle of salt full poured on top. There's no offensive taste to it at all. It's simply just too salty.

Q: What do they look like?

A: They smell bad.

Q: It depends upon the egg. I've had eggs explode.

A: I mean, when I was in Cambodia they're selling them on the street these black eggs that they pull up out of the ground because they let them rot.

Q: Oh, yeah, China too.

A: Yeah. Century eggs.

Q: Yeah.

A: For 25 year olds it's $1,000 an egg.

Q: Wow.

A: Full of black or white mold. This bacteria. And the only people can afford it are these rich octogenarians. It's for real. And they'll eat an egg and they'll be able to have sex every day and ejaculate two or three times a day for a month.

Q: Really? Oh wow!

Q: That's real. Okay, so what is the [unintelligible] high egg?

A: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

Q: So you were telling this girl that you met out there. Here's a cotton swab with some musk oil. Stick it up your... What are you, some sex freak? Just trust me, okay?

Q: [laughter]

Q: What's the advantage of the high egg versus high meat? What's the difference?

A: There's a lot more mature protein in the meat than in the egg.

Q: So the meat's actually preferable?

A: Well, it depends on what you're looking at. If you've got tissue that was damaged in your body from a drug, contamination, eggs are better. 

Q: Okay, and now I guess last question. Now, so you were talking about getting E. coli into the high meat situation by taking fecal matter, and you mentioned buffalo fecal matter, and sort of just smearing it on a little bit. Okay, so suppose I want to do that. So I take my own fecal matter, right? Okay, are there any considerations about...

A: You don't want to use your own fecal matter.

Q: You don't.

A: You have to use an organic animal, so it's completely pure. You don't want to take your own fecal matter.

Q: Why would you not?

A: Because you've got high contaminants in your system. If you had been raised a raw fooder all of you, it wouldn't be an issue.

Q: Oh, it's a good thing I came here and asked you that. Okay, so where do you get organic fecal matter? Kathy? You never told me...

A: Kathy supplies us the shit.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Exactly. I'll let it go to the next person.

A: Okay, Jim.

Q: Well, I have a bunch of questions, but one thing is, no matter how I prepare chicken and all the recipes, my wife won't eat it. I think she needs it. I'll eat it. I like it. What's going on? 

A: Why wouldn't she eat it?

Q: She doesn't like it. Even if I give her the tomato and chicken soup thing, with extra honey in it, it makes it like candy. She still won't eat it.

A: Did you blend it? Did you take it and put it in a 10% chicken with beef and put it together in a food processor and then make a dish with it? She'll never know it's in there.

Q: No. So just put it in a beef dish.

Q: Just trick her.

A: Just only 10%. She won't be able to taste it any more than that, she will.

Q: Okay. Thanks.

Q: But that's kind of not without the person's consent. If you're doing that. Remember the story about your son.

A: He's making the food for her. She wants it. She needs it. I've seen her as a patient. She needs it. I told her she needs it.

Q: So it's just a matter of she confronts it and she rejects it.

A: I've had some clients who are that way. They'll blend it with red meat and they'll never know.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Judy. Oh, I didn't hear the Jew on it. Judy. Okay.

Q: My question is again, how strict do we need to be in that diet?

A: It depends upon the person. It depends upon the person. I've seen people do the diet 50% take away the problem. And they'll continue 50% for their whole lives. My parents are that way. They were both dying in their 60s. And I got them to eat half raw. They'll eat the raw olive oil. They'll eat the raw butter. They won't eat raw meat. My father ate it only when he was in pain with his knee transplant. He was suffering for weeks. I told him the story. I've been trying to get him to eat raw meat for 20 some years. And he ate the raw meat. He ate the raw meat.

Q: No I'm talking about the rotten egg. 

A: Oh, you mean the high bacterial foods. It depends on what you want. That is a medicinal remedial thing. If you're in depression, eat it every day. A little bit every day. If you're not in depression, you want hormones to build and develop in your body, you know, use it a couple of times a week. One high egg a month might do you. If I have one high egg every six months, it does me. Otherwise, I'm a sexual maniac. I have to watch it.

Q: So that's the best thing for sexual vigor, high eggs?

A: I mean, for some people, their bodies are going to use it differently. But as you get healthier and you use more of the high eggs, then you have an excess that will help build certain hormones.

Q: Is that women and men?

A: Yes. Women and men are affected the same way.

Q: I called my doctor three weeks ago about this problem. He told me, and his bone is coming [unintelligible]. He said, the problem you have is you've got little cartilage.

A: You rebuild it eating eggs and meat. Eggs and meat together. So you're having, let's say, 20% chicken and 80% red meat. And you make a steak tartare with raw egg in it, and it builds quickly. 

Q: All the cartilage will build quickly. [unintelligible]

A: You have one meal like that and the pain will disappear by 50% within about an hour. It makes a big difference instantly.

Q: That's meat, white meat, and eggs?

A: Yes, steak tartare.

Q: Chicken, any kind of meat?

A: Chicken, beef, and eggs. You can even put fish in it if you want. It will add more minerals and you probably build the bone quicker, cartilage quicker, use all three.

Q: You told me that bone is dying completely because of the chemo.

A: Well, yeah. I lost, you know, I had bone cancer. So I lost about 40% of my bone mass. And it's all back. All back.

Q: When did you have that?

A: When I was 20 years old, 21.

Q: How old are you now?

A: I'll be 57 next Saturday.

Q: Really?

Q: Oh my gosh, you're so good.

Q: Oh man. So young.

A: Getting younger every day. When I was 21, [unintelligible] I was 35, 37.

Q: No plastic surgery.

A: No. No plastic surgery. No.

Q: Raw meat surgery.

A: There you go. Raw meat surgery. I was told that if I put meat, you know, raw meat over this, by some native Indians, it would take some of the wrinkles away. But I want to see it go away naturally without anything to do. I mean, more naturally, just from the inside out.

Q: I'll try that for you.

A: You can sleep with it on all night. That's what they say.

Q: Where is the meat you put on your face?

A: Where the wrinkles are. Thin slices of meat, leave it on all night.

Q: Is that beef or kidney meat?

A: Beef. Beef is the only thing I've been told that will work on wounds and bruises. Red meat's the only thing that's [unintelligible].

Q: You can sell it to women.

Q: Does the cast keep the self-cast from happening?

A: Well, if you have movement there, the body will build it on its own. If you don't, if you've got a cast on, there's no movement.

Q: Wow.

A: So it doesn't develop.

Q: So the best thing is don't have a cast when you break a bone.

A: Yeah, but you have to be careful while this is, until this is built, that you don't dislocate that bone.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, well, I just took care. The only place I took a big chance was that girlfriend I met wanted to go to the market. So I said, well, I'm well enough to go to the market. Bangkok, you've got thousands of people elbow to elbow. So she had to go as a guard for the shoulder.

Q: You should never go to the market on a situation with your own health.

A: But she was my shield. So she was right there.

Q: What about a splint that they used to use for broken arms? Is that okay?

A: Well, still, it will keep the movement in your body from developing its own. You can use a splint or not, or a cast or not, it doesn't matter. It's up to you. As long as the cast is plaster of paris, you're not going to have a problem. They're starting to make, you know, they're starting to put polymers in there, so they're putting polyurethane plastics in the new casts. And that you don't want, because that would gas into your arm. So you're not going to heal properly.

Q: Yes, in your recipe book, you talk about combining fruit with chicken and fish. And you say there's alkaline fruit, and you say there's acidic fruit. What are some other alkaline and what are other acidic? Because I've tried to combine things, but then I wasn't sure if that was acidic or alkaline.

A: Peaches, melons, let's see, these are alkaline. Pears, they're all alkaline. Subacid and acid are your, acid are your citrus fruits, subacid are apples.

Q: Apples, can you combine with chicken or not?

A: Yes. But you always have to have fat with them. And if you get them green instead of ripe, then you're getting less sugar and more enzymes. So that's much better. It's like the Thais and the Cambodians and the Laos and the Burmians. Burmese. Burmese. And the Malaysians, they all eat very tart green mangoes.

Q: Yeah.

A: And it's funny because it keeps them from having the lymphatic congestion that usually goes along with their kind of a high carbohydrate diet.

Q: I like my bananas really green almost.

A: That's the way to have them. Bananas are a subacid like apples.

Q: Mangos are they an alkaline or acid?

A: They're alkaline unless they're tart, then they're a subacid.

Q: Are bananas a sweet fruit?

A: Bananas are a subacid.

Q: No, when it's green, they're not sweet at all.

Q: But when they're ripe, they're really sweet.

A: Yeah, sweet. High alkaline.

Q: Essentially fruit that's not really sweet, but it is more it's much better for you. And if you do combine like a mango with chicken, is it bad or is it just that it doesn't seem like with beef, does it just convert it to fuel or what is it?

A: Well, it's just my experiment. I can't tell you why or how. I just found that even if you mix a fruit that is semi-ripe, not overly ripe. If it's overly ripe, it's going to make fuel with your protein. And if it's semi-ripe or unripe, and you mix it with white meats, it will still generate help generate tissue and heal quicker. But with red meats, it doesn't. The only thing you can get away with the red meats are the pineapple and the papaya.

Q: So the red meat should be eaten by itself?

A: No, you can have it with tomatoes and other things. I've got it in the recipe book. Of what you can combine with red and white meats. And there are 82 sauces in there to make it enjoyable. And the 82 sauces can be made in 3-5 different ways each. So there's about 400 sauces. So, find many sauces that are easy to... I mean, you know, some of these people could eat a third of a pound of meat a day and couldn't eat more. With the sauces, you're eating 3 pounds a day.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's always better.

Q: You don't find the green in the store.

A: No. Well, you can find more and more green because they're starting to pick them younger and younger.

Q: Did you say pineapple and papaya are alkaline?

A: No. But I said they will mix with red meat and still allow the meat to become a healer. A cell regenerator. So it doesn't matter whether it's alkaline or acid. Those are the two... Probably because of the bromelain and the papain. And the papain in the papaya, which is a protein that helps break down and disassemble fat. And the bromelain in the pineapple, which helps break down protein, was probably the only reason you could use those particular fruits with red meat.

Q: What are berries? Are they alkaline or?

A: Yes. Strawberries are acid. Most of the other berries are alkaline.

Q: So the strawberries you could have with chicken?

A: Yeah. And fish. Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah. I want to know more specifically about putting the meat in lemon juice, like chicken, fish, or whatever. I did some fish recently and I had it in there for about five days. And when I ate it on the fifth day I got horrible stomach aches. And what's the difference between that kind of length and time for high meat, you know, I thought it would be okay.

A: Usually it may have been purely coincidental.

Q: Does that have to do with the lemon juice?

A: If you add too much lemon juice it's going to eat into your stomach mucus. And it starts eating into your stomach mucus and your mucus is very thin or short fiber and it's going to cause a burn to the stomach. The stomach's going to be going to a cramp.

Q: Okay. That might happen.

Q: Were they organic lemons?

Q: I don't know. Probably.

Q: Because I found that I got a stomach ache when I didn't use organic lemons.

Q: I usually get those.

A: If your mucus is thin then you want to eat more eggs.

Q: More eggs? I've been eating like 6 a day.

A: Are you eating in with meat?

Q: No.

A: Then do that and that will create a longer fiber.

Q: Like at the same meal?

A: At the same meal. Or right after the meal. When you build mucus, mucus has fibers in it. It's like a mesh. It's like layers and layers of cloth. You've got these fibers, broken fibers. When a woman is on her period or not fertile you see the mucus fibers you take a mucus and it will pop. Right there. It will only go maybe a sixteenth or an eighth of an inch and then the fiber will break. The mucus won't stay long. But when she's fertile those mucus fibers get very long and you can stretch them about that long before they will break. That's the difference. The longer the fibers the more protection you have. In the body. Usually women and men only develop... I mean women develop that kind of mucus when they're on their menstrual I mean in their fertile period. Otherwise, the body normally creates it all the time that way if an animal is well and healthy. That's not during that time.

Q: But in other places in the body too?

A: Everywhere. It will make it right. But because the reproduction is so delicate that gets the priority.

Q: One other question. Who's going to help us out with all this stuff when you move to Thailand?

A: Pardon?

Q: Who's going to help us with all this when you move to Thailand?

A: When I move to Thailand it will be at least three years and I'll be there only three months at a time at the most because all the other clinics will be opening up and we'll be in probably Oaxaca, Mexico.

Q: Oaxaca?

A: Oaxaca. There are going to be 12 of them so I'll be spending weeks in different ones. But I will have all the information in books. And then I'll put it on my website eventually that's going to have every book on it so you can run a search on it so you'll pay to get on the website pay monthly to get on the website and you can put in whatever your problem is and you can come up and search on it and it will come up with every place that I mention it so you'll be able to get the information just like that. But that's going to be about two years to develop it.

Q: That's great.

Q: When are you going to see the patients here?

A: They won't need me when I have all the information. That's what I'm working at. They can take care of themselves when I give everybody enough information. And when they can address it they'll be able to look into it.

Q: I meant to say the iridology I mean how much people are doing.

A: Well that's if they want to know themselves but I'm training other people, I'll be training other people to do that. So I won't have to be relied upon very much.

Q: I'm want to be trained.

A: Yeah.

Q: Yeah.

A: I'm charging $8,000 tuition a year plus 20 hours a week of work that involves one of my books. So you'll learn as you're working with it. It's a three year course. You'll start probably January.

Q: Are you training regular doctors or are you training people like [unintelligible]?

A: I'm training only people who had exposure to some kind of health principle.

Q: So they're not doctors but they're some kind of health professionals.

A: Yeah. They've been some kind of nutritionist or therapist or somebody that knows the body so they don't have to learn the body. All they have to know is the basics of the body. 

Q: So if you don't have a computer and you're not computer literate then you're lost, right?

A: Well you won't be able to address it as easily. You'll just have to go through the books and do it slowly. And you still have the access to the information but you won't be able to address it in an instant. It'll take you weeks to figure things out or you can do it in a day if you have a computer.

Q: But Kathy asserts it's real slow.

Q: I don't have a computer.

Q: Well he travels around those telephones and see it's not like he is going to another galaxy.

Q: No I know but I think it makes it... how much is a long distance call?

Q: She needs some reassurance. Put your arm around her. I'm not going to go Kathy. You'll be fine.

Q: Well you'll probably have the information right, Liliana?

A: And I encourage everybody to eat fat. I always say that. Fat is protection. Tell this story again. Last year I went to...

Q: You lost weight, right?

A: Absolutely.

Q: You weren't that fat. You were not fat.

A: Well it was the accident. I lost like 20 pounds. I couldn't eat because I didn't have all the food. I had to rely upon other people getting me the food. I was in so much pain I didn't even have the wit to eat much.

Q: Can you give us an estimate of how you need to be? I gained already 22 pounds. Do I have to gain more?

A: I would say no more than 5 more pounds. Right now to me you're perfect. You're perfect.

Q: Excuse me. Right now I am overweight 30 pounds.

A: You're perfect.

Q: Noo...

A: I'm serious. I'm telling you a story so you all understand. I was in Nashville, North Carolina to see patients last year. It was September. And Nashville was full of these hippies from my era. In their 40s, 50s, 60s, hippies. And they've all been long-term vegetarians. They all do the right thing. Yet they're the sickest people I've seen. Then this guy who looked like he'd been a motorcycle biker, a gang member, walks in and he's got adipose tissue all over his face like he's been a drug abuser for at least 25 years and alcoholic for 30 years. He was only about maybe 25 pounds overweight. And his coloring was pretty good but his skin was a mess. I mean as far as adipose tissue and the damage that was done in the skin was scarring. Well, when I looked at his irises, his insides were almost immaculate. And here we had all these people who were 30 years old and vegetarians who thought they were doing the right thing. And here's this drug abuser who admitted that he'd been an alcoholic for 30 years and a drug abuser for 27 years. And we're talking cocaine, heroin, everything. And I said, it doesn't make sense to me. How can this be? You're only about 25, 30 pounds overweight. And he said, well, before I went on your diet five months ago I was 300 pounds.

Q: Oh.

A: Fat absorbs poison. We know that scientifically. Because when we go into a body we find the poisons, the toxins, where our fat is. And it's mostly in glands and fat tissue. So if you're fat, you're protected.

Q: He lost 300 pounds on your diet?

A: No, he was 300 pounds. He lost 120 pounds, 130 pounds. Yeah.

Q: Wow.

A: So don't lose any more.

Q: But then if you're eating, you know, everything's diet, but you're not gaining weight... 

A: Then you're not eating enough.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's what you want. If you get through that, then you'll probably break through your sleep cycle earlier. Because you get the poisons out.

Q: So then when I lose that weight, am I losing the weight with the poisons?

A: Yes. See, when you put the weight on, I tell people in the recipe book, I tell them every six months gain and lose the weight. I only say that because men and women have this bizarre notion that if they gain weight, it's going to be very hard to lose it. And it is for a lot of people who are very toxic for the first two and a half years. I would rather people be on a two and a half, two to two and a half year cycle. Get fat, hold it for two, two and a half years, and then lose it. But because people are so paranoid, it's easier to convince them if they can see that they're going to lose it in six months and then gain it back again, lose it, then they feel comfortable. Then after a few years of doing that, they don't care if the fat stays on for a year or two years. They're not worried about being fat forever. There are a few people that it's impossible for them to lose the weight, even no matter how hard they try. But it's only like .5% of all the people I know on the diet. And some people just don't want to. I was talking with a woman a couple of days ago and she says, I can't stand that I'm fat, but I'm so happy. She says, whenever I go on the weight loss program, I get unhappy. I look good, but I'm unhappy. She says, I'm staying fat. And fat, for her, is your size. To me, that's not fat. For her, that's very fat because she used to be a skinny girl. So she would rather be fat and happy. And I say, great.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I can't tell names unless they're present and they agree to it. See, you didn't agree to anything I said, so I didn't mention anything.

Q: Quick question. Since I passed it first time. If you have a lot of mucus that's in your stool, is that good news or bad news?

A: It's good news. Anything that happens when you're on a diet, it's good news.

Q: And the only way we can buy fertile eggs is if they are refrigerated when we get them. Is that bad? If we take them out and leave them out, is that okay?

A: Yeah, they'll start building up their bacteria again. And they'll be able to... No protein will... Never refrigerate eggs. You've got to re-read the books.

Q: No, no, no. [unintelligible]

A: Well, when you go to the mall, call your store. Find out when they get the eggs in. The eggs are never refrigerated until they're put on the truck.

Q: I asked for co-operative. They're transported in refrigeration.

A: They don't get put in refrigeration until they go on to the truck. The truck takes five hours at the most to get to the last stop. So it's only a few hours. Find out what day and what time the eggs come in. About what time come in. Go in that day, get them. They haven't been refrigerated but a few hours. Because it takes them about three hours to get to the temperature where the law says that the eggs have to be delivered to the temperature, just like 48 degrees. Usually the trucks will take it lower because they want them to be chilled faster. But because the first delivery may be only three hours away from the house and where they got the egg.

Q: So we shouldn't put the eggs in the refrigerator?

A: The eggs should never, ever go in the refrigerator. Okay. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Good question. Cellulite? Is that a new form of radiation?

[laughter]

Q: Cell phone flashlight.

A: Cellulite. Cellulite is usually, is always, hardened fat that is full of toxic matter. And it just keeps getting layers and layers thicker. And it turns into these balls. Hardened balls. Sometimes they'll never even show until you go on this diet. And the body starts putting solvents in there to dissolve it. And all of a sudden you've got cellulite. It's been there, you just haven't seen it. And when the body starts dissolving it, it's getting rid of it. And it takes swelling to do that. Because the solvents come around, surround it, and then dissolve it. Hot baths help remove it. If you take an hour and a half bath, you know, because a lot of times vegetable oils are involved, in that fat. And vegetable oils, once they've been in the body a while, will never turn fluid again at body temperature. So the body has to get 102, 105 degrees to get it to melt. So if you take long baths and take some kind of a formula like, you know, if anybody wants to write this down, an eighth to a quarter, well, depending upon your size as a person, to a third of an inch thick, a slice of green pineapple. Mix it with two to three ounces of coconut cream, and three tablespoons of butter, and one to three tablespoons of cow's cream, and a little bit of honey if you like. And you drink that before or right when you get in the bath. Then when you get out of the bath, you take a 45 minute to an hour walk. What the water will do, the hot water will do, so you have to keep warm, you have to do that every 20 minutes to 30 minutes, depending on what type of tub you have. Keep the temperature between 102, 105 degrees, so that it will soften all that cellulite, so it will get soft. Then that formula will start working into the lymph system and keeping it from going too hard again once your body cools. So when you do the walk and the exercise, you should also be bundled to be very hot. So like, wear wool underwear, silk underwear, plus your clothes over that, and you go right out and do your walk. You'll perspire a lot of the poison out. Sweat it out, yes. So you'll lose, if you did that, let's say, for two days a week, you would probably speed up the cellulite loss to probably four years instead of ten years. But on this diet, once you get rid of the cellulite, you never get it back.

Q: What about drinking water during the time that you're sweating?

A: Well, it's better to drink tomatoes and things that are going to help make solvents that help dissolve it and take vitamin A into your system. So it's better to take a bunch of, like, a quart of tomatoes and blend it with two ounces of cream. And that's a better way to get your fluids to handle that. Otherwise, if you had to drink water, if you did that, took the bath and everything, it would probably take you about two and a half quarts of water to regulate your fluid level. If you took tomatoes, one quart would be more than enough to do it. Plus, it wouldn't leach too much in your body. You need a certain amount of water because water is your most important solvent. It's so funny, the medical profession, even the pharmaceutical industry doesn't identify water as a solvent. But if you go into an... archaeological and oceanographers, they learn that water is an important solvent because you have to learn the properties of water and what it does to things in nature. Archaeologists need to know that and oceanographers need to know that. So they are taught that water will just disintegrate anything that it combines with. And that's its property. So when you put water into the body, it will tear your body apart if you're drinking too much water. It will leach minerals, vitamins, proteins from your system in your blood. So water is not something to have too much of. It's very minimal.

Q: What about your showers and all that? Bathing. It doesn't affect you that way, man.

A: Well, I take a bath every five to six days.

Q: And no showers?

A: Yeah, I have a well. So I'm up there in Malibu Mountains. I've got my little well, so I don't have to worry about it.

Q: I've got a well too, so that's okay.

A: Yeah, that's okay. But if you have city water like the LA city water, there's 192 chemicals in it. The water's been shit and peed in three times before you get it. Because it comes all the way from the Colorado American Canal. It comes down here, and it is used by Oxnard first, and then it goes to the valley, and then it goes to the community up here, and then it goes to the lower. It's all recycled. It's all reconstituted. So if you take baths, it's better. You can put a couple of cups of milk in it with a couple of tablespoons of vinegar and a couple of tablespoons of sea salt. That neutralizes the poisons.

Q: What about soaps and shampoos?

A: Those are all poison, and they all get into the body.

Q: As you let water out to get hotter water in the tub, do you need to add more milk?

A: No. For some reason, no. I did it for three years of testing, and for some reason that's all it took. If you don't want to use milk and you have only coconut cream, then you can use two ounces of coconut cream in the water. That's even better for the skin. Especially if you had candida or any kind of a fungus, you put two ounces of coconut cream in your bath, and it just coats everything, and you get rid of athlete's foot, candida, or any kind of a fungus. Four tablespoons of coconut cream.

Q: What do you use apart from water?

A: Pardon?

Q: What do you use apart from water? If you don't use soaps, what do you use?

A: I use, it depends. If I use coconut cream in the water, I just use a washcloth. Because coconut cream, 50 years ago, 80% of all the soaps in the world were made from coconut. Saturated fat just dissolves, dirt, and grime, and gets rid of it instantly. So if I use coconut cream in the bath, then I just use a washcloth.

Q: You use that in place of milk, and you don't need milk.

A: Correct. But if I'm using, if I want to make a shampoo, and I'm not using the coconut cream in the water, I use two ounces of the vegetable juice, green vegetable juice, two ounces of milk if my hair is very dry, it will condition the hair, and a tablespoon of honey, a tablespoon of coconut cream, or no milk and just a tablespoon of coconut cream to condition the hair, and one egg. And that's why I put that on my hair dry.

Q: Oh, really?

A: Or you can just use an egg. If you use an egg by itself, and you just want to clean your hair with an egg, then wet your hair first before you put the egg in, otherwise your hair is going to smell like egg.

Q: When you say coconut cream, don't you end up feeling a little greasy? I know when I get it on my skin, it's really greasy.

A: Yeah, but when you get out of the bath, and you take your towel over it, it doesn't leave an oily film on it. It's just perfect.

Q: Oh, yeah? I'll try. Sounds good.

Q: You mentioned the vinegar and salt. Does that stay with the coconut cream, or is the coconut cream in place of the milk?

A: Coconut cream is only in place of the milk.

Q: So you use the salt and the vinegar.

A: So you use the salt and vinegar.

Q: So in a shampoo, how long do you leave the egg on first?

A: You mean, no, if you're using the egg as your shampoo, you wet your hair first before you put the egg.

Q: Then you put on the egg, and leave it on for five minutes?

A: Doesn't matter. You know, you leave it on for two minutes.

Q: Oh, when you have the vegetable juice and the coconut cream, and the shampoo, you leave it on for five minutes?

A: Yeah, I leave it on for about five minutes. But then I don't wet the hair first when I use that.

Q: When you have the vegetable juice and you have the coconut cream.

A: When I have the egg and the vegetable juice, the honey, and the milk, I put that, I don't wet my hair first.

Q: The coconut cream, you said, in place of milk.

A: If I use, I mean, it's a tablespoon of coconut cream in place of milk. But if I'm using the vegetable juice, no matter what mixture, if I have vegetable juice in it, I do not wet my hair first. If I'm using just egg, I wet the hair first, so my hair won't smell like egg.

Q: It's a hot bath. Isn't that no good for a vaginal candida?

A: I don't have a vagina, so...

Q: How are you going to find out the answer to that one?

A: It's not a problem. Well, what it does is it allows them to procreate faster and eat more of it. But when you get out and the coconut cream is into your skin, it just stops the candida, smothers it or something. It takes away the effects of it. Or, you know, if you're not having coconut cream in your bath, then you put the primal facial body care cream from the recipe book. You put that on those areas, and the itching will go away.

Q: But if you use hair products like gel and stuff like that, if you don't put it on your scalp, it won't get absorbed by your body.

A: Oh, yes. Because the wax keeps leaking down from the shaft on your scalp. Unless your hair is all too dry.

Q: Would an egg white work as a gel?

A: Yeah, egg white works as a gel.

Q: Well, use egg white as a gel.

A: Well, coconut cream is better as a gel.

Q: Oh, yeah.

A: Coconut cream is great.

Q: On the hair, you mean.

A: If you want it even sticker, just put a tiny bit of honey, put a drop of honey per two tablespoons of coconut cream, and it will even get firm.

Q: When the tap water is warm, the milk curdles. You find it, too?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Maybe it's because your water is different than the water at home.

Q: No, I use it all the time. [unintelligible]

A: Maybe you're supposed to wait a few minutes. Maybe you're putting the milk in too when the water is too hot.

Q: Oh, okay.

Q: Wait until it cools down.

A: If I can't leave my hand in that water for five seconds, my milk does not go in that water. No ingredient goes in that water until my body can stand it. Then you just cook your ingredients. But what I do when I put in the bath, when I start the bath, I will put scalding hot water halfway. That heats up the entire tub. And then 10 minutes later, I'll go in and put cool water in until it brings it up to the level where I want. Then I'll put my ingredients in and let it sit for five, seven minutes, and then I'll get in. Then the whole tub is already heated so it won't cool quick. It may take a half an hour to chill it where I need to fill it again.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: 102 to 105 degrees.

Q: It's too hot, though, for the ingredients, right?

A: No, no. 104, 105 degrees, though, the ingredients can take.

Q: That's all you need to know for cellulite?

A: Honey is the only thing that's affected at 98.

Q: 104.

A: 104. Well, if you keep the water between 102 and 105.

Q: I was in the bathroom when you were talking about the cellulite bath. Can you just repeat the ingredients. I heard the towel. That's all I heard.

A: I didn't say towel.

Q: Oh, you didn't? Okay, what are the ingredients?

A: I just said it.

Q: What? Oh, those were the ones for cellulite? Oh, okay.

A: Yeah, it wasn't the bath. It was the ingredients to eat.

Q: Oh.

A: The ingredients to eat before you get into the bath.

Q: Oh. What's that?

A: And that's 1 eighth to 1 quarter, I mean 1 third of an inch thick circular slice of green pineapple, 2 to 3 ounces of coconut cream, 3 tablespoons of butter, 1 to 3 tablespoons of cow's cream, honey if you like. It's not necessary. What happens is, is the coconut cream is an intense solvent. It will dissolve matter. If you take, you know, a lid, like from a canning jar, it's going to spin you around. If you put the coconut cream on one of the canning jar lids, you know, it has the metal exposed. Within an hour it turns black, and you're sort of ripping up the metals. So coconut is a wonderful solvent to get rid of toxins and dissolve matter. So you have the coconut cream in there. Now you need something to arrest those poisons. So the butter and cream is for that. It will bind with those poisons.

Q: You have it in place of the other fruit? You put that in the bath?

A: No, that's what you're eating.

Q: I thought you said cellulite or something.

A: You dissolve cellulite in your body. You have the pineapple, the coconut cream, the butter, cream mixture. So it gets into your body, gets into your lymph system when you're in the bath. It softens the fat in the lymph system. Then you start feeding, you've taken that formula inside the body, and the lymph system feeds every cell in the body that isn't in the bloodstream.

Q: So you're supposed to eat that an hour before you take a bath?

A: No, no, no. If you're taking a bath for an hour and a half, you take it right before you get in the bath or right when you get in the bath. So that that is in your body and in your lymph system within an hour and a half. So then you're out of the bath, and then you do your exercise, and it's permeating into the lymph system.

Q: But if you're on weight loss, you don't take the formula with you?

A: You don't do that kind of thing on weight loss. You don't do things for intense detoxification when you're on the weight loss. Weight loss is to get rid of fats that have already combined with poison, bound with poisons in your body. You do not want to cause more deep tissue detoxification while you're losing the weight, because there's not enough blood fat to take care of those poisons.

Q: So no [unintelligible] fat?

A: No [unintelligible] fat. Well, no.

Q: I'm going to get a copy of the tape. If you want to get a copy of the tape from him, that's probably the best thing, if you're not recording. I'm going to get a copy of the tape from him, and then I'll get you a copy.

A: She has a copy.

Q: You might want to listen to it.

A: Well, sometimes she has to have things said in a different way.

Q: I hear you.

A: Her brain doesn't work in the same way. You used to be the same way.

Q: Wait a minute. If you're having, you have to have one fruit or the other. You can't have a fruit at 1.30, 2 o'clock, and then have 1.30, and then have another fruit before you go to the bath.

Q: Oh, yeah.

A: You do your bath in the afternoon. That's why I tell people to do the bath in the afternoon.

Q: That's your fruit meal.

A: Yeah, that's your fruit meal.

Q: Okay.

Q: Well, I mean, how many minutes before the bath do you have to take the fruit?

A: You take it right before you get in the bath or as soon as you get in the bath and drink it while you're in the bath.

Q: One tablespoon of coconut cream?

A: No, no, it's on there. You grab it on there. You just write it down and listen back to it in the ear. Okay. I think we've covered the room. What time is it?

Q: If I don't have it, I'll call you.

Q: It's 5.05.

A: 5.05.

Q: I'll call you.

Q: I want to talk about the magnetic mattresses.

A: I found that the magnetic mattresses are good for periods of time, six weeks, no more than usually, five hours a day, and it's helpful. As long as it's not electrically charged, they're set still magnets.

Q: There was a question Aajonus, I read once about the magnetic mattresses and the kind of thing where it could magnetize the iron and the hemoglobin and would cause the hemoglobin to cluster.

Q: Yeah, I've heard that.

A: [unintelligible] So limit your exposure.

Q: Okay.

Q: Can I ask you a question? Do you eat the meat alone or with anything else?

A: You're here, but I told you to have butter. How much butter?

Q: I'm sorry, the high meat.

A: The high meat? The high meat is always eaten alone or with water and 15 minutes before a meat meal.

Q: Okay.

Q: [unintelligible]?

A: Well, I don't know. I mean, you can definitely use it. It would probably help you.

Q: Use it before [unintelligible]?

A: No, no, for that particular part of your body.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: The other parts of your body would be very happy.

Q: I was going to get a rubber foam mattress.

A: Rubber foam will gas for five years.

Q: Latex?

A: Latex will gas for five years.

Q: I thought latex was a natural.

A: Well, it is true rubber latex if they're using a polymer with it and it's not a wax one.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: What's that? A top?

A: Latex is rubber. A lot of times they're using polymers with plastic. What do they call that again? The glue?

Q: Epoxy.

A: Epoxy. They're using the epoxy to bind the rubber together and that's plastic. That's the thing that will gas the BPA.

Q: Do you know where people can get rubber?

A: Let her finish. Let me see if she understands.

Q: No, I [unintelligible]

A: I had a rubber mattress made 100% latex, all-natural rubber. I was nothing but hot [unintelligible]. What I did was I had an organic futon made to go on top of it. I used that as my spring. $1,200 box spring.

Q: Oh, my God.

A: It works very nicely.

Q: Organic? What's the material?

A: 100% organic cotton. I have my own made.

Q: They have an option where you could do a layer of wool on top, like a pillow of wool. Would that serve the same purpose as a futon?

A: Actually, mine was made of 20% wool and 80% cotton because it sponges more. It's all organic. You go to a company now, and they want to charge almost $2,000 for that. I went to the futon company on La Brea, and I said, I want an all cotton, wool, that particular mixture, but I want it organic. We have to charge a lot of money for that. It ended up costing me only $600 for an 8-inch thick, queen-size mattress. It cost me $2,000 somewhere else. But that was $400 more than the regular futons. For them, that was a great bargain. But I had to go buy my own material because all their materials are polyester, partially polyester. I had to go buy a fabric and get the amount that I needed, the yardage that I needed, and give them the material. But they built it all for me in San Francisco.

Q: They had the organic filling, and you bought it?

A: They were able to buy it, yeah, the organic filling. They made it for me. So I had two of them made. Because I have a bed outside and a bed inside.

Q: I'm just in the process of buying a mattress right now, and I was just going to go with 100% latex.

A: But the latex one, let me tell you, you have trouble. You can perspire, and it molds. Your perspiration comes down, and all of a sudden you've got black mold coming out. I mean, it is horrendous. So I made the futon for it on top, and it's perfect.

Q: What was the percentage of cotton and wool in the futon?

A: 20% wool, 80% cotton. It springs better. It feels really good.

Q: What's the best bed to get that doesn't have all these retardants?

A: California has a law where you have to put borax or some other fire retardant in it. So I invented the doctor and wrote a letter that said, he's allergic to borax. Do not put any fire retardant in it. So they made my futons without fire retardant.

Q: So it's the only way to get it.

A: It's the only way to get it because it is a law.

Q: Even organic?

A: Even organic doesn't make any difference. You still have to put a fire retardant in it, unless you can find a chiropractor that says doctor on it. You've got a doctor, these guys don't know. If you get a note from a doctor, they won't put it in there.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you're sleeping directly on it.

Q: But why would you want it as a box spring?

A: Because it makes it firm.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, that's if you're sleeping directly on it.

Q: But you can find cheap latex mats for like, if you don't care for a box spring, you can get it for like $700.

A: Well, I don't like box springs because they have all that metal. So you've got all those, you know, and I'm very sensitive, and I'll wake up with radio sound going through my head when I sleep. So I don't like that. And if a siren goes off 50 miles away, for some reason the metal is driving it into my brain. So I have to use, I can't use any metal.

Q: Why don't you just sleep on the floor?

A: Depends on what the floor is. It's pretty hard if you're sleeping on this.

Q: What about buckwheat pillows? Do you have buckwheat old pillows?

A: I've only used buckwheat old pillows, but you know, sometimes that causes a little powdering after a while, and it causes allergies and sneezing. If you're using the pillow for only a year, before the fibers start opening up from use, they're fine, but for long-term use, it's not a good thing because it powders.

Q: I have to go, but I left that cooler right next to your box. It's on the step, and then I'll get it from you this week. I'll call you about my appointment.

A: Thank you.

Q: I'm calling about the photographs. I'll call you back.

A: All right, guys, that's it.

Q: Thank you.

Q: Thank you.
