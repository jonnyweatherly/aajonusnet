Q: Welcome to our workshop with Aajonus Vonderplanitz. He's here to talk to us about raw food, about becoming more healthy, about detox. Aajonus came into our lives a couple of years ago and has not been the same since. We've been sharing these many blessings with our friends and telling you all about it, and so here he is today to tell us some more.

A: Thank you, Jill. Hello. Has everyone read the book, or are there some people who haven't read the book? Anybody who hasn't read the book? One, two, three, four people. Okay. I'm just going to just take a few moments for the people who haven't read it. I'm an individual who was very, very ill since birth, almost died when I was 10 years old from a reaction to the polio vaccines, gave me peritonitis and they misdiagnosed as appendicitis when I actually had perforated intestine. They treated me for appendicitis wrongly, shot me with antibiotics about every three to four hours, plus pain medication. By the time I was 13, I started with angina pectoris, which are terrible muscle spasms around the heart. I would pass out. They let me lie down on the floor in the classroom for about 20 minutes because they didn't know what else to do. By the time I was 16, I started taking insulin, although I refused to until I was about 19. A few times I did take it. I didn't like it. By the time I was 19, I got a stomach ulcer. The treatment of that gave me a stomach cancer. The treatment of that gave me blood and bone cancer and the treatment of that gave me lymphoma. 

[laughter]

A: I did not go back for the verification of the lymphoma and they just said, well, there's nothing really we can do. We can try to extend your life a few months by taking more chemotherapy, but it's doubtful that it will work. I was already an invalid. To get from anywhere was a great chore because if I stood up, I passed out. So what I do is I sleep on the couch, lay on the couch, and when I had to go to the kitchen to get something to eat or to the bathroom, I laid off on the floor and scooted across the floor with my elbows and sometimes it would take me a half an hour to get to the bathroom. That's how ill they made me and that was mainly from the treatment. In the book, I talk about that. The first part of the book is a story and how my son was in an automobile accident when he was 22 years old, fractured his skull, about one-fifth of his brain was damaged. They said no one had lived with that kind of brain damage and that he would never recover. So the story is about how I helped him recover using raw foods and how I came to understand and know what I knew to help him by going through my own challenges, health challenges. So basically that is the gist of what you'll get in the book and in the second part of the book are raw food remedies for hundreds of diseases and they work 85% of the time. So it's a high rate. If it didn't work 85%, I didn't put it in the book. There are lots of remedies that worked less frequently, but I didn't put it in the book because it's just not enough room. What I'd like to go over today is something that I haven't done in the last two workshops that I've been up here in the last two years, is mainly focused on detoxification and the healing process. This diet is not a magic bullet. I've never found a magic bullet. I've searched for magic bullets, pills and the particular one food that will do it, this bark or this herb or this HGH, some human growth hormone, this was the key that will change your whole life around. 

Never found such a thing in my exploration and I haven't found anybody else who has either. Some people have been helped tremendously because they were absent in maybe just one particular nutrient and they had those kind of miraculous reactions, but there are far and few in between. This diet provides the nutrients necessary to supply your body on a daily basis to regenerate and to resupply all of the vitamins, enzymes and minerals cauterized, lost and destroyed from cooking processes or any kind of processing, whether it's heat or dehydration, because they destroy nutrients. I remember one fellow was talking to the doctor and said, well, your body has those enzymes, you know. Yeah, your body has them and it will leach from every part of your body, every cell in your body, every time you eat a cooked meal. It's absent in the enzymes, it has heterocyclic amines, it has lipid peroxides, it has all these poisons which are carcinogenic over a period of a lifetime. To reverse all of this, it takes lots of enzymes, lots of vitamins to be able to accomplish that. So, I'm one of those 100% raw fooders. When you've been where I've been and you've crawled around on the floor to get to anywhere you're going and nobody's there to help, because you know if you're asking anybody to help you, they're going to end up putting you in the hospital if you pass out. So, I refused all help except for two days a week a person from the hospice, a volunteer would come over and do some shopping for me and another would clean the house. Basically, that's how I learned about raw foods, was this one volunteer came in a drinking carrot juice and said, I want you to read this book, it was a very short book, maybe 80 to 86 pages, about this woman who reversed her cancer by drinking a gallon of carrot juice a day. That introduced me into raw foods. It changed my life instantly.

How I did that was because I had dyslexia. I had dyslexia so badly that if I looked at the printed page it swirled and I got vertigo and I'd vomit. Back in the 50's when I was learning to read, you were not allowed to follow your sentences, your words with your finger, because they said that slowed your reading ability. But they didn't understand that if I didn't use my finger to hold the page down, I'd vomit. So I was 22 years old before I drank this kale juice and within about 10 days of drinking it, my dyslexia disappeared. I had to cheat my way through schools, get through college, I had to have oral exams at all times. All the professors told me, they said, sure we can help you out, but if you can't read, you will never make it in the society. Great support. There's nothing I could do, it's like a cripple, you carry on without your legs, sorry, you will never be accepted in society, but this carrot juice reversed that and then I'd stop drinking it and then the vertigo would return, I'd drink it again, it would go away and it would return again when I stopped and then it would go away again every time I drank it. So I learned at 22 years old that raw foods was probably a good therapy. By 1972, when I was, what was I, 72, I was 25 years old, I made the commitment to totally raw foods, February of 72, and I do them completely now. According to Pottenger's work, does anybody know about Dr. Francis Pottenger? Okay, he did work with lots of raw foods, he did work with, an experiment with 900 cats over a 10 year period, feeding them various diets. He found that it took the cats who ate cooked foods, got all the diseases of humans, and to get well again it took five generations. For us, getting well to optimal health will take 40 years from the day you start eating a good raw food diet, 100%. That's not a bad average, that's about two and a half percent a year.

Let's say your body is New York City, could you imagine revamping New York City at two and a half percent a year? Impossible. So the body is pretty miraculous to be able to do it at that rate. It isn't the pot of gold is at the end of the rainbow, as you go along you get better. There are detoxifications all along the way, especially if you've been a cooked starch eater because the advanced glycation end products that form from all starches, whether they're cooked or raw, store a rate of 70% in a healthy body and a rate of 90% in an unhealthy body. New York City Medical University did research on advanced glycation end products, which are you take carbohydrate, your body converts it into a glycogen, your body uses a glycogen which is a blood sugar, and then the byproduct of that is advanced glycation end products, glycotoxin. The body needs most of cooked starches as they're already having been utilized. So instead of converting it in from a carbohydrate into a glycogen, it goes right from a carbohydrate into an advanced glycation end product, which is a glycotoxin. So you're storing that immediately, directly. What that leads to is candida, herpes, all kinds of skin problems in a lot of people. Other people will break down their glands, if those sugars, toxic sugars store in a thyroid, it can cause hypothyroidism, it can damage a liver, it can damage a pancreas and lead to diabetes, innumerable diseases, and that doesn't include, which I've already mentioned, the heterocyclic amines, which are protein toxins that are formed from cooking. 

Those are radically dangerous to the nervous system and to the hormone development or the hormone synthesis of all glandular activity, even prostaglandins, hormones are considered extra tissue, extracellular, if you have, when your liver produces a hormone or your castes or your ovaries, that is a hormone, when you have an intracellular hormone like development or secretion, that is called a prostaglandin. All of these sugars, these advanced glycation end products, interfere with the cells being able to form their own hormones, intracellular hormones, so the cells break down. With all of our immense processing that we have today, McDonald's, everything is in a package, rarely is anything fresh, these toxins are accumulating at an advanced rate. We have the chemicals, the processing, the preservatives, the pesticides, add that to it and then we are pretty toxic. Cancer in 1955 was at a rate of one in a thousand died of cancer, I just read an article from the Sun magazine, June issue, excuse me, March issue, I can't remember the doctor's, physician's name, he said that one in two males now get cancer, one in three females get cancer, that's up just from the last two years, that's pretty extraordinary. Then you say, well, you know, we have been cooking food for at least 10,000 years, we know that, at least 8,000 according to Jewish heritage, 8,000 some years cooking all along the way. Of course there were some raw fooders in the Bible, like Abel Cain, his brother, who was a vegetarian, slain his brother, was a meat eater, Abel was a raw food meat eater, very passive guy, his brother, who was a vegetarian, was not very passive, slain his brother. Hitler was a vegetarian, I have known a lot of vegetarians, including I was one for six and a half years, and I had quite a temper, my sugar level would go off instantly, I had low blood fat level to protect my nervous system, so I would get irritable very easily.

Now you would have to beat me into the ground to get me to become hostile. The whole idea that vegetarians are more calm and collected because they don't eat meat is an absolute myth. Now there are some people who are more affected by the poisons in cooked meat, yes, the heterocyclic amines in the lipid peroxides, it will irritate their nervous system or their glands and cause them to be more irritable, or just as irritable as most of the vegetarians I know. This collection of toxins is what I am going to get to today, how can they be removed? The body uses three methods, it makes solvents, just like you have degreasers, soaps, 80% fat, 15% protein, and 5% alcohols that it makes from carbohydrate that will ferment, turn to alcohol in the body. Go in and dissolve tissue, now the byproduct is almost identical to turpentine and it is as toxic, so there is a low grade nausea that is created from it and some depression, it destroys lots of bacteria. The second method is bacterium virus, bacterium virus can go in and feed on degenerative tissue breaking down the cellular toxicity, not the chemical structure because that still has to be done with the solvent process, and if you don't have bacterium virus or parasites your body has to use the solvent process, which is very, very slow. The bacteria and viral process works about two and a half times faster than your body can use a solvent, so bacteria is good, it is two and a half times less toxic. I thought it was 50% less toxic, but in the research that I have done in the last year and a half it looks like it is two and a half percent less toxic than the turpentine like substance. The third is parasites, parasites, my God, quickest workers you can have, only time it is dangerous is when you are in third world countries and you are dealing with people who only eat cooked grains, carbohydrates, live on cereals, like in India, because those tapeworms do not live on the tissues, they live on the food, if those tapeworms did not exist those people would die very quickly, those children would die earlier, because your body cannot store that much advanced glycation end products in your body without completely turning it into an acid like Coca-Cola and dissolving the body. 

So those tapeworms are even good and they feed on advanced glycation end products or carbohydrates that are not even converted yet, right in the intestines, when raw food is administered to any of those people who have that, guess what happens, three months the tapeworm is gone, minimum, if you cut out carbohydrates completely and put them on a raw meat diet they are gone in about ten days, they actually will just come apart and you will pass them out, some people have vomited them, but not very many. Parasites are a wonderful thing, they work five times faster than your body can use a solvent to remove degenerative tissue. Most people don't even know they have parasites until somebody diagnoses them and tells them and then they go and have all of these dewormers and they just annihilated their best friend. Most people who have parasites don't even know that they are working because the by-product is so non-toxic that the body doesn't notice it, the nervous system doesn't notice it, with bacteria there is some identification because of the verotoxins produced by virus and bacteria, but that's all favorable, they found that at the University of Toronto in association with the hospital for sick children of Toronto that the verotoxin produced by E.coli will completely dissolve tumors and the blood vessels going to the tumors in seven to five days with one injection. Dr. Lowe at Yale has done the same thing with Salmonella, only he does it, he says, he's created a genetically different Salmonella than our normal Salmonella because that way he can patent it, but if you just ingest anything with bacteria in it, let your meat rot, stuff like that, you will be getting all the verotoxins you need to help reverse cancer.

Now I use rotten meat to help reverse diseases, this is all about bacteria, a scientist named John Munro just published some of his work, he used EDDS's, do you know what they are? It's an electronic machine like a computer, they wire you up, they send in signals and then they come back as biofeedback and they can diagnose your situation, your conditions. They also have a paradigm of what some healthy individuals had and then they will send those electrical currents into your body to adjust your whole electromagnetic system. Now those of you who have read my appendix X, that's the therapy I was talking about that wiped me out for quite a few months, because it doesn't look at you as an individual and saying well you need this because of this because of this, it will set you up as a paradigm for about eight incredibly unusual healthy people astronauts, which this whole program is designed to facilitate, because when you are in a capsule, you can't deal with anything else, you need to go in there and violate the organic nature of things and take care of it or else you are going to lose some $3 billion or $4 trillion apparatuses floating up in the sky. When they identify you with these and send these electrical impulses in there, they are structured on the paradigm of a few individuals and it doesn't match, but a very, very, very few people, a rarity of people on this planet. So what it does is it confuses your entire system. Now John Monroe, a man who has been working with this and working with programs in that neighborhood, just found something out about his own machine. I don't know if it's because he heard about my Appendix X and what it did to me, but in one of his experiences, he took people who normally got two to four colds or flus a year. He worked on annihilating, inactivating the viral bodies that create colds and flus.

For one full year, none of these people got a cold or a flu. The side effect was that they got clinical depression. He did not identify it as the lack of virus or bacteria. Plunging along, trying to find out what it was, nothing worked. So he reintroduced the viral bodies again. People got the colds and flus again, but the depression went away. I've been utilizing high bacteria to take people out of depression, clinical depression for a long time, about four or five years. I waited until, you're the first group that gets to hear this, so almost five years to utilize this to make sure that it worked in all circumstances. Not all circumstances, not all cases would eat the rotten meat, so those I can't tell you about. But all those who did do it, and there were about 17 people who utilized in the last five years, whenever they got clinical depression, or any kind of depression at all, they rotten meat. They'd come to my door, got some more of that rotten meat. And it'd be so rotten that I mean you'd want to vomit if you smelled it, up to five months old, in the refrigerator, in a jar. Take it out once a week, twice a week, let it air, you do it outdoors, don't do it in your house, and let it air, and these people will take just small amounts, and they just cut it like you know a capsule size, and swallow it down with milk, and if you plug your nose, you don't smell a thing and it doesn't taste. But that's what they will do, and it worked in every case. One girl had cancer of the kidney, cancer of the, one of the adrenals, and cancer of the hip, and one, her right breast. This girl had been in chronic fatigue since the age of 20 years old, till she was 27, till she went on the diet. Still did not break that chronic fatigue for about a year and three months, a year and 1.75 percent, one year and nine months it took her to break it on the diet. She still was irritable to an extent, and she still had depression. 

The healthier she got, the more depression she got, because the more energy she got, the more frustrated she was, because there was still that certain amount of inertia that was built up for so long, all of a sudden she wanted to do something, and didn't know what to do, and depression resulted from that. So finally, after two and a half years, I persuaded her to try high meat. That comes from Eskimos, Eskimos ate a lot of high meats. That means bacteria high, rotten fish or beef, or caribou is mainly what they had. So she took this and I mean I had done a workshop somewhere and had gotten a fresh deer, so I took all the glands home, some of the glands home with me, lung, liver, spleen, pancreas, all those things, and I put them in some jars and let them mold. So they were about, some of them were as long as three, as old as three months when she started having them, and up to five months. Within two months of taking this, and she was about two and a half years on the diet already, but only after two months of taking these high meats, this girl was the kindest, most affectionate, gentle, could not get her angry, could not upset her at all, and never depressed in just two months. 

Q: How often did she take it?

A: She took about, a marble sized amount every week for about three weeks, and that's all. Large marbles, yeah, large marbles, yeah, one a week for three weeks, and then she let about five weeks go by and then she did it again, about three marbles, large marbles worth.

Q: Did she get sick a lot?

A: Well, initially she got some headaches, some migraines, and that will result of course if you've got that bacteria going down, eating all this degenerative tissue, and all this bacteria is starting to make everything work again, and your body becoming rooted with nature again, there is going to be some byproducts that need to be removed, and if it gets high in the blood, in the lymph, you're going to have some reactions, whether it's dermatological, blood pressure for headaches, irritability, whatever it might be, those transitions people will go through. Everybody goes through some kind of detoxification, some side effect of that process. Interestingly enough though, 95% of the time, they're exactly the symptoms that you've already gone through anyway. Let me give you an example, let me finish that conclusion of John Monroe who did the electrical dermal stuff. He concluded that the virus are ways that all life forms can communicate rapidly, because they get in and they can alter RNA and DNA. You know the virus do this, so from one species to another, it's the quickest way to communicate because those virus can go to plant, animal, anybody, and it's like he said it was like a process of symbiosis where everybody can stay in tune with what's happening on a planetary level, ecological level, and that was a nice way to put it, I didn't make my conclusion that grandiose, I'm more focused right on what happens physiologically, but I thought that was a nice evaluation or a nice conclusion from his work of what happens when you destroy virus and the depression that's created, and when you reintroduce the virus, the happiness that's created. So, it's all part of you keeping in connection with everything, because people mainly get depressed because they don't feel connected, and it goes on a cellular, bacterial, viral level.

Now, back in September, I started going through a detox, I started eating a lot more decomposed nerve tissue, you know like rotten brain, rotten spine, before you talk about rotten... That is the worst stench of all. Now the reason I did this is because in my cancer therapies, when I had all of the tumor growing here, they irradiated me back in 1967, there were no holds barred, no 68 when I started to see, there were no holds barred on the intensity and the rads that were utilized in radiation therapy, they completely burned my spine, I could not touch my knees, I couldn't bend over. In 1976 I began eating meat, in 1977 I had my first spinal meningitis, I thought I was going to die, I was coughing, it was like an intensified flu, doubled with triple pneumonia, and I was filling up, in five hours I could fill up an entire bath towel with mucus, this went on for about five days, I went into a coughing jag one night that lasted six hours, I was in a New York like apartment, so I had neighbors up above me and below and on one side, knocking on my door with bottles of antibiotics, trying to help me, and after the six hour jag, they called the paramedics during it, and of course I am coughing like hell and the paramedics are there banging on the door and I am saying go away, go away, I am okay, I just got a terrible flu, go away, so they left me alone, but there were times when it was just like after the radiation therapy and the chemotherapy when I was so crippled that I was crawling on my elbows, my back was in excruciating pain, it took about four and a half, five months to recover from that, I was sore in the back, I was sore everywhere, but when I finished the regeneration from that, I could touch my shins, I went through it again ten years later, I could touch the floor, I could actually put my palms to the floor if I worked at it without bending my knees.

Last September my spine started again in the lower back, one place that had never really gone, the spinal meningitis was part of that, mainly stuck from my waist all way up to my brain. This one started in my lower spine and I noticed it during sex. After half an hour of the old up and down, all of a sudden I started feeling very sore and I could start feeling the pain. I knew something was happening and I thought, oh low grade. So it went on and on and on and on and on and on and on and sometimes it was worse than other times. Then all of a sudden in February, February 28th, 25th, 28th it hit. All of a sudden I started feeling very, very sore and I have a crossbow that is 150 pounds and the prod on it broke so I had to remold and construct one because this is an old wood one that they don't make anymore and I couldn't get a part so I had to do this whole artistic thing and mold it and create this prod to go on it and I went to string it. Well when you string a crossbow it is 150 pounds, it comes out to a 300 pound stretch. So I went down to string this and the muscles right here on my lower back ripped out. I was on the ground instantly in pain. I knew that, I thought about that and I said wait a minute I am going through months and months of lower back trouble. I should know not to exert that. I should have taken it to the bow shop and just had them string it but I didn't. So the detox and repair became extraordinary. I had a black tie event that I had to go to 24 hours later. So I had hot water bottles that I put on the area just to get circulation in there and I took a pain formula. Pain formula works 95% of the time. From last year I even got it up higher.

Pain formula is 2 raw eggs, 4 ounces of cream, if you can't get a regular cow's cream then use coconut cream, 5 level tablespoons of fresh soft bee pollen, refrigerated. If it is not refrigerated, it is dry, dehydrated and it won't work as well or it is kiln dried and it won't work at all. The juice of one tablespoon to one and a half tablespoons depending upon your particular individual need. I suggest you use your intuition to decide that. Either lemon or lime juice. You blend that for about 50 seconds. What I prefer doing is blending it in a 12 ounce jelly jar. If you get an oster or an osterizer blender, you know the bowl, the canister where you blend everything in, you unscrew the base of that, take the blades and the washer off, put that away forever. Unless you are going to have a party and share your smoothies with everybody. But you take these jars, you can have 4 ounce, 8 ounce, pint, cord jars that these blades will screw right on. It makes it very easy for blending. It keeps the oxygen level down so you are not oxidizing your food as much. So this 12 ounce container holds that particular recipe nicely. Blend that for 50 seconds. Eat it with cheese. Now I have been telling people to drink 5 ounces every few hours as necessary. You know 2 to 5 hours, drink 2 to 3 ounces more and eat a little cheese with it. We have potlucks in LA. Every two months we have a potluck and maybe 40, 50 people come and we share all this. Everybodies recipe for raw meat and it's a great celebration every two months. And then they ask me to speak and I will speak. One woman got up and gave her testimony about the pain formula. But she wanted to address how she took it differently than what I recommended. She was a woman who was 39 years old.

She has had menstrual cramps since the age of 12 that put her in bed 3 days a month. Literally in bed she could not move. The pain is so severe. She woke up that morning with the pain, the cramping. She went to the kitchen, forced herself to up, made the pain formula, drank it all at one time with the amount of cheese that I told her to eat, which was per the whole thing, 1 quarter to 1 third a brick of cheese. Cheddar works a little bit better. If you are a person who gets migraines, it's better to use the other cheeses. It only cuts it down maybe 5% of its value of its therapy. She drank the whole thing at once and ate all of the cheese at once. For the first time in her life, she did not have any cramps for the rest of that time. They went away in 40 minutes, 20 to 40 minutes.Her cramps went away. So it's a great formula. Everybody loves it. Migraines, it even works for migraines. I couldn't get it until I had the cheese and other things involved. It didn't work for migraines before. This now works for migraines. You can add a teaspoon of honey if you like. Only a teaspoon.

Q: What cheese?

A: Cheddar, the raw no salt added cheddar cheese. You can use any of the other raw no salt added cheeses like the Munster or the Monterey. But the cheddar for some reason works a little better.

Q: Homemade?

A: Pardon? I've never tried it with homemade. You can do that. Do you have pain at all any time? No? You're not good for my experiment. Okay, you're okay. So the pain formula works when you're going through these heavy detoxes. So I had quite a few of those. Now this is before this girl got up and gave her testimonial. So I always did my five ounces and two to four ounces every few hours. So I had nothing else but some little balls of golf ball sizes of meats in between my pain formula. I went to that black tie affair. I took an Ace bandage and wrapped it around my waist. Now actually I had to get up slowly and move slowly, but nobody really noticed. The next day I was laid up and in bed again for a week and I was crawling around on my elbows just like after all of the medical therapy for cancer. I was in pain, headache, everything and I had to crawl everywhere to make my food to do everything. The pain formula would bring it right down to a point where it was easily tolerated. I just wish I had experimented and drank it all at one time each day instead of spreading it out. And since that time I went into, which was about two months ago, I was still going through it because two months ago is basically we were still in the first few weeks of when I did that. So after I heard her give that testimony, I tried it, I drank it all at one time. For the whole day, for two days, I would go without pain, except for a little stiffness, just a little bit of ache when I got up or sat in a particular position for a while. On April, almost two months to the day, I woke one morning, got out of bed, forgot I had the pain because every morning when I got up it was back again.

This morning, that morning I got up, no pain. It was all over. It's been a week now. I'm able to stretch again. For the first time since before the cancer therapies, I was able to sit on the floor and put my legs out and drop them to the floor. I've not been able to do that for 30 some years. I've still got four and a half, five months to go to heal from that detoxification. But always, you have to understand that on this diet it doesn't stop your detoxifications, which you call illness, sickness, whatever it is. All illness and sickness is trying to get rid of the toxins that are stored in your body, whether it's your own degenerative tissue or pollution that you put into it. If you panic, you'll run off to a doctor, get antibiotics, all this stuff, and then what you do is destroy your bacteria, then you don't enjoy life, other things break down, and then where are you? You're on the road to death, more degeneration. If you don't panic and say, no, I've been doing this for many, many, many years now, on the raw foods and raw meats, the bacteria, high bacteria. When you detox on this diet, you detox properly and you heal properly. You just cannot panic. The people who panic destroy themselves more. I'm going to let this gentleman... 

[audio cut]

Q: ...just to get rid of the bacteria, but it didn't really help me as far as the energy level. I didn't really quite come back out of it. I was always low energy. That led to a point at New Year's where I was always dizzy, couldn't hold urine for more than 15 minutes, very little energy, not clear at all, couldn't even pick up a job. When I decided I wanted to live, I ran into Jill, who turned me on to the book. Within a couple of weeks of doing the raw food, most of my energy was back. Within a month, I could hold my urine all day. To be honest with you, I've never been able to do that in my whole life. It's something we built stronger than it was when I was in high school. I've got muscle all over my body I've never had, cleared, a lot of things. I have a whole new body in four months.

A: Thank you, Michael. Most of the time, the reactions are not that radical. Most people do feel elevated experience once they start the raw meats. However, a lot of people will go into, I would say 20% of people go into a detox right away, panic and leave the diet and never give it a chance. All of those who remain on it always gain. I've got clients who have been on this diet for about 22 years. These people should have been dead ages ago. They're still doing it. They're healthy. One man is in his 60s. He had intestinal problems so badly that he basically was dying. His stomach looked like a pear. He had inflammatory bowel syndrome. He went on the diet, got rid of it. His hair was all gray. He lost most of it. When he went on the diet, after about almost two years on the diet, his hair came back in and red. It stayed that way for 15 years before it went gray again. Still, this man is approaching 70. He's got the body of a teenager. Another case where a fellow had Alzheimer's, 67 years old when he went on the diet. His wife put him on it because he really didn't have the faculty to be able to take care of himself. His wife put him on the diet. He ate the foods, thought nothing of it. He didn't have that faculty to discern. He ate the foods. Everything she put down, he ate. Within about three and a half years, he had the body of a teenager. I've never seen anybody reverse that quickly. I don't know if it's because his mind didn't have all that tension dealing with it or he had the hormones that occur in young people, the human growth hormone, that usually by the time we're 25, we don't have anymore.

Anyway, when he died seven years after being on the diet, he was 67 when he went on it, so he was 75 when he died, somewhere around there. No, but it didn't get worse. His wife never had to hospitalize him, so Ellie was just elated because he was able to stay home with her and he was fit. She never had to put diapers on him or anything. He was on stage four Alzheimer's. Stage one and two, I've seen the diet reverse, but three and four stops it, the progression of it, but does not reverse it. Barley is the only other one that I haven't been able to reverse, but maybe 60% of the time, or the diet. I don't do anything. The food does it. I'm going to take a few minute break just to have something. Do you want to cut that out? Maybe you better hit that gong one more time. Oh, yes? Are you going to hit that gong?

[break]

A: Okay, so through this spinal meningitis, it is again detoxing using bath towels, not as much as that first time. The body will use any avenue it can to secrete these toxins. It will go out the skin, it will be built into the mucus, leave out the mucus, whether it's in the bowels, the urinary tract, the sinuses, the throat. Anywhere the poisons can exude, they will excrete. The vaginal cavity in women, lots of mucus there. Ears can drain. Basically, women have seven bowels and men have six. My theory for women living longer is that extra place to discard and they discard a lot every period, men don't have that luxury. So they contain and hold about 20% more toxins, which accounts for the 20% of longer life in women than in men. Also, it's one in two men that gets cancer and one in three women that gets cancer. More data proving that that theory of mine could be right. So all of these things that you get, the pain, the circulation going, nutrients getting into that area, tissue being deserved, removed, carted out, new cells being regenerated, all of that is just like if you were to gut a house and rebuild it. It's not going to be very utilizable during some of those processes. Like I wasn't able to function at all for days at a time. One time it was for three days that I really could not do anything but be on the phone and help other people. Well, here I am crippled and I'm going to get by. But the process is, that is the process. Detoxification and then regeneration following that. When you're decomposing degenerative tissue in the neurological network, often you'll do them coinciding together symbiotically. You'll regenerate as you detox. Otherwise, your whole body could shut down. 

Now, there were times when I couldn't even move my lower body for one time up to three days, several times one whole day. Maybe four days, individual days, I could not move. I mean, they just didn't work. There was no communication between the brain and the legs and the feet. I felt like if I tried it, I was going like this and plus the pain in my back. I just didn't panic and I knew that this was a detoxification process, regeneration and it took from September to February to April before it concluded. Driving from, I went up to, flew to Sacramento, went up to Mount Shasta for a few days, up to Asheville and drove back down. After sitting for a long time that much driving, I did have a little bit of tightness and pain in my lower back, but nothing like during the detox process. Because I could immediately put myself to the test, I had more flexibility than I've had in over 32 years, 33 years. That is how you identify and you can trust yourself every time you go through a detox. Is you wait until several months after your detoxification to see if there is any improvement in functionality or vitality or basically your general better feeling. You just cannot panic. You panic, you go to some homeopath who will give you a remedy. Remember homeopathy is the early stage of allopathy. They give you something that will cause a reaction that is similar to the symptoms that you are having. Basically it is fighting fire with fire. It is causing a trauma and a toxicity, not a nurturing healing effect just like any drug or medication. So taking antibiotics, anything like that will destroy that process. People who let's say have surgeries like his father, Phil's father just had a bypass, a valve job as he called it. He is a mechanic so he calls it a valve job. He got a valve job. He takes antibiotics now just so he won't reject and won't have a problem with that. But he has depression.

Again you destroy the bacteria, you destroy the virus, you are going to have depression. But who do you know that takes antibiotics on a regular basis that is a happy person? I don't know anyone. Everyone I have ever known during the course of all the while they are taking it and sometimes for very long periods, for years after taking lots of antibiotics get depressed, clinical depression. Again they destroy the bacteria which is part of their life, part of giving them life. So I don't know how many ways I can say it, how many times I can repeat it. Detoxification is necessary, healing is necessary, don't panic. You go through everything that you have ever gone through in your life, you go through it again. But this time when you go through it you will detox properly and you will heal properly. I will give you another example. In my early teens I started having athlete's foot to the point where I was bleeding. The only way I could stop it was to take Listerine and pour it on my feet and let my feet soak in Listerine for hours and then I could go a few days without the intense itching causing my body to just rip my tissue to pieces and bleed and bleed and bleed. Well about a week ago it started, the first time since my teenage years when I got the cancer and all of that, of course everything. I had psoriasis and bursitis so badly that that was just a part of it so I didn't identify it differently. But when I started going red I needed lots of raw fats, all of that subsided and I very rarely had a problem except some places where I had impetigo on the face, those eruptions would come up again and go away. Well this week I started with the athlete's foot, on this foot.

Now I think it was this foot reacting that way not just because I had athlete's foot and poisoned it with Listerine, the great antiseptic, but because in 1980 I was bicycling in the desert on a street that had moss on it and I went around the bend and the tires went out from under and this whole foot from here down got caught on the curb and it ripped the toes out one by one. So it split the toes between the second and third toe it split about a half inch, the next one about an inch, and the little one split all the way about two and a half inches to the bone. It broke seven bones in my toes. Now I looked at that and it's a mess and I'm in excruciating pain. Luckily the people I was staying with had a fourteen year old girl, a fourteen and a half year old girl, who loved going around cracking everybody's knuckles, going around. So she got up and I had her put my toes back in place. So it took me about an hour to persuade her, literally it took an hour to persuade her to do it. And I said, listen I'm in pain, will you help me please, please, please. So she did it and she got the core there and she got five actually back into place, bones set right and everything. And there were two down here that I didn't know that were broken way down there until the next morning. I woke up in excruciating pain, touched around there and of course they were out of place. So I had to get her up again and then have her do it very, very hard. So I packed it with mud, in fact right after she did that I packed it with mud and I hiked three miles. The next day after she set those other two bones, I packed it with clay again and went bicycling twelve miles. I knew that if I sat around I was going to focus on the pain. 

I knew that if I got that foot moving, the circulation would get in there better and all the electromagnetic energy from exercise would make it work quicker. So I got over all of the pain literally in about a week. It still took about ten weeks to heal it. But because I packed all kinds of mud in there and everything, I'm sure that part of that and the fungus that remained in that foot from when I was a young child is coming out now, out of that toe. But it's a process, you know. It's a process that everybody will go through getting rid, detoxing, the things that the body already tried to detox before but didn't have the proper nutrients to do it. Just don't panic and don't get discouraged because a lot of people will get discouraged. It's not working, I'm getting sicker, I'm getting ill, you know, I can't move, I'm crippled. It's just a process. You'll get through it. When you get through it, you'll be better. You just have to be patient to get to that point where you're better. In 100% of the cases, I'm not exaggerating, 100% of the cases it's always been true. Whether I've had cancer, since I wrote the book, I started working with people who had medical therapies. Otherwise, I stayed away from them because then how can you tell whether the medical therapy or the diet is working? So as I said in the book, 98% of the people who didn't have any therapies with cancer reversed their cancers. Now that I've been working with people who've had therapies, you know, it takes about seven years before you know. Twelve years before you absolutely know according to Hardin B. Jones' work, who is a professor of medical physics and physiology at Berkley, from the 30s all the way through the 60s and 70s. About 60% of them look like they're reversing their cancers. But I really won't know for another two years, four years, seven years. It doesn't look as good at all.

People get better than they were. They start surviving. All of their nutrient counts go up. Their blood normalizes and the doctors are thrilled and all of this. But they've been so damaged with chemo and radiation and surgeries that their bodies just cannot recover. And I noticed that when people have these therapies, especially radiation, it destroys virus and bacteria. It's meant to stop regeneration of anything. Virus, bacteria, parasites, anything. I ate pin worm infested salmon, fluke worm infested brain, tripe. I've eaten a lot of parasites trying to get them to work in my body when I did those tests with the animals that showed that they healed, took longer, but they healed best and got to be like kittens and puppies again even though they were very old animals once they got through their parasites. So I tried to introduce parasites into myself because that was the quickest way, but they wouldn't take. The only thing I could theorize was that the chemotherapy still stored in my body and the radiation therapy has created such a condition where the parasites can't thrive. I can use virus and bacteria, so I rot the meats and that works, but the parasites I just can't work with. There's a Dr. Weinstock that just released his information this year at the University of Iowa that took a flip worm from pigs, that's a worm that lives in the gut of a pig, and gave it to these people with inflammatory bowel disease. What he did was gave them liquid solution with, and it was just sugar water, with the eggs of the flip worm. He had them drink it, now what he set out to do was to prove that the flip worm would not be harmful to these people even though they had inflammatory bowel disease. What happened was that these people got well from eating these parasites, parasite eggs, and they were back four to five months later, can we have some more of those? He wasn't expecting that at all.

Q: Were they on a raw food diet, or?

A: No, no, regular diet. You can take, there's an African medical doctor who uses maggots to get rid of gangrene. This one woman, National Geographic shot it and put it on TV, on a news broadcasting network. You could see her whole arm was amputated, it was a mess. He took maggots, very young maggots, and he laid a layer of them all over that, wrapped it with gauze, about five layers, and then you could see that some of the maggots were hatching. He unwrapped it and the tissue was all clean and new. No scarring. Australia has just made honey a medicine. So the doctors can prescribe honey as a medication for burns because it reduces scarring by 80%, increases healing two to three times.

Q: Topically?

A: Yup. There are a few open minds out there in the medical profession but there are not many. Someone asked me about eating a lot of honey. I've only found a few people, like maybe two out of about 200, an average of two out of 200 people. So one out of a hundred people still has an allergy to completely unheated honey and it's a temporary thing. Usually it takes them three months to get to the point where they're not allergic to it. There's no anaphylaxis. I've never seen anybody have anaphylaxis from it, child or otherwise, from a completely unheated honey. But when the bee goes around collecting the nectar it swallows it. In its stomach it produces an insulin-like substance that converts that carbohydrate into enzymes, not just protein catalysts as I thought before, but actual enzymes, active enzymes. And those enzymes are utilized for protein utilization and assimilation and even digestion, 90% of it. So only 10% is left as a sugar. About one out of a hundred cannot utilize that insulin-like substance. It neutralizes it so then it refers all that back into a sugar. Even though it's not a radical sugar and will cause damage, they still can't handle a high level of sugar just like they can't handle a high level of food even if it's raw because the pancreas doesn't produce insulin properly or an insulin that can utilize the sugar properly. Because some people's pancreases are fine. They're utilizing, I mean they're manufacturing insulin but still they have hypoglycemia or diabetic effect because the insulin that they're producing is not workable. It's not able to be utilized properly. I would say 90% of all the diabetics that I've seen were not even diabetics. The pancreases were completely working.

It just may have been that day, that test that they had, it showed a high level of blood sugar and the doctor said, you're diabetic, take insulin. Nine out of ten had never been diabetic in the first place, taking it 25, 30 years. Put them on a good diet, take them off the insulin, they're functioning normally, easily. It's a big racket. Drug industry loves it, the CEOs love it, the salesmen love it. I'm going to start taking questions now. Yes?

Q: I have reactions too when I have honey. It may disappear over time or maybe not.

A: What are your reactions?

Q: Well, I have the brightness bothers me and I have muscle pain all over my body.

A: All over your body?

Q: Mostly actually the shoulder, the neck, the back, I'm sore, my muscles are so sore. What else do I have? Blurry vision, sensitivity to bright light, I have tinnitus.

A: Your symptoms are not allergy, they are detoxification of AGEs. They store at a rate of 70 to 90 percent, her body is loaded with them. Honey helps her clean those out. And just like when you're exercising and you've got a lot of lactic acid built up, the next day you're sore all over, the honey is pulling out the advanced glycation end products and making them fluid and they cause the muscles to be sore. And sometimes tendons.

Q: You know, with my vision it's really an impairment because I can't see...

A: That means that you're, in every situation where I've advised eating lots of protein when that happens, usually within an hour the vision is restored. So it means you need protein immediately and not eggs. You can put egg white in your eyes and that will help. But actually eating meat and beef, when you have blurry vision, for some reason, not everything is logical. Not everything is linear. You figure that the eye is mainly neurological tissue and should go along with all the other reactions that I've had utilizing fish and fowl to regenerate neurological tissue faster than you can regenerate neurological tissue by eating lamb or beef or venison, any of those. However, when it comes to the vision of the eye, when you start getting blurred vision, it's a low red meat substance that clears it. So if you start getting blurred vision, you know you need to eat red meat real soon, right away.

Q: Do you get reports from people on the diet, reports of improved vision in general on your diet?

A: Yes, the most radical is one, there's a doctor in Santa Fe, New Mexico who is a psychologist and works for the government. She's an expert witness. She has had asthma all of her life and the whites of her eyes were always bright red so it looked like she was always stoned. So here is a doctor up on the witness stand looking like she's stoned on dope and how credible is that? So she had gone on the diet and went from using an inhaler every day, you know anywhere she said up to 30 times a day using an inhaler and on Pregnizone all the time, to using Pregnizone only about four or five times a year, one day, and her inhaler four or five times a year. Did I say that right? Pregnizone four or five times a year for one day and the inhaler for that much as well for a whole year. And she had Coke bottle thick glasses and after about a year and three to nine months on the diet she called me panicky. I can't see anymore. I can't see. This diet is ruining my eyes. I said well you're 53, 54 years old. You've been on a cooked diet for up until a year and a half ago approximately and it takes 30 years to regenerate everything so the diet is not going to be able to take care of everything all at once. So that's something that may be taken care of longer, take longer to get to, and also it may get worse before it gets better because your body is very depleted and everything if you've been taking Pregnizone and inhalers all these years. But I said if you want to find out go see the optometrist and see what he has to say or she has to say. So she went to the optometrist, called me when she got home, she said guess what, guess what, my eyes got so much better I had to have the prescription reduced so I could see.

And that's, I have had that reaction only to people who regularly put maybe once a day, once every other day, egg white in their eye. Take like an eye, you know those eye cups like glasses that put like a half a teaspoon in it, hold the eye open like this like it's going to pop out, put the eye piece up in there so that the edges hold the eye open, put your head back, roll it around about five times, drop it back in, remove it, open the eye again and roll it for about a minute. It will get all the egg white rotated and massaged into the eye. It does reverse eye, eye astigmatism, everything. If your eyes are repairing blood shot it will reverse that within about twenty minutes.

Q: Can you do this every day?

A: Yep, you can do it every day, several times a day if you like. I had my publisher's girlfriend's father is a painter. So he's had, he's been around spray paint. Oh my god, so you can see his eyes all the time were bright red. So about a month ago, publisher called me and he said, what can he do? He's not going to eat a raw diet, he's from El Salvador, you know, so old school. I said, well, don't say that he won't, just give him this to do, put the egg white, have him put egg white in his eyes two or three times a day. Within a week he was eating raw meat because that worked so well. They'd given him drops, they'd done everything, they said he was going to lose his eyes. And I just saw him for the first time the day I left and his eyes were just as white, as white, I mean he had a little redness over on this side of one eye and that was it. And he was putting the egg white in his eye three times a day.

Q: Is that good for inflammation as well? 

A: Inflammation in the eyes?

Q: Yeah, conjunctivitis. 

A: Yeah, conjunctivitis, pink eye, whatever you want to call it. Yes?

Q: I have a couple of questions. I've been sick for quite a while.

A: Congratulations.

Q: I've tried, I was diagnosed with a parasite, a certain kind of parasite from Mexico.

A: Are you getting these questions?

Q: And I was using herbs and using this, that, and the other and I finally got so debilitated I decided to use an antibiotic, which I've never done before, which I'm on right now. But my experience with the parasite, my symptoms from the parasite are much better and I'm feeling stronger and my experience is that, I know what you're saying is what you're saying, my experience was that I probably would have, it's not a successful parasite that kills its host, but I think this parasite and I were not getting along.

A: Were you eating raw diet?

Q: I wasn't eating, no, not on this diet, but I've always eaten, I've never eaten raw meat, but I eat a lot of raw stuff just because, and juice and stuff, just because that's how I eat.

A: Yeah, but that won't do it. You got to have raw fats and raw meat to deal with degenerative tissue, because that's what they feed on. They feed on degenerative cells and the only way you can replace and protect cells is with raw fats and raw meat. So the antibiotic will work for you because it will destroy those that are feeding on you if you're not supplying the nutrients. People who have problems with parasites are people who do not eat meats or proteins that will rebuild and regenerate their cells, otherwise they'll ulcerate and have problems. So you probably had ulcerations all throughout your system where the parasites were eating and whatever you were eating was not regenerating the tissue well enough to keep up with the rapidity at which the parasites work, eat away at that tissue.

Q: So you have no concern when you buy commercial or buy beef or fish or whatever with the parasites that could be in that meat?

A: Not at all.

Q: Really don't?

A: Not at all.

Q: What about someone debilitated, would you be concerned with them?

A: Them, I give more rotten food to them than I do to anybody else. Yeah.

Q: Let me ask you another question. Since I've spoken to Jill, I've been making clabbered from all goat's milk and putting eggs in, and I can't handle the eggs. I don't know why. I just, I don't digest them well. And I like the idea of it. It's not that I'm resistant to it. Do you have people with that problem?

A: Yeah. Some people can't handle eggs right away and at times. Well, it's not the egg white. It's actually the combination of the egg white and the yolk that causes intense detoxifications. And if you just had, you know, if you've gone through a series of antibiotics, your digestion...

Q: No, not even before that.

A: You tried the eggs?

Q: Yeah. I just can't.

A: You were taking the herbal dewormers.

Q: Not at that point. They're not worms. They're not the big guys. The big guys I think are easier to deal with. They're the microscopic one-celled guys.

A: Yeah, still flukes. Yeah. 

Q: They're not flukes. They're not flukes.

Q: They're protozoans.

Q: Yeah, and they actually get into the cells, into the walls of the intestines and cause diarrhea. And that's the main thing. That's the pain, diarrhea and gas. They're not good.

A: Yeah, they are. But yours weren't because you were not eating a diet that allowed them to do their job properly and you were not able to regenerate and protect yourself from the byproducts. The byproducts caused the diarrhea and some people bleeding.

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay. When people eat properly, eat lots of raw fats, especially meats, the fats in meats, and dairy fats, they don't have that problem. Some people have a problem if they have a digestibility problem. If they have intestinal problems, do not handle eggs well for a while. One time I saw it take two and a half years before the person could eat eggs.

Q: So then you don't suggest they try eggs?

A: No, I tell them to stay away from eggs, but maybe, you know, a couple of weeks. That's all.

Q: Do you worry at all about, you probably think it's nuts, but you know, they say that biotin is bound by egg white.

A: Yeah. There's a, the spell check in my, when my book was done, and I talk about that in my book, it substituted the avidin for albumin.

Q: Uh huh.

A: So when you see albumin when I talk about the biotin and the albumin, that's supposed to be avidin. That happens in a test tube, but not in the human body, not in an animal's body. And when they check the feces and find a high rate of avidin and biotin together, it's always in the accompaniment of biocarbons.

Q: Which is the starches.

A: No, biocarbons are when we use something to utilize it as fuel and there's a carbon left over. Okay. Those biocarbons, no matter what it is we use to burn, whether it's carbohydrate or fat or proteins in the form of pyruvate, there's a carbon left over. Okay. Always those carbons, no matter what they are, are attached to that avidin and biotin mixture. So what they have done is they've pulled out toxins. You'll have less of those carbons if you eat raw foods. You won't have an overabundance of them. But when you eat cooked foods, you've got a high rate of them. Because again, you go into an advanced glycation end product that's very similar to the carbon and then you'll find it bound in that binding process of the avidin and biotin. But it doesn't stop it from working. It means there'll be less biotin for the brain activity, yes. But there's no ill symptom from it as the conclusion was formed. It was a very ill-formed conclusion.

Q: Well, it's pervasive in the literature.

A: Oh yes, definitely.

Q: So one last question, and I know it's hard for you to assess where I'm at since I'm not doing the full diet, but I have been eating mostly proteins and vegetables. And I find...

A: Together?

Q: Well, I mean in my diet.

A: But are you eating them together at all? Are you eating vegetables with meat and vegetable juices with meat?

Q: I'm not eating meat at all. I'm eating eggs and dairy mostly.

A: You should not drink vegetable juice with any kind of protein. Vegetable juice should be had alone or with fat only, like raw cream or coconut cream. If you combine vegetable juice with milk, where there's protein in it, with any kind of meat, no matter whether it's seafood, fowl, red meat, you're going to have an acid and an alkaline in the stomach at the same time and they're going to neutralize each other and neither are going to digest. The only time that I recommend that they're eaten together is like eggs and milk and vinegar and cream is when somebody gets really backed up, stopped up. None of that digests together so it'll just wash right through.

Q: So you don't even combine eggs and milk?

A: Yeah, eggs and milk, they're both acids. They're both proteins.

Q: So, what I was getting to was, that it seems like, but I'm not sure, because I have such trouble with energy anyway, that I needed some kind of carbohydrate for energy that I wasn't...

A: No, you'd be lacking the protein. See, the main fuel that's the healthiest fuel and that is utilized with the least amount of byproduct is 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate. 

Q: Carbohydrate in vegetables?

A: No, well it could be from vegetables but that doesn't digest well as carbohydrate. It could be fruit, it could be the 10% of the honey that you eat, carrot juices.

Q: You don't use starches at all?

A: No. I recommend starches for people like fighters who beat their girlfriends up, their wives up. I'd rather it damage them than they damage the other people because that cooked starch will arrest those excess hormones that cause them to be so violent. And that's the only time I recommend it. Like in the book when you read that I ate the cooked starch when I found out my son was on his deathbed. You know, I couldn't sleep, I couldn't think properly or anything so for the first time in 13 years I ate a half of a baked potato with a whole stick of butter, raw unsalted butter so those advanced glycation end products wouldn't end up in my tissues. But after that I went for nuts and a nut mixture to take care of that carbohydrate. Nuts in the human body will be mainly starch.

Q: Isn't that good because I eat a lot of nuts?

A: It isn't good unless you mix it in proper form because in any nuts and seeds and sprouts you have enzyme inactivators, protein inhibitors, enzyme and protein inhibitors. So you eat a lot of them, you get still hungry and you're more hungry and more hungry and you can't get satisfied. Even if you take nuts, let's say you take a half a cup, better nuts are the softer ones like pine nuts, walnuts, pecans. Take a half a cup, blend them into a powder. Add three ounces of either raw cream, you can have up to four ounces, but if you're using the spectrum natural peanut oil which is pressed below 92 degrees, use three ounces of that. One of these fats, coconut cream, peanut oil, regular cream, butter, so if you wanted to use eight tablespoons of butter that's fine. Two tablespoons of honey, unheated honey and blend that together.Now the combination of those oils and with the honey will neutralize those enzyme and protein inhibitors. If you eat the nuts by themselves or just with honey you will bloat and you'll stop digestion of certain things and you'll inhibit the activity of the pancreas, which has to supply the enzymes that are missing or the pancreas has to take the enzymes that are in food, rework them, which is normal, into enzymes which are utilized in the human body and send them back into the stomach and liver. That's a normal process. If you're eating cooked foods, the pancreas has to send out hormones to pull out, leach from your body, enzymes, vitamins, minerals, that's part of your natural constituency and that's robbing from Peter to pay Paul.

[audio cut]

A: We've got a lot of people here so I'm going to get started. Is there anybody who has to leave early? Because this will be about ten minutes per person, maybe only five but depending. So you have to go early? You have to? Who else? Does anybody have to leave early? Let's say you have about an hour and a half, two hours? So just one gentleman. Let's start with you. What is your name?

Q: Doug.

A: Come on up Doug. Come on up, the price is right. I'm going to have to open this up a little bit because of the glum day. I have to look over here.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: When we have to resort to that we will. Face this way. There we go. Okay Doug, you have very overactive sex glands so if you don't have a partner take care of yourself because they can make you irritable. Very heavy and overactive adrenal glands. Pancreas is overactive too but it's debilitating. It's probably about 40% active. Lots of swelling. In the pancreas. It's mainly edema, not much fat in it. The left thyroid gland is okay. The parathyroids are overactive. The lymph glands in the throat are pretty good. Did you have your tonsils removed?

Q: Uh-huh.

A: It looks like you may have grown the left one back a little bit. 

Q: Tonsils and adenoids.

A: Yeah. It looks like a little bit has grown back over here. Here it's completely flat. Parathyroids are overactive on the right side too. The parathyroids are low. Red blood cell count is good. You're not utilizing fats properly. So you've got a lot of clogging in the liver, in the kidneys, in the small intestine, a little bit in the spine, in the center. It looks like you're starting to, the adrenaline is starting to store at a rapid rate and drying out tissue. It looks like you're on the road to eczema or psoriasis. You need to eat lots of fats. About 50-55% red meat, meaning beef, lamb, buffalo venison. When I talk about red meat, I'm talking about that variety, not like salmon or tuna. That's seafood. That's white meat. And then the other, you need about 10% fish, seafood, and 25-30% fowl. That will help your skin and lymph system get back together. You're just not utilizing fats very well anymore. Do you exercise?

Q: Not a lot.

A: Because with these overactive adrenals and those overactive testes, there's a lot of hormones that will make you, if you don't do it, you're going to be irritable.

Q: So I should exercise.

A: Yeah, unless you want to take it out on other people. You can be irritable. You have very good regenerative abilities once you start eating lots of raw meat and raw fats. You'll go fast. I suggest you eat about 8-10 eggs a day. And I would have maybe 4-6 of them Rocky style. Just down them without whipping them up. They'll be easier to eat. You'll be able to eat more of them that way. The others you can have with milk. If you can get the milk. Because you have these skin conditions, a lot of people, if you listen to these, you'll get a lot of information out of it. Because you have some skin conditions, I suggest that you do not have eggs and fruit together. Because it will be made into a solvent. You're all ready too dry right now. I want to lubricate your system before you go making solvents. Your body will make what it needs to, when it needs to. But if you mix fruit with eggs, it's going to be made into a solvent.

Q: Can you see if it's toxic? I've had that feeling.

A: Well you've got lots of toxins, but most of the toxins are fat bound. But you have no fat left to lubricate your system. It's already bound in toxins. So you need to go on a detox program. And I'm going to take a few minutes right after I finish him to give everybody some basic detox regimes so that you can detox easier. One fruit I recommend you have to break up some of that fat and eliminate it. It's a little pineapple once in a while. If you're going to eat fruit, no more than one piece a day with some kind of fat. Coconut, coconut cream, raw cream, milk, cheese, something like that. Okay?

Q: Good.

A: Do you have any questions?

Q: The only thing I didn't know is the parathyroid, everything else you've nailed right on.

A: Okay. What I like people to do as part of the detox process, I like them to get fat. Gain weight. Gain anywhere from twelve pounds minimum overweight to thirty pounds minimum, I mean thirty pounds overweight. Twelve to thirty pounds over what you should weigh. Now the reason for that is those fats, like I said, your body will use them as solvents and for binding with toxicity. So as those toxins that are stored deeply in you are pulled out with the solvents, the fats can bind with them again and then it's like old oil in a car. You put the new oil in, it takes the carbons, the shavings, it gets thick and black and you need to change the oil. You cannot remove old deep storages without this process. I tried for years, about eleven or twelve years, and the only way people can do it is by gaining that much weight. Now there's some people that will do it in a three month cycle, three months gaining, three months losing. One girl does it in a six week cycle, gains it in six weeks, about fifteen pounds, and loses it in six weeks, six to eight weeks. Her body is cleaned faster than I've ever seen anybody. Her eyes went from dark brown to green in a matter of two and a half years. I've never seen anybody go from dark brown to that much clearer of a color in only two and a half years. She's diligent about it.

Q: Excuse me, what if you're already all the way?

A: Well, what I usually suggest for that is you just eat the raw foods to stabilize yourself for about eight to ten weeks and then you go take it off. And then once you take it off, then you start putting it back on.

Q: So first you lose those weights, then you do that?

A: No, first you just stay where you are for about eight to ten weeks and then you take it off. Now, to put it on, milk and eggs together, lots of eggs, eggs and meat together, fat with everything. That will help you put it on. It helps stabilize your system, relax your nervous system, stabilize your nervous system, your brain, function, everything. Now, when you detox, there are several methods. But basically what you do is one day you'll drink a cup of vegetable juice. When you're very hungry, one egg. When you're very hungry, another cup of vegetable juice. When you're very hungry, another egg. So what you're doing is egg, juice, egg, juice, egg, juice, egg, juice, egg, juice, until you go to sleep. But you always wait until you're very hungry. The next day, you have the same thing, only instead of egg, you have an egg-sized amount of meat. You can have the meat with the sauce if you want, like a salsa, which doesn't have fat in it. You blend tomato and onion, maybe a quarter of a teaspoon of lemon juice in that. So that way it's juice, meat, juice, meat, juice, meat, juice, meat, all day long. But you always wait until you're very hungry. Don't wait until you're so hungry that your brain stops working, because that can happen. And don't wait until you're so hungry that you're shaking. Just wait until you're very hungry in the stomach, not in body. Sometimes you can not be hungry in the stomach and be too hungry in body. Don't wait to be hungry in stomach then, if you start shaking. That means you're getting dangerously low in protein. Dangerously low means that if you stand too quickly you could pass out and hurt yourself. For some people, I will tell them to have two days of meat in a row. One day of juice, two days of meat. I mean one day of egg, two days meat, one day of egg. If somebody is very thin, I will tell them to do the opposite. Two days egg, one day meat, two days egg, one day meat. Sometimes if you're very overweight, I'll say go three days meat, one day egg, three days meat. 

Q: For how long?

A: You do this six to eight weeks, however long it takes you to take off the weight.

Q: If you're taking weight off?

A: Yeah, if you're on that, this is the detox program.

Q: This is for heavy persons?

A: No, this is, everybody is supposed to gain the weight, and this is how to take it off. So when you get up to, you know, twelve to thirty pounds overweight, then it's time to take it off.

Q: So what about people that cannot gain weight right now?

A: Because?

Q: Well, I don't know. I tried, but...

A: Well, you were combining a few bad things, which may prevent you from doing it. You've discovered today you've combined a few. You don't remember?

Q: No. What was it?

A: Lemon? Yeah, you were having lemon with a nut, lime.

Q: That's somebody with the anger remedy. I don't do that very often.

A: It's the anger remedy. Yes, that is good. That nut thing is good for an anger remedy. But do not put lemon or lime juice in it, because that will completely stop the digestion of the nuts, and then you'll have all these undigested proteins floating in your blood, and that will cause allergies. 

Q: This put-on-weight-take-off-weight, basically it doesn't, two to six, however many weeks it takes you to get to a weight that you feel put-on-weight, and then you change that, and you take off that. And whether it's two weeks or two years, you go to the cycle again to a low point, and just keep taking it from a high point to a low point?

A: Yeah, I've been doing it for 20 years, 17 years. I've only been eating a diet of meat on a daily basis for 17 years. My six and a half years of raw food fruitarianism, veganism, I don't even count, because there was no protein to build my system. I give it three, maybe three years, if also I take the years from 76 when I started eating meat, to 82 when I started eating meat on a daily basis. There's about five years there. That's about six years. I still only count three years with all of that 10-year period, because I was not eating meat every day. So, I'm basically only halfway, 20 years in, to being toward my optimum. I'm halfway. I'm already satisfied. I mean, if I stopped right here, it'd be okay. But I know that I still have a lot to go. In my irises, I can see the scar tissue that still remains with my spine, all my abdominal area, and in my brain. 65% of my brain is scar tissue. That's why I'm such an idiot. We only use 5% of our brains for neurological thought processes. The rest is a garbage dump. Man is the only one who cooks his food, and man is the only one who has a big brain, that mainly, in everybody's eyes, comes out to be at least 60% toxic. I met a girl, a new client, about two weeks ago, that only had 40% toxic. I was amazed. But most brains are just toxic dump sites, and probably that's why the brain got so big, because man's been cooking a long time. In fact, there was a scientist that came up and 300,000 years ago, no, two million years ago, the man's brain was this size, and basically, they also found that he cooked some of his food. That may have been the start of it. Who knows? That's just theory. Okay, so, you know, to put it on, to take it off, put it on, and take it off. That's a process. It'll help you get through your stuff easier. You'll have less flus and colds, and if you have them, they will be less virulent.

Q: What foods keep somebody from gaining weight?

A: Pineapple. This man eats a whole pineapple a day. Usually when I have other clients that are as thin as he is doing that, they become so emotional and so irritable, they are unbearable. Unbearable. So, I usually say stay off of it when you're that thin, have pineapple, you know, just once in a while. I suggest that most people do not eat much fruit at all. I only eat fruit maybe once every three to four days, sometimes five days, and a lot of times I'll go for tomato, something that doesn't have a lot of carbohydrate in it. Remember that fruit will make you emotional. If you have, are very weepy and feeling sorry for yourself, stay off of fruit. Stay away from it like the plague for about five days and you'll come out of it. If you want to speed it up, rot some meat and eat that in place of your fruit, and you'll be out of your depression quickly.

Q: Can I eat too many eggs?

A: For you, no. Some people yes. It's all individual, but for you I would say there's no way you could eat too much of anything, especially if you're eating, you know, a pineapple a day.

Q: I could eat two.

A: And you'd also eat tons more food too. Remember that fruit is only five percent, needs to be five percent of your diet at most. The body utilizes fat, mainly fat for everything. It's a solvent to stabilize your body and to give you energy. Eighty percent is fat. Fifteen percent protein. Five percent carbohydrates. The carbohydrate doesn't have to come in the form of fruit. Say I eat one piece of fruit every four or five days, that'll total up five percent of my need. I need to stay away from it because I was diabetic and my pancreas really hasn't healed much, but maybe ten percent. So I don't handle fruit well.

Q: Does the brain run on glucose?

A: Pardon?

Q: I just, you know, heard that the brain only utilizes glucose for energy.

A: Yeah, but your body can make glucose from proteins even, pyruvate.

Q: Isn't it the harder way to do this?

A: Most of your animals in nature, you know, don't eat much fruit, except for the bat and some of the monkeys, but those monkeys are hyperactive and crazy. And the National Geographic showed John Goodall, who was, Jane Goodall was the daughter of John Goodall, and he did a film called The Beginning, a documentary, a full-length documentary in 1970, I think it was, or 71, it was nominated for an Academy Award and won it. And he showed that if you took monkeys and apes and in their natural environment, they never ate ripe fruit, never, ever, ever. They always ate it green where there was hardly any fruit in it, I mean hardly any sugar in it. Green bananas, green figs, everything was green that they ate. When they took ripe bananas, and they took three bunches of them and threw them in the midst of these apes. Now the apes normally would go up and pull a banana off and that's it. But they were throwing out these bananas and the apes started eating them ripe, and they'd never done that before. Started eating them ripe, within a half hour they were all fighting over them and they couldn't stop eating them. And they were fighting each other, they were screaming, they were hitting, and they weren't like that before. So, fruit you should be careful with. It's not the great carbohydrate to use. You have the nuts, you have, you know, you have carbohydrate in everything, even in meat there's carbohydrate.

Q: Can you talk a little about berries?

A: Berries are used for detoxification of toxic minerals in the system. And also to get rid of mutant antibodies from vaccines or antibiotics. If you'll take berries and then you take the juice and put it on metal, you'll see it turn black and the metal come right up and off of that container. If you have one of those canning jars with a lid and you get berry juice on it with the pulp on it, it will just turn black and come up off. And you ruin the lining of that lid, throw it away, get another. That's what happens in the body. I use them to help pull out lots of toxic minerals. The most toxic alternative therapy I've ever seen in my life is chelation therapy. And people take colloidal silver and colloidal minerals. It poisons the system. They say it pulls out toxic minerals like lead, mercury and stuff like that. It may pull it out, but it's also those things are full of metals already. That's what they are. And in a solution that's very fine. So what happens, it lodges in both the bones and the lymph. I've seen people turn their systems completely toxic from one bottle of colloidal silver and cause chronic fatigue for up to seven years to get rid of it. So anybody you hear say colloidal silver, colloidal minerals, chelation therapy, I hope the hair on your back bristles up and tell them not to.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It can't be utilized. It's impossible. If you go out and feed it to one of these trees or plants, a plant is geared up to take those inorganic minerals and to make them organic. And then an animal eats the plant, and then certain animals eat the animals to get those nutrients. But we are not plants. We cannot utilize those minerals. They are toxic to us, poisonous to us. Same thing with supplements. The mineral supplements are usually bound in some kind of a starch or some binder in a capsule or a pill. So usually they don't even get absorbed. You're just paying a lot of money for placebo basically. All supplements are only 2-12% utilizable. 2-12% means you're spending a lot of money for nothing. The rest, the 82-98% that is toxic is toxic, non-digestible, and it will cause toxicity and your body has to remove it. It has to use good nutrients to get rid of it. So supplements may be helpful to people who predominantly cook foods. Let's say 80% cooked foods. Supplements might be helpful for them in some circumstances. But mostly they are toxic. If you are eating any more raw foods than that, they will be more toxic than non. Unless you are deficient in one particular substance that is the straw that breaks the camel's back and causes your problem. Then that one particular substance that you may get that is only 2-12% utilizable may be just enough for you to come out of it. But that's not the way to do it permanently, because there will be side effects. 

Q: [unintelligible] The mineral sulfur is good to detoxify bones.

A: If you want to have, well I did experiments with that over a long period. It's not new, it's just now marketed well. Sulfur drugs cause all kinds of skin lesions, burns.

Q: I wasn't thinking about drugs so much. Maybe sulfur food...

A: Well sulfur food is eggs. Eggs and milk are very high in sulfur.

Q: MSM is good?

A: All those things are poisonous. You've heard about the people who spontaneously combust? Has anybody heard about those people? Everyone that I interviewed took sulfur drugs for kidney problems or bladder problems. When that mixes with certain people, that sulfur mixes with body chemicals and when it comes out through the skin and hits the oxygen it causes spontaneous eruptions. People constantly have burns all the time. All of a sudden something will look like they've been burned. That's a sulfur drug coming out through the skin, causing a toxic reaction. The one woman that I interviewed where two-thirds of her body, she was in a trailer, sitting down drinking coffee and her body went up in flames. Two-thirds of her body was burned. She took sulfur drugs for 22 years. And in her burned tissue, guess what was high in there? Burned sulfur. Gee, now why doesn't the medical profession come out with that information? Why didn't the news cover it? This woman's body, her skin had high sulfur in it because she took high sulfur drugs. They don't tell you that. Any of these supplements that you take when they're inorganic and not in a food form are not going to be utilized properly and they're going to cake in your system like plaster. And if your body tries to pull it out with a solvent, which has maybe the turpentine reaction after that, then you're coming up with some dangerous chemical reactions. And if it's exposed to the oxygen when it comes through the skin or out the nasal passages or causing skin cancer, there are all kinds of side effects from it. This is all about marketing. Did you notice that the medical profession and the pharmaceutical community have adopted all these vitamins and supplements now? Because there are more drugs they can sell. That's why they got into it. 20 years ago, they were fighting them because they didn't have a market on them. They weren't selling them. Now that they're selling them, they want you to buy them. Okay, let's take the next person. Should we just go around the line or do you want to go first?

Q: She has to leave first.

A: Okay.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You have to be last now. What's your name? 

Q: Marcy.

A: You have very overactive sex glands. Your adrenal glands are normal. Your pancreas almost looks non-existent so it looks like you have a diabetic nature. It doesn't look like you produce much insulin at all. Thyroid is in very good condition. Parathyroids are overactive. It looks like you had a tonsillectomy.

Q: I did.

A: The lymph glands in your throat on the right side are very congested throughout the entire neck area and even in the chest area a little bit, especially on the left side. Poor circulation everywhere. Your red blood cells don't transport oxygen very well. You need about 60-65% red meat and about 35-40% white meat and of that I would say 10% or a little bit higher should be seafood. I would vary it. Sometimes I eat more fish and less fowl. You have indications of very low self-esteem so you need to be very creative. I don't know if you've healed from that or not.

Q: I am trying to get my creativity back. That's one of my big issues. I've been low energy and I haven't been painting.

A: It could be writing. It could be anything. While you're in this fatigue you still need to be creative because your self-esteem is based in there. Writing, whether it's poetry, music or prose, whatever it is, will help you there. You have a lot of bruising. Were you a big salt eater?

Q: Not particularly, no. When you bang you have a bruise. Yeah, I do that.

A: Not high in adrenaline and not much salt. Did you still use salt a little bit? Because you just could be allergic to it.

Q: Hardly ever. I didn't use any extra salt.

A: What kind of paint do you use?

Q: When I am painting, oil paint.

A: It could be mineral toxicity from that. The cadmium in the yellow, the cobalt in the blue. What I recommend that you do is put olive oil on your hands and all the way up to your wrists so it doesn't absorb into your hands because it looks like actually a poisoning. Salt can do that. It's causing bruised tissue all over. It's causing a degeneration of the blood veins. 

Q: I've always had a very low immune system since I was a baby. I've got pneumonia and heavy flus that go for months, things like that. Whether that plays into this bruising business or not.

A: Well, you could have gotten some kind of medication at a very young age which would cause some damage.

Q: Tons of antibiotics, too.

A: I'm going to recommend that you drink a half a cup of white or green cabbage, whatever you want to call it. Not the red cabbage. The white cabbage. For about half a cup every other day for about six weeks to help stabilize that. It looks like there is hemorrhaging in your blood vessels here and there. Some ulcerations and the vitamin K and the vitamin U in the cabbage will help balance that. Stabilize that. You need to eat lots of white meat. You have very little bacteria in your system. In your torso. You do have the bacteria in your glands. You have molds in your extremities, but none in your torso. You have them in your brain, but it's just in your torso you hardly have any bacteria. I guess that's from taking the antibiotics. Your body protected your limbs from it, but not your torso. Basically, I would only eat fruit when you absolutely feel you have to.

Q: I'm not much of a fruit eater.

A: Like me, maybe once every four to five days and always eat it with some kind of fat.

Q: How about, I have done smoothies since I read your book, fruit juice with egg, blended up.

A: Even in my book I say do not use fruit juice. 

Q: I make my own.

A: Even if you juice it, you're supposed to use a whole fruit if you're blending it with eggs. I suggest that you have milk, honey and eggs together mainly. And keep the fruit down, way down. Otherwise, with this kind of condition you'll get very emotional and very depressed from fruit. Of course, if you go five, six days without it then you might get depressed for the same reason, that you're not burning your fat. Do you exercise?

Q: Occasionally. I'm trying to do more.

A: Well, I suggest that you mainly walk. Do a little walking every day, at least five days a week. That'll help. Your circulation is really damaged from the lack of bacteria. Then your bronchioles and your lungs, it looks like you have some scar tissue there, pretty heavy scarring in your lungs. Were you a smoker?

Q: I had been for a while and I almost died of pneumonia when I was diagnosed.

A: A deterrent to smoking, but you smoked anyway. This kind of scarring in the lungs means that you're going to go through pneumonia a couple of times to clean it out. Rejoice, have a party, be happy, because that's about the only way you're going to break up that kind of scarring. It's mainly in the left lung and bronchioles. A very creative bone there, so you just have to keep creative. Pretty headstrong. You have to have things your way, so if you're going to have a mate, pick one that likes doing what you like doing.

Q: I have a question. Do you consider, when you say tell us not to include the half of a lemon in a lubrication formula? Is that separate?

A: Yes, definitely. Those formulas are set. Any additional fruit is what I'm talking about.

Q: Are avocados fruit?

A: When I talk about fruits, I'm talking about fruits with high carbohydrate value. Fruit sugars. They are a fruit, but they're a bland fruit. High fat, bland fruit. Most people do not have a liver that digests it properly. Avocados, yeah. I tell people, you know, wait about two years after they've been on the diet before they eat many avocados. Other than that, maybe one, two, three a week at the most. Unless you have no other fat. What's your name?

Q: Carol.

A: Hi, Carol. The right ovary is fine. It's overactive, good and strong. Starting to debilitate a bit. The left ovary is almost 50% debilitated. It doesn't look like it's producing at all. The adrenal glands used to be very overactive. They're a little fatigued now. The right side of the pancreas is almost completely debilitated. The left is about 40% debilitated and it's edemic, which means it's retaining a lot of water. It's swollen. So you shouldn't use many sugars either. Fruits. Keep fruits down to maybe one every other day and always eat them with fat. Circulation in your spine is good on both sides. There's hemorrhaging there. So you have a little bit of hemorrhaging all over in your body too. So I'm going to suggest that you also have about four ounces of cabbage juice every three days for you. I forgot on those other two people that I read. I recommend four cups of vegetable juice a day. I usually give the amounts. It's usually 80% celery and 20% parsley unless I suggest something else. Do not have vegetable juice with any foods other than fats. Coconut cream, cream. In the groin area... Looks like a tendency toward constipation. Poor circulation in that area. The extremities, good circulation there, but not in the torso and down in the groin area. Red meat should be 60%. White meat 40%. 20% of that 40% should be seafood. You may increase that at times when you don't have an appetite for fowl. There's a lot of congestion in the small intestines. It looks like the suet that normally is around the kidneys is not breaking down properly and it's filling with ammonia and it's sending it out into the intestines blocking the small intestines. Thyroid is whole, just not functioning well. Parathyroids are whole, functioning better, but not as well as they should be. Do you have your tonsils?

Q: No.

A: Say ah. The left side, all the glands on the left side are really low and breaking down and deteriorating. So half of your glandular system is not functioning like it should. It's odd because the circulation on this side is better yet the glands are debilitated. Here the circulation is poor but the glands are stable so it's your particular way of balancing it yourself. Because of this configuration there's a tendency to be ultra-critical. You're right for you. Just know that you're right for you and everybody else is right for them and then there will be less conflict. I'm very philosophical, I enjoy that, but again it's all theoretical stuff. All that criticism makes your low esteem hit bottom too. So be creative and then that will pull you out of it. Because that's where your only enjoyment will be found, is in your creativity. I usually stay just into the nutritional and physiological properties except when I see that mental properties will interfere with the healing process. You need to write out some of your philosophies because some of those that you created are very debilitating to you. So I would just open up a little bit more on some of those philosophies. Your liver is not working very well so you're storing bile all over your body.

[audio cut]

A: I take an eight ounce canning jar and let them, you know, one jar some chicken and another jar some beef and another jar some fish. Because you have toxic minerals in your system too that are interfering with that, use swordfish for one of them. So you have three separate jars and you have maybe like three ounces of each. Open it up, go outside, open it up to the air two days a week. You know, just open it, close it right back up and take it in the house, put it in the refrigerator. At three weeks start taking it and taking it up until it's all gone. But you only take one large marble sized amount of each a week and rotate each week a different one. Okay?

Q: Is that in your book?

A: No. No. No, my publisher would not let me put certain things in. That's for another book. Okay. You're very welcome.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, that one I got away with.

Q: How do you know if you can eat avocados or not?

A: Well, normally I can't tell unless I'm looking in the iris and blow it up, you know. So I would say that if you eat an avocado and it sits a little heavily on your stomach, for about fifteen minutes afterwards you don't digest it well. Of course if you eat it with something like pineapples, you'll never know the difference. Because there's so much bromelain in the pineapple, it will just melt it.

Q: With papaya and so on?

A: No, it doesn't have the intensity and the citric acid to help break down the fats. Very different, papaya and pineapple. Let's say if you, after eating the avocado, you get a little lethargy, you get a little sleepy, sign you're not digesting it well.

Q: I feel like that with what I just ate [unintelligible].

A: Well, probably because you ate too much cheese with it. I would have said just to reverse more meat, less cheese. Yeah, because you're so enzyme deficient that cheese doesn't have a lot of enzymes. So, I would say eat some honey, little bits of honey just to get the enzymes in there so you can utilize it. It's better when you're first starting out like that to eat the meat with just very, very little cheese. And then you'll probably have no trouble at all. Did you drink anything, have anything with it other than the cheese and meat? Water? Never, ever, ever drink water with meat and cheese. It will completely dilute your acids and then that stuff will sit in your stomach for quite a while, at least 40 minutes, 50 minutes. And usually meat and cheese should be gone out of the stomach in 20 minutes.

Q: Not just water but anything?

A: You should never drink water with any food.

Q: But no fluid with any food then?

A: Well, you can drink milk with almost anything except for your vegetable juice.

Q: How long after a vegetable juice can you do milk?

A: After the first time, let's say you have vegetable juice the first thing in the morning, which I usually recommend to get everybody's enzymes going for the day. Wait about 20 to 40 minutes, that's all. After that it should be an hour either side for any food before or after vegetable juice, an hour. Just to be on the safe side.

Q: Do you recommend the high meat for everyone?

A: No, because some people may have such a violent reaction from it and they put them into such a heavy detox that I may not. 

Q: Someone who is relatively healthy with no specific symptoms, just a maintenance dosage of that?

A: Absolutely. I would say anybody who wants to eat raw meat on a regular basis every week, go for it. You'll get better faster. The Eskimos, they would do it every summer, getting ready for fall and winter. That's where I was introduced to it. They took caribou and beat it into a mince, rolled it in oil and seal blubber, wrapped it in a hide and buried it in the ground. It was never deeper than six inches under the ground and never above two inches above the surface. So, it was right in that four-inch plane, between two and six inches under the ground. They let it rot until it smelled for half a mile and then it was ready, downwind. Man, did it stink. I couldn't get within five feet of the stench of it. I just wanted to barf. So, I took cotton balls with musk oil and stuck them in my nostrils. They shaved about a golf ball size amount off. I went and stuck it and swallowed it quickly so that I could get it down and then ran again away from it and pulled the stuff out of my nose. It was okay. But, you know, I had blood and bone cancer. So, I was always plagued with a cold. If it got 72 degrees, I was already in pain in my joints. So, after I ate that high meat, and I didn't know it was high meat because it was green and black. I thought that it was herbs. I was a vegetarian at the time and they were trying to give me raw meat. I wouldn't do it. But, they got me to eat this because they made me believe or I interpreted right away that it was some herb. I ate this stuff and for the first time in ever that I could remember, I was not cold and I was in Alaska. Sure, it was late summer. It was September. But, it was still already cold. In Alaska, it's already snowing in September. Heavily snowing. I was not cold for the entire time that I was there for the month, you know, into October. So, they eat massive amounts of this. I mean, the kids come over and there's fish that you just would not believe that people would eat.  These kids got smiles from ear to ear and it's eating it as if it were a lollipop.

Q: On a regular basis when you buy meat, is it going to be two or three days before you eat it? Do you refrigerate it or leave it out?

A: I usually refrigerate it. But, for the day that I eat it, I usually leave it out. Because I like it room temperature. It's tastier that way.

Q: But, you could leave it out for two, three, four days.

A: Owanza in the book had 63 tumors. It took about 11 years to recover from all that. She did something that even the Eskimos didn't do. She took a half a cup of meat, no, a whole cup of meat, and she let it rot on the kitchen counter for six weeks in her apartment. Open container with nothing but cheesecloth over it. It stunk up the whole building. I mean, this was in Beverly Hills. And this apartment building, there were eight apartments in this building, and the fifth week I walked into the hallway and I could smell it in the hallway and I was getting a headache. So, I didn't even go into her apartment the last week. It was that bad.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, it didn't. In fact, she healed in the next 18 months, she healed quicker than I've seen her heal, I've seen her heal in the previous six and a half years before she did that. There was worms in it, there were flies in it, and she ate everything. She ate everything that was in it. Everything that was in it, she ate. Every bit of it. I don't even know how she did it. Probably because she lived with it every day and the smell when she was living with it. I don't know. She was better than I. But she did it and she got much better after that. I mean, she was always in depression. And after she had that, she was not depressed again. I've never known her to be depressed since that. She didn't eat it all at once. It took her about three days to eat it. She did.

Q: How much did she make?

A: About a cup. She had one of those wide mouth, poppacary type jars. And they had that metal flip lids. And just a gauze cloth over there with a rubber band around it. I don't know what it prevented from getting in there, because it was all in there anyway. Flies and everything. Little bitty flies. She ate everything.

Q: So why do you make it so complicated? Why can't you do it like that?

A: Because your whole house will stink.

Q: Even if it's closed?

A: Even if it's closed. It will leak. It gets gas in it. It will start pushing the top up a bit. It will bend it. It will crack it. It will bubble it. It will do everything. Unless you open it regularly every couple of days. And then that stench gets into your house. So I say, go out and take it outside and do it outside. Unless you want to prepare yourself for it.

Q: Bacteria growing in it?

A: Yeah. Gas. It creates gases. That's one of the reactions. The sulfur sets free. Okay. Who's next? What is your name?

Q: Kathleen.

A: Kathleen. Let's turn this way a little bit. Well, your liver stopped working properly about twenty-two years ago. How old are you?

Q: Thirty-five.

A: You just have bile all over the place. Everywhere. All of your tissues. All of your cells. But if you have a lot of advanced glycation end products, and you do have some in your body, you're a prime candidate for herpes and candida.

Q: Yeah. I used to have it. Stronger when I was twenty.

A: But you still have it. It's just that you're not detoxing it. Stand by when you detox it. It's all going to come back. There'll be times when your whole face around in this area is going to turn green and orange when it starts coming out. And then it'll turn brown. Sex glands are, the left one's pretty normal. The right one's overactive. The adrenal glands are pretty normal. The left one's a little overactive. The pancreas is okay. About fifty percent functional. It's just that even though you can handle fruit sugars, you're just so thin. You lack proper fats all over and you've got all this bile in there. So if you have the fruit, it's likely to make you very irritable. 

Q: I get angry when I eat.

A: Yeah. So I would stay away from fruit for that reason. If you can get raw cream and you can have, you know, a cup of cream, a whole cup of cream with some fruit, you could probably get away with it. That's a luxury. 

Q: Well, I've been doing four raw eggs a day and that seems to really be mellowing me out.

A: Well, you need about ten to twelve eggs a day to get all that bile out of there. You're using fragrant oils?

A: Yeah, I make essential oil soaps. It's starting to deteriorate your brain cells. So I would wear a mask, with a charcoal mask, something to stop those vapors.

Q: Is it essential oil or fragrances? Because we've always been doing essential oil and then we just switched to fragrances. It doesn't matter?

A: It doesn't matter. It's the vapors. You can't handle those vapors. That also adds to your irritability, because it's damaging those nerve cells. Even if you're exposed to the finished product, it's not a good thing. You need to stay away from oils. It's to hell with your career, right? Lots of congestion in your torso, especially around the kidneys and liver. Spinning. Do you have back aches?

Q: I've got two spots in my back that are just sore to the touch. Lower back one too, yeah.

A: You're concentrating some of the bile right there in those two places. And they're actually eating away the nerve tissue. So you need at least eight eggs a day. Minimum of eight eggs a day. Up to 12 eggs a day. Cream if you can get it. Do like I do. Get some extra quarts of milk and suck the cream off and use the skim milk for a bath. That will also help draw some of the bile that's in your skin out. I have never, ever suggested this for anyone before, but two days a week eat two egg whites without the yolk. You can have the yolk with some meat, red meat, another time. And then you can have the egg white, two egg whites when you're having milk and a couple of eggs at another time. That concentrated protein in that form will help build some mucus around the liver. They'll protect that liver. Have you been diagnosed with hepatitis? Because you have all the symptoms of having three types of hepatitis. It doesn't matter whether it's hepatitis or not, it's just severe liver damage. I'm going to suggest that you have liver at least two times a week. I have liver... When I take liver, I like pate. I'll just put it in a food processor with some red onion and blend it into a pate. And I like it that way. I came up with a new recipe last week when I was eating a lot of new buffalo glands, or just earlier this week. And I make a salsa with cherry tomatoes, take like five cherry tomatoes, one little sliver section of red onion, about an inch by a quarter of an inch, a quarter of a teaspoon of vinegar, blend that together, and then I'll take a teaspoon of that and put it with like liver or lungs or anything, half a cup of each, milk, gland, and a teaspoon of that salsa, and just a little bit of garlic, a little sliver of garlic in that, blend that in the salsa, and then I'll take a teaspoon of salsa and put that in with the milk and the glands, and blend that together. It tastes like an incredible soup. And that's an easy way to eat glandular tissue. If you have a particular glandular problem and you need to bring the gland back quicker, good fresh gland will get it back. It's the only thing I've found that will help the glands grow back quickly are the same glands that you have a problem with.

Q: Is moldy better than fresh for that?

A: Well to degenerate the old tissue in it, the toxic tissue, the rotted is the better, but to rebuild it has to be the fresh. So remember that a rotted food will help. Let me finish this and I'll do that. The thyroid gland is almost non-functional, both sides. The parathyroids are very overactive trying to make up for the inactivity of the thyroid gland. So if you can get thyroid, who has it? Can you get thyroid from the deer? Throat? Yeah, okay. You two live near each other? Oh, easy. You've got a fourth. You get that thyroid. If you just blend it with, you know, take that and some milk and some red onion and blend it together, it'll taste like clam chowder. But if you like the salsy flavor, you know, tomato like, you know, Mexican flavor, then go with the salsa and with it. So you need liver, you need the thyroid gland, and predominantly, this is a confusing one because you're over-acidic, so normally for over-acidic people I say less meat, because that tends to make you irritable. So you're one of those people who needs a lot of red meat, but yet will get irritable. So you have to stay on top of your juice, vegetable juice. You have vegetable juice, meat, smoothie, vegetable juice, meat, smoothie, vegetable juice, meat, vegetable juice. Make sure you get the full in because you have to keep your system alkaline or you'll get irritable very easily. And if you go off of that juice, even for two days in a row, you'll know it. Okay? And you won't be able to eat the meat, you'll get anorexic. And if you eat too much fruit, you're not going to have an appetite for meat. The more fruit you eat, the less you'll be able to digest meat because it over-alkalizes the intestines. Sweet fruit. And I would say I would wait about three months before you eat some rotten meat just to stabilize, because you start breaking down some of that liver tissue right now and you'll go into fatigue pretty heavily. So wait about three months until you've gotten good and stable before you start eating rotten meat, and you do need some rotten meat, because that is due to a lot of your depression. Okay?

Q: And the recipes for juices and smoothies are in the back of the book?

A: No. Yours should be 80% celery and 20% parsley. Everybody's 80% celery, 20% parsley, unless I tell you differently while you're up here. Okay? Smoothies for you, as I said, have eggs and milk and honey only. Okay? Once in a while, maybe the fruit that I wouldn't, because it would make you irritable and emotional and all wound up, I would say try to stay away from it. Be balanced.

Q: Butter, coconut butter, raw fat.

A: Yeah. Yes, definitely.

Q: And that egg can be blended together?

A: Mm-hmm. Yeah. So you can put as much fat in as you like as you can digest. With your liver problem, you don't want to overburden it. So yours, because of that problem, it's going to be harder for you to get through than most people. I mean, it's not going to be like your brother, you know, like that. Yours is going to be slower because there's some severe damage there. Okay? And there's lots of scar tissue everywhere. But you can still recover. Okay?

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Okay, what was it I was going to finish and talk about? Oh, moldy meat. Okay, moldy foods in general. Molds are there to break down the substances that are clogged in your system that there's no way to remove them and dissolve them or eliminate them. You eat cooked foods, you destroy the natural enzymes, everything in them, the bacteria, they're destroyed. Over, fini, nothing. So when that food dries out in your system, that substance dries out in your system, there's no way to dissolve it and remove it except with solvents. To get molds and bacterias in your body, if you will mold foods that you ate a lot of cooked, you can eliminate them from your body. To help get rid of advanced glycation end products, I used to take wheat berries, rye berries, you know, rice berries. I was a big, what was that, sugar crisp, what was that, sugar pops, you know, rice krispies, all those things. I was a heavy cereal eater. So I was full of those advanced glycation end products. So I took those same grains and would germinate them and then let them rot, black and white molds, and then I would eat them to help get rid of mine quickly, quicker.

Q: Would you still recommend it?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Should we do something with potatoes too?

A: You can do it with potatoes too. Just remember you don't want to have a lot of it because there are two things that happen with that. Sometimes a black mold you're from, which is ergot, and you can get high because it's LSD. And it can be a nice high, but it doesn't really ground you into reality. I haven't experienced anybody that's had hallucinations from it, except when it was pulling out somebody who had intense LSD. People who had a lot of LSD, yes, it would bring it out and they would have reoccurrences of hallucinations. So grains is something you probably will want to take with less often than you would meat. Meat is something you could do every week, rotten meat, fine. The grains I would do no more than once, one cycle of them about every 16 to 18 months, and no more than probably two ounces. Two ounces after it's, you know, if you took one ounce of berries and they swell up double the size, and then you mold and shrink a little bit, that's about right.

Q: Over how long, the 2 ounces?

A: Well you want to start taking it, you'll take about maybe four or five berries that have molded every week, and you start at the third week, and you go until you finish them. All molds have 17 stages that they go through, and you want to eat them at all those different stages.

Q: You know the molding raspberries, they were staying red for the longest time, there's hardly any mold on them and it's been...

A: You didn't let them mold outside the refrigerator first?

Q: No.

A: When you're molding berries, you wash them first, you let them get wet, you let them swell and get soggy, then you leave them out and they'll mold, the mold will grow quickly. Once the mold starts growing, then put them in a jar and put it in the refrigerator. And in the book I talked about having a lot at one time, and some people would go into chronic fatigue that could last anywhere from 30 days or a few weeks up to a year. Another way to do it, again like the grain berries, you can use the raspberries and the other berries in the same way. You mold about a pint of them, you only take three berries a week. And very rarely does anyone go into a fatigue, and if it lasts, it will only last for a few days. Again, that's to destroy the mutant antibodies created either by antibiotics or vaccines that feed on the proteins in your blood, the somatids that make up the proteins. So you can look like you have a lot of protein in your blood, but they're hollow like an empty egg.

Q: I ate a lot of soy. Can you do that with soy too?

A: You ate a lot of soy? That's a difficult one, because the soy bean is poisonous raw. That's a very difficult one.

Q: Could you mold soy sprouts?

A: Yes, you could. That would probably be a better way, but just remember that I would do that very, very lightly and only once in a while, and no more than probably five grains, maybe one of them a week, and that's it. Because, does everybody know the soy ploy? Okay, soy is one of the most poisonous foods there is, but it's high in protein, easy to grow, and great marketing. Even vegetarian animal herbivores cannot eat soy without getting sick. They cannot feed it to animals in any large quantity. An herbivore will not eat it in any quantity, even a goat, because there are enzymes which absolutely stop digestion, protein inhibitors, enzyme inhibitors. If you want to know about it, go on Price Pottenger's site, www.pricepottenger.com, and put in soy, soy ploy, and you'll come up with Dr. Enig and Sally Fallon's research on it.

Q: What about the Japanese? [unintelligible]

A: The Japanese only ate it in soy sauce. They never ate tofu. That was an industrialized thing that the Japanese came up with later on when soy started becoming a marketable substance.

Q: What about miso?

A: Miso is again almost all salt in soy. If it were raw fermentation, but they don't ferment any of that raw, and then the salt counteracts some of the fermentation, yes. If you're going to make a rotten food, make it raw. If it's soy or grains, you need to germinate or it's not going to do you any good. And you need to germinate the grains until they mold in the germination process. Keep them wet, not completely covered, but keep them wet. So you see this white mold start growing, and then when the blacks and the other molds start growing, you know they're at different stages. And eat them at all those different stages. Yes?

Q: When I came back from France, I decided to mold the cheese. Is that a good idea?

A: That's a very good idea, because we've all eaten lots of cooked cheese in our life. What's that American stuff? Velveeta? How much Velveeta I ate, no wonder I was so sick. That stuff was awful.

Q: What about cheez whiz?

[laughter]

A: That's plastic. Who said that? You just leave it out.

Q: And I also found that you put it in a dark place, it seems to, the mold grows faster.

A: Right, if you leave it out at room temperature, and you close, if you'll take it out of its package, and then let air inside, you know, plastic bag, like a Ziploc bag, with air in it, it will mold very quickly. All different kinds of molds. That may be a difficult one, so only a little bit, because I've seen people get fatigued, so eat only a little bit. Maybe, you know, a little, let's say mold from the outside first, and it will work its way in over the months inside. So when it gets on the outside, if you want it to go blue to blue cheese, you need to let it sit a longer time. If it's just a white mold, that will happen within a few days. You can shave some of that off, but I wouldn't have any more than a thin shaving like this, about as wide as the brick is, and no more than an inch long per week. And remember, don't mix these molds. Don't be having, you know, don't go having, let's say I have my moldy berries this week, and I have my fish, rotten fish this week, and I have my moldy grains this week. No, no, one mold a week, that's it, or else you find yourself fatigued. This is a 40 year process, do it intelligently.

Q: So why would one get tired from it? 

A: From the molds. The molds are there to decompose substances, that's what molds do. So you start molding, you know, you've got a lot of molds in your body, breaking down toxicity in your system, all of your energy and nutrients are going to handle that, and you're not going to have any energy to do things. Okay, next. What's your name again?

Q: Richard.

A: Okay, there we go. Okay, the left testy is pretty normal. Adrenal glands have been off and on overactive. The left testy, right testy is very overactive. Right adrenal gland is pretty, was pretty overactive. The adrenals right now are inflamed, the pancreas is inflamed and edemic. Pancreas is probably working only about 20 to 25 percent. One fruit with high carbohydrate in it, maybe only once every two days, always eat high fat with it. Red blood cell count is very good, however the oxygen is not being transported very well with red blood cells, so the red blood cells aren't very strong. I'm going to suggest that you have 25 percent parsley and 65, no, I'm sorry, and 55 percent celery for about six weeks, and then go to 20 percent parsley, 15 to 20 percent parsley, 60 to 70 percent celery, and then zucchini or cucumber for the remainder. You have fat cells clumping like glucose in your glands, thyroid, parathyroids and the throat area. You had a tonsillectomy. Lots of scar tissue there from it. And the lymph glands in the thyroid aren't so good. You need lots of moldy meat or high meat, bacterial meat. About 70 percent of your meat should be red meat, 10 percent seafood and 20 percent fowl. I would suggest that you do some walking, maybe even do some push-ups, because the congestion in your glands will help get that all moving if you'll do that kind of movement or chin-ups, something that will get that going a little bit better. The reason I said zucchini is because you have a lot of lead and toxic minerals stored in your brain, a little bit in your spinal cord, mid-back. When you do have fruit, I suggest you have pineapple, but not very much. You seem to have a higher hernia just nimbling between the stomach and the lungs. It's almost all scar tissue and lots of congestion in there. Sometimes that creates a very acid condition in here, soreness, burning. Eating whole coconut can relieve that. It's about the only thing I've seen relieve it when it's this pronounced. When I've seen it this pronounced, it usually takes 10 to 20 years to completely get rid of it, but it can be gotten rid of. Most people live with that all their life and it gets worse and worse and worse, so they have to have almost everything removed. But you can reverse yours. You just have to be patient. Did you ever have a hernia?

Q: Not to my knowledge. I have had pain in those areas, but I never consulted any medical people.

A: You've got some ulcerations down there. That's going to form into scar tissue like the hidal is. I suggest that three and a half cups be the other juice and half a cup of the white cabbage, about half a cup a day, which is four ounces, every three days for about eight weeks. That should resolve the hemorrhaging. It's not going to resolve the pain for a long, long time, all of it, but it will get rid of most of it, 80 percent. It won't even be that noticeable, but you still may have a sharp pain every once in a while. Did you work around heavy metals like lead?

Q: I don't know.

A: Where did you grow up?

Q: New York.

A: Well, you must have been allergic to all those heavy metals in the air, because they're all throughout your lungs and chest cavity. The bronchials, everywhere and it's just sitting in there. Tomatoes, eat tomatoes with cheese, maybe three days a week. And I recommend that you have about eight to ten eggs a day, right around eight. Are you living where you can get milk?

Q: Not really, or no. I'd have to order it.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Okay.

A: Go get it. They have the Claravale milk. It's a great milk. I recommend that you have a quart a day of milk. 

Q: What do you do when you have a headache?

A: Well, if you let it sit and clabber like I do, let it sit out for three days at room temperature, and don't leave it in those bottles. You saw the quart jars with the wide mouth that Joe has. Put it in that and don't fill it all the way. Put a lid on it so some air will get in there and it will clabber quicker. You should use a natural clabber though. I would rather that the milk digest itself rather than adding the rennet, because the rennet for you won't work. You need the milk to break down properly on its own for your system. And the headaches you're going to have because you have the heavy lead and mineral toxicity that's all in here, and when that dumps into the blood you get high blood pressure. Go for the headache formula, I mean the pain formula that I gave. That will help counteract that. So two eggs in that, you know, some of the cream, you know, the bee pollen and everything, that will take care of most of your headache. So you can still function at least. But you can go without that side effect. You need to eliminate it. Boysenberries and blackberries will help you also get rid of those metals faster. And if you're going to mold some, mold those particular berries. Do you have any questions?

Q: I think that will do.

A: Okay, thank you. Could you put it on pause for a minute?

[audio cut]

A: All right. What is your name again?

Q: Andrew.

A: Okay, Andrew. This guy should be an athlete, or a prostitute. Very, very overactive sex glands and adrenals. Hope you have a very active partner. If not, you need to take care of yourself. Because that many hormones building up can make you a very irritable man. Or distract you entirely. The pancreas is about 60% functional, but not very healthy. So you could handle one piece of fruit a day, as long as you eat it with something. If you eat fruit without fat, it's likely to increase your sexuality and make you more uncomfortable.

Q: Restless?

A: Very. Not necessarily more emotional. It will work up to that eventually. But you will make you more restless and irritable. Circulation is good in the spine and the limbs. Lots of bile collecting everywhere. Your liver is not in good shape. The lymph glands around the liver are very congested. The liver has done as much as it can do until its whole system is destroyed. There is a lot of metal toxicity in the right testes. What that is going to do, eventually when it starts coming out, the whole area between your rectum and your scrotum is going to inflame and could last for a couple of years and itch at times. Who knows when that is going to happen in the next 40 years, but it will happen probably several times.

Q: Metals?

A: Yes. Why they have stored mainly in the right testes, I don't know. Also in the sinuses on the right side, all up in here. Do you work with welding?

Q: I have previously done a lot of welding. Also a lot of solvents, paints, metal work, metal shavings, dust.

A: Well, it's really lodged and it's basically poisoned your liver. So you need lots and lots of eggs, up to 28 a day.

Q: I don't break my previous record.

A: What is your record so far been?

Q: I could eat easily 8 to 10, whatever.

A: For you that's nothing, you need a lot. Are you working out, do you exercise?

Q: I have physical work, I don't exercise purposefully. Outside of...

A: What do you do?

Q: Landscaping.

A: Oh, that's very active. You can definitely eat 28 eggs a day. That's the only way I see you're going to get rid of that bile. You don't have to do it every day, all the time. But you need to just load your body up with it. You need to get fat around here and then take it off and get fat around there. If this bile with that kind of metal toxicity and solvents gets to your intestine without enough fat around here, it's going to put holes in your intestines and then you'll find yourself not able to function. So you want to make sure you can build that up. Cheese is going to be very helpful too because when your body takes some of that, it's going to dump it right into the stomach and the cheese will help absorb it. So you won't have so much nausea. There will be times when you probably will have to vomit it up.

Q: How about mineral deficiency?

A: Well it definitely creates a mineral deficiency but the cheese will help correct that and the milk. I recommend two quarts a day. Lots of milk and lots of eggs. I would say concentrate on those for about six weeks, six days a week and maybe a half a pound of meat every day. The various types of meats, I'll get into what percentage in a minute. And then after about six weeks, increase it up to about a pound of meat a day and cut the eggs down to about 12 to 20 a day. For six weeks, go 20 to 28 a day, half a pound of meat. And keep up your juice, vegetable juice. Maybe let it go one day, two days a week, but never two days in a row. Berries I would wait until maybe August before you start eating berries because that's going to pull them out even quicker. I would just like to make sure that your body is stabilized everywhere so when that solvent and those metals come out into your system, that your system will be protected. So the chance of damage will be minimized.

Q: It's an older exposure, it's not a day to day thing currently.

A: But it's in glands. It's very fluid.

Q: Luckily I'm not taking it in currently to that degree.

A: No, it would look differently if you were taking it in now. This is old and deep. It's all in your bones, in your arms, in your ribs, especially in the right testes, and in your brain, sinuses. The thyroid looks okay. It's got some metal toxicity. Parathyroids are underactive. Tonsils... It looks like scar there so they look like they've been removed. Somebody get me a flashlight. They're quite a bit deteriorated. I'm going to get mine. Mine's a little bit brighter. In case I need to see them again. Do you have a...

Q: I don't know.

A: That'll work.

Q: Did I swallow my tonsils somewhere along the line?

A: No, sometimes solvents will actually cause them to just deteriorate, disintegrate. That one's almost completely gone. It's very dark. And so is this one. I can see that this one, the left one is a little bit better though. You can't even see a gland. There's a scar tissue that looks like the gland has just eaten away.

Q: What do the tonsils do? What's important about them?

A: Well, they break down certain toxicity and protect the brain.

Q: How can people protect themselves from solvents and chemicals?

A: Wearing masks, putting olive oil on your hands.

Q: I was a mechanic for years, so many chemicals, used motor oil, solvents... It goes right into your cuticles, right into your nose. It soaks in. That was a daily thing for me.

A: And breathing it.

Q: Is there enough food that you can take to protect you?

A: No. Well, you need lots of fats which will help, like milk and creams and stuff like that to buffer it. And then coating your arms where you're touching it and wearing gloves. That's about all you can do but you can't really prevent it. Also, you need to stay away from using any kind of oils other than a natural oil. Fragrant oils, any of them.

Q: Aromatics.

A: Aromatics, any of them. Are solvents again for you. If someone could create... 

Q: Like citrus maybe?

A: Well, you could use the rind and just squeeze it on you.

Q: Rather than the aromatics.

A: Correct. Well, they're all heat processed. Even Young's which are distilled at 257 degrees. He says in his book, nature does it at 62 to 72 degrees. Not 257 degrees. So his oils are better than those that are done at 257 and higher. But still his oils are done at 257 degrees. That's too high. Turns it into plastic. And it has a very toxic vaporous reaction. So if you want real oils that will be fragrant for you, eat the flower petals. Early in the morning before they vaporize. Before oils vaporize.

Q: And to me that any kind of soap with any kind of essential oil, that's not advisable.

A: I won't use soaps at all. I blend one egg, three ounces of vegetable juice, two ounces of milk, and one tablespoon of honey. I use that. I put it on my hair when it's dry. I didn't do that today because I didn't have access. I just put straight milk on my hair today.

Q: [unintelligible] Do you wash your hands after using facilities?

A: Yeah. Well, I'd recommend that you do not wash your hands after that. I would recommend that you touch yourself with that E. coli and salmonella and everything. Some of my cancer clients, believe it or not, and this is going to get out because it's the first time saying it publicly, I have them take rotten meat after they've gone to the bathroom before they wipe themselves to take their finger over their rectum and rub it on the meat and let it rot. That way they'll ensure the high E. coli and the high verotoxins produced by it. And like I said, the University of Toronto has shrunk entire brain tumors along with the vessels going to it in a matter of 7 to 15 days with one injection of verotoxins.

Q: What about all those babies that died and mothers that died giving birth before doctors figured out how to wash their hands, that whole, you know, that whole, um...

A: That wasn't... Everybody likes to, you know, theorize what was responsible. A lot of women were not able to get access to meats, were very low in protein and mainly lived on carbohydrates and they were very thin and had very low fat levels, so both they and the babies would die under high strain. A lot of women died that way just from being thin, from weather temperature changes, because it was not easy to build fires. Stoves were expensive, even pot belly stoves, so there weren't a lot of homes that had them. Women were considered healthy if they were fat. You couldn't get a wealthy man to marry a skinny woman a hundred years ago. He would reject her in a flash because the odds of her dying in either heat or hypothermia were about ninety percent.

Q: Yeah, you see it in the art, too.

A: Oh, absolutely, yeah. Now that we have heaters and we have all this convenience, you know, skinny people don't die so easily, you know. And a lot of them die in childbirth because you need a lot of fats to have a good, you know, birthing. Yes, John?

Q: What about washing your hands after using bathrooms? What about in public restrooms?

A: I don't touch anything there. I just touch myself, you know, and if I hit, you know, they have all those electronic ones now, but I'll hit with my elbow or something like that, you know. But I don't worry about germs. I want them.

Q: Well, no, I'm not going to say worry about germs, but I mean, there's a lot of great germs in there, like at airports. You get them from all over the world.

A: You know, I don't mind as long as they're organic germs. What bothers me is man-made germs, you know, like the War Department's, you know, AIDS virus and stuff like that. They're not easy to handle. Pardon?

Q: How do you protect against that? You know, we've got these phenomenal chemtrails flying everywhere. God knows what kind of fungus and bacteria are coming down that are man-made and war germs.

A: Well, I did about five months' research on the chemtrails, and basically, they're trying to handle the ozone layer. Okay, they're trying to deflect global warming, and what they're doing is they're spraying an aluminum compound, which is a neurotoxin, and it destroys natural bacteria that's in the atmosphere. That's suspended in, you know, in clouds. You have lots of bacteria. You have protozoas. You have what they call sea monkeys. You know, that's how...

Q: They live in water droplets.

A: They live in water droplets, exactly, and when you release that aluminum compound, it kills them. Then more bacteria feeds on all these other animal-type compounds, so that's why they're finding so many different levels and kinds of bacteria in it, because these aluminum compounds are destroying, poisoning the atmosphere just like it poisons a human body.

Q: Because we've been getting doped here for, oh gosh, months and months, almost every day.

Q: What can we do to prevent, or shield ourselves or protect?

A: Not easy. The only way you can get, you can protect yourself against neurotoxins is by drinking cream, milk, milk and cream, and eggs, but milk is, milk and cream are your best. That's best for that. That's best for that, yeah. But you need to get in touch with your congresspeople and say, hey, this is not, poisoning me is not the way to handle, you know, the atmospheric toxins. You need to cut out fossil fuel, period. That's the only resolution. Pardon?

Q: I was just wondering what she was talking about, that she knew that it was happening here.

Q: Oh, I've been photographing it, going to the supervisors about it, doctors about it.

Q: What is it, in the air?

Q: Oh, yeah.

A: It's in the airplanes. You see the airplanes making these white streaks, and they don't go away, they don't evaporate, and they stay as clouds?

Q: Uh-huh. I didn't know that's what that was.

A: Yeah, that's trying to deflect the sun rays back out of the atmosphere.

Q: It's because of global warming.

A: And it only works about one to two percent. And then the pollution is greater than one to two percent. So it's really stupid. Really stupid.

Q: I don't know if people know about it.

A: Oh, it's stupid. It's asinine. One billion dollars a year, Hughes Aircraft has the contract. And they're using the military planes to do it.

Q: There's a very high level of cancer in this area. I'm wondering if that's connected with that, because we never have figured it out, really.

A: Well, you know, low bacteria is high everything. It's happening everywhere. It's happening everywhere. Cancer's everywhere.

Q: Is there a specific meat I should be thinking of to clear some of those toxic metals and solvents and whatnot?

A: No, the things that are going to get rid of that is lots of eggs and zucchini along the line. Even eating some late at night. The last thing you have is your vegetable juice is a little zucchini that will help pull it out. But you really need to stabilize before you do, because your liver isn't real active, and you've got a lot of bile throughout your entire system, like his sister. Where'd she go?

Q: She [unintelligible].

A: Oh. Kathleen?

Q: No meat in particular. Not fish or more red meat.

A: Well, you need to just stay, like I say. Didn't I tell you the proportion? No, I didn't?

Q: No, you didn't give me a reference.

A: Okay. It was about 65% red meat, about 25% fowl, and 10 to 15 fish. For about a year and a half, 18 months, then you'll probably change at that time.

Q: Are these percentages by weight? Volume?

A: Volume. Yeah. Or weight.

Q: Juice is fluid volume?

A: Pardon?

Q: Juice is fluid volume?

A: Yes.

Q: So when you say those percentages, do you mean every day or over a week's period?

A: You can work it out to a week's period.

Q: So you can just eat one day?

A: Yeah, you could eat all beef one day. Unless you're very delicate, and he's not delicate. Kathleen's delicate, so I would ask her to do it on a daily basis, to do those percentages on a daily basis, to have all of them. But other people who aren't fragile like that, they could mix it over a week and make it work out to those percentages. Okay, next. You still have all that bile. Your skin's looking so much better, though.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: You notice it, too? Wow. Okay, you did get a lot of the bile out, because now I can see why you were having so many, so much fatigue and so many problems. You also have metals.

Q: Mm-hmm.

A: Spilled all up in your sinuses and your brain.

Q: Oh, that's why I have a constant open sore in my nose.

A: Yeah. So what metals, poisons were you around?

Q: I don't know.

A: Mainly on the left side.

Q: Yeah. Metal filling?

Q: Not anymore.

A: Usually metal fillings won't create that abundance of it. I'll find that this lodged a little bit, but this is tremendous. 

Q: How about lead from water pipes? They soldered with lead, or they used to.

A: Yeah. I've never seen it from that. This is usually some kind of exposure to some art medium, you know, whether it's stained glass or, you know, working with solvents or being raised in a city where there's lots of heavy, you know, combustion pollution.

Q: Yeah. I hate cities for that.

A: The left side of your small intestines are very, very congested still. This is Pescal. I don't know if I've been saying the names each time. I'd like you to have five to ten percent of your juice now is dandelion.

Q: What is that?

A: Dandelion greens. Should help those intestines that are just, you have lots of scar tissue there. Those advanced glycation end products. Dandelion greens, because of the high vitamin C in it, will help go in there and dissolve it a little bit better.

Q: You know, I've been constipated most of my life. Does that mean I'm going to be constipated a lot again?

A: Well, you just have so much scar tissue there. You know, there's low intestinal bacteria because of that, low intestinal flora, low digestive enzyme reaction. So, in order to really get that moving properly, we need to get rid of the scar tissue. As I told you before, though, if you use a suppository of the... If anybody has constipation, they really want to help remove it permanently rather than the quick fix that I gave, which was the vegetable juice, the eggs, and the milk, and the vinegar, and the honey. All those things are indigestible together. So, just wash things through, you know, loosen you quickly. If you want to heal that, you've got to increase the bacteria level in your colon. Fecal matter is normally 60 to 80 percent bacteria. E. coli, salmonella, campylobacter. The fecal matter, if we didn't have those bacteria, would be about the size of marbles, and it would be the texture of granite. They go through and just rip you apart every time you had a movement. Bacteria feeds on it, sponges it out. All of the byproducts of the B vitamins, the amino acids that they manufacture, the varotoxins that prevent, you know, tumor growth and growth or storage of dead cells. It helps all of that, so all of that's good. There are even people who eat fecal matter to reutilize their proteins. Does anyone know Dr. Edward Howell? He was the man who discovered enzymes and did the research on enzymes. He fed rats cooked diets and raw diets. The ones who ate cooked diets all got diseases of man. The ones who ate raw didn't get any diseases. The curious thing was, with all their disease, usually you would expect the lifespan to be shortened. But the lifespan was equal for the ones who ate cooked and the ones who ate raw. But one thing in his notes that he didn't become conscious of until after he was looking at the information, was that the rats who ate cooked food ate all their feces. The ones who ate raw food did not eat their feces. So the next test, he took the rats and put them on a screen so they could not eat their feces who would fall through once they lived only two years instead of three years. So there's lots of animals that will eat their fecal matter when they need their bacteria to flush back into the system or they're not finished digesting what they ate to recycle it.

Q: There's nothing left.

A: Pardon?

Q: There's nothing left to work after that. We're eating our own shit.

A: No catalogs or jokes yet. But they use it as a remedy in some countries.

Q: In Europe too.

A: Yup. So when somebody says they eat shit, you go, thank you. Thank you, exactly. I suggest you eat from 35 to 40% fish for about three and a half weeks. That'll help get some of that metal toxicity out of there. Along with that, the dandelion greens will probably get your intestines working a little bit better. What I was going to say is if you want to get the bacteria in your intestines going in your bowels, take clabbered milk that you clabbered for about four days in a solid like yogurt. Take an enema bulb syringe, put about three or four ounces in there, get on all fours, bark. And then insert it in your rectum, then get down on your shoulders, on your knees, and your butt sit up in the air and roll your stomach like a belly dancer to get it down, moving into the transverse colon. Then roll on your right side, belly dance again, roll your stomach, and get it to go down into the ascending colon. So that the fecal matter, I mean the E. coli, the salmonella, the campylobacter, will have something that's non-toxic to feed on. Because since you're so toxic, you're going to be putting out toxins in your fecal matter that the bacteria sometimes will not work on, especially with heavy metals in their system. So the fecal matter doesn't touch it, I mean the bacteria doesn't touch it, or it actually will destroy the colonies the bacteria will poison them. And the only way that you can reintroduce that and keep them fed is maybe once a week doing this clabbered milk suppository. 

Q: Is it the whey part or the solid part or both?

A: Well, when you've got it at a clabbered stage, there's no separation.

Q: Oh, because mine always separates.

A: That's because you've taken it too far.

Q: Oh, before that.

A: Before that, yes. And that will help grow that bacteria so you'll move better. But until you get rid of that scar tissue, you're going to have to do that on a weekly basis.

Q: I really like the fish, like the tuna. And then a friend of mine told me that in Hawaii, it has so much mercury in it that it's really toxic to the liver, so I've stopped and I wasn't going to ask you about that.

A: No, if you cook fish, it causes the mercury to be a free radical. When you do not eat it cooked, it will not be absorbed as a toxin in your body. The mercury in swordfish is a very healthy mercury and helps that creature be very buoyant and can dive and jump very high. Without that mercury, it wouldn't be as buoyant. It wouldn't move as fast. It's a non-toxic until you cook it. And then you've made it a free radical, and it is a poison. So as long as it's fed, not fed, high levels of toxic mercury to the point where the fish itself has tumors and is diseased, it's not going to be a problem for you. Because my test showed that if you eat the animal raw, the toxicity passes out with the fat chelated with it without any digestion, without any breakdown of that fat or that chelated compound. So you eat that tuna.

Q: Okay.

A: Enjoy it. Your glands are in great shape now. Everything is working well, whether your kidneys are not, and your intestines, everything is working better. Pancreas is a little bit better. It's nice and high. I mean, it hasn't regenerated, but that that you have is now at least working. So your pancreas is probably working about 30%, and it's working very well for that 30%. So still no more than a piece of fruit a day.

Q: Yeah.

A: And it doesn't have to be that often. You do not really need fruit. Some people do, but mainly most people do not eat fruit, need fruit. Some people, they have a lot of fat congestion. I do recommend having pineapple, and that's when I've said that to the individual.

Q: That's what you've said to me, that if I have fruit, that's the one I should have.

A: Well, also the pineapple can help break down scar tissue. But I would suggest that you start eating high meat in the next few months.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay? But it looks a lot better. Your red blood cell count is still low.

Q: So what do I need for that?

A: Red meat.

Q: Red meat?

A: Yeah.

Q: That's what I've been craving most.

A: Mm-hmm. So you don't need a lot of chicken right now. You need mainly red meat and fish.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay?

Q: All right. Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: Question?

A: Question? Yes.

Q: I hear around that the fish have a lot of toxic metals and chemicals in them and that they're not good to eat.

A: I just addressed that.

Q: Okay. Okay.

A: Yeah. The ocean is only 2% polluted. The earth is 36% polluted. So are you safer by eating land food or ocean food? And the freshwater pollution is like 50%, 48% to 50%. I don't eat any freshwater fish.

Q: What about fat, animal fat?

A: The what?

Q: Animal fat.

A: Animal fat is wonderful.

Q: But it doesn't have a high pollution.

A: Well, I will not eat fat from animals who have been fed hormones and antibiotics, you know, and vaccines and stuff like that. Yeah.

Q: But what about toxic metals? Isn't that stored in the fat?

A: Yes, but as long as you don't cook them, they won't be released in your system.

Q: So how does this happen?

A: They'll pass through. Pardon?

Q: So the fat is not connected to toxins there?

A: Yes, they chelate with the toxins. But in my lab tests, it showed that the body could identify that when it wasn't cooked and did not break that fat down, just passed it through with the toxins.

Q: And the rest of the fat is broken down?

A: Correct.

Q: The animal has already dealt with toxicity and encapsulated it so it can deal with it.

A: Correct. And then when your body takes it in, as long as you don't cook it, it can identify that. And there's a symbiotic process that passes it through.

Q: What about the idea that the big fish eat the little fish, and the concentrations of toxic materials get larger in the bigger animals?

A: Well, if they're feeding on land creatures, that will definitely be a response. But if you've gone around polluted areas, most of those fish won't touch those little fish that are so polluted and full of tumors. They won't eat them. You'll see them floating around, dead. And no fish is eating them.

Q: I have a theoretically simple question, and that has to do with water. And drinking water. We have a spring here in town called Bittman Springs. I had it lab tested, and they said that it was 50 or 100 vegetable coliforms per the little thing I brought in. Would that be good water to drink? Or what water would you suggest drinking when we wanted good water?

A: No water. I'm very hard against water. Water is nothing other than minerals without any nutrients. And what do minerals do? Minerals attract nutrients. They pull them out of your blood, pull them into your intestines. And what are you doing? Washing nutrients out of the body. And they dry the system out. So I suggest a quart of juice a day, at least a quart of milk a day. And that usually handles it. Now, some people do need a little water. So if you're craving water, then drink a little bit. I maybe have, during the winter in this time, three ounces of water a week. And that's it. But I may go through two quarts of milk a week, I mean a day. Plus my juice. Before I was on a diet like this, I was drinking two gallons of water a day. And by drinking two quarts of milk and one quart of vegetable juice, it more than satisfies me. And I'm not on the toilet every hour. Over the toilet every hour.

Q: Does that in any way mirror what animals do in the wild? How much water do they consume relative to you?

A: It depends upon the animal. If you're a camel, you can take up to 25 gallons at a time and not drink for six weeks. But other animals drink very little water. Depends on how hot it is. Probably birds eat more water, drink more water than any other creature.

Q: They have to because they consume grains.

A: Dry grains all the time, yeah, so much. Well, you notice that when they feed on insects, they don't drink much water. But when it's season for seeds, they will drink more water. Okay. Your name again?

Q: Ursula.

A: Ursula, this is Ursula. Ursula, you have very, very little protein in your system. Everything is debilitated. Your glands, there's no rounding. Everything's sunken. I only see hands like this on people who have eaten mainly grains in their life or vegetarians for a very, very long time. 

Q: 25 years.

A: You still maintain a pretty good red blood cell count and that's because your system is basically over-acidic, very over-active adrenal glands. You used to have over-active adrenal glands. I can see that your ovaries at one time had been very over-active. Now, everything's under-active. The only thing that looks like it's still over-active is your right parathyroids. Do you have your tonsils?

Q: No.

A: I'll use this end instead. Say ah. Put your tongue out. Say ah.

Q: Ah.

A: Definitely scar tissue. It must be lymph glands that are very over-active around in your neck. Do you have swollen glands here? Thyroids basically are not very active. Parathyroids are trying to do the work. You need lots of chicken, lots of beef, a little fish. The fish you need. If you don't have any beef, you need to eat a little bit. Let's say for five to six bites of red meat, you need one bite of fish to help rebalance you because you're over-acidic and you're not going to have a taste for it and you won't digest very well. Because you're low in all kinds of digestive bacterias, it would be easier for you to eat... If you eat, it's very restrictive, but more monomeals, like meat with maybe a little sauce, like a salsa sauce, so it's not confusing your digestion too much. That's a problem with vegetarians that I've seen over the years. They lose so many digestive enzymes and so many digestive abilities that they have to reduce everything to monomeals, and you're definitely in that category. So I would say if you're going to have a smoothie, have two or three eggs with only maybe two or three ounces of cream.

Q: I can't digest the eggs very well. I've always been trying to do it with clabbered milk.

A: Just clabbered milk and eggs?

Q: Yeah, I tried a little half of a third of a banana just for flavor, but I've also done it without that. I still have trouble with it.

A: Well, I don't want you to have the milk. I want you to just have the cream.

Q: Okay.

A: Two ounces of cream with three eggs and some honey. Now, sometimes you have a reaction with the honey with that mixture. Usually it doesn't happen because two ounces of raw cream prevents that, and you can utilize the honey. Pardon?

Q: Can you have problems with the honey?

A: Well, you're having it with enough fats. There's enough fats in the egg and all of that.

Q: Can I have coconut cream?

A: Pardon?

Q: Coconut cream?

A: Coconut cream is fine. I prefer cow's cream for your system. The coconut cream is better than nothing, better than no rich fat. Because your body has so many advanced glycation end products in it, you have yeast growing in everything, even in your bones. You're going to have a reaction when it comes out of your skin. So, what I suggest that you do is, and this is a great moisturizer for everybody who would like to help their skin, and when toxins pass through the skin, take three and a half ounces of cream, juice ginger to get one tablespoon. That's one tablespoon to three and a half ounces of raw cream. Blend that for about ten seconds and put it on your skin. If you have good thick cream, then it will whip into a whipped cream, and it's just like putting a cosmetic cream on. It's very nice. If it isn't a thick cream, then it will not whip, and it's still good. It doesn't go as far. And then I would put that on your skin so that when you have that, when your body's... The honey does not create a candida, an environment for candida. Honey helps detoxify the yeast that are candida. Get rid of them. So, as they pass through, you have the itchy and the flaky and the dryness resulting from it. So, if you have enough fats with it, like you have that many eggs, three eggs with two ounces of cream, and you're just having a little honey, you know, when it comes out, it's not going to drive you crazy. And I would suggest that when raw butter is available, you eat a stick a day. You just need everything lubricated and stabilized. And then eat lots of chicken, you know. When it comes to that, lots of chicken and beef. And just a little bit of fish just to keep you alkalinized. And I thought that I would even... If I were you, I would suggest that you, even with chicken, have, you know, a little piece of fish with it, just to make sure you don't get too acid. You also have lots of metal toxicity in your sinuses and throat. Nasal bones. Bronchial. So, I recommend that your juice be 70% celery, 20% parsley, and 10% zucchini or yellow squash.

[audio cut]

A: The time span that I've given you, whether it was six weeks to 18 months, you can add about 10% kale juice in it to help get rid of the bile. But make sure that you stabilize as long as I suggested before you do that. And you have lots of bile everywhere, too. So, I would suggest you stabilize before you start removing that bile.

Q: So, by stabilizing what you just recommended.

A: Yeah. And, you know, like I say, when the butter comes out and cream comes out, I would consume a lot of it. And I would gain a lot of weight and then take it off and gain a lot and take it off. The reason I'm saying this is because I've seen situations like that, like yours, go into lupus. And lupus is so difficult, you know. You can't lift anything, you can't touch anything. 

Q: I've had arthritis.

A: Yeah.

Q: That's related to what you're talking about.

A: Well, it's one more stage toward that. When that starts happening between, you know, in the connective tissues, it's swelling, everything's so sensitive, you can't pick up anything, you can't touch things, you can't even do your clothes very easily. There's different stages of it. So, at some point you're going to need lots of bacteria. From what you said and suggested, use green bacteria molds or berry molds for a very, very long time, maybe three or four years. Just need bacterias for a while. If you do do those, it could throw you into lupus. So, I don't suggest that you do those. And I recommend that you do ten to twelve eggs a day when you can utilize them properly. So, you work up to that when you can do it. Even if it takes a year and a half. Do you like red bell peppers?

Q: Uh-huh.

A: Okay. Have that, make it kind of a sauce with cheese, cream. You may have a lot of trouble with milk at first.

Q: Well, it's clabbered milk.

A: Are you able to handle the clabbered milk?

Q: Yes, surprisingly.

A: But not with the egg.

Q: Well, it's not the milk, it's the egg that's [unintelligible].

A: Yeah, but it's the combination. So, why don't you have the cream or the egg. You could blend egg, red bell pepper, and a little cheese to make a sauce for your meats.

Q: Okay. How about the feta? Is that raw? Is it actually raw goat feta? Is that good? Is that too salty?

A: It's too salty. Too salty. Salt for you is absolute poison. And when you can get honey in the comb, eat the wax, except for the sheet in between. Scrape the wax off and eat it, because the wax will help stabilize and protect your kidneys. Kidneys are very exposed, very vulnerable. You see how I did it? Pineapple is likely to make you very irritable, even if you have a little bit. So, I would say that if you're in a grocery, or when you go into like a store that may have a few pieces of pineapple, you know, out, you just buy a couple of pieces. You know, like two pieces only. And little, you know, squares or wedges of them. And maybe twice a week have that. But no more than that. And always eat it with an egg and some cheese. Even if you just down the egg Rocky style and then eat the cheese and the pineapple together. Okay, do you have any questions?

Q: I don't know, I'm overwhelmed. I can't be here overwhelmed anymore. The fragility, is that how I did it today?

A: The what?

Q: The fragility, the emotional fragility.

A: Yeah, that's because you have no fats in your system, no protection, you have all those sugars. So, you can have glycation end products stored everywhere.

Q: And I don't eat sugar.

A: Carbohydrates.

Q: Not much, I don't eat much.

A: Grains, breads, all that for over the years.

Q: Yeah, so from the past.

A: Yeah, definitely. And you're just so fat deficient, you have no protection anywhere. And you have all these yeasts feeding on the advanced glycation end products. And so just, you're exposed to all those acids, so they'll irritate your nervous system all the time. That's why I say, when you can get that cream and butter, just start drinking that stuff.

Q: Proteins, you know, I have all these things in my mind, but we've learned over the years that protein is hard on your kidneys. 

A: It is when it's cooked.

Q: When it's cooked.

A: Yeah, just remember that those things that damage the kidney are the lipid peroxides and the heterocyclic amines that irritate and damage the kidneys. Those are only formed from cooking, not from raw. The easiest way to stabilize your kidneys is to eat meat, especially red meat and chicken. 

Q: How is eating vegetables like broccoli or zucchini, any of that stuff?

A: No, because they create resins that will block the system and turn into plastic, basically.

Q: That's not good.

A: Yeah. It's in the book, so if you get to that...

Q: I read it, I just can't remember it.

A: All right.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. I'm going to have to get some more milk. Oh, no, I've got some here. Never mind. I drank that hours ago.

Q: We'll get some more milk for you.

A: Oh, that's it. Okay. I looked for some more juice, but that's all I got. Okay, who's next?

Q: I guess I'll go.

A: All right. Can we have a fight here? I'd like to see some action. Turn around this way.

Q: Lance.

A: Lance, okay. Okay, Lance, your testes are very overactive. If you don't have a partner, enjoy yourself. Because they will make you very anxious and unsettled. There are certain types of fat that you're not digesting properly. So it's causing your inability to use minerals and proteins together. So it's causing a buckling of the tendons, tightening of them, tightening of everything. Coconut would be very helpful to dissolve some of the hardened matter. Coconut cream, whole coconut too. And you have heavy metal toxicity in your shoulders and your neck. And your spine. Looks like a little bit in your pancreas. Your thyroid, your left thyroid, looks like it's very toxic, doesn't work very well. It looks stable. It looks like the tissues were all there. It doesn't look debilitated, but it's not functioning. The parathyroids are working overtime. They're very overactive, compensating for it. Looks like the tonsils are gone, but the lymph glands are working very well in your neck. Did you have your tonsils removed?

Q: No.

A: It's completely flat here. See, this one looks like it's here. Tonsils here, but over here. It's not there. This is probably deteriorated, and this one's fine. I always like to check this one. Wow. The left one is amazing, I mean the right one's amazing. The left one is almost all deteriorated. About 75% deteriorated. The other one's nice and full and clean. Parathyroids on the right side, very active, overactive, compensating for the low activity of the right side of the thyroid. I think you should have the coconut cream as a regular thing, probably 12 ounces a week, and you should have them with your meats. So, do more like the, you know, you'd be good in the Polynesians, you know, the South Pacific, because they have coconut cream with almost all their meats. But do not have the lime juice with it, unless it's fish or chicken. Do not with the red meat. But I suggest you have coconut cream, even if it's only a tablespoon every time you eat meat. Oh, and everybody, try to work up to a minimum of a pound of meat a day. I didn't tell people that. Try to get a pound of meat in a day, work up to it. And it's best if you don't try to do it all at one time. Some people, yes, most people, no. I'm going to suggest, I usually don't suggest it, but I'd like you to eat one salad a week, and have it as the last meal in the day, with some vegetable juice, so that no other food comes in for, you know, five to eight hours after you've eaten it.

Q: Yeah.

A: Are you a teacher?

Q: No, I'm just a metal worker.

A: So that's why all that metal poisoning, too. Be a great teacher.

Q: Well, I'm a shop foreman now, so I am teaching to a certain extent.

A: You have to go into teaching. Be very good at it. Enjoy it. Teach shop. You need to eat a lot of shellfish. Probably the only way you're going to get that metal toxicity out of your system. Oysters, clams, urchin, scallops, and have it with some kind of a tomato sauce, with some, you know, tomato and, and tomato lime juice and coconut cream.

Q: Sounds good.

A: That's not mine. That's a Polynesian recipe. I got it in Bora Bora. But it would be very good for when you need to remove some of that toxicity. I recommend that you have about a quart and a half of milk a day. Butter when it becomes available, about a quarter of a stick. A day.

Q: You said a quart and a half of milk?

A: Yeah. And a quart of vegetable juice. You could even have five cups a day. Sometimes, you know, when it gets hotter.

Q: Yeah.

A: Especially if you're in a metal shop. It's really hot and steamy in there. You can go up to six cups if it gets, you know, because you need all that, you know, all those vitamins and minerals and enzymes that you can get.

Q: Yeah.

A: And I would start, you know, taking some of the Spectrum Natural olive oil and rub it into your hands several times a day. You know, and before you put it on, take, you know, a towel, clean towel, and wipe it off and then put it back on so you're not absorbing a lot of that here. And, of course, if you're, you know, shaving and grinding, you need to wear a mask.

Q: Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've been doing that these days.

A: Good.

Q: I didn't use to do those precautions.

A: Now that you're getting older, you know.

Q: Yeah. Feedback's apparent now.

A: Mm-hmm. I'm just going to say this about your relationships. Don't take your teaching nature into relationships, okay?

Q: Yeah.

A: You know, if you're the martyr in the relationship, you're never going to be happy. So if you have an affinity to try to fix your relationships, fix the other person, and then you'll always be the one thinking that you're giving and not receiving. But you set yourself up for that if you do that, okay? And that seems to be a pretty important thing to you.

Q: Yeah.

A: Just how, you know, how you communicate in your relationships.

Q: Yeah, it is important, yeah.

A: So I would say, you know, don't be the martyr, don't be the teacher.

Q: Yeah.

A: Just be a sharer.

Q: Mm-hmm.

A: You know, all my experience is this. You know, you have to do what's right for you. It'll be fine.

Q: Okay.

A: Cheese is something you should have at least a brick a week.

Q: If I start eating any cheese at all, I find myself binging on it. It's a brick at a time.

A: But that's because you're going for the cheese like that. I was just going to say, if you grate some with your meat, you know, then that'll be fine. Yeah. That's not necessarily a bad thing because you just need a lot in there to chelate the toxicity that dumps into the stomach.

Q: Yeah.

A: But binging on it is probably not a good balanced diet for you.

Q: No, it's not.

A: So if you shave it off and have it with your food, then you'll be able to eat more meat by, you know, by grating your cheese on it.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: But just let that be the condiment. On your food to encourage you to eat more food but not cheese. And even taste better that way.

Q: Mm-hmm.

A: Okay, any more questions?

Q: Well, I have this horrendous problem going on with, I guess it's candida, and, of course, kind of going along with that is a craving, endless craving for fruit, which I keep fluctuating. It's like I get it reduced down really small, and then pretty soon it's like I'm consuming a lot again, you know, and it's like I just have not been able to get out of that cycle.

A: Well, it doesn't look like you have a real candida problem. It looks like you have dryness everywhere.

Q: I have a lot of gas is the problem. And then when there's a lot of gas, there's a lot of pain.

A: Right.

Q: So I keep myself lubricated with fats.

A: That's the way you need to go about it. Eggs and the cream, coconut cream.

Q: So what was it you said, how many ounces of cream a day? Can I think of coconut?

A: Well, 12 a week. 12 a week. Minimum.

Q: Okay.

A: So you divide that up.

Q: Yeah. Okay, great.

A: That's minimum.

Q: Okay. Thanks.

A: You're welcome.

Q: Any particular veggie juice combination for him?

A: For him?

Q: Yeah.

A: I thought I said 70% celery, 20% parsley, and 10% zucchini or yellow squash.

Q: Okay.

A: Didn't I say that?

Q: No.

A: Okay.

Q: Question on the coconut cream.

A: Yes.

Q: How do the Polynesians make that?

A: Well, if it's a young coconut, they just scoop it out and then wring it through a cloth.

Q: That's why it's so pulpy. If the coconut we get are so hard.

A: Yeah, but if they take an old mature coconut, they call it, they grate it and then wring it.

Q: Like through a cloth?

A: Yeah. Like a muslin cloth.

Q: And if a coconut has started to rot a little bit, is it still good?

A: Yeah.

Q: There's so many of the ones we get around here at the farm.

A: Yeah. All of this, two that I made today, I let some go yellow. Will start the fermentation and rotting process. Because I used to eat, I loved coconut as a child, but it was always steamed. You know, so I need to clean a lot of that out. So every once in a while I'll eat some rotten coconut to help cleanse it. But the Mayans and the Aztecs used spoiled coconut to help bowel problems and digestive problems.

Q: It ferments, doesn't it?

A: Well, there's not a lot of sugar in it. It's mostly fats. It's not necessarily a fermentation. There is some sugar that will ferment in it, but it starts breaking down the fats, creating a bacteria in it. And that's what will help the intestines.

Q: How do you determine how much clabbered milk [unintelligible]

A: That's going to vary, but I would suggest that you have a quart a day.

Q: It won't congest me? Because I am always congested.

A: You're going to have that because you're so dry.

Q: I know.

A: Yeah. If you had the cream to drink, you know, everything would just relax everywhere. Yeah. Yeah. Definitely. You know, if you buy extra milk and just suck the cream off the top of the straw like I do, because I need the cream. I have to. I have to have it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Claravale. Raw milk.

Q: [unintelligible] All of that's pasteurized?

A: All of that's pasteurized.

Q: So they separate it, they pasteurize it separately, then they combine it back together. That's why the cream is at the top.

Q: So the only thing we can find in this county is raw cheese.

Q: Claravale milk.

A: Yes.

Q: We have to go to Sacramento.

Q: Oh, really?

A: Yeah, but you can, you know.

Q: One person drives to Sacramento each week.

A: Yeah, but you don't have to go there every week because, you know, milk, they say you leave it in the refrigerator and you leave it out to clabber. I keep milk up to, you know, three weeks at a time. You know, it's not a problem. In fact, the more spoiled the better.

Q: I need to go. Can I?

A: Yes. Your name again?

Q: Sandra.

A: Sandra. Okay. Relax. Okay. Very overactive sex glands, Sandra. You're a naughty girl.

Q: I've been active for a long time.

A: They are active. It's just they're making up for the low adrenals that you have. This adrenal gland doesn't look like it's working at all. This one looks like it's working a little bit, but it can't keep up. So you're substituting your sex hormones for your absence of adrenaline. Very low thyroid on this side. Parathyroid is fine. The glands in your throat are good. Here also. The thyroid's shape is okay, but it's not producing well. Parathyroid on the right side is very overactive again. So you have hypothyroidism. I'm not a doctor. I can't diagnose, but this is what it looks like in hypothyroidism. Pancreas looks debilitated over here. Probably 25% active on that side and maybe 20% active on this side. This side's drying up and debilitating more than this side. This side's more edemic. This ovary is starting to debilitate a bit. Very toxic minerals in it. And on the right. More on the right. Lots of toxic minerals stored in the sinuses. Do you get headaches?

Q: No, but I have a chronic post-nasal drip.

A: Surprised you don't have migraines with that one.

Q: No, I don't get headaches usually.

A: You're very fortunate. Usually when I see this condition, people have either migraines or cluster headaches.

Q: So there's toxic minerals there?

A: Toxic metals.

Q: Oh, metals.

A: It's a concentration like it could be mercury from fillings. It's a little bit more than that because it goes so high up. It's mainly on the left side. 

Q: Yeah, it's the left side.

A: Intestines, lots of scarring in the intestines. Lots of advanced glycation end products stored in there. Worse on the right side than the left. Even the good kidney on the left kidney is full of scar tissue and fatty deposits. Red blood cell count is okay. Circulation, blood temperature. Blood pressure seems like it's okay, but blood temperature is low.

Q: Well, I'm usually very hot. I don't know if that has anything to do with it, but I'm going through menopause. I'm hot all the time.

A: Are you getting hot flashes?

Q: Yeah, but they're not as often as before. I'm still having them, but still I'm always hot in the summer or even before the summer time.

A: And in the winter?

Q: I'm hot and warm. You know, I don't get cold. I don't get cold.

A: So this is just something that's happening right now?

Q: I'm not feeling cold. I'm warm most of the time. Too warm. Sweat a lot.

A: I guess your hands are working as a radiator.

Q: They are. What about the rest of my body?

A: It's very warm. Your hands are just ice cold. My feet do that for me. So the red blood cells look like you're carrying oxygen well. Everything is fine. You're not digesting fats well at all.

Q: So how could you, I eat so much fats if I don't digest that. I mean, you would recommend fats, a lot of fats.

A: Well, if you're eating raw fats, you need proteins to digest them. You're not assimilating the proteins that you've been eating to utilize your fats properly. Once you start eating the right raw fats, you'll be able to digest the fats that you are eating. And then I would say stabilize for about three and a half months before you go on the detox program. 

Q: Three and a half months.

A: Yeah. It doesn't mean you'll gain more. You'll probably lose some. But I don't want you to lose a lot. I'm going to recommend six to eight eggs a day.

Q: Before I do that, what about my liver?

A: Your liver isn't in great shape.

Q: It isn't?

A: No. It has scarring in it. It has some rupturing in it, hemorrhaging in it.

Q: Any mineral deficiencies?

A: Well, you have all of your, you're mainly deficient in all of your minerals. Because you've eaten so many cauterized from cooked foods. So you're deficient in all minerals. And that's what the juice will help you with. I'm going to recommend that you have 10% kale juice, 80% celery, and 10% parsley. That should help stimulate your adrenal glands a little bit better and bring your body temperature down a bit. If you're going through heat prostration in the summer, have a half of a grapefruit with some coconut cream. About three ounces of coconut cream. And that will help the heat prostration. I recommend that you try to eat 12 ounces of meat a day. And then do a period of about a year and three months work up to a pound. Various meats. You need a lot of red meat at first. I'd say 75% red meat and 25% white. Split that up however you want to fish your chicken. And then after about 18 months, then you can lower the amount of red meat, increase the amount of white meat. Not that much, maybe only 5%. You can eat red meat for a long time. Lots of red meat. That juice I would take for about seven weeks. Then eliminate the kale juice and add 10% more parsley for another three weeks. And then lower the celery to 60% or 70% and have 10% zucchini or summer squash and 20% parsley. One day a week, substitute your one cup of regular juice, one cup of the quart, for one whole cup of white cabbage. Vericose veins are present. 

Q: Straight one cup of cabbage?

A: No, don't drink it all at one time. You might have a lot of gas from it. So just sip it. Have it all at one time, but sip it over a 20 minute period. Not mixed with anything else. Some almost thrombotic type reactions going on in your body with the vericose veins. And it's a severe vitamin K and U deficiency. And the cabbage will help bring it back. But you need it in a concentrated amount one day a week. Probably in about two or three years down the line you could incorporate it into your juice on a daily basis. But right now you don't want to start detoxing those toxins right now. You want to concentrate on that. A lubrication formula at the top of page 163, when the butter is available, have that.

Q: How often?

A: With the last meal before your last juice in the day. You could have it with your fish meal, with fish or chicken.

Q: Once a day?

A: In the evening, yeah, have it in the evening. Only once a day, yeah. All right, last meat meal. Okay, do you have any questions?

Q: Yeah, so what about eggs and milk?

A: Well, I said you need about six to eight eggs a day. Milk, you know, as much as you like. You would do better by clabbering it because you're very low in enzymes in the intestinal tract. And the clabbering will help take care of pre-digesting it for you.

Q: Okay. You said eggs, you said meat, you said juice. What about honey?

A: Have that as you like it.

Q: Okay. And fruit, you didn't mention fruit.

A: Oh, I didn't. Because even though your pancreas is working, you've got varicose veins and thrombosis type, developing thrombosis. And the fruit will cause more swelling and rupturing. So I really suggest that you limit the fruit if you're going to have it.

Q: What about pineapple?

A: If you're going to have small amounts. Let's say you had a quarter-inch circular slice. Half of that, you know, once a day with cheese or cream or something like that would be okay.

Q: Okay.

A: But I wouldn't have it every day, I'd have it every other day. Otherwise you're going to have swelling there and any swelling is going to cause rupturing. And more of a development of that in maybe a couple of years.

Q: Okay. Thank you.

A: I'm giving everybody what I see as the optimal for them. You do what you're going to do.

Q: May I be next?

A: Pardon?

Q: May I be next? I've got to go soon.

A: I'm sorry. How many do I have yet to do? 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Okay. Lorraine. Did I pronounce it correctly? Lorraine?

Q: Uh-huh.

A: Boy, what an artist you are. Some control issues there.

Q: Probably.

A: What do you mean probably.

[laughter]

A: The left ovary is debilitating a little bit, shrinking. The right is okay, fine. The adrenal glands are normal. I would expect them to be very overactive. You know, it's as thin as you are, but... They're not. The left side of the pancreas is almost completely debilitated, less than probably 5% functional on the left side. Right side, maybe 10% to 15% functional, mostly debilitated. So, it looks like a diabetic type pancreas. So, fruit, I would say, only if you absolutely have to. Blood cell count is very good, excellent. So, concentrate on maybe 50% red meat for a while till the liver is rebuilt. Got a lot of blood going into the liver. Yeah, usually it means that the liver is needing a lot of nutrients, you know, a good supply of nutrients. It also usually means that you're producing a lot of bile, and using bile in place of good fats. Which irritate and break down the system. I can recommend that you have your carbohydrate rather than in fruit juice. You have 10% carrot juice as part of your juice. So, 10% carrot juice, 70% celery, and 20% parsley. Now, you're also going to have, you know, a huge amount of bile come out through your skin, and you're going to get very yellow and green and brown at times. Thyroid seems to be very good. Both parathyroids are very low. Not very active at all. The tonsil on the left side looks okay. The right side, it's debilitated. Do you have your tonsils?

Q: Uh-huh.

A: Do you get sore throats on the right side at all, earaches on the right?

Q: Not really.

A: It's very unusual with this pattern here. Well, now that you're getting good food, you might start having, cleaning out those areas because it's very debilitated. And the parathyroids on the right side are very debilitated and toxic. You have the appearance of arthritis developing in the joints. Kidney is fat congested. That's just the left kidney. The right kidney looks like it's not functioning. The end of it. So, I recommend the honeycomb for you too, eating the wax with the honey to help. At least a quart of clabbered milk a day. About, six to ten eggs a day. I recommend four of them Rocky style. That's a recommendation.

Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

A: You know, a lot of people would have your feeling about that. Usually, they poke a hole in both ends and then suck a little out at a time. It's easier to eat that way. Sometimes, somebody has your kind of repulsion. If they have the whole egg and try to eat it, they can't get it down. Like, let's come back up. So, you just take a little bit at a time.

Q: Okay.

A: It's easier. And if you don't have to look at the whole globby mess and it's inside the egg and you're sucking it, you never get to see the egg. It's easier.

Q: Okay.

A: As you say, artistic and visual.

Q: I think that would be harder to do it that way.

A: I don't think so.

Q: Huh.

A: Give it a try and see.

Q: Okay.

A: Coconut cream is going to be very important to help get rid of this joint toxicity that you have. It could develop into the arthritis.

Q: I do a lot of that.

A: Pardon?

Q: I do a lot of that.

A: Okay. And also, eat some whole coconut. Circulation is good. No real congestion too much anywhere. Let me see your eyes. Hmm. You have scarring in your muscles. Were you a dancer, athlete at all?

Q: Active kid.

A: Yeah. And your lymph system is pretty clogged.

Q: I know that.

A: I would suggest, as I suggested for one other person, a few slivers of pineapple twice a week for you. Two, just a couple of them to help break down that lymph congestion. Coconut cream will help with that a lot. So when you have the pineapple, have the coconut cream and the pineapple together. And I suggest that you have that with some chicken or fish or even beef once a week. One of the times that you have the two wedges or pieces of pineapple with coconut, one time either with chicken preferably and another time with beef. Chicken, you have a hard time with chicken, I can tell.

Q: I haven't even begun to get there yet.

A: I recommend at least four cups of juice a day, a quarter a day, probably more. You're going to need a little bit of water, probably a half a cup a day. I hope that's not his stomach. That's what?

Q: His painter.

A: Oh.

Q: His vibrator.

Q: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: I like that joke.

Q: What about my lungs?

A: Yeah. You're not in real good shape. There's a green cast to it, almost like there's some gangrene. And I haven't brought it up because I'm still trying to figure out what it's from.

Q: Well, I have smoked off and on for ten years, various things.

A: Like marijuana and crack?

Q: Well, not like crack, but marijuana, DMT, cigarettes, you know.

A: Well, the only way I can...

[audio cut, same persons reading]

Q: Okay.

A: It's the tissue that will substitute there better, unless...

Q: Well, I'm getting better.

A: The lungs. Oh, really?

Q: Yes.

A: Oh, really? Don't make a big difference. I was a heavy smoker. I smoked two packs a day of Lucky Strike, no filtered. And I smoked them down to the very end. I would burn my fingers. My mother called me a fiend. And I started about 13 years old, so I was 24. It was the hardest thing for me to give up. My lungs were still full of scar tissue, my bronchioles. I had some lung of a buffalo last week, actually on Tuesday, when I arrived. And I took the milk and blended it with it with a little teaspoon of salsa. It was the best gland I've ever had, with that salsa. And it was delicious. The next day, I had it that night. And the next day, I felt like I was absorbing and utilizing all of the oxygen I was breathing. And I haven't felt that since...probably never.

Q: Okay.

A: So, it's really delicious. And he brought some. He brought some to this. They're gorgeous. They're pink and lavender and, you know, mauve. And a beautiful gland. It's the most beautiful gland in a healthy animal.

Q: He didn't smoke.

A: Maybe it's parents' smoked. Yeah, so, you know, eating lung and chicken is the best way to remedy that. Yeah. That usually means two or three spells of pneumonia in your lifetime. That kind of gangrenous look.

Q: I had, like, pleurisy-type thing once, when I was little.

A: And you probably took antibiotics to prevent it.

Q: I think I only had antibiotics once, maybe once in my life.

A: Fortunate. Wow. Well, then, probably those three times won't be so traumatic.

Q: Okay.

A: Do you have any questions?

Q: I don't think so.

A: Okay, good.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. I'm going to tell you a little incident about... Everybody knows what multiple myeloma is. Yeah. It's cancer of the blood and bones, what I had. Point zero... I just looked at the statistics a month ago. The survival rate is .0001. Survival rate. Okay. That's what I had. I had a client about a year and a half ago that was in fourth stage. She had been in that for four years, or had been diagnosed after four years. Had had lots of medical treatment. Was on her deathbed. Had not been out of the bed in about a year and a half, two years, something like that. She had had pneumonia two times before I saw her in the six weeks before I saw her. She didn't tell me that, and I told her that she was probably going to have to go through pneumonia because it was a condition I saw in the lungs, the lungs were in, the bronchioles. And she said, well, I just went through it twice in the last six weeks. And she said, if I hadn't have gone to the hospital, I would have died. And I said, that's your belief. I said, but if you go through, if you'll bear with it, and even though you think you're going to die, say it's okay to die. Take your chances, because your only shot is to get through it and get well. And if you take the antibiotics and stop it, there's no progression toward well. There's only more convalescing. So, and I said, you're already in bed. How would you not like to be able to talk or breathe without a respirator? I said, and that's the way you go every time you stop pneumonia or bronchitis, any of them. So, sure enough, ten days later, she got pneumonia. And it was do or die. She was going to get through it. And there were moments during the night time when it usually hits the worst, when the nervous system is detoxing, that she just thought she wasn't going to be able to take another breath, and that was it, and she was going to die. She got through it in three days and was out of the bed the first time in... It was a year and a half, two years. And everybody was all around her, freaking her out, scaring her, but she stayed strong and got through it. Okay, next.

Q: Hi, I'm Gordon.

A: Gordon. Hi, Gordon. Okay, very overactive sex glands. Very overactive. Okay. Adrenals are pretty normal. The right one is a little overactive. There's fatigue in both of them right now. The pancreas, the left side, is about 90% debilitated. A little bit of inflammation. A little bit of edema. The right side is about 15% active with edema and inflammation. I would treat yourself as if you were diabetic and have very little fruit, once maybe every four or five days. Four days is probably about right. You do need a little fruit, so probably every four days would be best.

Q: Any particular recommendations on that?

A: You need some kiwi when you can get it. Berries, very good for you. Any of the berries. Strawberries, not as much, but raspberries, mulberries, blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries, any of those. And when you have them, have a little cheese before you start eating them. Have some with coconut cream, other creams, milk, avocado once in a while. The liver is not in good shape. Storing bile throughout the system. Thyroid glands are both good. Parathyroids are good. The glands in your throat look like they are very good. Well, the right one is, the left one is okay. Circulation on the left side of your spine isn't that great. Okay. Some kind of stomach problem. Looks like probably 60% of the stomach is scar tissue in the duodenum.

Q: Where would that come from?

A: Probably your body not manufacturing mucus properly to coat the stomach and the acids and compounds from eating away at the stomach and just kept getting scarred, scarred, and scarred over the years. Any questions? I recommend that you have about 70% red meat, 30% white, for maybe six years.

Q: Okay.

A: You have some very toxic compounds in your sinuses.

Q: Long-term exposure or more immediate?

A: This is very long-term.

Q: Okay.

A: But it could be also present because it looks like it's active right now or it's coming out.

Q: Any particular compounds you can identify?

A: Well, it looks red in your system. And as it lodges in the tissues, it's causing a green and purple.

Q: Now this is independent. I throw some carrots and some beets sometimes in my juice mix. Does that coloration you're seeing is independent of that coloration?

A: No, no. That's not toxic. Unless it's pulling out some metal toxicity.

Q: Hmm.

A: You have just a lot of fat congestion everywhere.

Q: Hmm.

A: So it isn't that you don't have good fat digestion. You have, I mean, you don't have bad fat digestion. You have bad fat assimilization and utilization. I would suggest that you drink your urine after a meat meal twice a week.

Q: Midstream or full?

A: Full. About 10, 15 minutes after you eat meat, I suggest you have about a tablespoon of honey. 

Q: That's any kind of meat, red or white?

A: Yeah, any kind. You have some good instincts going with the beet juice. I usually don't recommend beet juice because it cuts down bacteria levels. But if you mix some beet juice with some coconut cream, at the time you're going to drink it, not pre-mix it. And that would be like a teaspoon of beet juice to about three tablespoons of coconut cream. And you have that with either chicken or beef, I mean chicken or fish. That will help you utilize the fats properly and to break those down that didn't get utilized properly.

Q: Specifically coconut cream rather than milk cream?

A: Yes. You will not have the same reaction of beet juices with cow's cream. I suggest maybe five, six cups of milk a day, preferably clabbered. You need lots of high meats, high fish. Clabbered milk, you need lots of bacteria. Usually when I see this kind of, there's a lot of depression involved. And that's because bacteria levels are low. Not all the bacterias but just certain ones. And they're mainly for fats. So fish is a good high fat that can grow a lot of bacteria in it quickly. Chicken also because the oil is permeated in them. It isn't sectioned off in marbling. So those two high meats would be preferable for you. At least a quart of juice a day. 80% celery, 20% parsley. But per quart use a half of a small lemon or lime. Juice the rind and all. That's what I was going to say. When you're on the detox routine, add a third of a lemon or lime per quart rind and all and help you lose the weight quicker.

Q: Per quart of...

A: Vegetable juice.

Q: Okay.

A: You juice it with the rest of the vegetables.

Q: When you're on the lose weight side of the diet.

A: Lose weight cycle, yeah.

Q: Oh, wow. Per quart you said?

A: Yes, per quart. Yeah. Yours is more. And you have it at all cycles, you know, for about six months. There's some days you can take off if you don't want it, you know, but five days a week. I would say you need six eggs a week with red meat. So two eggs at a time with some red meat. So three meat meals a week of red meat. A little steak tartare there. Red onion would be very good for you.

Q: I've had an allergy or an intolerance to red onion. It can make me very ill.

A: To what extent?

Q: I get first a burning sensation. Then all my energy drops out. I become very, very weak.

A: For how long?

Q: If I get a piece the size of my fingernail, it can knock me out for a day, maybe two. Red is the worst for me.

A: And with what? Were you eating it? 

Q: It depends if I have any form from... If it hasn't been cooked... If it was cooked early, I don't have as much reaction. But raw, in any form, any place I would get a raw, it wouldn't matter what it was with, as far as I know. I mean, I haven't tried, I haven't experimented with different things. But, for example, in a salad or just by itself.

A: Look here.

Q: In fact, I avoid any kind of onion or anything in the family. Scallions, white, whatever. How about garlic? I can tolerate garlic.

A: But it doesn't do the same. We'll just have to, I'll just have to skip that then, because you do have a blood problem with that acid.

Q: Yeah.

A: Trying to see if there's something else that can do the same thing. Have you ever tried just a little bit with raw cheese?

Q: I've never tried it. I'd be willing to try it once.

A: Okay.

Q: On a day when I know I'm not going to have to go to work.

A: Okay. Do that. What I'd like you to do is only take a section about like this. I mean a piece. You know, a square like that.

Q: A little bit.

A: Okay. And use this much cheese and blend it with an egg.

Q: Okay.

A: Blend it all together and see if you have a reaction.

Q: Can I just have it with a fork?

A: Oh no, you need to blend that. Because you need those acids that you're having a problem with in your blood. Because it's in your blood that it's happening. And that's why it's fatiguing you. For some reason it's causing your red blood cells to rupture. Like, it's almost like that sickle cell anemia. It's almost identical to that. Which maybe you have some black heritage there.

Q: I don't think so. Not that I know of.

A: Right. Anyway, it's not identical to that, but it's similar to that.

Q: Right.

A: And that's the reaction you're getting from. So if you mix it with that and then eat it with some meat and you don't have a reaction, it'll be fine. But you need all of those acids absorbed into the cheese and the egg fats. So that it cannot get loose into your system easily. So it'll already be bound and arrested in fat.

Q: I'll give it a try.

A: Okay. I'd like you to call me and let me know.

Q: Okay. Sure. I'll try to do it sometime in the next month.

A: Okay. That's a big risk factor. Yeah. Yeah. Because all you need is just a little amount like that about every two weeks.

Q: Okay.

A: Like a medicine. We'll try to get the medicine to where it doesn't cause the side effect.

Q: Right.

A: Cream will not do it. It has to be cheese.

Q: Okay.

A: Cheese and egg.

Q: So I don't take any cow cream at all?

A: You can, but I mean with that onion.

Q: That thing is cheese.

A: It's cheese and egg.

Q: Okay. Right.

A: For a meat sauce. I didn't describe it. I showed you a thumb size, my thumb size. So it's like maybe two of your first joint of your thumb, that much cheese. Blended with one egg. And a one quarter inch by one quarter inch cube of one thin slice of onion, red onion. Now you say it happens with the red onion but not the yellow and white?

Q: Red is the worst. The next would be white. The next would be yellow. And the least would be scallions, although I still react. But it's more in that order.

Q: How about chives?

Q: Chives, again, I can tolerate in very small quantities. If I get a few, it's okay.

A: Well, do it with the yellow onion.

Q: Okay.

Q: How about leeks?

Q: Again, very tiny quantities. Too much and it's a problem. Shallots, not, yes. Yeah, we got the point here. Yeah.

A: Also, shellfish would be very good for you.

Q: Okay. I've been eating raw scallops about once a week.

A: Great. Good, good, good. Good instincts. Okay, do you have any questions?

Q: Yes, I do. I have problems with my eyes. I'm kind of an eye strain company with developing farsightedness, but I also have a serious retinopathy in my right eye. And it's an ongoing problem where I have a slight rupture and the serious fluid leaks behind the retina and creates a bulge. And I'm wondering if there's anything I can specifically do to try to address that.

A: Well, put the egg white in your eye, you know, two times a day. At least once a day, but twice a day would be more helpful. The eyes get nutrients so delayed, you know, and it lasts usually in the cycle of where food goes, chain. So that's why putting it directly in the eye helps.

Q: So that will actually internally affect the retina.

A: Yes, yeah, because it will be absorbed into the white tissues and even under it will be absorbed in the tissue of the eyelids. And then the body can process and utilize it. So if you're feeding it twice a day there, it will help the internal, you know, protein. Red meat, like I said earlier, is important to stabilize the eye condition for some reason. So, you know, eating red meat will help that a lot. Red meat. And if you had red meat and chicken together or red meat and fish together, that would also promote it, you know, the healing of it quicker. Anything else?

Q: I have some cardiac arrhythmia.

A: Look right here. The heart tissue looks fine, but the lymph glands all around the heart is very congested, all the way out to the skin and bones. So it's basically a fat block.

Q: Okay, so it's all related to this.

A: This fat, you know, not utilizing your fat properly.

Q: And the last thing is, on intuition, I've been juicing chard and beet greens along with my juice mix. Any reason why I shouldn't do that?

A: No, as long as they're greens, fine.

Q: That's not a bacterial killer? 

A: Well, the beet root has the high hydrochloric acid in it. And that's what destroys it. The stalk doesn't have that kind of concentration of hydrochloric acid.

Q: What about oxalic acid?

A: You mean in spinach?

Q: Yeah, I'm not juicing spinach.

A: That's not a thing I recommend very often, because that's an antibacterial.

Q: Is that in beets also?

A: Yeah.

Q: Yeah.

Q: But not the chard? Chard, too. For some reason, I'm craving wanting to do it. Should I avoid that instinct?

A: No, no, you'd have to have it in a very large quantity. Chard doesn't have the same reaction like beets do. Okay.

Q: Thank you.

A: And garlic will also have a heavy reaction toward antibacterial, so you should use it as a flavoring. I love garlic, but if I have garlic, my blood pressure shoots up and I can't sleep and I get horny as hell. So I will just take a thin slice and blend it in something and it permeates the flavor and so I feel like I'm eating a lot of it.

Q: What about ginger?

A: Most people, it lowers their blood pressure. Me, it raises mine. Pardon?

Q: How about ginger? Is that also antibacterial?

A: Yes, it is antibacterial. I don't mind using it on the skin very much, but it does help break down certain fats. It is something that you could use once in a while, some ginger. Some people have an allergic reaction to it. The best way to have it, if you're going to have ginger and use it in that way, if you do not have an ill reaction, is to make an ice cream, ginger ice cream. And that's taking one egg, five ounces of cream, one tablespoon of honey, and half a teaspoon of ginger is all it takes.

Q: Ginger juice?

A: Yes, ginger juice.

Q: I put ginger in my juice every day for taste. Is that a good idea? Just a little bit.

A: Yes, you have a lot of fat congestion, definitely, because that's your main problem. Two of you have similarities there.

Q: We both can take ginger.

A: Yeah.

Q: Should I really juice it?

A: No, you need it mixed with those things. Because that could cause an ill reaction.

Q: You just answered one of my questions. It's like probably two months ago, I started consuming a lot of ginger. Now, you just said, it's like, ah-ha, about two months ago, my intestinal problem got a lot worse, you know, the gas problem. So I'm really disturbing an already disturbed population.

A: Environment, yes.

Q: The ginger, eggs, cream, honey mix is what?

A: Yes, all together. You can just make that mix, I mean, it's like an ice cream. If you were to, you know, add a half a teaspoon of carob to that, it would be like gingerbread ice cream. I love that. Delicious. It doesn't even have to be frozen.

Q: Do you add carob?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do you add carob?

A: Yeah, about a half a teaspoon of carob to that. I love gingerbread ice cream. Okay, next. He wants to stay and get as much information as he can get. Michael.

Q: Yes.

A: Overactive sex glands. If you need a partner, play with yourself. Circulation is good all over. Lots of youth hormones. That's why you're reacting so quickly. Usually I don't see this kind of youth hormone except in somebody under 15. You're very fortunate. It's creating so much radiance that I can't see as many of your problems. Severe congestion in your intestines and looks like spleen, lots of scarring in it. There's almost no bacteria in your intestines at all.

Q: I drink almost a gallon of milk a day. Really?

A: It's not going to do anything.

Q: Oh, it's not?

A: Unless it's clabbered. What you need is some good high meat, rotten meat. Rotten chicken would be the best for what you need. Rotten fish and rotten chicken. 

Q: Rotten deer?

A: You could do that. What you might do is take some tripe, some deer intestines and eat that. That will probably reconstitute from that intestinal damage that you had. Probably reconstitute it quicker. Lungs, you've got some damage in the lungs. Heavy metal toxicity in the right lungs and all through the sinuses on the right side. Metal toxicity all through the mucous membranes in the throat up. What were you doing?

Q: You name it.

A: You did everything? Because you have lots of metal toxicity too. Lots of solvents, lots of chemicals, paint. I'm going to recommend that you have 60% celery, 20% zucchini or summer squash and 20% parsley. A third of a lime per quart of juice, rind and all. And a tablespoon and a half of honey with your juice per quart. Were you a smoker? Because the smoking is related to kidney damage. Does your left kidney back here ever give you any soreness?

Q: It used to hurt all the time, not since the diet.

A: Good. When you start getting rid of some of that scar tissue in there, it's going to hurt again.

Q: In my lungs?

A: I'm talking about the kidney right now because the kidney is in pretty bad shape, the left one. If you're going to have fruit, I suggest you have berries. Any kind of berry, cheese, cream, coconut cream, avocado. Avocados, you're not going to digest more than three a week.

Q: Really? I've got to cut back. I love avocados.

A: You need to eat at least a pound of meat a day. Anywhere from 50 to 60% red meat and 40 to 50% white meat. To reconstitute those intestines, you're going to need that fowl.

Q: So I've got to do the bird?

A: Yeah.

Q: I'm ready for your fowl recipe book.

A: The recipe that I gave earlier with the coconut, tomato, and lime juice, coconut cream.

Q: I did that one with the cabbage too.

A: No, no cabbage. Who told you to add cabbage?

Q: I thought I got it from your book, a Polynesian recipe.

A: No, I don't have it. I didn't have it in my book. At least I don't remember putting it in my book. Maybe I did.

Q: What's the Moraya? Iceberg lettuce and tomato?

A: Yeah, iceberg lettuce, not cabbage.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: Cabbage would create gas and all kinds of ill reactions. I don't recommend much lettuce in that. That's a very small amount just diced up in there. Otherwise that will over alkalinize it. Lime, they balance each other when you have a small amount. So did you have chicken that way?

Q: Yeah, it was good. It was very good.

A: So just have more. Anywhere from a quart to two quarts of milk a day. With intestines in that shape, I would say definitely clabbered. Ninety percent of it clabbered. You could use some ginger too because you have some fat clotting. That may have changed. It looks like it's changed since you started the diet, so you won't have any trouble building any more of that. But the ginger will help get rid of the old stuff that's clogged in your system, especially all around the intestines. You have these clots, fat, toxic fat, congestive clots. 

Q: I can see it in my eyes. The little fat rosary beads, they were around the outside.

A: That's lymph. They're moving to the inside. Well, that rosary means that you're at the brink of lymphoma. If that's going away, that's great. Okay. Do you have any questions?

Q: Yeah. Is it okay to put lemon juice on my deer?

A: No.

Q: It's my quick lunch.

A: If you put lemon or lime juice or pineapple with red meat, it will turn it into a pyruvate to be burned as a fuel instead of utilized as a regeneration for regeneration of tissue. 

Q: What if you're about to go do like three hours of intense exercise? What would you eat before you went or during?

A: When I did that for one and a half years of my life when I did some exercise, I ran anywhere from five to 13 miles a day. I did 250 push-ups with my feet at least this high off the ground and then I did 30 to 50 handstand push-ups. That was when I first started eating lots of fats and meats. The first time in my life I felt I could do something. It was hard getting into exercise because I'd never been able to exercise. But when I would do that, I would always suck two eggs before I went.

Q: Now, what's the difference between a blended egg and a sucked egg?

A: When you blend an egg, you mean without anything in it?

Q: If I take three eggs and put them in a blender, then I have it all by itself.

A: You oxidize some very important proteins that can no longer be utilized properly.

Q: When it's blended?

A: Yes, when it's blended. If you have cream in it, coconut cream, milk, it coats the proteins so that they don't oxidize. And if you're blending it in a small container where there's not much air, it'll even reduce it more.

Q: You can get it right away and still oxidize?

A: The oxidizing is when the air passes into it.

Q: So it's better not to put it in a blender then?

A: Correct.

Q: How can you tell somebody has a really poor constitution?

A: Poor constitution? Well, it depends on where and how.

Q: Like many years ago, I had somebody look into my eyes and he said that I have serious problems and I also have bad genetics. So I guess I was wondering if that's something you can see.

A: Well, yeah, when I take a look at you, I can see the degree of debilitation in your system. Now, let's say your eyes are supposed to be blue or green and they're brown and you were born that way, that means that you came in with a poor constitution. If you came in with lesions or scar tissue, that means you came in with a poor constitution.

Q: But all that is reversible?

A: All of it is reversible. I came in basically with diabetes like five of my cousins and they all started insulin from about 8 years old and on it, you know, definitely between 8 and 15 years old. And I completely reversed mine.

Q: Is onions antibacterial?

A: Pardon?

Q: Are onions antibacterial?

A: Yes, but I just use them for flavoring, just a small amount.

Q: I have another question. Like when I was born, the hip bones were out of the socket, so I had surgeries for that. And although I can walk and walk, I'm fine, but I have this pain on my right side that hurts. Can this diet correct or help?

A: Yeah, but it takes seven and a half years to replace every cell in the bones and it takes five generations to do that. So it could take up to 40 years to remedy that completely. Now, both of my femur joints were almost completely gone from the bone cancer. So, you know, I couldn't walk and I rarely have pain anymore and I'm only 20 years into it. Next.

Q: Michael.

A: Michael, say your last name so we know.

Q: Rhodes.

A: Michael Rhodes. Okay, Michael, very overactive sex glands, they're debilitating. Again, I see a condition where it looks like you were a vegetarian for quite a while. A long time.

Q: Yeah.

A: How many years?

Q: 25.

A: Yeah. There's no stable protein anywhere in your body. You're very fragile, very frail, like the other lady here that was that long. You're a little bit better shape. Relax your hand. Both thyroids are inactive. The right parathyroid is somewhat active. I said the right parathyroid, didn't I? The right parathyroid is somewhat active. The left is barely. There's lots of swelling in the throat, in those glands in the throat. Did you have your tonsils removed?

Q: No.

A: This one looks okay, but this one looks like it's debilitated and scarred.

Q: I have throat problems with my voice. Losing my voice, would that be related?

A: Yeah, that's that gland. It's trying to deal with the toxicity around and it keeps trying to drain out your throat with mucus, so that will affect your voice. Anytime toxins pass out through the throat, it will affect the vocal cords because the mucus gets in the way of the cords. You have no stable animal fats in your body, so everything is very, very tenuous. Any compound that is of an acidic nature will irritate your system. Like her, I would suggest when you can get the cream and the butter, you eat a lot of it. Until then, eat as many eggs as you can, and I suggest anywhere from 10 to 18 a day. Lots of fish and beef and chicken. If you want to reverse some of this quickly, I would say work up to eating about a pound and a half to two pounds a day of meat. I eat from one to three.

Q: And high meats?

A: High meats, I would say not for about two and a half years. If you have a little depression, I'd say maybe you might think about eating maybe a pill-sized amount of fecal matter to get your straight verotoxin right in there to get the bacteria full force and then something that still has to go through to break it down. And the meat, if you start with the high meats, you're going to spend a lot of time detoxifying, and you're going to have no energy. You're too vulnerable, and you have too much degenerative tissue that can be fed on immediately, and that will put you into chronic fatigue for years. So what I suggest is you get stable, you get strong, get some cells regenerated, and then in about two and a half years start getting rid of some of that. But right now, you can't afford to get rid of anything.

Q: How about sunlight?

A: Oh, sunlight is very helpful. For everybody, sunlight is helpful. Do you handle sunlight okay?

Q: Well, I do now. I used to get herpes sores, and the sunlight would aggravate that. Is that just a detoxing kind of thing?

A: Right, because the oils in the skin convert to vitamin D, and the vitamin D is a good detoxer. You have a lot of swollen arteries and veins. They've gotten like thrombosis. They've gotten very watery because there's a lack of protein in them. So that will reverse with lots of protein. So I say you need a pound to two pounds a day of meat. Juice, 90% celery, 10% parsley for about six weeks. Then lower it to 80% celery, 10% parsley, and 10% zucchini. Every other week, in one day's juice, one quart use one-third of a lime or one-half of a lemon rind and all in the juice. That means juice with a rind and all. Where do you live?

Q: Brook Lake, Grass Valley.

A: Okay. You need a lot of glandular help. Thyroid, lungs, parathyroid, which are attached. When you get thyroid, you get the parathyroids with it. Testes, you need some glands, and that will help you bounce back quicker. Your testosterone right now and your overactive adrenals are basically what's keeping you going. Thank God you have that because some people don't in your situation. Like this young lady over here who was there. It still looks like you have some growth hormones, which is something I usually don't see in vegetarians. I've been around vegetarians for a very long time. It looks like you could rebound better than most on a good diet like Michael. I suggest that you drink some of your milk at an odd stage. When it goes just a day old, it's got more of a bitter taste, but that particular enzyme and bacteria is something you need. So let some clabber three days and let some just go a day and kind of mix them. So have a quart to two quarts a day, whatever you like. But I'd focus more on the meat than I would on the milk because if you eat a lot of milk, you're not going to crave as much meat. So sometimes concentrate on the milk and sometimes concentrate on the meat, predominantly the meat. Okay, any questions?

Q: How about homemade sauerkraut?

A: That's great if you want to lower bacteria levels. You don't need that. You needed it while you were a vegetarian to keep the bacteria levels down because you have so much degenerative tissue that if you started bacteria feeding on your system to degenerate it, you go into chronic fatigue. Homemade sauerkraut will prevent that. You don't get well, but of course you don't get stronger. And you'll have a certain amount of fatigue, but at least you won't bottom out. So I suggest do not do it.

Q: And avocado?

A: No more than four a week.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: Question, does it take the presence of growth hormone to allow regeneration? And without it, are you basically just going to hold it where they are?

A: Well, usually in the meat, when it's raw, it has growth hormone activity in it. If you have your own, it magnifies it. Like lucky guys like this.

Q: What did you say you said, did you say growth hormone or youth hormone?

A: Growth hormone, same thing.

Q: But the idea is that for the various folks here who have had places where there's been organs which have degenerated significantly, raw meat is the single biggest thing that's going to help to regenerate. 

A: Correct, and if they eat the gland that's degenerated from an animal, it will increase that.

Q: So, for example, should I be eating stomach?

A: Yes, like I told, didn't I tell you?

Q: No.

A: Who was it?

Q: You mentioned that in one case that they had stomach.

A: I told you to eat tripe.

Q: Yeah, eat stomach.

A: The tripe is the intestines. Yeah, you need intestines and some stomach. See this man, he's got the connection up here.

Q: Oh, he's the man with the gland.

Q: But if you don't have access to organs regularly, then is the single best next thing?

A: It's any of the meats, yeah.

Q: Red or otherwise?

A: Well, if it's an organ, it's usually white meat like chicken, turkey. If it's a gland like the liver, the spleen, and the pancreas, and the muscles, it's mainly red meat. Will build them faster. Next. Jennifer. Can we pump up light at all? Okay, then let me use this.

Q: Do you want me to hold the lamp?

A: No, that's okay, because I've got to move it where I need it to be moved. Thank you. Okay, the spine looks like it's improving.

Q: Okay.

A: The left ovary isn't, but the right one is. The parathyroids are looking better. The thyroid still isn't. It's stabilizing, but it's just not functioning well. So there's probably, you still have fatigue because of that.

Q: Yeah, I do. Do you think it's a good time to do the moldy version of it, or still go with the fresh?

A: You mean the rotten meats?

Q: Of the thyroid particularly.

A: No, because it's building, and that's really what I wanted you to do was build first. And then when it's functioning, you can do the rotten glands to get it broken down. You still have anemia. Do you get out in the sun at all?

Q: I have been a lot more now.

A: Okay. You need about 70% red meat for about six weeks. Okay. Okay, this is an odd one. I want you to have, I'm going to suggest that you have 60% celery, 20% parsley, and a half of an orange, rind and all, per quart. Do this for three weeks only.

Q: Okay. What is that for particularly?

A: I'm trying to figure it out. Sometimes some things come intuitively, and I'm trying to figure out why. It has to do with your lungs, your liver, and your pancreas and spleen. There are certain resins from cooked vegetables that have collected in that area, and they're like crystals. The oils in the rind when combined with the acids in the juice and in the high mineral content in the rest of the juice, in the vegetables, will combine to help, looks like free up those crystals. I'm trying to see if it's going to dissolve it. It doesn't look like it can be dissolved. It looks like they're stone. They're actually like jewels, not precious being there. Far from it. Pretty, but not helpful. Your body is going to try to pass them like stones out of the gallbladder. So you may have some cramping and some pain within six weeks after having that, after that three-week period. So have the pain formula handy. It's a lot of sugar. You may get emotional during that period. I would say try to have like three, four ounces of cream within 20 minutes after having the juice each time. Well, let's say two to three ounces each time, which is a lot of cream. You just have to go down to Claravale and get some for that three-week period. And sour cream is wonderful.

Q: I wanted to ask you how to do that. Is it just outside the fridge? You just let it go?

A: No, I let it sit inside. Well, if you do that, if you want sour cream, you can leave it in the fridge for about a month. Sours beautifully. Leave it up to three months if you like. Now I've had it up to five months and it's still delicious. Beyond that, I couldn't tell you because I haven't let any sit for more than five months.

Q: Were you going to say something about that sour cream for me or something?

A: No, I'm just saying that you can utilize cream even if it's sour. But I wouldn't have any other fruit.

Q: No. Is a date a fruit?

A: Yes, high sugar, definitely. Even though it's high in niacin and high in minerals, to help bind with the sugar so they aren't used so rapidly, it still can create emotionality. That's the only thing I would change.

Q: Okay, great. Yeah, I wanted to show you something. Remember I cut my finger and I did the mud? Lately the nail is turning white right at the bottom. I don't know if you can see it. I think the circulation and things are okay.

A: That's fine. It's probably just scar tissue being built into that.

Q: Okay, good.

A: Because that's the way you can build out the scar tissue and get rid of it quickly.

Q: I had a couple other questions. I seem to have tightness or congestion right in here in my small intestine. Is there anything you can suggest?

A: Well, that's just what I was saying, all of that. Those resins. They're locked in there.

Q: I tend to feel dehydrated even though I'm drinking.

A: You're so dry it's going to take you probably six years to feel non-dehydrated.

Q: For the kidney, my kidney has been swelling up a lot and going back down. I wondered, could that be a reaction to any of the foods that I'm eating?

A: No.

Q: Or do you think it's a detox?

A: Detox, right.

Q: So not avocado or milk or anything?

A: No.

Q: Okay. And then I've gained like 14 pounds and I'm wondering how much further to go before losing weight.

A: You look pretty good.

Q: Should I go up like another 10 or something?

A: Yeah, I would say 10.

Q: Okay.

A: Definitely.

Q: And then I also have heart arrhythmia and palpitations.

A: That's usually low protein level.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay. That's it. Okay. Thank you.

A: Okay.

Q: My turn?

A: Do you want to go? Go ahead. Oh, Phil too.

Q: On the juice you said 60 celery, 20 parsley and then half an orange. Does that make up for the, what is that, 20?

A: Well, whenever I add the orange it's like don't even consider the percentage between, you know. You'll just have a little extra juice. Okay.

Q: Benjamin.

A: Benjamin. Very overactive sex glands and adrenal glands. Very overactive on the right. The sex gland on the right is about normal. The one on the left is very overactive. Usually that means that you could be an athlete or somebody who is physically involved in life unless your other glands above, you know, your chest do not function well. And your thyroid is underactive, both sides. Your parathyroid is overactive on both sides but really not functioning that well. The one on the left is overactive but not producing much. It tries. It looks like you still have your tonsils.

Q: I had them removed. I think one is growing back.

A: The right one. Yeah. Looks like the fat cells are clumping in your intestines, in your liver. Small and large intestines. It is affecting your spine right in this area right here. It looks like it is even causing some hemorrhaging, some ulcers in there. So I am going to recommend that you have, you need to handle that because you will go into spinal meningitis. If you go into spinal meningitis when this is going on, it could be a long time to recover. I am going to suggest, if that scares you, that is good because I want you to take care of it. Take a whole cup of cabbage juice, the white cabbage, a day, four ounces at a time. Four ounces in the morning and four ounces in the evening. Okay. And the rest of your juice.

Q: That is green?

A: Yeah.

Q: White?

A: Green cabbage and white cabbage is the same, just not the red cabbage.

Q: How do you blend it?

A: No. If you are going to blend it, then you need to strain it.

Q: You don't want the pulp then?

A: No.

Q: Is blending better?

A: No. Well, I would like the pulp removed. So if you blend it, you have to put some kind of cloth that takes the pulp out. And you wring out the juice. Champion, Green Life, any of those juicers. Do you have a juicer?

Q: I have an Omega.

A: It will work for cabbage.

Q: It doesn't squeeze it out very well.

A: No. Well, then you can take it and press it.

Q: I see.

A: Yeah. Just open your Omega up and press it against the side and that will squeeze out even more. Or put it in a cloth and wring it.

Q: Okay.

A: That's what I did, you know, in the old days. Have you been a vegetarian?

Q: No. Not strict. I'm omnivore.

A: You say not strict.

Q: Yeah, I try to have a healthy diet.

A: Uh-huh. You're not reproducing with the cooked meat, of course?

Q: Yeah.

A: You're mainly eating... Okay. Because you're not, the connective tissue and the tendons are buckling on now, which means that you're storing scar tissue there and you're losing elasticity. White meat is best to remedy that. You're still a little anemic, though. I mean, your red blood cell count is good, but your red blood cells aren't as strong as they need to be. Basically, you have a pretty balanced system. It's just balanced low. It just doesn't have the enzymes and everything it needs and it has toxicity in it. But there's nothing that is exceptionally out of whack except that you're not getting rid of the advanced glycation end products, the toxic sugars from cooked starches. That is stored in your body and that's causing an acid reaction throughout. A high sugar and acid reaction, so it's damaging the blood, it's damaging everything and causing a little swelling everywhere.

Q: I do a lot of fruit juices.

A: Well, that'll certainly help clean it out, but it'll also damage you at the same time. It'll also give you a hell of a craving for cheese and meats and fats or starches if you eat cooked starches. 

Q: Like in potatoes?

A: Yeah.

Q: I don't care for potatoes.

A: Breads and grains?

Q: Sprouts.

A: Sprouts. That usually won't cause that. That'll usually cause more hunger. How much vegetable juice do you do?

Q: I have done a couple of quarts.

A: A day?

Q: For one meal. And fruit juices in the morning and peanut butter in between. 

A: Oh, so there you're going after the nut butters to balance it. I knew there was one food in there we had to go crazy over. None of those nut butters are raw, even if they say raw.

Q: I make them myself.

A: Oh, great. But like I say, they have that, even if you're making it into a butter, it has the enzyme suppressants, enzyme inhibitors and the protein inhibitors, so it's better to blend that mixture I suggested and you won't have to eat as much. You'll be much more satisfied. I suggest that you have one to one and a half quarts of milk a day, a quart of the juice a day.

Q: Along with the cabbage juice?

A: Yeah, extra.

Q: Extra.

A: Yeah, so that's five cups a day.

Q: Okay, and so is that throughout the day or just for one meal?

A: No, you need to spread it out throughout the day. Because if you have a lot of juice at one time, you're going to urinate out most of it after it robs your blood of fats. I mean, the vegetable juice at least won't rob your body of fats like the fruit juice will, but you need to spread it out so that your body can absorb and utilize it without urinating it.

Q: What about apples?

A: Apples? If you're eating it with cheese, I would say it's okay once in a while. I mean, your pancreas is okay. There's a lot of debilitation on the left side, but you can handle a piece of fruit a day, definitely. We are not talking about a piece of fruit like this, man. Eating a whole pineapple a day. I'm talking about one that will fit in your palm half closed. That's a piece of fruit.

Q: So any kind of fruit, kiwi or?

A: Yeah, whatever you like. There's no real... Well, you say you do have some fat congestion, so pineapple once in a while, kiwi. Basically, whatever you're attracted to. Pears would be good for you also.

Q: Banana? Oranges?

A: Banana's not a great thing for you. It looks like.

Q: I don't crave them, but once in a while.

A: Yeah, well, once in a while would be okay.

Q: Oranges, like three times, three big oranges a day.

A: I don't recommend having that much fruit.

Q: That's basically my mainstay, oranges.

A: The problem with that is if you eat a lot of fruit like that, it's going to alkalize your digestive tract so much that you're not going to be able to eat meat.

Q: Okay.

A: It will absolutely destroy your ability to eat meat.

Q: Over a period of time?

A: Meaning?

Q: Over a period of time, then it's going to destroy my ability to process meat?

A: Yes, probably immediately. You'd have to start, yeah, because you're already doing that. So trying to eat meat's going to be difficult. You'll see that if you try, let's say tomorrow.

Q: I had a piece today and I got cold.

A: Yeah, you're not digesting it.

Q: So what do you do to react?

A: You just need to get on the vegetable juice, eat lots of eggs, you know, like, let's say, to build that. Eat the meat and let it clabber. Because basically the fruit juice wipes out the intestinal bacteria that handles meat and eggs and dairy. So what you need to do is have those cut back on the whey bag, on the fruit juices, to build your ability to digest. And I would clabber all of your milk.

Q: All of it?

A: All of it.

Q: And how much do you think?

A: A quart and a half.

Q: What percentage of celery per quart of juice would you say?

A: I think I said 80 and 20. 

Q: 20 parsley?

A: Yeah.

Q: Peanut butter, honey, that combination?

A: Well, not peanut. Peanuts have an enzyme that's very difficult in the whole form. You can have the peanut oil, you know, with almonds or walnuts, excuse me, pecans or walnuts or pine nuts.

Q: With the milk?

A: No, with cream.

Q: With cream.

A: Or with peanut oil and the honey.

Q: Okay. I have another question. I have scar tissue that I've been trying to figure out how to turn that back into muscle. And also my brain, I have a neurolateral temporal dysfunction and a hemisphere dysfunction. Two-thirds of my brain doesn't work.

Q: Well, that's normal for everybody.

A: Because it's so toxified. The best way to get rid of that scar tissue is to eat, you know, brain that's, you know, if you get brain from this gentleman and let it rot a little bit and then also eat some healthy brain, then the degenerative bacteria from the brain will go in and help break up the toxic areas of the brain, remove the scar tissue. Eating the healthy brain will help restore it quicker if you want to concentrate on brain.

Q: Why are you alternating it?

A: Because neurological tissue is so important. Whenever I do anything for the spine or brain, I will eat a toxic, you know, the high bacteria one day and eat the healthy one the next day. And I'll alternate them like that. And no more than, let's say, let's say I'll take a calf's brain which is probably about this big. It's the size of a softball or larger. And I'll spend five days eating that. And I'll let half of it get high and the other half not. And the way I keep half of it from getting high is I put it in a jar where there's no air and the one where I let it get high, I put it in a big jar with a lot of air. And that will work quicker. Also eating olive oil with chicken.

Q: Is that red meat? I mean white meat.

A: White meat, chicken. It's white meat, yeah. Olive oil with chicken will help dissolve some. Bacteria, like I said, works faster. Parasite works even faster. If you can get them to take in your system. Have you had a lot of antibiotics or anything in your system?

Q: Probably some. Penicillin.

A: Injections?

Q: No. And antibiotics this last fall for the flu.

A: Don't do that. Don't do that anymore. Okay, you're welcome. All right, next. Everybody's falling asleep here?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Phil wants to hear all the information. If he came here, he's going to take it all. Hi, Ray. Okay, relax your hands now. Are you eating a pound of meat a day?

Q: Yeah, about a pound.

A: Are you getting sunshine?

Q: Yes.

A: I'm going to recommend that you eat 70% red meat for a while. The red cells are getting healthier but not healthy fast enough.

Q: You said that last time too.

A: I know.

Q: I'm having to clay too.

A: Do you have liver at all?

Q: No, I haven't.

A: Okay. Probably that will bring it back quicker. I'd try to have liver twice a week so, you know, about a half a pound a week minimum. The pancreas is still very debilitated, swollen. Adrenal glands are looking a little bit better. Thyroid gland, the left side looks like it's functioning. Parathyroid is not. Thyroid over here looks like it's starting to heal. Parathyroids are working. Lymph glands in the neck are working. Are you having that nut mix at all?

Q: No.

A: I think you're lacking some starch. So I'd like you to have that once or twice a week, that nut mixture. The half a cup of nuts, walnuts, pecans or pine nuts. Two tablespoons of honey. Three ounces of peanut oil or three to four ounces of raw cream or coconut cream.

Q: That needs to be blended?

A: Yes, blend that for about 50 seconds. And have that once or twice a week. And I'd say for about a six week period, not much chicken. Focus on fish and beef and liver as part of the beef. Are you still having other kinds of clay other than the Rosbond?

Q: No, just the Rosbond.

A: How long have you been taking that?

Q: Maybe two or three months. You know, like a month after the last time I saw you.

A: Okay. I suggest that you stop taking it for about four months completely. It's created a lot of good bacteria in your system, but it's becoming too much. And then when you go back to it, have it only two days a week for another two months. And then take four months off again. And do that pattern for about six years. Two months on, twice a week, two months off, four months off. And you're letting it get moist? It's already moist and you're keeping it moist when you're eating it?

Q: Not so much. I mean, it's a clay.

A: It's a Rosbond clay. It's already moist.

Q: Yeah, a little bit.

A: Okay, that's fine. Some people let it dry out and then eat it as a powder and that's exactly the opposite of what I want them to do. So just making sure that you're having it that way. Okay, what I'd like you to do is take about a tablespoon of kiwi and mash it with two tablespoons of banana and three drops of lime juice. And I'd like you to mash that all together and have it with an inch by an inch and a half cube of cheese. Monterey or cheddar. Monterey is a little bit preferable. That is going to create a chemical reaction in your blood that will stop them from sticking together so much. They're clumping and when they're clumping they're not able to get to the capillaries as well.

Q: So it's going to help.

A: Yeah, help circulation.

Q: As far as like energy and stuff.

A: It should help, yeah. Because the blood's not flowing properly, not utilizing oxygen well, then your energy level is always going to be low. So let's see how long. Do that for about six months.

Q: Do you do that every day?

A: No, no, no, no. Do it five days a week for two weeks, then three days a week for one week, and then two days a week for the rest of the six months, period.

Q: How many is that? The last one?

A: For the rest of the six months, period.

Q: How many days a week?

A: Two.

Q: Two.

Q: Are you able to gain weight?

Q: A little bit, yeah.

A: Yeah, it looks like he's got a little bit there. It looks fine.

Q: I've been having ten to twelve eggs a day for a while now.

A: And how much meat?

Q: About a pound.

A: About a pound? Yeah, at times a little bit less.

Q: I haven't really done much with high meat.

A: Do you suffer depression at all?

Q: No.

A: Okay.

Q: No, no, no.

A: The bacterial level looks pretty good. So that's not my concern is bacterial level. This is the clotting, I mean the clumping of cells. There may be three stages to getting it to where we want it, so this is the next six-month stage. But hopefully this will make a big break in it.

Q: What about even filling out more, you know, muscles? Can you fill out more?

A: Well, that would be taking it, you'd have to eat more meat.

Q: Eat more meat.

A: Eat more meat, yeah. You still have a lot of congestion in the intestines. That could probably use a little bit more bacteria. Also eating tripe, if you can get it from Michael, you know when you're up in this area once in a while. You might let a little bit of that get ripe. That bacteria is completely absent there. Like you took, you know, lots of oral antibiotics at some point or dewormers or something.

Q: Yeah, when I was a kid. Yeah, probably. That's what people did.

A: It was pretty destroyed on the left side.

Q: Yeah.

A: But everything else is working out pretty well.

Q: Yeah, getting stronger.

A: Yeah. It's just that anemia. You've got an anemia that's hard to break.

Q: I sometimes have like blood in the stool. So, it's hard at times.

A: Uh-huh. You have low bacterial level in the colon and that's that scarring here.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: So, you know, use the clabbered milk to help encourage that.

Q: Yeah.

A: It can be fun. It isn't like some colonic, you know, where they're putting five gallons of water in you. It's just a nice kefir. It actually is very soothing. And it's funny. It's just all of a sudden sometimes you can just be so irritable because you're constipated. And then you put that stuff in and it's like, wow, I didn't even have a movement but I felt like I did because it just goes in there and absorbs all those acids and everything that's having a problem that the bacteria will not feed on. Neutralizes them pretty much.

Q: You know, when I detox, it's usually through the knees and the joints. If I don't sleep, for instance, at times I'll go through like a lot of pain. And it goes. And I find that if I don't juice, you know, I'm pretty good at this.

A: You get too acidic.

Q: Really, that's what happens.

A: Acids in the joints and stuff. Yeah. Take the pain formula, you know, in place of the smoothie for two of your eggs.

Q: Yeah. And also, how do you get rid of like a long time with a wart? And what is a wart from?

A: A wart is usually dead cells that are cartilage and can no longer function as cartilage properly but they're not completely dead. So the body builds it into the skin and makes it a wart. It's a viral activity where the virus goes in and changes the RNA and DNA so it pulls it out of the joint area and builds it into the skin.

Q: So to let it go, what's the way to let it go?

A: What did I use last? There are several things that I have in the book to get rid of warts. But they don't work as much as I would like them to. And I just found something that worked very well and I can't remember what it is.

Q: Wow.

A: I think I need to eat some meat soon.

Q: Or some brains.

A: Precisely. Give me a call and I'll remember all the facts. I'll email it to you. Okay. Okay, anything else?

Q: No, that's it.

A: Okay, that's it. I'm finished for the day. Phil, too bad.

Q: You know you told me to have the orange and no other fruit. And you told me to eat half a grapefruit every other day for two weeks. Should I stop that for now?

A: Yeah.

Q: And then the thyroid, how often should I be eating the rough thyroid?

A: I would say no more than two days a week.

Q: Oh, is that often?

A: Yeah. If you want to get it well faster. It's up to you if you want energy sooner.

Q: So every other week, twice a week?

A: Yeah.

Q: Because I'm usually eating it like five days in a row and then off for like two weeks or three weeks.

A: It might be better if you have it more frequently, but less throughout that week.

Q: Yeah, all right.

A: All right, this is good. Wow, your red blood cells are getting back together. Yeah. 

Q: Should he be keeping [unintelligible]?

A: In his brain. In his ears. Wow, your blood is sure coming together. You have metal toxicity all throughout your system.

Q: Yeah. How does that show up in the hands? What do you see?

A: Well, it's what I see inside the hands. I can see the metals. And sex glands are still very strong, the adrenals. Pancreas is looking much better. Even though you're eating all that fruit, it doesn't make sense. Probably overworking it so much. The thyroid looks worse. It's probably the pineapple breaking it down.

[audio cut]

A: ...two weeks just to stabilize.

Q: No kiwis either?

A: That would be an okay fruit for you to have.

Q: But not ten of them.

A: One a day.

Q: How long is a day?

A: Forty hours. For you, at least 40 hours. Forty Jewish hours. You know what that's like.

Q: Is there such a thing as too much cream?

A: No.

Q: Okay, good. 

A: I didn't say for anybody else. I said for him.

Q: Because I could drink like two pints a day without too much trouble.

A: I wouldn't. If you're eating a whole pineapple a day, probably use a quart of cream. That will reduce. You won't need as much if you're not having all that fruit. How much meat are you eating?

Q: A pound a day. That's like three eggs a day.

A: You're only having three eggs a day?

Q: Should I have more?

Q: Now where do you eat all that pineapple?

A: Exactly. Yeah, you need about ten to eighteen a day.

Q: And what about my juice mixture? 

A: I'd continue with the same that you're having.

Q: I'm juicing an alfalfa sprout. Is that a bad thing?

A: Yeah. It has an enzyme inhibitor in it. If you have too much. One day a week is probably all that you can handle. And no more than one of those little packages. And don't mix it up. Have it only one day. Don't mix it over a three day period. I can't get over how your digestive system. I don't know if it's that pineapple. I've never seen this before. Because your digestion has definitely improved.

Q: I'm only eating one food at a time. I've been very careful about that.

A: That's easier to do then.

Q: I tried having kiwis and a milk product or something. I was thinking I'm going to be really careful. And no honey either because the honey was screwing me up too. Well copious amounts of course. I had a hard time having anything not in excess.

A: Well that's because you're not having enough fats. You're eating the pineapple. That's going to make anybody crazy. The whole dietary regime will go nuts. So the more eggs, more fat, less fruit. You'll balance out a lot more.

Q: Yeah I cut down the cheese too. The cheese and the honey was difficult to digest. 

A: You know the honey can be eaten with cheese. But if you're pigging out on both. Just remember that the honey works on proteins. And you can't count cheese as a protein even though there's protein in it. Because when protein has been dehydrated like in a cheese. The fat and the minerals become the predominant active ingredient in cheese. Honey isn't going to help you digest very much of the cheese. Because it digests protein well.

Q: So how much meat should I have to have more of that for the day?

A: Well if you increase the eggs. You won't need any more than probably a pound, pound and a half of meat a day.

Q: I've been doing mostly red meat and a little chicken. It seems to work very well.

A: Well you could use some fish because you have all those mineral toxins. It would help neutralize some of that.

Q: I have to go eat the fish in an emergency room parking lot. Since last time I had any hint of fish my throat's a little shut.

A: Oh yeah?

Q: I haven't tried it raw yet though. Which is the least fishy fish?

A: Is that a possibility? Probably tuna. To me albacore is very strong. But the tuna is less strong to me. But I like the strong fish. I like swordfish and I like yellowtail. And all those things are strong.

Q: Cod is actually not too fishy, and also King Mackerel is the least fishy of the fish I tried, but it's hard to find...

A: That's true. Hard to find it non-farmed.

Q: So what should I do to help out my thyroid?

A: Eat thyroid. Definitely. Beef, deer, whatever you can get. Get a hold of Michael when you're up this way. This guy's going to have a hell of a business. Listen I've got guys in L.A. that have businesses going from this. Like the milk, the guy, he made arrangements. Now he's supplying all of Southern California the Claravale milk.

Q: So question, the ridges on the nails, any concern with that? Does that mean anything to my dry hair?

A: Well those ridges mean that you're putting out a lot of the toxic minerals from solvents that were in the hands. And that will go on for years and years and years. But there's a nice sheen on them. So that means they're good and strong.

Q: What about the dry hair, what about that?

A: You're very dry. If you're eating a pineapple a day you're burning up all your fats. You're going to be dry forever. A pineapple, if you eat a whole pineapple a day, that will burn up about three pints of fat.

Q: Really, that's more than I can eat.

A: Just remember this, 80% fats, 5% sugar. That's all it takes. So you can take that big a pineapple and five times fat you'll need to utilize that properly.

Q: So now he's got this new habit since he doesn't do honey, he does vanilla which has alcohol in it. I'm not crazy but what do you think?

A: Not a good idea.

Q: How about vanilla bean in a raw form, that's okay.

A: That's fine, that's better.

Q: Not the processed vanilla.

A: Not in that high amount, if you're putting one or two drops in that's okay.

Q: That's okay?

A: Yeah.

Q: That's about all I use, maybe three or four drops.

[laughter]

A: That's double what I just said.

Q: How are my eyes looking? Oh my gosh, they're lighter.

A: Yeah, they seem lighter. Definitely, definitely, yeah. Well, I guess that pineapple is doing something good. Is he tolerable eating that much?

Q: At work is horrible but with me it's fine.

Q: It wouldn't have to be that way. People just steal everything.

Q: I have a question. When we were in France everybody smoked and it was so hard for us. Can we do something to clean up from there?

A: Tars are very difficult to break down. The only way that I've seen people can deliberately break down those tars is to eat raw tobacco. Chew on it and spit the pulp out.

Q: Yeah?

A: Yeah. Even chewing it up and then letting it mold and then eating it also will help dissolve some of those tars.

Q: Where do you get good tobacco, organic tobacco.

Q: They sell it.

Q: They do?

Q: Yeah, American spirits.

Q: Do you get totally ripped?

A: No, you can get a little bit of a high because, you know, there's nicotine in it. It stimulates the brain. It's vitamin B-niacin, you know.

Q: But it won't make you nauseous? Like chewing tobacco would?

A: No, I've never heard of anybody getting nauseous on raw green tobacco.

Q: Oh, raw green tobacco.

A: It's the better.

Q: Oh, okay. So you've got to grow it your own?

A: No, you can usually like going to John's source and tell them you want green. They can get you green.

Q: So what berries would I have? Should I have berries to get rid of the metals and things?

A: Yeah, but I would calm down from the pineapple for a while. You know, it's funny. The other person that I was talking about, that detoxed. Her eyes went from dark brown to a light green in three and a half years. She was like that. She would eat a quarter to a half a pineapple a day. She was a basket case but definitely cleaned quicker than anybody else. So, you know, if you can tolerate them, you know. Yeah. You just take it all out on your employees, right? Poor guys.

Q: And customers too.

Q: I mean, I'm the opposite..."Babe!", like, I couldn't believe it, I've never seen him like that before.

A: That's what too much fruit will do for you. I think it's usually better to do it more gradually than that.

Q: Yeah. I'm not that way.

A: Well, become that way. Eat more eggs and more meat and calm down.

Q: So how can you blend the eggs without oxidizing? Can you just like take a fork or something?

A: No. If you want to blend them in something, then add a little bit of cream or milk or something that will coat the egg whites so it doesn't oxidize.

Q: Is it better to have the whites and the yolks separately in separate meals?

A: No.

Q: It doesn't matter?

A: It's better to have them together except for one person I suggested to have them separate.

Q: What if our stools are green? Does that mean there's poor digestion?

A: That means that you're not breaking down all of the chlorophyll in the green juice, but that's okay.

Q: Go ahead.

Q: If I take my smoothie and put the eggs in there and the milky and the milk and whatever else I put in there, that's okay?

A: Yeah.

Q: The eggs won't oxidize.

A: Correct. Because they'll be coated.

Q: What about putting like a peach and pineapple or a strawberry or something like that?

A: Then you're going to make solvents that will be for detoxification. If you want to detoxify more, that's fine. But if you do that often, get ready for a flu or a cold. That's why when in the book I have the smoothies with fruit as a remedy for it because it helps more solvents get in there and break everything down so it will flow out.

Q: I have sneeze attacks every time I take that.

A: Causing you to dry out then. You need some cream with it or something if you're going to do that.

Q: Coconut cream?

A: Yeah, but that's more of a solvent. If you need to soothe your tissues, you need cow's cream.

Q: Can I have one more clarification? When I'm eating the thyroid twice a week, can it be for one thing, can it be two days in a row? Is that okay?

A: Yeah.

Q: It's hard to get, you know what I mean?

A: Definitely two days in a row is fine.

Q: How much at a time? Because I have a hard time. I mean, if I can get one of those, you know, about like that, I feel lucky.

A: Well, like I say, it's a new recipe that I gave. If you put one teaspoon of salsa in with that, it is so delicious in comparison.

Q: The texture is just so disgusting to me.

A: Well, did you ever have, you know, potato soup or clam chowder? That's what it's like. And with the new salsa recipe, it all of a sudden is like a soup.

Q: Okay, I'll try it. I've been doing the new thing that you told me, that you chunk them while they're in shape.

A: Oh, wash it down, yeah. The coward's way.

Q: You should see me in there.

A: The whip. No, that's very brave. Anybody's eating the glands, that's brave.

Q: Is olive oil okay with the beef?

A: With what?

Q: With beef.

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay, I have another question. Like, I'm trying to figure out why I have so much metal toxicity. And I grew up in, my parents had a bar and a nightclub. There was always like a smoke of, you know, a cloud of smoke in there. And I breathed that, you know, for many years. Could it be?

A: Definitely. Yep.

Q: From there?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Do I need to chew tobacco?

A: It would be helpful.

Q: What about the homeopathic remedy for that?

A: Well, because when they use the alcohol, it destroys the bacteria that will help break it down.

Q: I can't handle alcohol, actually.

Q: A little pellet?

A: No, once it's dehydrated, it doesn't do it. You need it in its raw form so that you can get the bacteria and all the enzymes to form bacterias and molds to break it down in your system.

Q: How often would you recommend chewing tobacco?

A: Well, if you have too much, you could put yourself in pneumonia, cleaning too fast, or into meningitis when it cleans out of the brain. So, I recommend probably eating it, you know, chewing and spitting out the pulp about a tablespoon worth or, you know, about two inch piece of the leaf, two inch by two inch piece of the leaf, no more than four days a week.

Q: Four times a week?

A: Yeah.

Q: What's it mean when I have like a wheezing sound in my lungs?

A: It means you have no fat. You're too dry.

Q: You did mention eggs for me.

A: It also could mean that, you know, the mucus isn't forming properly.

Q: Morning?

A: Yeah, definitely.

Q: How many eggs should I be having per day or a week? Do you have any idea?

A: I didn't tell you?

Q: No.

A: Let me see your hands again. Eight to twelve a day. I would say ten to twelve is probably better. Yeah.

Q: Thanks.

A: You're welcome.

Q: [unintelligible] eggs for me either. How many?

A: Let me see your hands again. Six to twelve.

Q: Can I freeze raw butter?

A: No.

Q: So, freezing is anything really out of the question?

A: Well, not out of the question, you just destroy some of the enzymes. It flattens it.

Q: Well, because the goat's butter doesn't last very long. I mean, I have to make it almost, it's so labor-intensive. I'd like to just make a bunch of it and freeze it.

A: Well, I'll show you how to do it easier and quicker.

Q: I'd love to see that.

A: All right.

Q: How long does raw butter last if you don't have the Stueve's?

A: If you do it the right, if you have the Stueve's, those Stueve's I've had last up to twelve months in the refrigerator. How the fuck is it? Where is he? What's his address? I'm going to go home that direction and become a burglar. It lasts over probably a year is the longest I've kept it. It may last longer than that.

Q: I have a couple of questions. One, I've heard pineapple discussed in a lot of different ways. A lot of people, it seems to be like burning fat. I heard a recommendation about it relieving fat congestion. I know you didn't mention, in my case, you mentioned kiwi rather than pineapple. Should I avoid the pineapple for me?

A: Yeah, because it will cause too much fat depletion in your system.

Q: The second thing is because of the arrhythmia, I've been on a half-aspirin regimen for quite a while. Is that contributing to the stomach issue? 

A: That creates like a cement that goes into a cement in your lymph system.

Q: The question is, given that there's a risk for me if I don't take it in terms of having a clot thrown, what way can I address that until I can somehow manage to get rid of the arrhythmia?

A: I wouldn't worry about the arrhythmia. I had arrhythmia from the age of probably 13 up until I was in my mid-30s.

Q: What kind?

A: I don't remember what it was right now, what it was diagnosed as. I was so young. But it was serious. I had angina along with it. You know how serious angina is? It's basically like a heart attack every time you have it. My father, he came down with an arrhythmia. You know what I said? I said, don't count. Don't count. Simple as that. He hasn't done a thing about it and he's fine. Most people don't need to do anything about it. It's, again, a way to sell a drug.

Q: I've avoided any of the medications, but this is one thing that over and over again, I was told was a risk with atrial fib that you get a swelling of the blood flow through the atrium and they say under some conditions that can coagulate and it can cause death.

A: It's so rare and if you're on this diet at all, it's not going to matter.

Q: I've been doing, I have a completely plant-based magnesium supplement I'm taking. It doesn't have any kind of magnesium salt in it. It's only using plant materials to get the magnesium.

A: It doesn't make any difference. Once it's dehydrated and once it's isolated.

Q: It's in liquid form. It's a fluorodex, but forget it.

A: Forget it, yeah.

Q: I have a calcium supplement.

A: Forget it. Waste it. Because what you get in that supplement, you will get and utilize every bit in about a half a cup of milk. In a whole bottle of that supplement.

Q: Okay, rely on the milk and the juice to give me the minerals.

A: Correct, and the cheese.

Q: And CoQ10, eliminate that as well.

A: Eliminate that entirely. That's very toxic to a lot of people that have problems. That have arrhythmia problems.

Q: And Hawthorne leaf berry, eliminate that as well.

A: If you have the actual berry, fine.

Q: No, this is a powder.

A: Yeah, no. He's got a Hawthorne berry tree.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: So, you know, one of those a week is enough.

Q: How about the algae?

A: I did a lot of experiment with that and I didn't find that it did much of anything. In a person who was on a totally raw diet. I found that with people who were not on a good diet, it provided some minerals that were important to them. Also, because it was so high in sodium, it created a lowering of bacteria which I don't like. So, probably the most remedial effect was that it was more of a balanced sodium that most people got. And it made them feel better because it stopped detoxification.

Q: I tried it after being on a raw diet for a month just one time and it just destroyed my digestion. And I throw that stuff on the plants when I get home.

A: Exactly, they'll love it. Make a little compost with it. And boy, the plants love it because it's perfect for them.

Q: So, what about like Howell sells those enzymes? Plant-based enyzmes.

A: You know, everybody is trying to market something to make all of their time and research worthwhile. And he tried to do it. He has this theory and postulation that will work. However, in actual practice it doesn't work. For a few people in certain circumstances it may work, but it's not controllable. You don't know who's going to work, for whom it's going to work and who it's not. 

Q: I was reading about two different studies, a soccer team in Australia and a football team in Oregon that took supplemental enzymes and they documented that their injury healing time was shorter. 

A: But those guys eat 99.9% cooked everything. So, even those that are processed are better than what they are already getting. It's like people who use essential oils that are heated at 357 degrees will not have as good a reaction as people who are using 257 degrees distilled. So, there is an improvement, but when you are on a raw diet, anything that isn't raw is not going to be an improvement.

Q: Just like the supplements, it's the same?

A: Correct.

Q: It works well for somebody that has a similar processed diet because a lot of the processed items make sense?

A: Correct.

Q: So, honey with digestion of protein, is there anything that aids digestion of fat?

A: You mean a particular food?

Q: Yeah, food or something like that, like honey is a food that aids protein digestion.

A: Any of the fruits, any of the proteins, doesn't take much fruit, takes more protein, 15% protein, but 5% fruit to utilize fats properly.

Q: I see, that's the diet you are recommending.

A: Yeah.

Q: I have fat cravings, I get so many.

A: Pardon?

Q: I crave fat a lot.

A: You crave fat a lot? Yeah.

Q: So, if I don't eat any honey, is that okay, if I never have any honey?

A: Why, because you can't control yourself?

Q: Right.

Q: Precisely.

Q: Well, I can talk about that. I went through a period where I finished on honey and I just let myself do it and eventually it leveled out. 

A: Yeah, it will level out.

Q: I'll just have a little bit at a time.

A: But if you make yourself have meals, two eggs and some milk and some honey, if you do that, you won't binge on anything. It's when you let yourself get too hungry and then you start binging, you are going to binge on whatever you are eating at the time.

Q: So, even though the lactose in the milk is okay with the carbohydrate and the protein together, the lactose carbohydrate in the milk is okay with the protein and eggs, the digestion is fine?

A: You are talking about the lactate is the lactose. The sugar. Is the sugar.

Q: Right, and it digests okay, because whenever I have eggs with the honey, I feel nauseous, kind of dizzy.

A: It may be causing a liver detoxification or even a gallbladder detoxification. So, then I would cut out the honey.

Q: Is there anything we can do?

A: I had that problem every time that I had it, you know, because I had that poison mushroom. And after that, any time I ate honey with eggs, I got cramps, I got nauseous, everything. So, I couldn't eat it for, let's see, I ate that in 81 and it was just last year, it was the first time I could combine honey and eggs together, last year. So, it took a lot of years.

Q: So, was it good to do the detoxification or it wasn't good until you could do it?

A: Well, because it was so painful and it knocked me out, I had to do it gradually, 18 years. I've had enough pain, I'm not glutton for punishment. You know, I want to give well quickly, but not that, you know, I don't want to do it that way.

Q: Do you have any, like, objective, like, number measurements about how the ingestion of the large quantities of raw fat affects things like cholesterol, homocysteine levels, and the second is, does it even matter?

A: It doesn't matter at all, because your body, I've got lots of blood analysis for it. I'll give you some of the extreme examples. A banker who had a 267 cholesterol level, I put him on a stick of raw butter a day. He was about 6'3", so he was a big man and very overweight. So, I had him on a stick of butter a day, about 4 ounces of cream a day, and about 10 eggs, raw eggs. So, you know the cholesterol involved in that, right? His cholesterol, and he had the test done 3 weeks later and his cholesterol was down to 167. I have an Olympic gymnast, 27 years old now, 26 years old. When she came to me, she had a 327 cholesterol level, and if she didn't keep that up to about that level, she could not work out, but the problem was she kept having colds and flus every 2 to 3 weeks, and it knocked her out. She couldn't even work out for a week, sometimes 10 days, and she'd have to start her workout all over again. So, they were going to drop her from the team, because there's no way that they could keep up with that. No telling. The games came along which cycle she would be on. So, she went on to a raw diet. Her level stayed at 327, but because they were good cholesterols, she didn't have a cold and she could go right through and not have a problem with the cholesterol. I've got a champion skater, a figure skater. She had a high cholesterol level right around 210, which is not real high, but it's still high. For a female, she's about 5'3", 5'4", I guess. Somebody who works out, you know, skating 6 to 8 hours a day. I gave her twice the amount of cholesterol that she was eating previous to that. Her cholesterol level went down to 187, and you know, she goes out there and works, and these other girls are going out there, can't go in. She's going 5, 6 hours, and she just keeps going and going and going. So, I can't say that the cholesterol level makes any difference. It's whether it's raw or cooked.

Q: So, is it when we're younger, you can pretty much get away with anything if your body just doesn't notice it and gets away with it?

A: You have growth hormones, you have youth hormones, you have lots of adrenaline. If you're healthy, if you're a child like me, I didn't get away with anything. I was born sickly. So, some kids, a lot of kids get away with everything until their growth hormones fall off, and then it's all downhill.

Q: What would be good to rebuild my tendons. I still have some pain left in my right hip.

A: Rebuild your tendons? Is that what you said?

Q: Yes.

A: If you could take tendons and chop them up and grind them in a grinder, meat grinder, you would probably, if you can digest it, break it down, and the best possible way is to grind it, put it through the grinder about three times to get it down into the smallest fragment. So, when the hydrochloric acid invades it, it will dissolve more of it, but it's a very hard substance to digest in a human system with our lack of health. But that's the quickest way. The next best way is to eat a lot of chicken.

Q: Can we do anything to help Stueve go home?

A: Well, no. Stueve is now at the mercy of the people who will process their substances and what they want. So, this company that they contracted to do it got threatened by the state to be closed down, so that scared them for about six months. And then when that got all squared away and everything was settled out with the health department, no, that would be conspiracy and that would be prejudicial. I'm glad that they did that, even though it canceled us being able to have the butter right away. It set a precedent that if they did go and do that and harass this company, then they would be facing a tremendous lawsuit and definitely would lose it. So, I'm glad that the one health official, one inspector that came to that said, you do Stueve's and we're going to really come in and do this to you and do that to you and do this to you and that to you. It was bad because they backed out from Stueve's saying we won't do it. Now that it's cleared up, there's a threat to the health department if they do anything out of the ordinary, they're in big trouble. So, this company said that they're going to start manufacturing it this month and it will be out the 22nd, but we will see. Now, they have up in Oakdale, everybody that's near Modesto, that's where one of the Stueve's farms is. They have just increased their herd to 350. They're going to start producing raw milk, raw kefir and raw butter. They do not have all the facilities together up there in Oakdale to do that. So, it may take some time for them to manufacture it so they don't have to ever rely upon anybody else again and plus they will not be in Los Angeles County. No medical milk commission. Medical milk commission hasn't met since Stueve's stopped producing.

Q: There's no one else.

A: Yeah, that's it. He's doing all of this, his milk will be organic when it comes out.

Q: How long does it take for them to put together an organic farm?

A: They're already organic. This particular farm established their organic a year ago. They just sell all their milk to Strauss, one of the organic producers. Their contract is only for so many gallons and I think about 100 cows takes care of that. Now they have 350. So, they're selling their milk to these organic pasteurizers but they're not contracting that says we will agree that we will give you this much every week or every month or whatever it is. They can stop at any moment and produce their own.

Q: Why is organic farms milk not organic?

A: Because he doesn't buy the organic feed. It's a little bit more expensive.

Q: What do the growth hormones look like on the fingers?

A: Oh, it's an aura thing that I see that is not... When I taught nutrition, only about three people out of 15 could see what I saw of that particular thing. There's a lot of other things that nobody could see and that's when I realized that it was a particular faculty I had to see all those things where some people could see some and most could not see, you know, 70% of what I see. So, it's an intuitional.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I can see it in the hand but other people don't see it, what I see.

Q: So it's a gift you have?

A: Yeah.

Q: Are you gonna teach it at all?

A: No, because there are too many people who can't get it. So, I try to pull down the information to a perfectly physiological bare minimum, you know, perceptions and when I finish a book that will help do that and give people some measurement to go on like the mounds that everybody can see, the coloring and why it's not working. They can just see that, okay, the thyroid gland is okay but not all of them will be able to tell whether it's functioning properly unless they can see the coloring and identify the coloring. So, I will have everything that I can see in the book but whether a person will be able, has the faculties to be able to discern that from their perceptions depends upon the individual. But I will start teaching once that pedagogue is complete because then somebody will be able to go away from the class and say, oh yes, this is what he said about this, this is what he said about that because people left my class after a week, 8 hours a day for 5 days a week. They went back and that was a lot of information. It's on tape recorder but without the irises, without something to see, to remind them of what they were looking at at the time they didn't remember because what we did is I take people out to Venice Beach and I would pay these homeless to let us look in their eyes and in kind of code talk, you know, point out to the different toxins and the different conditions in the iris.

Q: You would say, this guy's liver is shot.

A: Exactly. Could you imagine what the poor guy would be like?

Q: You can't help but worry about it before you see it.

A: Right.

Q: What would you typically see when you see all various illnesses?

A: Oh, various. Incredible how varied it was with each person.

Q: Did you ever see somebody where you said, hey, you need to go do this now to keep from dying?

A: I wouldn't say that to somebody that didn't come to me. If I was reading somebody's eyes and they didn't come to me and I was using them as a subject, I would never say anything like that. Unless they have. One guy did ask.

Q: What did he ask?

A: He was a really good, he looked good physically, but you know, he did his drinking and he was a homeless person, pretty young, you know, like in his late 20s and thought he was infallible. Obviously he had some good growth hormones that continued with him. However, he had severe corking in his eye, which means that he's binding the advanced glycation end products were binding with the adrenaline and caking like plaque throughout his tissues. So the easiest way out is a heart attack. The hardest way out is multiple sclerosis. So he asked me, you know, what his condition was. So I explained that to him. He said, you gave me some real bad, fucking bad news, didn't you? I said, you asked, I never would tell you. I would have never told you that without giving you answers. He says, okay, what's the fucking answer? And I said, stay off of alcohol, eat lots of raw meat and lots of raw fats. You're out of your mind. I said, yep, I am. And he stormed away. So I, you know, I debate sometimes whether to tell somebody. Now, what most of the time I'll say is you don't want to know. You don't want to, you don't want to hear it. Yeah, that usually dissolves.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, exactly, yeah.

Q: What's the argument when you tell somebody about his diet, you know, hey, you know, people used to eat this way, you know, a thousand years ago. And they go, well, yeah, they only live to be 30 years old too, so.

A: That's a fallacy, complete fallacy. Yeah, such a fallacy.

Q: I read it was because of the dying in childhood. So it made the average lower. And if you got a broken arm, you died of it. And that sort of thing.

A: Not even that. People didn't die of broken arms.

Q: What was, was it Napoleon was the only guy with broken arms?

Q: Napoleon, no. Napoleon, Napoleon. [unintelligible]

Q: Who was it? Christopher Columbus?

Q: Oh, Maybe he had like a severe deficiency, [unintelligible] like sailors.

Q: Right, they didn't eat very well on a sailboat.

A: No.

Q: Do you know of any cultures that lives on a diet similar to what this one?

A: Well, the Eskimos lived 99.9% on animal meat, animal matter. And it was mainly raw until the Germans brought cauldrons for them to cook in. Because they had no way of cooking in that kind of climate. They had no metal containers. There were no cauldrons that existed. So it was all 100, pardon?

Q: Not much wood.

A: No. So it was, you know, everything was raw basically. And they had, and they had no dental caries until 1886. And that was in one of the Eskimos that lived in one of the colonies, the white colonies, and had been eating sugar and breads for 50 years. That was the first case of cavity. And the first case of cancer was until 1934.

Q: What was the average lifespan?

A: It was about what ours was. But you have to understand that if we, if they took our white people and put them in Alaska, most of them would die within about a year to three years in that kind of a climate. The Eskimo lived the exact age as we are up to 110 in that extreme temperature.

Q: Also, very little sunlight.

A: And the Maasai eat nothing but raw milk, raw blood. They mix it together and drink it and raw meat. And they have no disease. They're considered the healthiest, strongest, tallest, most agile race in the world. Very so smart that they won't even let the white man get within 20 miles of their villages. Every day they will march 20 miles to entertain the white people and do rituals for them. But then the government protects them that they will not, no white man is allowed within 20 miles of their villages. That's smart. Because they saw what it was doing to them. The white man was bringing candy, potato chips, and garbage, and they were getting ill, having digestive problems. And for us, that's no big deal. But with them, no illnesses and no diseases ever. Never a case of diarrhea or anything like that. And all of a sudden you start having this. You want to stop it right away if you're smart.

Q: What color are their eyes?

A: Amber. A beautiful yellow. 

Q: What is your take on royal jelly, the product from the beehive?

A: It's wonderful. It's what the bees eat for the first three days of their life. It's only what the queen eats. It's only that.

Q: From what I understand, it stimulates the pituitary glands to produce hormones.

A: Well, actually, it has some actual growth hormone stimulants within it, not just to the pituitary. So if you take like a BB-sized amount of it and eat it every time you eat meat, you're going to increase the regenerative effects of your meat.

Q: How do you keep growth hormones alive in your body?

A: Well, I think that you would your entire life if you didn't leech from eating cooked foods.

Q: So, if you kept on a nice raw diet, you'd be abundant with growth hormones.

A: Right, for your entire life probably. You know, there are the fable of those people who did, you know, live on raw foods and they lived, you know, a thousand years. I don't know if that's possible. But we should be living to at least 147. Because all other creatures live seven times the time it takes them to finish maturation. For us, that's 21. So we should be living to 147. We're not even living half that. Most of us, most of the people out there.

Q: Is the way you see when you're looking at someone similar to like these medical intuitives such as Cheryl and Miss. Because some people have...

Q: How many years?

A: I think that everybody could develop it if they wanted to because I certainly didn't have that faculty.

Q: The ability to diagnose intuitively?

A: Well, I don't diagnose. I'm not a doctor. I analyze.

Q: Do you feel like this diet has something to do with helping to develop those abilities? 

A: It does in almost every person who goes on it develops their ability.

Q: That's one of the reasons why I'm, besides the physical health reasons, I'm trying to pursue this.

A: Yeah, there was, everybody I've known has developed, you know, psychically that way. Some do it incredibly well. I think the longer you're on it, the more your, you know, your whole, the neurological system is intact and the more you can receive. I'm very limited in what...
