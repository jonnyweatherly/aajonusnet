A: My name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz and I'm here to talk about health. For people who need credentials, I just got my Ph.D. in August in nutrition at the University of London because I didn't want anything to do with the American medical profession. They can't say, well, you've got to do it our way. This is the way we teach it. And I say, well, I didn't learn it here. I didn't learn it there either. What they did was they gave me an honorary doctorate for my books and then I had to do some testing. And they said that it was extraordinary research. So they were very delighted. They interviewed 20 of my patients. Can you imagine interviewing patients to get your doctorate? So anyway, I'm now a doctor. I can't say that means a lot to me. Thank you. Anyway, I got into health because I was a very sick individual. I was born very unhealthy into a very violent household. I had a brother who was 18 months older than I and he was still in diapers when I came home from the hospital. And he was very unhappy that I took all of mom's attention away. So he made sure that I suffered on a daily basis. And he used to push me on anything that was rusty. Because my mom's a nurse and, of course, rusty anything makes her think of lockjaw. Made her think of lockjaw. So off to the doctor I would go or the hospital I would go and get an injection of tetanus. Now in those days, tetanus was supposed to last a year. You know, now they say it lasts even longer. But my mother was, if three months had gone by without a tetanus shot, I'd get one if I'd come close to anything rusty. So my brother made sure that I got lots of tetanus shots. They would always make me very sick for weeks at a time afterwards. And my mother would never know whether I was getting lockjaw or having a reaction from the vaccine. There was always a vaccine. The third one that I got, I got when I was 18 months old and it shut off the communication center so I became autistic, developmentally autistic. So I was not able to understand language, never put it into a context of comprehension. So by the time I was eight I learned to parrot sounds. So if somebody said something to me enough, I got the gist of it. Something I heard very frequently from my parents was, be quiet. Not to me because I never said anything, but to my brothers. I had three brothers. Pay attention... And because I was autistic I had that tendency, because I didn't understand anything, to not listen and pay attention to people anyway. So I just dripped off and then it was slap on the head, pay attention, pay attention. So I was not allowed to have the behavior of your normal autistic child. So it forced me to be borderline autistic. In other words, I had the attention span of a normal person, but I had the inability to communicate with language nor understand it. Emotionally, and I guess intuitively, I could definitely understand the emotionality where somebody was coming from. Whether they were angry or hostile or whatever it was. So I basically knew what people were saying to me, but if I had to respond to something that was addressed to me, some question, and I would always pitch out some kind of response that I had heard. Like, I am, I understand, totally without understanding, and then of course the conversation would go on and I couldn't respond. I'd respond with the same remarks and I'd get slapped around, beaten by the nuns and the priests because I wasn't paying attention and I wasn't obeying them.

And they didn't have any idea about children who were developmentally autistic, mainly it was people pre-vaccine days that were born autistic, and then the developmentally autistic was not a common event and they weren't even acknowledging it in the late 40s and 50s when I was a child. So, it was very difficult for me when I got into school. When I was eight years old I had to help enough repertoire to keep from being hit too much. And I always picked a very smart, sensitive girl to sit next to so I could copy her hieroglyphs off of her page because that's all it was. I mean, translating the hieroglyphs from over there to here. There were not even the proper letters because I didn't understand. I was just copying designs. So, that's the way it went on. When I hit 12 years old... And I had to stay with my mother. I couldn't go play with the other kids. I couldn't play sports. I was too ill. I would keep a cold three to five months a year on the average. Sometimes six to seven months. So, I learned how to cook. I learned how to sew. I learned how to paint and do stuff like that. And then when I hit 12, I was diagnosed with appendicitis. And I had actually had peritonitis, which was a perforated, bleeding, small intestine. And they went in to take out the appendix, found it in great shape, took it out anyway just in case it caused me trouble in the future. And that's the consciousness of the medical profession to this day. So, from there, after that, I mean, I got injections probably every two to three hours. Once in a while, maybe four hours, but that may have been because I was asleep. And so, desperately in a coma sometimes, so they didn't know that they may have shot me out more. But at the end of that five days, I was swollen black and blue all over and in severe pain. And that affected me from then because in every, I don't know how many of you know, in 96% of the vaccines that are manufactured, there are 76,000 trillion molecules of mercury. And if you don't know, mercury is the most lethal neurotoxin that is known to the human nervous system, any kind of animal's body. If you go to Calgary University in Canada, they did a DVD which shows neurons growing, you see all these beautiful neurons making their patterns, they drop a 2% solution of thimerosal. Thimerosal is the liquid mercury that is put into vaccines and you can see it just starts dissolving the neurons, taking them apart like that. It's only a 2% solution. So you can imagine a vaccine, and they're saying that your problem is the mercury in your fish. The mercury you get in a fish isn't even a fraction of a hundredth of a percent of what you get in one of those vaccines. Children here in Illinois are getting something like 128 vaccines by the time they're 16 years old. So do you know how many neurotoxin molecules are in their system? We've only found in laboratory tests, only found in the first 24 hours, 7% is relieved in the urinary tract and 24% is relieved in the bowels. That's the maximum. And then after that, one half a percent for the next few days and that's it. That means about 30% of all of those 76,000 trillion molecules remain in your body for a lifetime. 

And let's say it comes out at one particular time in your, let's say, small intestine. What happens? Your body cannot seal, cannot heal. The tissue will not bind together. So it leaves an ulceration, which is what I got at 12 years old. And it caused a lot of other problems elsewhere in my body. So by the time I had 15, I got angina pectoris, which is a heart disease of octogenarians. And that means muscle spasms in and around the heart. So I probably had about 300 non-possibly fatal heart attacks from the age of 15 to the age of 22, and 50 near-fatal heart attacks, which I never got therapy for. I would pass out in school if I had a heart attack and just lie there. They could not find anything wrong in the heart, so they didn't know what was causing it. Of course, the medical profession doesn't look towards poisons. They always look to something natural. Well, is the fat in your body causing a problem? Is there some microbe? Well, how about pollution? How about chemicals? We know the damage that it does. They never look for it unless forced to. Never look for it. I'll give you an example. I had a patient die a year ago of breast cancer. A patient that I never thought would die. She gained almost enough weight to get to a normal detoxification of cancer. Remember, cancer is nothing other than the dead cells, the inability of the body to dissolve and get rid of dead cells. But you have to consider what damaged that cell and killed that cell. Normally not something natural. It had to be some chemical, some industrial pollutant. When people start dissolving these tumors, there is a waste product that is full of this chemical that caused the problem in the first place, and the body has to deal with it. So I took her vomit and had one of them analyzed. The laboratory called me and said, somebody's poisoning your patient. I said, what do you mean? He said, well, there's 3,000 times the lethal dose of thallium in that vomit. And thallium, for those who don't know, is a metallic mineral like lead, almost as soft as lead and almost as toxic as mercury. 3,000 times the lethal dose. She was a jewelry maker. And she had, you know, her Bunsen burner going there and melting the, softening the metal as she bent it and shaped it. No mask, no gloves. Seven years. Stored in her body, all up into the lymph glands and went into her hand, into her hands and arms, and into her lungs, all into these lymph glands that gave her breast cancer. By the time she stopped her vomiting, the cancer was all gone in the breast, but she was too thin to recuperate. She couldn't eat. It would harden the liver and she died. There was no cancer cell that killed her, no cancer killed her, no microbe killed her, thallium killed her. Toxic industrial elements killed her. The only way you can get thallium in that kind of concentration is in metal. So whenever you have a disease, you'll know that 90% of the time it will be, and if it's any kind of a serious thing or near fatal, any type of extreme or chronic condition, it's an industrial pollution that's caused it. The minor things that happen from organic toxins that form are about 10% of our diseases, and none of them are lethal.

Gout, arthritis, rheumatism, those kind of things can develop from cooked foods, and we'll talk about them a little bit later. So at 15 and a half, I started having angina pectoris and diabetes. Diabetes in my family is pretty normal. On my mother's side, I had eight cousins who were diabetic by the time they were almost 16 years old. So it wasn't unnatural that I would not get it, but it was very difficult. By the time I hit 16, I had almost leukemia, just diagnosed as anemia. I was very lethargic all the time. I had to smoke cigarettes, so I started smoking heavily at that time. I started having problems earlier as young as eight years old, so I started smoking when I was eight to give me a boost. By the time I hit 16, I was doing two packs of Lucky Strike non-filter a day. I loved smoking, and I would smoke today if it weren't unhealthy. My mother used to look at me and say, stop smoking like that. You look like a fiend. I would take that thing and I would draw. That end of that would just get an inch hot long. I just felt the burn. I was so numb from all the drugs and all the pain and all the illness. That was a nice sensation. I was heavily into it. It also gave me a pickup, but I had to keep doing it like every hour or every half hour almost just to stay awake. Then I would have to drink alcohol at night to be able to calm down enough to go to sleep, and I drank 11 cups of coffee a day. That's the state I was in. Coffee and cigarettes in the day to keep me awake and somewhat alert, and then the alcohol at night to help me sleep. By the time I was 19... Well I don't wanna leave this out. I found a girl who was very, very smart, got top grades in school. She got an award for being one of the best students in the school. I was autistic. I was an idiot, and she loved me. I wondered who was the idiot. Of course, I had a good heart, but I was raised in a very violent household. Everything was dealt with on a violent level. Yelling, screaming, accusations, that is the way everything transpired in my family, everything. There wasn't a tender moment unless somebody was having a heart attack or diarrhea or vomit. Then there was a little compassion. My father put us in the hospital. He put me in the hospital quite a few times. He put a nine-iron three inches in my skull one time. My mother is a nurse, so she knew she was going to have to... He fell down the stairs in that shape, a nine-iron to the skull. People are pretty gullible when you want them to. My father put me in the hospital a few other times. He broke both my eardrums because I didn't listen. Not that I was autistic. He didn't understand that. He just thought because I didn't do what he said, that I just didn't do what he said because I was being belligerent or a problem. The priests did that to me too. They beat me all the time because I didn't do what they said. So when I got expelled the first day of my sophomore year from a Catholic high school, it was the biggest blessing in the whole world. I went to public high school and the first thing this guy, this man who was interviewing me, and I'd learned enough by then, I was a sophomore in high school, I got enough dialogue going on, I could just flip something back and forth. He said, what do you want to do? Nobody had ever asked me what I wanted to do, ever in my whole life. 

This man asked me, and this was a public school, and I thought, oh my gosh, this is impressive. I don't want to go to school. He said, you have to go to school. I knew what all that meant. To break it down into words, of course I still couldn't spell it, I couldn't comprehend verbs or adjectives or nouns or any of that. It was just completely beyond my mind's ability to grasp it. In this public school I met this wonderful lady and she loved me. She was a year older than I. We wanted to get married, of course nobody would let us get married, so we got her pregnant, purposely, so we could get married. So we got married, because you couldn't do anything about it then, especially with my parents being Catholic. Of course you can't go out and have an abortion or anything like that. It was pretty cut and dry, so by the time I was 16 I was married, had a child at 17, divorced at 19. I had to go to school, I had to take care of the baby in the afternoons while she went to work. She came home and I go to work. So school, take care of the baby, go to work. I was not happy. I was sick all the time. I had to even smoke more, I was smoking sometimes three packs a day, just to keep my energy level up. Same about 10 to 11 cups of coffee a day. Heavy, heavy alcohol. I was up to a fifth of gin at night to be able to sleep. So of course the marriage did not last. She was not going to stay with a complete loser and I was a complete loser. I moved to California where an uncle said he would help me out. So I heard that California was the promised land. Those are little key words that I understood, the promise of something big. Even though in a literal sense I did not understand what that was. I went out to California and I was very blessed and I had, like most autistic children, I had an idiot savant side. So when I graduated from high school, my mother took me to a brand new school that taught computer programming. Computer programming did not mean anything to me when I heard the sounds. My mother took me and one of my brothers and they tested us. It was unlike any test that I had ever had before. They tested me on figures and shapes and mathematics. There's a few chairs scattered around. Right here. They gave me a mathematical problem which I knew the answer to. I got this a lot in school. I did not have to cheat on mathematics. I would look at the problem, not understand a thing about it, but I had the answer. The only thing I did not cheat on was math. That was the thing I always got accused of cheating on was math because I could not give them the how of deriving the answer. How I came to that answer I could only give them the answer. It was all I could write. I had that ability with computer programming. They gave me a program to write. I did not have a clue to this day how I would do it and I just wrote it. It would take me an hour, maybe a few hours to write a program that would take them months or a year to write and debug. They took me into the school and they tutored me through it. They were just teaching me the symbols where they belong and I was good with patterns. I guess it goes along with taking the sounds and using them back.

Patterns of sounds. So I made a lot of money. They put me in big companies and they always had somebody with me to write everything in the English language. When I moved out to California I was placed with Time DC, the third largest constructing company in the world and Carte Blanche Corporation. So here I was an idiot making all of this money but a very sickly person at the same time. I developed an ulcer at 19. All the alcohol and smoking and everything was drying out the mucous membranes and then they became ulcerated. So I was vomiting blood, a tremendous amount of it. The doctor gave me lots of Maalox. I drank lots of Maalox sometimes, a couple of bottles a day, sometimes two bottles a week. It turned me into a chalk bathroom. I decided that wasn't working very well but by the time I decided that, a tumor had developed next to the ulcer. So the doctor said well we're going to have to remedy that by giving you a vagotomy pyloroplasty, which means they're going to go in and sever the vagus nerves through the stomach. So I would no longer have vagus nerves through the stomach and never again secrete hydrochloric acid, which means they put me in the category of octogenarians, 80-year-olds, who don't secrete hydrochloric acid and can't digest much of anything. So they rendered me that at 20 years old with that surgery. And they told me, which I didn't really comprehend at the time, which is you'll never be allowed to eat even an apple. You have to steam cook anything. You have no hydrochloric acid, bacteria or parasites will go in and kill you. So I understand no cooking, raw, I understood that everything had to be cooked. And I hated cooked vegetables. My parents used to force me to sit at the dinner table until I finished my vegetables. But I could projectile vomit with certain vegetables. I mean, I could hit that wall over there with cooked broccoli or Brussels sprouts. Peas, maybe I could hit you. And carrots I could probably hit you. And that's the way it went. Different cooked vegetables would make me projectile vomit. And it was every one. It wasn't just some that I could get by with. Even cooked corn would cause a problem. Corn on the cob was great, I could do that as long as it wasn't cooked and fresh and sweet. But that's not a vegetable, it's a fruit. So I had a very difficult time in eating at all. I just liked meat and potatoes. After the surgery I couldn't digest meat anymore, no hydrochloric acid. So the meat, cooked meat would go into my system. The next morning I'd wake up with pustules. Anybody see Liar Liar with Jim Carrey? He's got that scene where this guy's got this zit on the end of his nose and you know it's about ready to pop in your face? Well I had those all over from head to the knees, back, shoulders, thighs, stomach, face, everywhere. So when I realized that every time that I ate meat that occurred within the overnight it would happen. So I realized that I couldn't eat meat so I stopped eating meat. So I lived on donuts and I loved powdered donuts and RC colas and that's the spell that I ate. Soda pop, alcohol, cigarettes and donuts. Pancakes, stuff like that. That's what I lived on. So I wasn't getting any better.

I was getting sicker and sicker and sicker. So within two months of the surgery the incision keloided, which means it became tumorous, up to about three quarters of an inch high up to inch and a half, almost inch and three quarters wide in some areas. So it was growing quickly. So they said now we've got to irradiate that to stop it. So I had ten weeks of intense radiation therapy. Have you ever taken clay? Do you know how malleable it is? What happens when you fire it? It's solid. That's what they did to my spine. So this was my movement. That's how I could move. To sit in a chair could take me four minutes. It was so painful to get into a chair and sit. I couldn't touch my knees unless I was sitting and I could never sit up and sit straight because of that. They just fused the spine together by the irradiation therapy. They gave me blood and bone cancer, multiple myeloma. So the doctors were treating me very well. So then, with the radiation therapy with the multiple myeloma, cancer of blood and bone, they said, now we have to give you chemotherapy. You'll be dead in three months if we don't. At the time, it was, we'll help extend your life maybe. But what are the results of doing it? Of course, it was never explained to me. I wouldn't have understood it if they tried because I was still autistic and dyslexic. I went to the chemotherapy for three months. It wasn't intense like the ten weeks of radiation therapy, but I was bald, I was vomiting, and I had diarrhea all over the place. With the spinal fusion, I was completely paralyzed now from the pectorals down, so I crawled on the floor on my elbows. I had quite a bit of money saved because what does an idiot spend money on? I didn't think about boats. I was never into sports because I was so sickly there was nothing I could do. So what was I going to spend money on? I knew nothing about investments or anything, but I had enough money. Even though I was getting chewed up during this time, doctor bills and everything, I still made them eat $80,000. I had to pay them for their efforts to help. I had this house in Beverly Hills that I was renting, a very nice two-bedroom house, and I had to live on the living room floor. I was defecating and urinating in pots and pans and bowls and jars. I had two volunteers that would come in from the hospice. The hospice was first created in 1968. That was the first time that hospices came into being. Two volunteers came to help me out two or three times a week and shopped for me, prepared food for me, cleaned the house and cleaned me. It was pretty bad because they had to empty all the stuff that was sitting around, the urine and defecation, so the house was just, stunk all the time. There was no way that I could crawl on the floor and keep moving all the stuff. It would just splash all over, so that didn't work. It would take me thirty minutes to get from here to the back there in the corner because I'd pass out every few feet and then wake up because I'd be so exhausted. So that's the way I lived for almost two and a half years. One of the volunteers was a seventeen-year-old African-American. He was about six, three. He had lied, said he was eighteen years old, to be chosen to be one of the group called The Going Thing. It was a musical group. They worked for Ford Motor Company and toured all over the United States singing. 

He was the youngest, tallest African-American kid. He was one of the volunteers that was helping me, a great-hearted person. He kept throwing carrot juice in my face and said this would help. He said something, as I remember back then. He said this woman reversed her uterine cancer, cured herself of uterine cancer by drinking a gallon of carrot juice a day and thought of carrots. I knew carrots were vomit, because I never had raw carrots nor carrot juice. It turned me off when I heard the word carrot. I didn't want anything to do with that stuff. After a while, he just kept on me, trying to sip it, sip it. Finally, I sipped it. It was the best tasting stuff I had. I thought, oh, this is good. I stopped drinking the RC Cola. I had donuts and carrot juice, cigarettes and my alcohol. I was drinking a lot of the carrot juice, probably about half a gallon a day. Within ten days, I woke up one morning and I understood language. I understood each letter of the alphabet. I understood how it all worked. I understood that there were nouns and adjectives and verbs. I thought, oh, what are they? I realized how I could construct and put all that together. I got out some books that I had had, attempting to do some kind of comprehension. I realized language. I called the kid, Steve, the volunteer, and I said, I have no money right now. I said, will you take me to a bookstore? I'd like to get a lot of books on nutrition and health. He said, sure. So he put me in a wheelchair. He put me in his Mach 1. They gave him this really spicy Mach 1 from Ford Motor Company. It's convertible, so he could put me in there in a wheelchair and all that. So we went there and I spent $110 on books and that was in 1969. You'd get a hardback book for $1.95, a softback book for $.25 to $.95 max. So I got a lot of books for $110. One of them was Siddhartha. Once I realized that I could start reading, I called my uncle and he was surprised that I was having a conversation with him beyond the normal comprehensive dialogue stuff, sound bites to me. He said, I want you to get a book called Siddhartha. He says, you're a diehard Republican asshole and your heart needs to open up. That was the first book I read. It was only like 82 pages and it took me a whole week to read it because I was in the dictionary constantly trying to figure out everything from my first book read. So I learned a lot about reading in that book. I also learned a lot about people and nature and that there was an other nature besides my diehard, mean, military-minded, hard-ass family. So it did change me in a big way, emotionally, physically, mentally. One of the other books I got in there, even though it was about diet and nutrition, talked a lot about mind over matter. I thought hmm, that's appealing. I can go back to my donuts, my waffles, alcohol, cigarettes. I don't have to think about them anymore because everything I read kept taking me more and more away from all those things I had been doing habitually. And I was doing them habitually to function. And here, you know, there was a lot of withdrawals, there was a lot of pain, there was a lot of anxiety, because I still wanted all of that stuff, although I was trying to stop. Of course, the cigarettes, alcohol, that was pretty easy after the surgery. But the cigarettes was painful. I mean, I loved smoking.

So I thought mind over matter, I'm there. I was an idiot all my life and here I was able to all of a sudden read. I must be genius if I can read, you know. So I thought I'm ready for mind over matter. So I stopped drinking the carrot juice, went back to my donuts, cigarettes, everything heavily again. In about nine, ten days, I was back in autism. Oh God, you know, it's like being blind. You're looking for the light switch. Where did it go? I knew that I had light here. I knew that I could see images and that's what it was like looking for languages again. I couldn't put my finger on it anymore. So it was devastating. So of course I went back to drinking the carrot juice and eating more of the so-called health foods of the time, 1969. And probably it was another ten days to two weeks, autism shut off again. I was able to read and comprehend again. So I thought, well, there'll be another day when I'm evolved and I'll get to that, but right now I have to follow some kind of a diet. So a year went by and I came to that place again. I said, now I'm Superman. Now I can do that stuff. I don't have to follow the diet like these weak people do. I'm much more spirited. I'm much more spiritually involved now. So I went back to eating garbage food again and within about a week, ten days I was back into autism again. I said, okay, I may be ignorant, but I'm not stupid. Obviously this machine does not work properly up here on that other food in that other way. So I said, I'm going to have to take care of my diet probably for the rest of my life. And maybe every 10 years I might try it again. And every time I've eaten less meticulously, I've always suffered, but I've never gone back into the autism again because I never go back to eating donuts. So everything for me was an evolution of getting to the point where I am now. And getting out of that crippled stage took almost two and a half years. So when I hit 27, that was 21. When I hit 27, I had been mainly a raw fooder from 72 to 76. 73 is when I decided that I'm not going to learn or reverse all of my conditions, I'm not going to learn how to be optimally healthy from anything from our society because every book contradicted every other book. So everything was bad for you and everything was good for you. So everything was confusing. So I decided I'd go off and live off of a bicycle in a sleeping bag in the wild with the animals and Indians and stuff like that and find out what truly worked health-wise. So I did. I went off on a bicycle, living off the land all over North America, all the way from the Yucatan up to Alaska and across the United States five times. Lived with four different Indian tribes, lived with alligators, chipmunks, all kinds of different creatures, swam with alligators every day, lived with coyotes to find out what it was. And no animal in nature eats cooked food unless a man gives it to it. And a lot of those animals will snub their noses at it and just leave it, except for dogs and cats. And it's mainly because they're starving. Because I throw it out to the coyotes and they wouldn't get near it. They wouldn't eat the garbage, nor would the wolves. So they had a discerning nature not to do it. So I was looking for the answers, and the four Indian tribes, it was the Mayan, the Yaqui, both in Mexico, the Sioux I lived with in Dakota, South Dakota, and then the Inuit in Alaska.

There was another tribe, but they were almost the same as the Sioux in Canada. And they all told me raw meat is what you need. I said, you know, wait a minute, I'm already evolved spiritually in this situation where I won't hurt another animal. I won't kill an animal for my sustenance, nothing. And I wouldn't need even dairy at that point. I started off in 72 as a complete raw fooder, February 72, as a lacto-ovo vegetarian, I eat raw eggs, I eat raw dairy. And then when I went off on the bicycle, I wouldn't eat raw dairy either. So I was a fruitarian. And that was pretty good for me coming from where I had been because I'd never had any energy unless I was smoking cigarettes or drinking coffee. And the sugar, the high sugar in all this fruit made me manic. And to me that was good energy, high energy. Of course I'd pass out because I was diabetic, you know, in another hour or two because the sugar level would be sky high and then drop completely. So it was always up and down. I was passing out all the time. But it felt good to me because I had all this high natural energy and I thought I was evolving and evolving. So the Indians kept telling me raw meat is what you're missing. And at the end of two and a half years of living outdoors, I was in Alaska in early September, end of August, early September, and it was 1975, no 1976, and they had dug up, they had a festival and they dug up a lot of these hides, hides wrapped around this moldy, stinky, foul smelling stuff. It was green, it was black, it was yellow, it was orange, all these molds. And I had no idea that meat turned colors like that. I thought it was some kind of degenerative vegetation that did that. I thought from my exposure in society was that meat turns into worms and decomposes and is gone, and that's it. I didn't know that it molded, turned gangrene or anything like that. I knew that people turned gangrene because I saw in my diabetic family their limbs would be amputated, but I didn't know that meat would do that. So when they were telling me this was raw meat, high, they called it high meat, and that meant hide bacteria gives you high energy is what the Eskimos interpreted their word for hide. The children would smell that stuff, they'd jump up and down with this joy and excitement, and the adults were all happy smelling it, and I wanted to projectile vomit. It was horrendous. They kept saying, this is what you need, this is what you need, and I was willing to try anything because the pain was getting excruciating again, the multiple myelomas coming back with a vengeance. So if the temperature dropped below 50 degrees, I was paralyzed in pain in every bone, especially in the right hip and the right elbow and shoulder, and I mean excruciating pain. I could barely breathe in the pain if the temperature dropped below 50, and it was September in Alaska, and it was getting that cold. 

So during the day, of course, I would bundle up with several plastic sleeves inside my sleeping bag to completely contain the heat, but I would still have to wait for the sun to beat on my sleeping bag two hours before I would be able to be non-painful enough to get out of the sleeping bag and go get some food. So I decided that I would have about a large marble or ping-pong bowl-sized amount of this horrific stuff, so what they did was they took two cotton balls with musk oil and put them up my nostrils so I couldn't smell it, and I ate this stuff, and for three days I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in 45 minutes instead of two hours. I said, oh, this is impressive, so I kept on doing that. What was this herbal mixture? And they kept saying, no, it's raw meat and fat. I said, no, you're just trying to get me to eat raw meat. There's no way I'm going to eat meat. It's not going to hurt an animal and I'm not going to break out with pus all over my body. There's no way I was going to eat meat. They didn't give me the answer I wanted, and I was still painful, so I decided I wasn't going to bicycle back to California to the desert. I decided I was going to go fast myself to death and end it. I hadn't found the answers, so I was just walking. I hopped freight trains all the way back down to Southern California in the desert near Palm Springs, near the Salton Sea. I picked an old Indian burial ground to fast myself to death. A bunch of coyotes lived there in the canyon. They'd come down and play a game about midnight every night, wake me up and play the crazy game.

A: ...need a little levity, so that was helpful. One night after about two weeks they brought me a dead jackrabbit that they had killed, ripped it open from the throat down the stomach, laid it on my bare feet, and it was warm as hell. I said, here's the Easter bunny. They want me to eat this bunny. All of a sudden a whole repertoire of sound bites came back into my head from when my uncle was telling my brothers and cousins who were going rabbit hunting that if they killed a rabbit, they needed to cook it thoroughly. No pink, white meat at all. It all had to be brown and burned because if they didn't, there was some kind of organism in it that would cause them severe intestinal cramping and pain for two days and they would die of exhaustion, dehydration. I thought, two days, I like that. Two days, it's going to take me 40-60 days to die fasting. Here already I'm in dry heaves, I've got headaches, I'm in a desert, it's getting up to 120 in the day and I have to climb up into the caves to get out of the heat so my headaches wouldn't be so bad. It's freezing cold at night. It's like 80 degrees change from day to night. I decided two days, I'm going to eat this rabbit. I picked it up and started eating it raw. Ugh. It kept coming back up. I thought, okay, I'm going to go back to the dinner table at my parents' house, hour and a half a night, two hours sometimes, getting those vegetables down. I can do it with this rabbit meat. It took me about five minutes to psych myself into that, to start eating it. I learned to hold my breath so I didn't smell anything, chew it up enough without tasting it, swallow it, hold it, breathe very slowly through my nose and out of my mouth, just to get it down and hold it down. After about 15 bites, it became pretty tasty. So I started devouring it. In about an hour and a half, I ate three and a half pounds of this seven-pound jackrabbit. The coyotes shared the rest. They went off their way. I went back to my sleeping bag to die. I knew I was dying because I felt good. The only times I had felt painless and felt light, besides being drunk, was when I had near-death experiences. I died on the operating table twice, had to be revived, and then a recreational drug experience where my blood pressure dropped to the point where I died. I knew that leaving the body was the only time that I ever felt painless. Even on alcohol I wasn't painless, but during that experience I was painless. I felt really good. I felt like I was leaving my body. I was going back to the sleeping bag after eating that three and a half pounds. I went back in the sleeping bag and I woke up and I was not in the light. I was not anywhere else but in my sleeping bag. It only took me forty-five minutes to get out of the sleeping bag again. This lasted for about three days. I said, raw meat, I'm not broken out, not one pustulation, no nausea, not one cramp as I was promised from running that old tape that my uncle had said to my cousins. I had a vagotomy, so of course those microbes would have got through and gotten me. Nothing like that happened. So, I thought, that's the key, raw meat. That's just what they were telling me. All those three years and I had this concrete wall, a block about it, and this sidewinder and rattlesnake went right by me at that moment. I'd seen the natives do it many times.

They'd go up and put their foot on its head, pick it up right in front of the rattle, spin around, snap its head off, peel it back and eat it. You've heard of the old snake oil medicine, right? Snake oil is one of the most healing foods there is. In all of Latin America, snake is considered the most medicinal food that anybody can eat, most medicinal, any food at all, whether it's plant or animal. And the oils, it takes a lot, you have to ferment them to get the oil to rise, and a lot of people were selling other kinds of oils, snake oil, and that's why I got the bad rap, snake oil, but snake oil was true. So anyway, I picked up this, I went bare feet, right up on my foot on his head, it was crazy, and I picked it up in front of the tail, I mean in front of the rattler, whipping it around, I said, oh shit, what am I doing? I've never done this before, my arms are getting tired, and I'm swinging this thing around, he's gonna come back and bite me in the face. I said, what if his head doesn't snap off, what am I going to do? So as my arms were getting, shoulders were getting more and more sore, I decided I better take the chance, I'm gonna die or it's gonna die, snap, the head just went right off. Peeled it back, started eating it, it's got a lot of bones, and it does not taste like chicken raw, it tastes like fish. So, just a lot of bones in it, so there were two cats on a farm that was about a mile away, and I don't know how they smelled it, but they were right there with me, eating the snake with me, and it really made me feel differently. It just eased all of my bone pain. You know, multiple myeloma is cancer of the bone, and when those tumors and things develop in the bone, you can't move anything without pain, you get cold at the same time. It's like having rheumatoid arthritis magnetized a hundred times. And that snake, within an hour of eating about half of that snake, I ate about two and a half feet of that snake, and I felt really good. So, I mean, I started trapping birds and eating eggs and, you know, lizards and scorpions and tarantulas, and there's not a lot of meat on those things. You know, chipmunks can take all the skin off, and what do you got? You know, a little something about like this, you know, five or six bites of food, and you have to eat the bones with it. If you don't, you're going to starve to death. So, I decided I had to go and eat normal food. So, I hopped on my bicycle, went around to all the farms, made deals to milk cows, milk goats, to shovel manure, to do any kind of chores in exchange for raw meat and raw dairy, cream, milk, butter. In about three and a half months, I looked like a scaled-down Arnold Schwarzenegger. I went from 118 pounds to 160 pounds, and I mean I was big. In that few months, my whole system here grew. As a child, I never developed in the shoulders, only in the hips. They called me Fatty Arbuckle, and I was shaped like a Jewish pear. My father's a Jewish, my mother's Catholic. I got so much guilt in my family, you had to go see the accountant before you could see the rabbi or the priest. So... Here I am, 38 years later, and I was supposed to be dead at 21. I just started my 60th year last week, so I was supposed to be a dead man, and here I am. It's all worked. I went back to Los Angeles to spread the word, and they all said, raw meat? You're eating raw meat? Are you crazy? You're going to get a brain fluke and be an idiot.

I said, well, I've been there and done that most of my life. I only feel good eating this way, so this is the way I'm going to continue eating. Every time somebody saw me eating either a raw lobster or raw oysters or raw chicken, turkey, no matter what it was, you're going to get a brain fluke. You're going to get parasites. You're going to get sick. I heard that for two years, and then I started getting frightened myself. Am I going to be in the state like I was with autism? Is it going to hurt me? For thirteen years, I thought, every time I ate it, I hope this isn't the time. Always that tinge of fear. Then after thirteen years, never a parasite, I realized, wait a minute, I've got a vagotomy, no hydrochloric acid in the stomach, I've eaten raw meat, even one time I came off of a forty-five day fast, forty-two, I can't remember after fasting that long the brain goes. I stopped the fast on a Sunday evening, Sunday night, and there were no stores open, so I hit the garbage cans in supermarkets. No food, I couldn't find any food, they'd all been dumped or something. So I remembered this fish market. So I went to the fish market and there was lots of fish there in the garbage can. Pulled it out, took it home, I get it home, unwrap it, I got salmon undulating with pinworms, undulating with pinworms, in and out, they're just weaning in and out of it. I said, I'm hungry, I've got a headache, I just can't think, you know, I had to eat this. So I pulled out the real long ones, you know, about five of them and all the rest of them were no longer than that. So I ate them and I ate, it was just all worms and meat, I mean, couldn't get all the worms out of it. So I probably ate about maybe a hundred thousand pinworm eggs and probably a couple hundred worms along with two pounds of salmon. And, you know, then the next day when I woke after feeling good, I said, oh Jesus, what did I do? I said, now I've done it. So I went to a friend of mine who was an MD and I said, hey, here's what I did. He said, well, let's have your feces and urine and blood checked right away. Ten weeks, we checked everything. Not one parasite, not one. I thought, wait a minute, wait a minute. Then after a few years later, you know, it's probably like seven years later when it dawned on me, this is 13 years of worrying. I said I was just lucky that time. He said I was just lucky. After 13 years of never getting a parasite, I realized that it was probably fiction. Another fabrication of the medical industry and scientific industry. It's an industry. They think because they're very high on the intellectual plane that whatever they think is probably true. If they think you get parasites from eating raw meat, probably what happened. That's just that mentality. So I decided I went to UCLA, I went to USC, I went to Stanford where I had alumni there. I did go to Stanford and got very good grades later on in my life. I went to Dartmouth, I went to Yale and Harvard. Guess how many tests that I found on raw meat produces parasites in animals? Zero, absolutely zero. Zero, zip, nil. None. So to say the least I was angry. I was angrier than when I was angry about surgery and all of that. So I started anytime a doctor would say anything to me about parasites, meat will create parasites, I said where do you have that information? Show me the test. Nobody could do that and I said you need to think about that. I've done it for so many years and never got one parasite. Not one. Here I am 38 years later from my death sentence.

I'm the only person who's had multiple myeloma, that's cancer of the blood and bone, and lymphoma and lived over three months. It's been 38 years. It's pretty special isn't it? And I've never gotten a parasite from eating raw meat. And I don't know anybody on this diet who has. And I know that 11,000 people are eating raw meat on at least a weekly basis. And a lot of them are eating it on a daily basis like I do. So you have to get rid of all the myth. You have to get rid of everything you've ever heard about what is right and what is wrong health wise. Because it is all a bunch of crap. Crap is better for you than the stuff that you're getting. Because there's animals that thrive on eating crap. But the stuff stuff that you are living on thinking it's going to get you healthy is likely not to do it if you have a health problem. I'm not saying that people out there aren't thriving on a vegetarian diet and there are people who aren't thriving on McDonald's, but how many people don't have some kind of suffering, don't have some kind of pain, don't have some kind of disorder? If you have a disorder, there's something wrong in your system that could be corrected by my diet or it could be corrected by another diet, but none of those other diets work for me and most of those diets don't work for most of the people out there. I've only met eight people out of over 3,000 now in the last, you know, since I was a vegetarian that could live healthfully eating a vegan diet. Eight. And one of them hit 74 two years ago and all of a sudden his bones started disintegrating overnight. Guess what he went to? Started eating raw meat and raw dairy. Stopped the disintegration. Okay, this is the end of the lecture period, the free lecture period. What I'm going to do after this, I'm going to take a break and then we're going to have a workshop. Now the workshop will be where I help everybody understand how the human body works, how it functions, so that you all know how food affects you. Then we're going to get into the various foods and food types, how combining them works different times of the day to make sure that your body is the most functional, why it's more functional if you eat certain foods at different times of the day. So when you leave here in about six hours, and the workshop will take about six hours, that you will know how to pretty much help yourself. And if you have my books along with it, if you get the first book, which is We Want to Live the Primal Diet, it has over 230 diseases in it. And all the foods, all raw foods, they can help you reverse those conditions. And it's worked in at least 80% of the cases, in all cases. And I worked with 3,200 people before I finished this book and wrote it. So it covers a lot of people. So it's not just, hey, I can get 10 people, and 8 out of 10 people it worked for. We're talking about it working for thousands of people. So that book, in company with this one, which makes the foods very appetizing, there are 82 sauces in here, meat sauces that can be made in 3 to 5 different ways each, so that's 400 sauces. So to make your raw meat appetizing, if you want. So when you leave this workshop today, you'll be equipped with what you need to take care of yourself. Of course, if you have a severe health problem, then you can come to me, but I'm not after your money. I'll help you if I can. Most of the time I can.

And at the end of the workshop, I'll do mini readings for people. That means I look at the palms, almost like the Chinese system, and I look at how your glands are functioning, your bloodstream. That gives me a 50% view of what's going on in your system, and I'll give you different foods that I think will help you get started, so that it's easier for you to get started. For those who want something more complex, a very thorough view of what's going on in your body, I do private consults, where I take a photograph of your irises, both of them, blow them up on a screen this big, so we can pinpoint any spot in the eye, and it tells me where toxins are in your body, where you're healthy, where you're unhealthy, and we know what to pinpoint to make your diet more structured, to reverse that condition and strengthen your body. Most of the time, I can tell the problems you're going to have with different foods, so I know that the food's for you to avoid, and to have even in a raw form, so that it'll make it easier for you. The mini-readings are $30, take 6 to 10 minutes per person, the full consult takes an hour and 15 minutes, and that's $300, doing Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday, and I think we're booked all the way through to Wednesday. I only have two appointments left. Two appointments left on Tuesday, so then Wednesday, all the way through to Wednesday so far. The workshop after this is $80, and that's a 6-hour seminar, and that's pretty cheap. In LA, you pay $1,250 for a 6 to 8-hour workshop, so I'm making it very affordable for everybody if they want it. We're going to take a 10 to 15-minute break, go out and get some food, because it's going to be two and a half hours before, two hours and 15 minutes before I give you another break. For those who want to sign up for anything, see Sherry and pay her, and then get situated. Then return here, and we'll get started. Thank you very much for coming.

[break]

A: All right. As I said, we're going to first talk about the human body. As you know, the digestive track is the stomach and duodenum. They are one and the same. That's considered the first digestive track. Herbivores have two to four. We have two chambers in one. That's the stomach and duodenum. It's basically the same area as the stomach. What happens? A certain amount of enzymes are dumped into the food in the mouth when we chew. There's only one enzyme that's related to carbohydrate activity, and that's the ptyalin enzyme, and only the horse carries that. So we're part horse? Mainly we have bacteria in the mouth. The human has more bacteria than any carnivore, dog or cat. We have the greatest amount of bacteria. Again, that is best for digesting meats, all dairy products, animal products. There are something like 2,300 bacteria per million parts in our saliva, and in a dog and cat it's less than a third. So it's very prolific. We don't have the amount of hydrochloric acid they do in their mouth, nor in the stomach. They have 15 times more than we do. However, we have just as much hydrochloric acid that we secrete, but we do it mainly in the small intestines. So a lot of people will say, hey, we're vegetarians. We have these molars here for chewing vegetables, and that's not really true. Most of our teeth are cutting and tearing. Our bicuspids are for tearing and all the other teeth are cutting. We only have a few grinding teeth, and that's to crush the meat so we can swallow it. Look at your vegetarian animals, they have all molars. Everything's a molar. Theirs is all for grinding. They will swallow their food, they'll regurgitate, chew it some more, swallow. They'll do that seven times. We swallow one time, unless we're infants, we regurgitate and re-swallow. Basically our system is built and made for animal products. Our digestive tract is two and a half times smaller than any herbivore. They have one thirty times the length of their torso, we have one only twelve. They have sixty thousand times more enzyme to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fat and the protein. We're lucky if we digest three percent of that protein and fat from vegetables. Also, what happens if you put whole vegetables in the digestive tract? It over alkalinizes and neutralizes the acids in the digestive tract. So any dairy products, meat products that come into there, the digestibility is neutralized. So it interferes with digestion. We get into the bowel, we have E. coli. It's the prominent bacteria there and it's prolific. Hopefully it's prolific. Because E. coli is the final stage of protein digestion. It breaks the protein down into the finest amino acids and combinations, myriad of combinations to do many things. The consequence of that is that the E. coli synthesizes a mass amount of B vitamins to soothe the nervous system and strengthen the body. If that E. coli is damaged with colonics or enemas or eating whole vegetables, you compromise the health of your nervous system. You're going to be more anxious, you're going to be more unhappy. 99% of the people that I work with who have psychological problems have low bacterial levels in their body, especially E. coli.

That's why I said in my recipe book that if people eat high meat and high eggs they get instantly happy because it provides that bacteria and those predigested amino acids. It isn't necessarily the bacteria that's in the meat that influences your own bacteria or helps live in your body. It does not. The bacteria that lives in your body is very different from the meat bacteria that is predigesting that meat. It does help though because the meat is further broken down and more liquid so that the bacteria in your intestines can eat more easily and then if they thrive then they can reproduce better. But the direct transfusion of the bacteria in meat does not live in your intestines. It's a different kind of bacteria. It's an aerobic bacteria. The bacteria that's in our intestines is non-aerobic. The amino acids that are broken down and the whole myriad, like I said, of various ones help all kinds of functions, growth, hormonal. Anything that you do, eating and breathing, it helps all of the functions, every minute to large function that can occur. Keeping that environment happy is an important situation, keeping it thriving. The things that damage that are chemicals. You can breathe something. You can go in for a hairdo and get the aerosol hairspray and that can disrupt your bacteria, your E.coli for three months. It is that toxic. Hairspray is deadly. All of a sudden, let's say you're in that shop and they do nails in that shop. The nail polish, the polish remover is considered the most toxic available substance that isn't in an industrial situation. It is illegal to open a bottle of nail polish in an airplane or any closed environment. It is that toxic. If an airline stewardess or flight attendant smells some nail polish being opened, she will descend on you instantly. It is toxic. If you're in an environment where you get hairspray and nail polish permeating the atmosphere and you're inhaling it, you're going to damage a lot of things in your system. You have to be careful. The food you eat, pesticides, antibiotics fed to animals, industrial fertilizers, herbicides, all of those, if they get into the body, will damage that intestinal flora environment. If you get depressed, if you feel anxious about anything, you can better believe that you've got a low bacterial environment in that moment. Something could be stored in your body for a long time and be dumping into the colon at that time and it will cause destruction of those bacteria. All of a sudden your vitamin B production is lowered. Your amino acid absorption is compromised and you end up in that state. Best thing to do, suck an egg. Suck an egg every half an hour and start absorbing those poisons. Egg is the most absorbable food there is but I'll get into that when we get into foods. So, we've gone through the digestive tract. Let's take a look next at the bloodstream. What is the bloodstream supposed to do? We're told that it feeds every cell in the body, right? It's not it's job. The bloodstream is responsible for transporting oxygen into the system and transporting carbon dioxide out of the system. 

That is it's exclusive job and all of the air, the gases that are in the body is responsible for that. If it has to take on the job of transporting nutrients, guess what's going to happen? You're not going to be able to run 55 miles an hour like the Indians did. You're not even going to be able to run 12 miles an hour unless you're an athlete. That's what happens to the system. It gets weaker and weaker and weaker. Wouldn't it be nice to be able to run 55 miles an hour barefoot? It would be pretty tremendous, wouldn't it? Who do you know can do that? I've only seen one Indian ever do it. I saw him do it. He was running probably 45 to 50 miles an hour. But he was keeping right up with a horse that was on full gallop. We can't do that. We're taxing our systems and putting them to work in a wrong way. Who's responsible for feeding every cell in the body? The blood takes the oxygen and gases out. The lymph system takes waste out. The lymph system is also connected to the lacteal system in the digestive tract, through all the intestines. That feeds the lymph system. It's called the lacteal system because at that point it's all milky. It looks like milk. It's a milky white. When the lymph system doesn't get it, they take a lot of the nutrients out of it right away. Then it becomes more of a translucent substance. But that lymph system, if it's getting the nutrients from the digestive tract more than the blood is, then it's pretty obvious to me that the lymph system is responsible for feeding every cell in the body. We know it's responsible for eliminating all the waste. It's responsible for neutralizing the waste and eliminating it out of any part of your body that you can. If I were to compare the human body to any discharged organism, I'd have to say we're all assholes. Because the whole body is used to detoxify. The tear ducts, the earwax, the mucous membranes, the skin, the hair, the nails, everything has a high relationship of toxins in it. The body is constantly trying to eliminate. The vaginal cavity, the urinary tract, the bowel, everywhere the body will eliminate and the lymph system delivers that toxicity. If it can't, it may throw it into your connective tissue, hoping someday that you'll sweat or get into some kind of a situation where you perspire it out of the body. If it doesn't, it could collect and you create a myriad of diseases. Skin disorders, eczema, psoriasis, god forbid lupus, which is disintegration of all the connective tissue. All these parts are important functions to keep you well, to keep toxins and everything out of the system. What can we do to make them function properly? That's what we're going to talk about today, or I'm going to talk about today and you're going to listen. Now the nervous system, we know that's pretty general. It's just taking information, whether it's light, sound, or impulses, or electricity, and converting it into receptive areas where we receive it as different information and qualify it as different information, and then interpret it in whatever way that we do. Of course, that's all that it does. It just takes in electricity, conducts electricity, and exchanges light. How does it do that? Mainly through metallic minerals, aluminum, cadmium, lead, mercury, arsenic, thallium, very tiny trace amounts is all it takes. I can have a huge silver screen here and bounce a lot of light from it so it doesn't take a lot. 

That's why there's only trace amounts of those metals in all our food. Keep that nervous system where it needs to be. What happens if we can't conduct the light, we can't conduct electricity, we can't transmit the light to conduct electricity? The brain doesn't work properly. We have autism, we have dyslexia, we have senility, we have all kinds of problems. It just doesn't happen with the old, it can happen with the new. It can happen at any age, at any time. You can have one of those days where those words just don't come. Then the next day it will be fine. On the day that it's not working, there's a big disruption in functionality. The nerve has a myelin sheath which consists of 60% fat. The brain which consists of neurons and very few nerves consists of 60% fat, so you're all fatheads. That's a good thing. However, the problem with that is, guess where most of the poisons and toxicity stores in the body? In fats, in the brain. You can also call somebody a fathead garbage brain. You think about that and you get the idea what's happening when you're out there breathing in pollution. Most of the toxic metals that go in the body go into the nervous system and brain. We say, well, the brain has evolved in the last 10 years or 60,000 years that the brain has tripled in size in the human body, in the remains that we find. What has caused that? Cooking, firing pottery, being exposed to pollution. The brain has to get bigger and bigger and bigger to have areas that can function if it's getting more and more toxic. Other animals don't cause that kind of pollution to themselves so they don't need to develop a larger brain. Now, we men would be lucky if we could grow some vaginas because women will live 20% longer than men because women discharge 20% more mucus and with it 20% more toxins. So you've heard of penis envy? Well, we men have vaginal envy. So everything is backwards. Everything is backwards. You women should be happier. Men are a lot more toxic. You can store more fats than men. That means that the poisons would be more likely to go into your fat instead of your cells that would damage the RNA and DNA. Retard function. Weakened function. So women have an advantage and they need it of course as they are breeding children. Absolutely. Because every time they have a child in this environment they age 7 to 8 years like I said in my book. They are giving up 7 to 8 years of their lives if they did not grow up on a raw food diet. And they are not eating a raw food diet for at least 7 years before they have a child. You have to think about all the things that cause health. All of these are pertinent in the children too. A lot of people think oh, I'm feeling so good I'll have another child. And then after they have another child they go whoa, I got hit by a baseball bat, this is a big one this time. It may take them 7 or 8 years to recover to where they were before they had the child. And that's the way it is. You have to be conscious of limitations. You weren't raised like these tribes were on a completely raw diet. Now you say raw diet, okay, I've heard this before. I've heard this idea that enzymes are destroyed at about 118 degrees. Well, if I put a blow torch on you or put you in an oven for 118 degrees or 110 degrees, how long do you think you're in that oven at 110 degrees? You'd live. 

And how functional would you be at 110 degrees? Most people get into 102 degrees and they can't function. They go for air conditioning. A lot of people die if they don't have air conditioning in the summer in the humidity. If you don't have heat in the winter, you'd say, yeah, but you know, we must be getting healthier. We're living longer. How so? I remember the tombstones when I used to go to the small towns all outside here in Sheffield, about 110 miles west where my grandparents had a farm. Their people lived very old, very young. That's the same. Propaganda is good that we're living longer. More people are living, yes, and I see that mainly for a weather control, a temperature control reason. How many people die without air conditioning in the summer, humidity? Remember those blackout, three-day blackout in New York City? 230 people died in three days? That was of the heat prostration that they'd had. It wasn't a heart attack. It wasn't any other kind of death. That was heat prostration. 230 sick, something like that died of heat prostration in three days. Imagine it had gone a week. How many people die when there's an outing and they don't have heat? Massive amount of people would die. How do you think you would live if you were stuck in Alaska, butt naked in an igloo? Would you let your infants run around butt naked, crawling around on an ice floor? Do you think they're healthy enough to handle it? Be okay? Do you think they'd shrivel up? Think about how these tribes, how these people do that. Our society is so weak, incredibly weak and so sick that if we don't have our controlled environment, probably 80% of us would die. 80%. That's how weak this society is. 100 years ago it wasn't that way. Everybody was tough. Nobody had central heating. Nobody had central air conditioning. So to me, maybe there's some people living older, but they're certainly not living healthier. So we're here to find out how to do it. How can we allow the body to heat itself and cool itself then? In the blood, the body heats itself by thickening. So we have a spleen and the spleen holds excess blood. A lot of people think that the spleen manufactures red blood cells. Red blood cells are born in the bone marrow. In the fetus it's different. It goes into the kidney and then the bone marrow and finally in the bone marrow, and that's forever for the rest of life. After about 46 months, it's in the bone marrow always. For us, it's in the bone marrow. Bone marrow breeds red and white blood cells. It's an environment that allows cells to divide. That's how it's like there's me and all of a sudden there's two of me. Same size and everything. That's how we have more and more cells. Cells divide. They do it in the bone marrow and then they get into the blood and transport it to the blood. When the body wants to thin the blood, it'll take some of those red blood cells and put them in the gallbladder. I mean in the spleen. The spleen will hold it. Then if the body gets cold and it needs to thicken, the spleen will dump the red blood cells back into the bloodstream. The kidneys will take out some of the water. The kidneys have quite a job to do. They purify the blood. The only reason they purify it is because the kidneys have to eliminate water. That is their sole job, to remove water from the blood.

In that process, because of the high toxicity from cooked foods, especially uric acid and acrylamides, the kidney forms excess and poor ammonia, almost like a horse. It forms ammonia that strongly. The only other animal that forms that kind of ammonia, that high level, is a horse. A horse has a digestive tract that causes slow digestion. He doesn't break his pulp down really well, so he has to have all this liquid go in and disintegrate as much as it can of the fluid and of the fat molecule. If you compare a deer or a goat, which have similar, and a sheep, which have similar little balls, feces, you'll see that everything is very broken down. A horse eats differently. A horse eats mainly dried food. It's not eating fresh grasses as much. It likes dried food. Because it's highly toxic in its acids, it isn't alkaline like fresh grasses are. It has to produce a lot of ammonia so it won't damage the kidneys and the bladder. We shouldn't be doing that. We shouldn't have to create that kind of ammonia, but we are because of that high toxicity. The kidney's responsibility is to remove fluid. When it does it, it has to purify some of that blood as it goes through as a precautionary condition for the stability of the body. The blood should not have to be cleaned that way, but it is. The kidneys remove the water. Their job, when it comes time, is they remove red blood cells. They allow very few red blood cells to escape in urine. They use a lot of ammonia to help separate the blood cells from the rest of the fluid. When you urinate, you are really eliminating blood with very few red blood cells. Whatever is in the blood is in the urine. If you have healthy blood, you have healthy urine, except with a little bit of ammonia added to it or a lot of ammonia on your diet. There are many races which drink urine. They are mainly vegetarians or low meat eaters, low animal food product eaters. They don't get enough protein, so they have to recycle theirs. This is big in India. A lot of people, probably at least two-thirds of the population drink their urine because they don't get enough protein. That's not a bad thing. There are a lot of people, I've gone through times where I drank urine every day for four years and it certainly helped me when I was a vegetarian. Without it I wouldn't have survived. I did a test one time. I did a 32-day fast, nothing but water. I was drinking about two gallons of water a day. I went down to 96 pounds in 32 days. Then I did a fast to see how long I could do it and drank nothing but urine and no water. I went 45 days and only went down to 123 pounds. Big difference, huge difference. It didn't take me two and a half years to recover after the 45-day fast. It only took me a year and a half to recover. So fasting of any sort is not a good thing because the body eats itself. The bloodstream, if it goes without a regular supply of protein, the red blood cells become cannibalistic and they eat other red blood cells. It's like one day you just say, oh, I'm awfully hungry and you eat your buddy next to you. I'm awfully hungry, you're going to have to be my dinner. And that's what happens. The red blood cells start eating red blood cells. And you know how many hours that takes? Five.

If you're not eating regularly, if you don't eat every five hours, the protein level in the blood bottoms out where the red blood cells become cannibalistic. The toxicity that results is tremendous. Now the tribes, the Maasai, Samburu and Fulani who eat mainly all raw foods, they can go hours without having that problem because their red blood cells are healthy. Red blood cells can eat red blood cells and not have a problem. But when the red blood cells have been washed in the kidney with ammonia and they go through a lot of nitrate and benzene changes and benzoic acid changes and citric acid changes, there's a lot of toxicity in the cells. They start eating each other and it compounds it. So you have to eat every five hours something with protein in it. It doesn't mean grabbing a piece of fruit and eating it. Some kind of protein needs to be eaten every five hours to keep the blood strong. There's a lot of people that say, oh, well the blood revitalizes itself in three days or ten days. No, it doesn't do that. It takes sixty days minimum to regenerate every cell in the blood. Theoretically forty-five days if you were healthy, but none of us are very healthy so it takes a minimum of sixty days. Then it takes a minimum of how long to clean out the soft tissue in the body. Two and a half years to replace every cell. Then we have the cartilage, the more tougher tissues, the cartilage, the tendons. How long does that take? About four and a half years. We get to the bone, seven to seven and a half years. According to the work of Pottenger and Howell in their studies with animals who are diseased, it took them five generations on completely raw food diets to become optimally healthy again. So, if we relate that into cellular life regenerations, that means it takes us seven and a half years to replace every cell in the body one time. If it takes five generations, five times seven and a half is about 37 and a half years. So, you figure about 40 years on an all-raw diet and you will be completely well, as long as you haven't had any severe surgeries or you haven't had any chemical poisoning that's damaged the RNA and DNA in your body. But still, as healthy as you're going to get will probably be in about 40 years. You say, oh my god, I'm not going to live 40 years. Why would I wait 40 years? I want a magic bullet. My god, if you find a magic bullet, bring it to me. I've been looking all the years and there's no such thing, nothing out there. There's a lot of hopes for them, but nobody produces any because they're all chemicals. The body doesn't know how to handle chemicals properly. It'll do a makeshift thing and work at it for a while and improve for a little bit, but then the opposite seesaw happens. Creates a different kind of imbalance or damage in the system. It doesn't quite work. We have to keep alert about what does work in the body. If you're eating properly every meal, you're going to get healthier every meal. Some people say to me, oh my god, do I have to do fully 100% this diet? Can't I do a little bit of this and a little bit of that?

I said, if you only had one raw food in your whole life, you would be adding benefit to it because you're going to have vitamins, minerals, enzymes, everything in a nature that allows the body to relax and help itself. That's a pretty good way to look at it, isn't it? Every time you do something good, every time you give yourself some raw food, your life is going to improve. Of course, you have to look at the flip side of that, too. What happens if you cook food? You have chemical reactions. That's how chemistry works. Add a chemical, you add heat to it, all kinds of changes. What happened when they used radiation to destroy certain kinds of microbes or cancer cells in my body? It cauterized my spine. What did that do to me? Here the therapy created an invalid, a painful invalid. The cure was not better than the disease. I would have preferred to die. Not now, but back then the pain was excruciating 24/7. I had to live in a bathtub with milk and epsom salts in it or sea salt to levitate enough to give me enough buoyancy so I had very little pain so I could sleep. If I tried to sleep outside the bathtub, I'd sleep no more than 10 minutes at a time because the pain was excruciating. I'd wake up with a jolt. The pain was so bad. When I would lay in a hot tub with the buoyancy, it just kind of relaxed the body so there wasn't much pressure. I would sleep for an hour and a half. It was an old big cloth on the tub. If I got it hot enough before I got in it, the cast iron used to stay hot for a while. What I would do is fill the tub with scalding hot water and let it sit for about 10 minutes and then put chillier water in to keep it to a temperature that I could withstand, which is about 101, 102 degrees. Then I could fall asleep for an hour and a half, two hours. Mac would wake up before he's in water. Then I'd let a few inches of the water out and reheat it again and then go to sleep for another hour and a half to two hours or maybe only an hour. Then we'd get cold again. But the cold would only last for a few minutes until I heated the water again. So let's say I was cold for five minutes. That was better than being in constant pain. So I had to play with my disease to live with it. And it's not easy to live with a disease. And you don't want to go to some therapy that's going to give you another condition on top of the condition you're already dealing with. It's rather absurd. But that's the way the medical profession approaches it. Because they do not approach any disease from a perspective of let's make your body healthier and better. They say let's fix this problem and it's always a mechanical perspective. And it's all about attack. Any disease is because of microbes, the bacteria theory. And boy is that all wrong. And there's tons of evidence of it, but they don't give it up because their weapons are antibiotics and pills. And if they give that up they have nothing. Because the doctors don't learn anything about health. They only learn disease and chemicals. Disease and chemicals. That is it. So if you're going for help, why in the world would you go to somebody who knows nothing about it? It doesn't make any sense to me. So where are we going to go to do this? 

Well, we know that all animals in nature are healthy unless man's encroached upon it with their industrial chemicals or they've destroyed their food chain. They have nothing left to eat. Some of them will look at that and start eating other things. Like bees mainly eat nectar and pollen. Pollen is a nut. Even under a high powered electronic microscope, it looks just like, almost like a walnut. It has a hard shell. As the shell hardens, as the shell dries out, it gets harder. That's when we can't digest it. As long as that pollen is soft, we can just digest that shell with our hydrochloric acid, but once it's dry, we can't digest it. But the bees, if they don't have their honey and pollen, guess what they eat? Other insects and animals. They'll even eat themselves. It's like chickens. Chickens are the same way. Chickens are very carnivorous. They're scavengers, but they need their protein. If anybody's been on a chicken farm, what happens if they don't get their protein. They'll eat a chicken. They'll jump on a chicken and kill him and just pack him to pieces. They'll do that once, twice a week. About maybe 50 in the flock. They'll kill a chicken about every two to three days. Let's do it. You feed them soy, that's full of protein, right? It's not the same thing. It doesn't develop a healthy chicken. Chickens get lots of diseases. Before we get into the food, let's go into how the body takes care of disease. We know that the medical profession tries to handle disease with chemical destruction. Always chemical destruction, never nurturing. How does the body clean itself? We know there are bacteria in there that eat certain things. We have phagocytes, we have bacterias, we have parasites. If we observe what they eat, they eat degenerative tissue. They don't eat healthy tissue. They eat bruised or damaged or ill or toxic tissue. If they eat toxic tissue, what happens to them? Let's say they are eating some cells that are degenerating but the cells were caused their degeneration by mercury. So what happens if a parasite or a bacteria eats the mercury, the food that is parts of the subatomic cells, particles like we have cells and it's a macrocosm to a microcosm. They get poisoned too. What happens if the body has bacteria and parasites, how do they eat? How much can they eat? What happens in their process? They are going to eat up this toxic matter. Parasites can eat a hundred times their weight in a day and discard 1%, as little as 1%, in excrement. That's like eating a hundred pounds of food a day and having a one pound excrement the next day. We eat about anywhere from 7 to 14 pounds and have a half a pound or a quarter of a pound feces the next day. That's pretty good too, isn't it? Can you imagine reducing to 1%? That's a pretty good friend, isn't it? I'd say the parasites are your best friend. Bacteria can reduce it by 50%. They'll eat 50 times their weight and discard 2-5% waste excrement. But what they're doing is they're reducing contamination. Plus they have byproducts. E. coli produces a verotoxin. Why they call it a verotoxin? It's a judgment. Oh, this comes from the waste. It's got to be shit, so it's got to be bad, right? So it's called a verotoxin. But what does that verotoxin do? It completely dissolves human brain tumors in 2-5 days when injected into the system. 

And the University of Toronto, in association with the Children's Hospital of Toronto, has been using the verotoxin from E. coli for 31 years, dissolving human brain tumors, including the vessels going to the tumors, in 2-5 days. So why don't we all eat shit and live? Because we're conditioned to think that it is terrible and contaminating and awful, and things like verotoxin are applied to things when it shouldn't be at all. Well, what happens if the toxicity is so great that all of your bacteria and parasites are destroyed and you don't have their help? Mass depression, chronic fatigue, fatigue, lethargy, more depression, anxiety results. How does the body clean that toxicity? It makes solvents, it makes body soaps, they're called virus and they're not alive. Virus are protein bodies which disassembles particular, minute, exact structures of tissue. It can be intracellular, it can be extracellular, it can be cellular, but it's all produced cellular. Viruses are produced by the cells. It's like you taking a coconut, taking the cream out of it and making a coconut soap. That's what the cells do, it's not alive. They're protein bodies. There are 300,000 virus... 

[break]

A: tissue and work on an area for more than 72 hours, three days. So they're rotavirus, they're retrovirus. So that means that a virus that is created today is extinct in three days. You'll never see that virus again in that form, in that shape, ever. So what does that say about vaccines that are made to counter viruses? They're pretty insane, aren't they? What they could create is already extinct 72 hours before they make them. And it takes six months for them to manufacture and develop a virus to the point where they can give it to the public. It's inane. It is strictly greed. It is nothing but poison. Pasteur, do you know how many animals survived his injections? Zero. Absolutely none. Not one animal ever survived any of his injections. How did it become a big thing? Because somebody discovered that if they put a toxin in the disease that they were going to inject into a person. That was a good idea. Well, let's see, if I give a person disease while they're in a healthy state, before they get weak, they're going to build antibodies against it and defend itself with that disease. That's a great idea, but you're not looking at why the person has created a disease. A disease only becomes a disease, there's only a malady in the body if there's some kind of poison that is collected into the system, into a certain body part or a certain kind of tissue. So if it's collected that tissue, it needs the disease, doesn't it? It needs to dissolve that tissue and rebuild it or else it will be non-functional. So you live as a cripple. I've got people who have no sense of smell. They go through their whole life or whatever life they had after they lost their sense of smell, not ever being able to smell or taste anything. People who are color blind because of mercury or a vaccine, you know, the aluminum that's in a vaccine. And some are artists and they go through life never perceiving color again. You have to look at the value of your life. Do you want to compromise your life by a treatment? Do you want to get worse instead of better? I'm offering you a way that you bring more life to the body, more sensation, more pleasure, more everything. And it isn't through the medical profession. It's through common sense study of animals and nature, including the human animal. And the human animals that have no disease are very few. The Maasai tribe, Inuit, the Fulani, the Samburu, all of them. The only ones getting close to disease right now is the Fulani. The Fulani lives 90% on raw dairy products, 10% on cooked meats, about 5% on cooked meats, and about 5% on fruits. They are becoming diseased because they've allowed man to come in and give them tools for agriculture. Now they've got gasoline, they've got oil, and they weren't trained how to use these. They're breathing in all these things. They're getting diseased even though they have good diets. They're getting irritable. Fulani has a very amazing practice. In their culture, if an adult, and it was rare in the tribe, maybe it happened once a month or once every two months, some adult would get irate with another adult. That evening, the children get together and do a play based on that event. They make it a farce, an irony.

The adults get to see it and they laugh at it. That's the way the culture ran. They don't even do that anymore. They've been, by a particular British scientist who dreads it to this day, did a documentary on it. He says, my influence was the worst thing I could have ever brought to them. Agriculture and industry was the worst thing I could have brought to them. Before they had no disease and they lived harmoniously. Now they're fighting, they're having problems, they're getting diseases. 

Q: Where are they?

A: Africa. I forgot what part of Africa. The Fulani, I mean the Maasai, they started when Shirley MacLaine and all those people were going to visit them, they were bringing them cakes and candies and stuff like that. After about 18 years of this, the Maasai tribe says, wait a minute, these guys are poisoning us and killing us. So they went to the government and they said, we don't want any more of the white man within 20 miles of our villages, of our children, of anybody. They got that. They agreed to hike 20 miles out to a village to a agreed upon area and they'll do dances, rituals and sell them their goods to the white man. But the white man doesn't get near the Maasai tribe anymore and they're considered the smartest, tallest, fiercest, most intelligent tribe of the world. We take a look at the Eskimo, the ones that are still living primitively, 99% of their diet is meat, 100% 9 months out of the year. 3 months out of the year when they can eat berries and some other things, they will do it, but it's like 1% of their diet. That's it. It is 99% animal fat and meat. The problem with that is as soon as they dig a hole and catch a fish, it's a popsicle that by the time it reaches their mouth, so it's all frozen. You have to have incredible teeth for that. That's why I would have never stayed there even if I didn't have the bone problem, because of the teeth. How many people can eat bones with their teeth here? Eskimos can. A human can chew on bones, not like a dog or a cat. But humans can chew on bones. How healthy do your teeth have to be for that? If I even thought about trying to chew a bone, I'd have a toothache. I'd have some gum ache. After chemotherapy, especially after radiation, it dissolved all the bone around my teeth. My teeth dangled in my gums. If I went like that, I lost a half a cup of blood. My gums were bleeding. In my last three months of my life, they told me, which they said it would be, they wanted to pull all my teeth. I said, I'm going to live three months and you want me to suffer trying to heal all my teeth extractions in a three-month period? Only take me two years to recover from that surgery and you want me to spend my last three months suffering a complete mouth extraction? What are you, stupid? Of course they are. They're not ignorant, they're stupid. They're trained to be stupid. Do you know who writes the manuals for the doctors? Pharmaceutical houses. Merck's is that thick. It tells doctors their whole procedures, what to do. And you better believe, 85% of it's right at their medications. Dosages, everything. And they lump it into all so general. It's always the highest. You work backwards instead of working upwards. You work backwards from the highest dose to a lower dose. If you get a symptom, you back off. If you don't get a symptom, you may raise it. But most of the time, people have ill reactions from it and they have to cut back. And that's just the way that they treat it. So, the Maasai, the Samburu, the Eskimo, didn't suffer any degenerative diseases. The first case of cancer among the Eskimo was in 1936. And that was an Eskimo who had been eating. He was living in the German colony, the German-British colony was developed, eating cakes and sugar, breads, cakes and sugar. The first dental caries was in 1886. 

Can you imagine going through your whole race, which is hundreds of thousands of humans, no cavities, no cavities. And you can chew bone. Your teeth, gums and everything can be so strong. That's a dream in our society. That's almost a non sequitur. It's a myth. Nobody can do that. You're right, nobody in our society can because we don't have that kind of stability in our bodies. So how do we get there? It's going to be a journey. I'm still not there. I do have my teeth. There's only one right here that's a bridge so I don't have that tooth, but everything else are my teeth still. They're all my teeth. There are lots of fillings within all those teeth, but they're still my teeth and rooted into my system. I've got a few root canals, but I let them canal on their own. When the tooth died, I let the nerve die on its own and just pulled the nerve out of it dry and hard so I didn't have it done with a drill so that I could still use the tooth until the tooth decided to eliminate it on its own and hopefully regrow. A new one. My fantasy, but is it a fantasy? Six years ago in Thailand, a man 90 years old, who had lost all of his teeth by the time he was 60 years old, grew a whole new set of teeth. 90 years old. It was a whole new world for him. He could chew again, he could eat again. He was interviewed and it was quite interesting. I've gotten little tidbits of other people who've done it. Not that I've witnessed, but I've read about them. In interviews in newspapers. So I'm hoping for that someday. Maybe a fantasy. I don't know, but I'm working. So I try to take care of myself in the best way I can. So pollution is the main cause of disease. We have to look at cooking itself causes disease. It's not just industrial pollution. Of course, cooking could be called industrial development because you're having to make a fire. You're changing the whole mechanical and chemical structure of something. So that could be called industrial. Altering food. What happens when we cook food, we not only destroy enzymes, microbes, bacteria, fungi, anything that's in that to make it a life substance that can ecologically renew itself is destroyed. Toxins are formed. I name about 36 of them in my recipe book. Last 50 pages, the science is in this book. Talks about 36 that we know of, identifiable toxins, but those are the only ones we looked for and studied. It could be an entire myriad of toxins that we haven't studied yet. One of the worst is acrylamides. In Sweden, about five or six years ago, there was a team of full professors who did laboratory tests and chemical analysis of acrylamides. They found that 60% of the constituents of cancer cells were acrylamides. Tumors were acrylamides. So they searched whatever caused acrylamides. Any kind of cooked food causes acrylamides. Any type of cooking causes acrylamides. The worse the cooking, the greater the acrylamides. Fried foods are out of this world. Chips, french fries, donuts, 1,500 and more acrylamides whereas in the normal cooked baked form there is maybe 150 to 200. It shoots up to 1,500 and more just from frying it. 

What they found was the higher the ratio of carbohydrates in the frying process created the greatest amount of acrylamides. So they thought that all cereals should be off the market. They thought that french fries and all chips should be off the market. Guess what happened to all those full professors when they came out with that announcement? They all are now teaching high school. They lost their full professorships. People came out, food industry paid, intellectuals were saying, oh they did the tests all wrong and it wasn't accurate. Nobody has followed up or backed that up because they know it is right. They don't want to disprove it. Why? Because they couldn't disprove it. There is not there one fraction of a certain sentence on it. These poisons that collect, they can create diseases. Take a look at the tribes who are eating just cooked meats, cooked animal products. They have gout, they have arthritis, they have a little rheumatism, they have some skeletal problems, but no other serious diseases. When a people or tribe gets off into eating a lot of cooked carbohydrate foods like rice and things like that, we have greater amounts of disease, compounded liver deformations, all kinds of other diseases that become extreme. So cooked foods can cause a disease, but only ten percent of the disease that exists in our population today. Ninety percent of the disease that exists today, degenerative disease, exists because of pollution, industrial pollution that is not related to cooking. Mercury, thallium, barium, you know they're dropping barium and aluminum from the sky in chemtrails. You're inhaling that and if you study barium toxicity, you see the research by the FDA. They did the tests only so far and you can tell they stopped because they didn't want to do it all the way. They saw that it was a neurotoxin, that it causes paralysis, that every test group of animals that were subjected to the barium, they showed no toxicity, no change, but all the ones who had heart disease died. But only, this is the way they word it to make it sound really non-threatening because the military is dropping barium on us every day from the sky.

Q: Why?

A: They say it's weather control, they call it weather modification. However, I think that's just a smokescreen for dumping their chemical industrial waste. Like President Eisenhower said, our greatest enemy is the industrial military machine, that is our worst enemy of peace and well-being. This was a five-star general who became President of the United States. He warned everybody in the world in the United States, our worst enemy is the military industrial complex. Where are they putting all of their waste? They dump it illegally, the nuclear waste in the oceans. They're dropping barium and aluminum which there's a lot of by-product from making military machines and weaponry and they're dumping it on our heads. Barium reflects radiation so it can affect precipitation. The aluminum can help knock the light back so we can collect more precipitation to have more rain. It's a smoke screen.

Q: Is that cloud seeding.

A: Yes, that's what it's called. You can do cloud seeding that has nothing to do with barium or aluminum and it's relatively non-toxic. So why are they dumping aluminum and barium on our heads and having us breathe it if they don't need to dump this kind of pollution when they know that they're toxins. Aluminum destroys the zeta potential which is the ability for nutrients to stay suspended in fluid. Why do you think it causes Alzheimer's? Brain transmissions don't get to where they're going because the nutrients in the nerve serum is just dropping. It's not getting to where it's supposed to get. Why are they dropping that on our heads? Regardless of that, toxins, industrial pollution, industrial waste that is in our air, that is in our food, that is in our household, every chemical that you have for your house, everything that is produced has a chemical by-product that gets into the water, into the air, in our food, in everything. In our walls, toxins gas from the walls to 5 years minimum. Gassing the varnish, will gas for five years off of a chair or any kind of furniture, five years. Plywood will gas for 25 years. That's why the mothers for, the environment I think it is, say that plywood and press board should never exist. It is so toxic to children. Developing children, causes mutations, it causes a lot of miscarriages. So that is our major pollution. Now how can we ward ourselves against it? I mentioned being fatheads. What happens? Poisons go into fat if we have them. Fat is the most important protective nutrient in the body, primary and foremost, fat. You say, Aajonus, boy you're full of shit, look at you, you're pretty thin up there, aren't you? What kind of body fat do you think I have on my system? Normally for somebody my shape and size, solid, everywhere is solid, 7-13% max. Athletes dream of 7%. Why? Because they're brainwashed into a myth. My body fat is 22%. I'm really fatter than anybody else in here except for that man back there. He's probably about 32% fat and I like that. He's very protected. When molecules of fat are cooked, they enlarge, swell 10-50 times their normal size. I've been eating only raw foods, raw fats, since February of 72. My molecules of fat are very small and I've gotten rid of most of the big fat ones. 30 some years. 34 years of eating raw fats. So my fat molecules are very small, but I'm dense with fat. 22% fat. Most of you are not. Oh, here's this man. I'm as fat as this man. He's probably 25% fat. I'm just about as fat as he is. But I don't look it because my fat molecules are small. But I like people to be his size, ideally. Or his size. Get fat. Absorb those toxins. Because when you detox, where will those toxins go? If they can't find the fat, they'll go into the cells. Because there's always fat inside of the cell. Just think, if you had all this fat around here, how much fat do you think would go to, I mean, how many toxins do you think would go into the brain? If you had a lot of extra fat around here, a lot less would go to the brain. A lot less would go to the liver, or the pancreas, or the gallbladder, or the lungs. It would go into the extra fat tissues that you have. Now I used to keep myself this size.

When I talked about, you know, when I went into Los Angeles, spread the word, when I was a scaled down all in Schwarzenegger, I was his size. And I never felt better in my life at that time. It was great. I felt protected. I never felt tinged with poisons unless I went through a heavy detoxification, and chemo, and it's still coming out. Radiation's still coming out. I've got a rash right now from it. It comes out about every year and a half to three years. There's a good dose of it that eliminates it. And I feel even better, stronger. I mean, look how I can move my spine now. And, you know, 38 years ago it was, you know, excruciating pain. And that's what I did. I used to fall over a lot, just like that. The memory scared me. But, you know, I can touch my toes. I can bend. I can do everything. I mean, I can't go very far back. That's always been that way. My hamstrings are very short, probably from all the disastrous chemicals that I have. My mother cooked everything till it was leather. She had no culinary skills at all. The worst food in the world. I didn't know that food existed until I left home. And then people cooked things differently. It was a great, great adventure. I mean, cheese burrito. I mean, I couldn't think of anything better. And I only had two years of that before I got so sick I became a raw fooder. But, I mean, that was a great item. I loved cheese burritos. Burritos made with beans, refried beans, you know, with lots of cheese in it. Oh, I loved it. So, foods, poisons can cause disease. How do we reverse it? How do we contain it? Fat. Get fat. You've heard the saying fat and happy? It's a truth. Most babies are irritable and unhappy unless they're fat. Most adults are unhappy if they're fat because society says they're unattractive and they feel badly about themselves. Left alone wouldn't be that way. A hundred years ago, if you were fat, you were a prize, because we knew you could get through a winter, freezing cold winter, and you could have children without having to worry about being so disintegrated by it, and breastfeeding that you could maintain. You may lose a lot of weight in that process, but then you could fatten after that to have the next child. A skinny person, a thin person, would be considered undesirable as a mother and as a housewife. A hundred years ago, that's the way it was. It should still be that way. But it isn't. Fat and happy, get fat. You'd be happy about it. You'd be protected. Now where do we get fats? What are the good fats for the human? Well, we've got vegetable oils. Isn't that ideal? Vegetable oil is the most important. We've got short trans fatty acids, unsaturated. Isn't that the ideal? Low cholesterol. Isn't that the ideal? So we're told. What happens with those? They harden in the human body. An herbivore can eat vegetable oils. Their body temperature is 101 to 103 degrees. Average is about 102. They go into a fever and go up to 105. So when they eat the vegetable fats and it's made a part of their cells. It stays fluid for their entire lives. Ours, it crystallizes in our body at 98.2, 98.6. 

Our bodies even get cooler than that. So it dries out and crystallizes in the system causing hardening of the arteries, MS, muscular dystrophy, all kinds of problems, hardening of the heart, heart disease, vegetable oils. But wait a minute, wait a minute. Animal fats cause hardening of the arteries and heart, doesn't it? That's what we're told every day, look at the tribes that eat only cooked meat. No heart disease, no arteriosclerosis, none, zero. Hundreds of thousands of years, Borneo, even the humans who were cannibals never had heart disease or arteriosclerosis. It exists in people who eat lots of cooked vegetable oils. So there we go, oils, not for us are they? Not good at all. If you have a question, mark it down. If I don't answer it by the end, we'll get into Q&A, ask. So vegetable oils are what? Safflower oil, all those oils that are said to be good for us, they're not. Margarine, Crisco oil, all that garbage food will cause hardening in the system. Well, what about olive oil and coconut oil? They're a little different. They will not harden in the same way, but they will cause overheating of the body in some circumstances and irritation and caustic responses because mainly that fat is used to cleanse the body. The body will start making a lot of body soaps, a lot of virus to start cleaning the body. Now I didn't finish my talk about viruses, did I? Bacteria and the parasites reduce the waste. What happens when you put a solvent? Let's say you go into your garage and you take a solvent to clean up the grease. What do you put it into? A pail of what? Water. You've got the solvent that's broken it down. Now you have all this tar and grease, all this industrial waste product, plus the solvent itself in a whole bucket of water. Nothing's been reduced, has it? Your waste is not minimal now. It isn't taken from 100 to 1% or it's not taken from 50 to 2 to 5%. You've taken something that's about 10% and swelled it to 200%. Now you've got all this contaminated fluid. The same thing happens in an animal's body. If viruses are being used, you've got a huge contamination, systemic that carries on in the system. How does that relate to actual life? Take a look at how the doctors perceive viral meningitis or cerebral meningitis, either one, to bacterial meningitis. They fear viral because of the mass swelling involved. Bacterial doesn't have all that swelling. Why? Because the bacteria is reducing the tissue and that discarded waste to a small fraction. When the virus is doing it, you have an expansion of toxic fluid and not enough health in the body to eliminate that waste safely. You've got to feed the body those fats to absorb all those poisons. Going through detoxification, you've got to load up on the fats. What are the good fats? What are the fats that we digest best? Who likes to have ice cream? Who likes ice cream? Everybody likes it. Why do you like ice cream? Because your body knows that that is really the best food for it. Butter, cream. Who doesn't like butter? There should be only a few people who don't like butter. One child back there who doesn't like butter. Butter is delicious, incredible. Cream is delicious, incredible. A lot of people like meat fat. That's my favorite. Sirloin fat.

I've taken my meat, cut it up, put it in a two-cup canning jar with a wide mouth, stuck it in a bowl of hot water, not hot enough to burn my hand, and then do that for several hours, and I've got the juices of savory sirloin fat. So tasty. And it tenderizes the meat. The warmth tenderizes the meat. So if you want to have it more delectable, you just have to take the time to do those things. And that's no different than it takes time to cook. It may take a little bit longer if you want to warm it longer and get it more tenderized, but at least you're not using constant heat and you won't have to scour a pan or a pot. When you're finished, you just rinse with lukewarm water the jar so you don't have all that waste product from cooking. Those fats are the most important for the system because they are digestible. Now is there any difference between the butter and the cream and the animal fat? In my experiments, yes. Animal fat has a tendency to clean out toxic tissue in the body and drugs galore. Avocado will do that too, but not in the same way. If you've had radiation therapy or chemo, the quickest way to clean that out is to eat lots of animal fat. Cream is the only fat that I know of that soothes the nervous system. What happens in the summer? Why do people crave and eat so much ice cream in the summer? You've got the sun's radiation beating down on people who don't have the proper fats in the tissue in their skin. The radiation normally is absorbed into the animal fat in your skin, transforms into vitamin D and absorbed in a myriad of complex fats and cholesterols that aid the body in all kinds of chores. Strength, protection, energy, building, growth. You don't have the proper fats in the skin. If you were raised on Crisco and margarine, guess what's in your skin? You've got a magnifying oil that's going to burn when the sun hits it. It causes irritability. It's too great a sensitivity on a cellular level to the sun's rays. So people go for ice cream to soothe the nervous system. Just drink down a cup of cream. Pretty nice, huh? And then you're sitting there, oh man, oh that was so good, but I can't move. I've got to go to sleep. Let me have a break here while I digest my cream. That's because the liver has to have a whole complex of enzymes to extract the water and make butter. And it does it to about two-thirds of the cream that you eat. A third of that cream will be made into fats that retain the fluid and all of it goes to the nervous system. Butter cannot soothe your nervous system. Only cream can. Cream in the milk or cream separate from the milk. Butter cannot. But, cream is absorbed and utilized in all the glands and organs and it will never make it to the bones, the connective tissue, the cartilage, the lymph and the skin. And even if you're eating a lot of butter, which does get to those areas, you've got to eat a tremendous amount at one time to get it there. And then again, how are you going to digest all that fat? You've got a gallbladder. The gallbladder doesn't make bile. The liver makes bile and stores it in the gallbladder, just the way the bone marrow breeds the blood cells and stores it in the spleen. When we were out hunting and we caught an animal, guess what we ate right away?

All of the fat. You ate so much fat it would take your liver a week to generate that much bile to digest it. The human body and nature had the gallbladder to hold this enormous amount of bile to be able to digest eating an enormous amount of fat at one time. So we should be equipped to do it, shouldn't we? But if the bile is made incorrectly from toxic foods, it's not going to do its job properly. So then eating that butter and that cream is going to weigh you down and you've got to go take a nap to digest it. Then the pancreas is going to spend a lot of time putting some enzymes together or leaching them out of the body and converting them into substances which can help create a better bile to break the fat down so you can utilize it a lot. I can go through, it used to be, you know, when I first got onto the raw meat, I was eating a quart of raw cream a day with a quart of carrot juice and I would pass out after an hour. Oh boy, I'd wake up digested and ready to go. I was able to keep my weight like this, maintain it like that, and I loved it, but I always had to nap. Now I can eat a quart of cream and I don't get sleepy because my body can digest it now, but then I won't be hungry for anything else because my body is very satisfied and very satiated, having been this many years on eating lots of raw fats and raw meats. I'm not an animal who requires an excessive amount except when I'm detoxifying. So butter, the way that you can get the body to absorb it and digest it quickly is to make the moisturizing lubrication formula, and it's in the recipe book I think on page 146. And that consists of lemon juice with egg and butter, but less preferable some other fats like coconut if you don't have it, but butter is the ideal. And honey, those four substances, that lemon in there helps the liver break or helps break down the fat so that you don't require as much bile. It isn't as complex. So you can digest that formula, it's on page 146, yeah, top. You can digest that formula so quickly that the stronger orphans that are getting the food first don't eat it all. Because that's the way the body works. Every cell in that body is a starving orphan. And the ones that are nearest the digestive tract and in the digestive system get it, so the bones, connective tissues, the skin and the lymphatic system don't get their supply because it's all absorbed. When you eat that moisturizing lubrication formula, it digests so rapidly that it does get to the skin. Evidence of that is, since I started using that formula with people with psoriasis, it used to take me seven, eight years to get it to a point where it was not painful. I can do it in three to six months with a patient now. Massive, massive, dead, dry skin all over the body, bleeding, cracking all over knees, elbows, armpits. Three and a half months, one elderly man, only three and a half months to reverse that condition with that lubrication, moisturizing lubrication formula. You say, why do you make it so complicated? Why not just call it moisturizing formula or lube formula? I need it to entice you. For the women, it's moisturizing, and it's very appealing to you, and for men, lubrication. And it works. So for the men I say, hey, give you lube formula. Does that sound good? Lube formula, I like that. Moisturizing formula, you get your moisturizing formula, and it works. Psychologically, it works.

And think about it, it does just that. It gets to the outer parts of the body, so it will moisturize you. For men, it gets into the joints. It does to the women too, but the men like to think of the lube, the joints lubed and stronger.

A: The fats are already liquefied. But the butters are liquefied. However, it's not in the structure that requires very little digestion. In the egg yolk, the fats require very little digestion. There's still lots of bile that has to be mixed with the butter to be able to be broken down properly and digested and absorbed, assimilated and absorbed, and then assimilated again. In the egg, there's very little requirement for that. People come to me with severe environmental allergies, sensitivities. They can't eat anything. People are allergic to anything. I give them predominantly eggs. People with emphysema, the same thing. Eggs because it's so easy to digest. They're not going to have allergies. I've never met one person allergic to raw eggs. Let me tell you, it makes a world of difference. People who have complications, complications. I have another client that was put them on the egg thing, they did well, and then put them back on a complete raw primal diet. Within a few weeks, they were back to having problems. To me, that was simple. Five days on the egg diet only, eating an egg every half an hour, 45 minutes, five days on the primal diet. Five days this, five days that. I've got infants doing that too. They're making tremendous progress. It works. Those eggs are phenomenal. But what about the biotin problem? Hello? Only in a laboratory does it come up with a biotin problem, a biotin deficiency. I eat 50 eggs a day and I never show a biotin deficiency. I have never, ever seen a biotin deficiency from people eating raw eggs. I've seen it in some dogs and cats, but not in a human body. Never seen it. Dogs and cats need bones. So you're going to find a deficiency if you're only feeding them eggs. But a human, I fed humans nothing but eggs for nine months without one biotin deficiency symptom. Nine months only eggs, eggs every day, up to 33 a day. No symptom, no biotin deficiency. So these people who get on this theoretical bin, because some scientist says that there's no way that you won't have a biotin deficiency. Like I said in my book, We Want to Live, I talk about when I see the binding of avidin and biotin together, it handles biocarbons. Guess why you have a lot of biotin? To handle biocarbons. That's its purpose. So if you have a biotin deficiency, you're going to have a lot of biocarbons built up. That's going to create a lot of deficiencies. I don't have to see that the biotin is released from the avidin. I want the binding of the avidin and the biotin. But people who are eating cooked foods sometimes don't have the enzymatic link to utilize the biotin-avidin coupling to remove biotoxins. So some of that will be found in the urine or feces. But it is a minute amount that doesn't ever cause biotin deficiencies. So all of this myth about a biotin deficiency, I've never seen the empirical, clinical proof. Because it doesn't exist. It's all theoretical in a scientist's mind. And these people who believe it. And it's a sad thing because that combination is so important. And you will not have the fats and the proteins together to help digest each other. And when I've separated them and apply them to people, I have to eat the egg yolk thirty minutes before the other.

It doesn't work. You need the protein to digest the fat and the fats to digest the protein. The effects are not the same with the eggs when you separate them. So get rid of that myth that is out there in the alternative health field. That the eggs should be separated or the white should be cooked and the yellow should be raw. Forget about it. It's all bull. And it makes me angry. And then you've got those people with seesaw. Oh, today it's okay to eat the white and the yolk together because so-and-so said it. But the next week, oh, somebody is much smarter than that guy. He says that the egg yolk and the egg white should be together. And I believe that person. And that's what happens when you're seesawing a non-imperial experience. You're not looking at the results of that. You're going to be confused. And whatever you think is making the best sense, whoever you think is making the best sense at the time is who you're going to believe. And that could be very harmful to your health. Eggs, if you're ever having problems digesting, if you're ever having any kind of problems and foods aren't working for you, suck an egg. Together. The yolk and the white together. Suck those eggs. Get you back into shape. And then you go back into eating and you're still not right, predominantly eat eggs. Eat maybe a cup of meat in the evening, somewhere around 7 o'clock, and a glass of milk before you go to bed. If you're well enough to be able to digest the milk without an allergic reaction. So the egg fat is a very important fat, also to help the body. And there are a myriad of cholesterols. Now, 60 varieties of cholesterols, and guess what? They're all good. LDL, HDL, garbage is another myth. What was it, 20 years ago? All the cholesterol was bad. There was no HDL or LDL or anything like that. They were all bad. You know how the pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry backed out of that one? Well, we found that these are bad and those are good. So we made a little mistake, but we didn't make a total mistake. They are a mistake, completely. The LDL and the HDL are all good. And if I have my blood checked and I'm eating the right way, I want to see a lot of contaminated fat in that blood because I want to make sure that I'm detoxing those old fat cholesterols that are in my body from when my mother fed me Fried Crisco. She fried her French fries in Crisco the same way that Ben and Jerry's and everybody else, Henry's and McDonald's, everybody else is boiling theirs. If you go to Mexico, they do it in lard, pig lard. That's better than the vegetable oil because it won't crystallize in your system and cause hardening of the arteries and the heart. I want to get rid of those. I want a high cholesterol level. I like the cholesterol level to get up to 700 sometimes. It's over 160, 150. You're in danger of what? Of their fantasy. You should move all of the doctors out to Hollywood and let them write for the horror stories because they have no base in reality. There's no sense of reality anywhere in their consciousness. The pharmaceutical industry trains them that way. Pharmaceutical industry took care of all the universities, took them over in the early 1900s when Carnegie and Rockefeller were offering all these huge subsidies for tests that would create chemicals that they could sell. 

They had nothing to do because everybody was using food. Hippocrates, let food be your medicine and medicine be your food. You know how you handle childhood diabetes type 1, the one that never gets cured? A raw milk diet. That's all. That's all they got to eat was raw milk for six months and they would be completely rid of their diabetes, type 1 diabetes. I had type 1 diabetes. Said I'd be on insulin all my life. When I started eating raw foods, I stopped. I was eating a lot of fruit and I was passing out all the time, but I didn't go into a coma or a shock like I did when I was eating cooked foods and taking insulin. I went to Washington Medical School in St. Louis three years ago and they did a test on me, lots of tests on me. They were looking for congestive heart failure because of all the fat I eat. They were expecting to find lots of cholesterol in my carotid arteries and all in my heart. They had this division of the school, the medical university, that was handling this test was mainly looking at vegan raw fooders. They heard about me, called me and asked if they could take a look at my blood and everything. So I said sure. On my way to Chicago here, I stopped in St. Louis and went through the two days of their testing. They found that my pancreas, I did a glucose tolerance test, I allowed them to put sugar in my body. Oh my god, I was like this. I couldn't write. My head was shaking. They found that normally your pancreas, if your pancreas is working, every half hour lower the blood sugar about 30 points. It will stop right around 102-104. Mine went all the way down to 54. Kept grabbing it out of there. They said that's the best pancreas they've ever seen working in their lives. I said, I was a type 1 juvenile diabetic. That's the difference. They spent 20 minutes we had five cardiologists around me I'm lying on the gurney and they've got this you know ultrasound going around my heart different angles trying to find all the congestion and all the fat in there that was going to kill me. Because you know I eat like sometimes a half a pound of butter a day plus you know half a cup to a whole cup of cream a day plus all the animal fat plus, you know, whatever else I'm eating that has fat in it. Eggs, you know, 10 to 50 a day so or 8 to 50 a day. So I mean they spent almost 30 minutes with this thing and they usually do it in 5-10 minutes. They were searching hard and they couldn't find any congestion there. They found a little in my carotid artery on the left side, but it had been when I was a young boy 20 years old it was five times more congested than that. So it's gotten bette. So in another, you know, I've still got 16 years to go on a raw diet to where I've been on a raw food diet of eating meat on a daily basis, like I said takes about 40 years to completely rebuild my system. So I'm getting better every day. So fats are very important, eggs are very important, all of those things are the utmost important. Let's take a break before everyone pulls their hair out. Okay, so we'll take a 10 to 15 minute break, eat, do whatever you need to do. 

[break]

A: In my experiments with animals or the only... Raw meat is the only thing that increased cellular reproduction, sped up healing of wounds of bruises and of growth. Cooked meats didn't do it, other forms of proteins didn't do it. The science diet, I don't know who's science that is. Every dog that I'd known that was on the sound science diet had kidney stones or some other problem. Ridiculous bull advertising scheme I've ever heard and seen. I have one man, my publicity agent at MGM when I was an actor making money to pay for my research. It was good money. I mean you know I made like $60,000 for one day's work. Pretty great and it paid for a lot of, you know, a lot of things, a lot of laboratory experiments. When I gave humans meats raw meats they healed and grew and we would see the lab, in the laboratory the cells were producing at a greater rate, and only when they ate raw meat. And I'm not talking about just beef, I'm talking about any kind of flesh food. Any kind of flesh food I call meat. There was a lot more cells that were produced, healing was sped by at least two times, sometimes up to five times. So raw meats are the only proteins that ever I ever got that reaction with. Eggs did not do it. The protein in eggs allows for a restructuring of cells that already are alive but in the in the analysis it did not increase cellular division. Milk the same way unless milk was never refrigerated then in about 65% of the subjects cellular reproduction increased cellular division increased. If the milk had ever been chilled or refrigerated below 55 degrees cellular division was normalized which is a slower rate. So you will never find milk that hasn't been refrigerated to about 36 to 40 degrees. If you get it from organic pastures it's been 32 degrees and if he tells you that's not been chilled for more than 36 degrees he's a liar. I'm talking about Mark McAfee or organic pastures. He freezes everything. The milk doesn't get solid but he freezes everything. The butter, everything is frozen. The butter is solid. He freezes the butter until it's solid. Sometimes you'll find the milk in the stores where I find the milk, crystals in it, ice crystals in it. You don't get ice crystals in milk unless it's at 32 degrees or lower. When I caught him on it doing it, you know, he said I'm doing that you know it's okay it doesn't harm the milk. I said how do you know Mark? Well I know. I said how do you know Mark? What tests have you done to show that you know? Well Sally Fallon and all those people said that freezing doesn't harm anything. I said how do they know? Did they do an experiment? I don't know, but they know. So I talked to Sally Fallon. Just what she believes because Weston Price said that vitamins weren't destroyed by freezing. Well if you don't have the enzymes, if you don't have those enzymes to utilize the vitamins properly, what good are the vitamins? And you need enzymes to utilize anything in the body. Now I did tests that gave 14 animals, well I was the 15th animal, frozen and unfrozen meat.

Same meat, same cut, same animal, frozen and unfrozen. Those of us that ate it raw and that's all we ate, well I ate a little bit more because I couldn't just eat that, but the dogs and the cats, we fed them and that group, that's all they got. They got nothing else, they got no butter, they got no dairy at all, they got no honey, they got no bones, all they ate was the frozen meat. And the other group, the same meat, that's all they got was that unfrozen, non-frozen. The group that had it frozen started developing skin problems, some of them within three weeks, all of them within six weeks, mainly extreme within 10 to 12 weeks. One of them got scurvy. The group that did not, that ate it non-frozen, not one problem, their skin, their coats were beautiful. The ones that ate it frozen, some of them were losing their hair. That's how extreme it got. So after that I decided, okay, they say that, you know, I knew that skin disorders could be repaired pretty quickly with butter. So I said, the only way I'm going to know if frozen butter, and let me tell you, I went around and around for six months, and Sally found a lot of other people, about frozen butter is not as healthy. And that milk, this right here, in here, this whole thing, you know, I wrote this first thing with Dr. Douglas's stuff, you know, this report in favor of raw milk, we got the law changed, and when we designed this whole thing, I wrote it with a woman who was putting it together, and I had another scientist and me, we had both of our laboratory analysis that showed that raw, that frozen butter was not as good, that there was damage to it, and that it didn't cause the reversals of disease, like the non-frozen did. So, Sally pulled so much weight, it was pulled out of this package here. In my experiments with those animals, I fed them frozen and non, took the sick animals, so there were seven of them, and I took those that were the worst diseases and put them with the non-frozen butter, and then those that were less damaged with the frozen butter, I mean the non-frozen butter, and did I get that right? The worst cases went with the non-frozen butter, and then the less worse cases went with the worst cases went with the non-frozen butter, and the less worse cases went with the non-frozen butter. I want to get this straight. The animals who were the worst off got the non-frozen butter. The ones that were not as bad as the others got the frozen butter, so you think that those who are the worst off would take longer to heal. They healed three to five times faster than the ones who had the raw, that had the frozen butter, and they weren't as bad shape as the ones who ate the non-frozen butter. Three to five times faster their skin healed. Certainly evidence to me that the the frozen butter is less healing than the raw butter. I'm not saying that the frozen butter is damaging, but it certainly is less healing. Three to five times less healing. So freezing anything is not a good idea. I mean any protein or fats.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: McAfee. Yeah, he's the organic pastures dairy man from California. So meats in a frozen form are disease producing because those animals got diseases. Now Sally Fallon in her book says freeze meat for 14 hours. I say don't. She says get rid of it because of the parasites and bacteria. You want them. You have to understand that these people who are making all of those claims have no empirical experience. They just have their belief and whatever has been brainwashed into them is what they believe. None of them have gotten paid for the laboratories like I have and done the experiments. They just have this belief and it doesn't have anything to do with logic or rationale. Now Sally Fallon and all those people are very kind-hearted wonderful people but when it comes to the science let's get it right and that means let's do the experiments to prove it. Not just go along with what makes sense or rational or what you know seems rational for today. Okay, so you could eat nuts. Nuts are a good form of protein, right? Well all nuts have phytic acid. What is phytic acid? Phytic acid is a substance which binds with certain minerals and those particular minerals allow for protein absorption and proper digestion. So it destroys your ability to digest the protein that you're eating. So are you going to digest and assimilate the protein in the nuts? When I was vegan I was eating seven pounds of nuts a day waking up a few grams lighter every day. So nuts don't do it and I know so many vegetarians and vegans who are eating massive amounts of nuts and not getting strong and healthy. A few of them, like I said, I know eight out of about 3,000 who seem to do okay. But basically, no. Nuts are not a place for humans to derive... If you're a squirrel, anybody a squirrel? No? Nobody's a squirrel? Then that's not for you. Oh we got one kid back there who's a squirrel. His father put him in. And then you've got grains. Well grains, you know, make, you know, this is like nuts. Can nuts contain 15 to 30 percent protein? Well grains contain what? Five percent to 15 percent protein. Can you digest grains? Phytic acid in grains too. Well there's lots of people to say that if I germinate the grains, it destroys the phytic acid. It alters it. So I don't have to worry about that. But what happens when you germinate a grain? It becomes a vegetable. It changes its kingdom. And what do vegetables have? They have three enzymes in the sprouts and in germinating that react just like the phytic acid. So you're dealing with three instead of one. It does the same thing. So if you want to digest it, you have to ferment it. And what happens if you get too much alcohol in the system, it means a lot of gas, and a lot of carbohydrates so you get a lot of advanced carbohydrates that collect in the body, because when the body uses a carbohydrate either from, you know, well carbohydrates and sugar anything, it could be carrot juice, it could be a carrot, it could be a potato, can be any anything. There's carbohydrates in it. When the body uses that carbohydrate as glycogen there's an advanced glycation end product that is a byproduct. And Columbia University found that it stored 70 to 90% for a lifetime in the human body. Means every donut you ate, 70 to 90% of the advanced glycation end product that resulted in your body would still be in your body. 

70 to 90% of that waste product is still part of your body today for a lifetime. That's it. So as these keep collecting and collecting what do you have at the end of 50, 60 years? A body full of sugar wastes. What's cancer started in? Sugar wastes. Why? Because sugar breaks down healthy tissue. Dissolves it. It's an acid. Dissolves a lot of tissue. So what happens is you are an old person with a lot of dead cells in your body. Can't dissolve those, they're accumulating into the glands. Your body has to start building them into tumors, so they're like little waste stations or prisons to hold them. And if those start impeding on functionality you've got a problem or if the body starts dissolving that tumor and you can't get rid of that accurate waste it starts dissolving live tissue all around in the area and you're dead. So maybe rice and all those high carb foods aren't good for us. Even in the raw form we form advanced glycation end products. So what happens when we have a lot of advanced glycation end products in the body? It's sticky. It causes the blood, neurological fluid, and lymph system to get sticky. Now stickiness in the lymph system isn't a big thing. It's okay. There's enough fat in there to keep it from causing that tacky reaction but in the blood and in the neurological fluids that tackiness causes a slowing and a sticking and a clumping. And if the oxygen gets higher in the blood they clump together and stick like magnets from that sugar. It's like gum. So is your brain going to function well? If your neurological fluid is sticky? No. Most people, most children, they go to school on cereals and doughnuts and pancakes and stuff like that and they're falling asleep in class. 80% of them, 80% of the children react that way to the sugar and only 20% don't and that's a good class. According to what I've been reading lately, 5% of a class is ever awake and alert. Nowadays, 5%. It's pretty amazing. Pretty bad. This shows that we're declining even more and more. So fruits really aren't a good thing for us, are they? Any high carbohydrate food. What else happens if we eat a lot of fruit? It looks for the fat in the blood and rips the fat out of the blood. To burn it is fuel. To utilize this for fuel. What happens when you have that combination of high sugars and fats? Minerals start magnetizing to that coupling. So you lose tremendous amounts of calcium. It starts fragmenting the bones. That's why your fruitarians have such thinning bones, deteriorating bones. It starts ripping out the body minerals. So not a good thing. So we have to limit the amount of carbs that we eat. So what's a safe amount? Well, according to some scientists, the body uses 80% fat. 80% of the diet should be fat. 15% should be protein. 5% should be carb. That is the most rational and reasonable that they came up with for functionality. Especially in the citric acid cycle of utilizing fat as energy. 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbs. That's just to utilize for energy. How about for maintaining strength and health of the body? 

Then we get into a different ratio and nobody has analyzed that but me, as far as I know. When you look at the diets of the tribes and it's 60% fat by calorie count, about 35 to 40 percent by meat count, and 5 to 10 percent by carbs. And that's about what I go with and that's what I found works the best. What happens if we try to time the body responses in a day? If we follow the natural progression of the system we see that whatever the body forms into blood sugar will be confined to that by noon. So if the body eats a lot of high carbohydrate food before noon the body will make its main glycogen, blood sugar, and blood sugar and neurological blood sugar. The sugar that will feed the nerves and the blood will be very high in sticky substances. So if we feed it protein in the morning, lots of meat, it makes the sugar, the glycogen from pyruvate, which is a protein sugar in association with glucagon. Not sticky. Pyruvate, which is sugar made from protein, only has seven to eight percent advanced glycation by-product. Only forms that much of the waste whereas carbs 70 to 90%, and it stores that much in the body. So 70 to 90% of that that is made is stored in the body. With the meat 7 to 8 percent is produced none of it stored. No advanced glycation end product is stored when the glycogen is made from pyruvate in association with glucagon. So there is no sticky substance when we eat meat. So time-wise when we get up in the morning the blood has a tendency to be over acidic. So how do we get an alkaline substance in the body? We know we can't eat vegetables because they'll over-alkalize the digestive tract and we won't digest animal food. We talked about that earlier. Well if we have fruit it's going to cause all the sticky stuff in there. Well how about if we have it green? We eat green fruit. There's not a lot of sugar in it and it's still alkaline. Lots of enzymes. Good idea but there's still too much sugar in it. And are you going to get one that's acid enough to balance the system? Difficult call to make. Well how about we just juice the vegetables? That's what we get out of them anyway is juice. We get vitamins, enzymes and minerals. That's about all we get. We only get 3% of the fat or protein and that's nothing. That's the total. 3% of the fat and protein total together. So if we take vegetable juice, mainly celery, maybe 80% celery, 90% celery, 10% parsley, we've got enough of the chlorophyll in the parsley and enough vitamin E and vitamin D, everything in that parsley to alkalinize the blood and make the bloodstream alkaline. We're not out to alkalinize the intestines because we don't want it alkaline. Why? Because it takes an acid environment in the intestines always to digest the raw animal products. Now if you're eating cooked meat, what do you have a condition in there? Overacidity. There are lots of products that don't digest. The meat will putrefy and peristalsis is ceased. So if you eat a vegetable salad with a cooked meat meal, perfect combination. But when you eat meat raw, it has to be an acid environment and you cannot put alkaline foods in it. Put maybe more than a teaspoon, a tablespoon, two tablespoons in a meal as part of a spice or a sauce.

Some kind of flavoring and that's it and it won't cause an alkalinity that interferes with digestion. Vegetable juice and mainly the celery has the same environment mineral balance as blood does. There is so little carbohydrate in celery, you don't have enough to digest the celery. Juicing it eliminates that problem. So you've got almost a zero environment of carbohydrate in the celery. You've got a lot more carbohydrate in the parsley but you're having such a little amount of it that it's not enough to cause any other issue other than the sugars will help you deliver the minerals and the minerals will help you deliver the little amount of sugar to boost digestive abilities. The juice will be absorbed by the time it hits the bottom of the duodenum so it never gets into the digestive tract to alkalinize it. That's the key. If you're eating whole vegetable matter, fiber, you're going to be releasing alkaline fluids all throughout the digestive tract and you're going to impair absorption of animal foods and that's a problem. So we have vegetable juice the first thing in the morning, 8 to 16 ounces depending upon your size. Big person, 16 ounces. Medium person, 12 ounces. Little person like me, 8 ounces. And under 8 ounces. Some people even 4 ounces. That will give you all the enzymes and minerals and vitamins to get digestion going. Most people get up and they want coffee or soda or something like that to give them a jack up and to get the digestion going but it isn't a good way to do it. Vegetable juice will do it. Don't wait. You get out of bed and you have the vegetable juice. That will get your digestion going. Not also waking you, it will act like a coffee or tea. It will wake you because it makes you hungry. It incites hunger. Hour later you have a meat meal. Remember you don't want to go to something high in carbohydrates. You want to go right to meat. You want to give the body the power to do it. So you have meat and fat together. Why the fat with it? Some other kind of fat, but mainly butter. Because if you eat the meat alone, I found that 80 to 90% of it will be made into pyruvate, a protein sugar. Even though it won't cause a lot of advanced glycation end products to be manufactured, it still is a very expensive fuel. It's like having Bush in office. He's going to pay a lot of money for very little energy. And it's a huge waste of your money and meat eating experience. You want meat to regenerate the body and to make a clean body blood sugar. So if you eat the fat with it, you won't burn the fat. I mean burn the meat. You will have it there to heal and build and strengthen your body and you'll get younger instead of older. Now the reason I say older is because aging and deterioration is associated with age. Older we get, fewer cells we have in the body. And you've seen those old people trying to walk across the street and thinking, my God, my whole life is going to go by with this person trying to cross the street. They have maybe 23, 24% of their body cells alive. It has to carry 100% of the weight and those cells aren't very healthy. That's a lot to carry. If you're eating this kind of diet and you're eating raw meat with fat, you're going to have the ability to keep dividing cells.

So every day you get younger. I didn't have this kind of vitality when I was 10 years old or at any time. Now I'm this old 60 year old man and I can just go on and on and drive you people crazy because I have so many more cells alive in my body than I did then, and energy. So you want that meat with, you want the fat with the meat. Also a little honey helps digestion. When the bee collects the nectar, it swallows it. It possesses an enzyme like substance which converts 90% of the carbohydrate activity into enzyme activity for digesting fats and proteins, mainly protein. So it'll help you digest everything that's on the diet. Honey is very helpful. The bees will not eat the honey unless they're starving if it goes over 92.8 degrees. That is the level which starts destroying that insulin like substance that's produced in their stomach. Oh, did you know that honey is bee vomit? Because they eat the nectar, they swallow it, they create this insulin like substance, they get back to the hive and they vomit. That's honey. Bee vomit. I like it. I don't mind. That creature has a symbiotic relationship with me. It's making my food better. Because now I can digest a lot more with it and I can get healthier faster. It increases healing up to five times. It increases digestion up to five times. 

[audio cut]

A: ...for 24 hours. You don't want to move. Honey even on that garbage, cooked food, will resurrect digestion. So you imagine what it can do to the raw food. So honey is a very important food. If you overeat it, some people can overeat it, it'll cause a dissolution and a detoxification. Let's say that you had cancer, you're too thin and you don't have enough body fat. It can cause massive detoxification in your system because it'll start dissolving tissues like a virus. So you have to be careful. Most people, if you're eating all those fats and you're eating enough protein, there's no limit to the honey. But if you're not, you need to keep it around 6 tablespoons a day or 3 ounces. So be careful. If you're overweight, hey, enjoy your honey as much as you want. Not a problem. So honey is a very good thing to especially have after a meat meal to help you digest it. Let's say we wait 2 or 3 hours later and we eat something to just relax and calm the system in general. Milkshake is great for that. So with milk, let's say anywhere from 4 to 6 ounces of milk and anywhere from 1 ounce to 3 ounces or even 4 ounces of raw cream, couple tablespoons of honey, maybe just 1 or even 3, and 1 to 5 eggs. If you're a big guy, 10 eggs. So there's no regulation on the ratio of that. Just enjoy it. It'll help relax the nervous system and soothe you for the day. It also keeps up the protein level because of the eggs. It's liquid. It keeps the body moving good and well. It keeps the sugar level down. Then next, you're about noon. Hey, we're to the time where we can start getting maybe a little crazy. Eat some fruit or something like that. The system's slightly acidic, so so it would be good rather than to alkalinize the blood at the same time we're inundating it with sugar, it's best to alkalinize it first. So, another vegetable juice. Same vegetable juice, it's fine. Same vegetable juice all the time, it's fine. If you get into other vegetables, spinach, collards, cilantro, you're asking for detoxification. Better be ready and healthy for detoxification. And I haven't even finished writing that book yet, so I think you should just wait. I don't suggest anybody force detoxification unless they've got a serious health problem that is caused by that toxicity that they need to eliminate. I think that the body, from my experience, it's better you just let the body detoxify as it chooses, you just take care of your diet. And then maybe after you've been on the diet 15 years, then you might want to start playing with, you know, thinking that you know you can help the body out faster. I'm telling you, from my experience, and I've done a lot of forced detoxifications, it ain't worth it. You know, the body will always clean on its own, in its own time. If you don't have a serious disease caused by that particular toxin, don't force it out of the body. Every day as it comes, enjoy yourself. Sometimes if you want to just get rid of a little extra toxicity, I got some juices in there that can give you a little bit of a head start. But if you start fermenting, you know, cabbage and a lot of things like that, remember, a lot of those people will tell you, you know, that's the, you know, our ancestors used to do, used to ferment cabbage, used to do a lot of fermented vegetables.

Just remember that that fermented bacteria, that alcohol, is to digest vegetables, not meat, not dairy. If you want something to digest meat and dairy, you get the bacteria growing in the meat and you get the bacteria growing in the fermentation, in the dairy products. That's what's fit for it, not sauerkraut or any other.

[audio cut]

A: Some old heavy tars from the vegetable oils that you ate cooked as a child because when you ate the cooked vegetables, you had no bacteria, you had no fermentation bacteria, you have no molds that normally recycle it, that break it down. So you've got hardened elements, especially the fat that's hardened and crystallized in your system, that you cannot naturally eliminate. There's no cyclic process to break it down. So if you eat some fermented vegetable juice once in a while, you're going to add to a detoxification. That's part of the detoxification and you can do that once in a while, but be discreet about it. Don't do it very often because you'll force a detoxification. I guarantee you're going to have enough detoxifications. This diet does not cause detoxifications unless you force it. This diet does not cause detoxifications unless you force it. People are sick on this diet just as much as they're sick on the other diets. But this diet doesn't add toxicity to your system that needs detoxification. This diet provides nutrients so that when you detoxify, you detoxify properly and you heal properly. Other diets don't do that. So detoxifications are chronic symptoms that go on and on and on. Take for example somebody with Crohn's disease or inflammatory bowel disease. They'll live with it their entire lives. Why? Because they're eating cooked nutrients that have toxicity, they're breathing and taking in elements that cause poisoning of the system, and they're never getting the environment right. Put them on my diet, especially to start. Put somebody on Crohn's disease. You know, the food's so bad, their intestines are so bad, food is passing into their blood.

[audio cut]

A: It's amazing. Can't digest it yet. You need to close that perforation, hydrate it and test it. You need to make sure that food isn't passing through, so nothing that is a complex digestible matter is to be avoided. Anything that is a complex matter to be digested is avoided. The liquid protein and the liquid fats in the egg, if they pass into the blood, the body can handle it. Still, digestion utilizes it in the system. But mostly it's all digested before it even gets very far in the digestive tract. So it's getting... The lymph system, instead of taking the nutrients from all over and delivering it to the rest of the body, the lymph system takes it from the beginning and throws it back into the small digestive tract and the large digestive tract to heal it. So instead of the lymph system taking its nutrients to heal and take care of the whole body, it'll take it to take care of itself, the digestive tract. And it works marvelously. So you don't want to play with detoxification too much. You just want to let the body heal on its own by feeding it properly. You're going to go through enough detoxification. I'm going through detoxification right now. I've got a rash all over my body right now that I haven't had signs like this for probably 15 years. And when I took a scraping of it, guess what I found? Chemotherapy. Radiation particles. I found irradiated iodine. And it's irradiated here. And when they took the contrast x-rays, they gave me iodine to contrast. So when I got the x-ray, I had radioactive iodine. You know how long radioactive... They say it has a half-life of 62 hours. In whose reality? 58,000 years is a full life. 58,000 years. And you know what they say that the half-life is? Oh, it takes that long for the body to discard it. Not that it won't be radioactive that long, but you know what they're doing. I've looked at the examinations in the test. They take one day and they check the feces and urine. 7% goes out the urine, 24% went out the feces. This was on an average, out the feces. They assume that for the next five days, they think you're going to assume that for the next four or five days that much is going to come out so it'll all be out and gone. They don't tell you that if they do the test for the next four days, they're going to see no more than 10, 15% in those whole next few days. That means that 50 to 70% of that toxic matter they put in your body to make the pictures better so they don't have to spend as much time reading them... Maybe it takes them five, ten minutes longer, but it's better for you to have the radioactive material in your body forever, for your life. If you lived 58,000 years, you'd be able to heal from it. Or you have to get it out of the body, and it's not easy to get it out of the body. I'm still dumping it, and I haven't had any of that in 38 years, 39 years. I'm still dumping it. I only do it about once every, let's see, the last time that I had a detoxification here that didn't affect the elbows was about four years ago, and the same elements were coming out, but they weren't coming out here.

Also, some fragments of a mold that's very similar to tetracycline, which I took as a child, and penicillin, also in this tissue here. It's hardened tissue in the elbows, which the result of when I took tetracycline when I was a teenager, that started my psoriasis. When I had chemotherapy, well, I started eczema. I got chemotherapy, psoriasis was every day. Now, this is the first time I've had it in probably 15 years, and back then I had it for about a month. This I've had it for about three weeks now. I'll probably have it for another week or two and it'll be gone again. So, I keep getting better every day, every year, every minute, as long as I take care of myself. So, in other words, I'm going to be like those kids who can do things the older I get. So, let's say I've got 16 more years to go to be completely healthy, I'll be 74 and I'll be newly born. I like that, I like that idea. If we look at all other animals and creatures in nature, they live seven times the time it takes them to finish maturation. If we finish maturation at 21 years old, we should be living to 147 years old. If we die at 70 years old, we're living half of our lives, less than half of our lives. No other creature does that unless they're living in captivity with bad foods or unless they get eaten. Naturally, death is seven times the time it takes them to finish maturation. At 74, I'll just be half-life. But I really don't care how long I live, I want to live healthily while I'm alive. Because all that other stuff about life, age and extension is theoretical. I don't know. I know I've met one person who lived to be 105, so I know that's possible. So, 74, if I'm healthiest I can be at 74, then if I make it to 105, I'm going to be a healthy person. Because I'm going to continue taking care of myself for that long time. And all of you have that option. Some people will say, listen, like my parents, you know, my mother, five years ago, got breast cancer. I'll take you back further. 1982, she was living on Jekyll Island, Georgia, which is an island off the coast of Georgia, about 60 miles north of Jacksonville, Florida. A lot of rich people lived there. My parents aren't really rich. They're in between... 

[audio cut]

A: During all this turmoil, living there and happily, you know, not having the friends she liked, probably had one friend there and that was it, she has a lot of anxiety, crappy diet, she didn't like my father, she didn't like anybody except me. Why did she like me? I don't know. I was a vegetarian and not a kind one. She started getting very sick and then a few years went by and I talked her into eating more raw food. She'd eat the raw eggs with the orange juice and she'd have olive oil with her, cooked meat, you know, raw stone pressed olive oil, eat the raw cheeses, so about 50% of her diet. So she started reversing her diseases pretty quickly doing that. You know, she grew up on raw milk at the time, you know, 1916 when she was born, so there was nothing but raw milk in those days. There was no such thing as pasteurization until 1928, you know, for milk in the United States. In England it was earlier, and in France it was earlier, but not here. So she had a good start. So for her, a little bit of raw goes a long way, and the same with my father. So my father started doing it too. Then after about nine years of that, they felt like they were super people again, so they went back to all their own shit foods, all of it no good food, except for maybe a banana or an apple once a day, or an orange or something. So it was lemonade and orange juice back to that stuff instead of fresh squeezed, all the garbage food. So five years ago, my mother came down with breast cancer. She called me and said, I'm going to have a lumpectomy, and you don't have anything to say about it. I said, well, then why are you calling me? Because you know I'm going to give you my two cents worth. So I said, that's all you're going to have is a lumpectomy. She says, no, I'm going to have the radiation too. And I said, Mom, what's behind your lungs? What's behind your breast? She says, lungs. And I said, what do you think is going to happen to your lungs? Think what happened to my spine. What's going to happen to your lungs? She says, I'll be mild. They don't do it like they used to do back then. I said, Mom, you're not a young girl, you know, you're 75 years old. I mean, 73 years old. This isn't, uh, you know, you're not a young woman. Oh, it'll be okay. They know what they're doing. You know, I'm a nurse. Okay, Mom. She lived on oxygen for five years. She's only been off the oxygen for two months. Five years to heal her lungs from the radiation. Five years. And she was supposed to die in December. She got so weak, she got so skinny, went down to 92 pounds, was wasting away, wouldn't eat. So I flew there several times and I fed her papaya. Tried to feed her custard. Too rich for her. She ate it once. But that doesn't increase appetite anyway. But papaya, plain papaya does. So I fed her about a half a cup of papaya. Every day that I fed her a half a cup of papaya, she ate four meals. I didn't know if they were cooked or what. I put a couple of raw tablespoons of butter in there into the food. And miraculously, they had the hospice people taking care of her today, giving her a month to live. A month turned into two months. And here it is, end of April. And she's back to preparing food for her and my father. She can't bathe herself... She can't stand that long without support and help. So the hospice people are still bathing her, but they tell her in a few weeks they're going to have to drop her from the hospice program because she's too healthy now.

So even a little bit with that type of person who grew up on raw milk and a lot of raw foods back in those days, it wasn't easy to cook everything back in those days. You had to light a fire. There were no stoves like there are now. I wasn't just go and turn a dial. You went out and you collected, you know, you had an outhouse. She grew up in Alabama with 12 brothers and sisters, you know. You didn't have time to cook everything. You made most everything raw. So she had a good start. All of those people had a good start. Sickest people were always the people who, children who belonged to rich people. Why? The rich people all had the conveniences. They could have everything cooked and anytime the child got sick, guess where they went? To a doctor. He's always injecting them or giving them some kind of pill. So you see all these little brainy little kids, they're also weak with their glasses on that are a product of rich people. Very sickly because they're always tended by the medical profession unless you have somebody who doesn't believe in that system and got rich. There are very few of them because it's considered high class to be able to take your children to a very high class doctor and those are the worst kind. So, next on the diet is the fruit. You alkalinize the blood a little bit so in the afternoon you want to have the fruit. You don't want to have fruit which is going to cause detoxification. High sugar causes alcohol in the stomach, alcohol in the system and alcohol always, always causes detoxification and we want a little bit of detoxification every day. So, one fruit meal a day and this is the time to do it, midday. You won't disturb yourself from sleeping at night and you won't cause the problem of over sugar production in the morning that makes the brain sticky and sluggish. And the blood. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The vegetable juice and then after that you have the fruit.´An hour and a half, two hours, unless you get too hungry quicker. You can always suck an egg in between to stretch it out. A couple eggs. And then... If you get hungry. And then the best thing to have if you want a clean is coconut cream. If I take coconut cream and I put it on this metal lid, it will turn gray in about an hour. It rips the metals out. If I put butter, cream, olive oil, coconut oil, any other kind of fat on here, it may take 24 hours to a week to start disintegrating that metal. But if you put coconut cream on there, it will rip it up instantly. 50 years ago, 90% of all the soaps, whether it was shampoo, body or laundry, contained coconut. Because it was so cleansing. But that means growing the coconuts, picking the coconuts, stripping the coconuts, these big husks, down to this thing, breaking them open, dealing with all that fermented product. It is so man hour intensive that they like now to make everything chemically. So that you have these rough industrial solvents going into your body instead of a food substance like coconut. They don't give a shit about your health at all. It is about profit, strictly now. Or else they would still make everything from coconut. All the soaps would still be from coconut. Body soaps and shampoos were 98% coconut. Now, rarely ever find it. Coconut cream is a wonderful substance to help cleanse the body. It helps dissolve lymphatic congestion. It helps dissolve anything. It makes you healthier, less aggressive viruses. Let's say you have 2 to 4, 5 ounces of coconut cream. Let's say if you are under 5'6, 2 ounces. Under 5'10, 3 ounces. Under 6'5, 4 ounces. Under 7'10, 5 ounces. You know, up to that point the next level that I mentioned prior to the higher level. So, have that in conjunction with a piece of fruit. And if you want to reduce the alcoholic reaction, because the more alcohol, the greater the detoxification. So, let's have unripe fruit. In Asia, the people over 30 never eat ripe fruit. Now the kids are getting all this garbage information from our TVs. Let me tell you, you wonder how they can afford it. They make 50 cents a day living in the jungle like that. And they have a TV. It will cost them 5 years of wages. And they've all got a TV. Who pays for the electricity? Our companies go over there and give TVs out and let them have electricity. Because you know what they're doing? Everybody wants to become part of America and the consuming public. And guess what 99% of the commercials are? Pharmaceuticals and fast foods. Pharmaceuticals and fast garbage food. And they buy it. It's terrible. So anyway, unripe fruit is the best thing to have. 

Q: Because it has a lower alcohol content?

A: It has a lower sugar level, the more sugar, the more alcohol that's created. Then have a little bit... Now if that starts detoxifying, which it will do a little bit, you want some animal fats with it to bind with those poisons. So you need some butter and or cream. So a tablespoon of butter, half a tablespoon of cream or half a tablespoon of butter, tablespoon of cream, tablespoon and a half of cream. And if it's a fruit that you're eating that won't cause a lot of stinky gas, then you could have an egg with it. Like if you had a custard, you know, with papaya and egg and coconut cream. That would be a food that you could put an animal fat of egg in there and it wouldn't create this awful gas. Very stinky sulfur type gas that would make you not very desirable. So think about that too when you're choosing a fruit to eat. You gotta combine egg in it. Then also honey is optional with that meal. It will always help, maybe a teaspoon, tablespoon. Then let two to three hours pass. It's going to take a while to digest and utilize all of that coconut cream. Now's a good time to have a small alkalinizing juice again, four to eight ounces depending on you and your system. If you have that juice and you find that it's two hours and you're still not hungry for meat and you just don't want to eat anything, the next day you cut that juice out. You go to a meat meal or you have the juice and then go to your meat meal an hour and a half, two hours later after the juice. Same meat meal as the first one with at least butter with it. Then if you want to balance the body, calm it down, sleep well, have another milkshake or some milk before you go to sleep, warm milk. Now remember I said if you go five hours without eating, the protein level in the blood drops, bottoms out, red blood cells start eating the red blood cells. Wait three, four, five hours. Have an egg, have a half of a milkshake, have some milk, something with protein in it to prevent that. Now if you're a person who sets the alarm for five hours after you go to sleep, you wake, you eat. God I'm not sleepy now, I can't go back to sleep and I want to get more sleep. Then you set the alarm for three hours. If you sleep eight hours, if you sleep seven hours, set it for two hours. Get up at half and go back to sleep. You'll sleep all the way through. Work it out with your body so you're not going five hours without eating. It's that simple. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Every day, every day. The body goes into a fasting mode, starts eating itself. You're not healthy enough to eat yourself.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It doesn't make any difference. Five hours, protein level... You can be 700 pounds and the protein level will bottom out. You'll have plenty of fat, but you won't have the protein. That's what causes the red blood cells to eat each other.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Those are in the latter part. That comes after about three and a half to four hours after you've been asleep. You wake up two or three hours after you go to sleep. Have that, go back to sleep. Those rhythm patterns are going to be a lot better because they're not going to be disturbed by the red cells eating each other. It's even going to be better. There's a lot of people who wake up after eight, ten hours sleep and they're running for the coffee or soda pop because the red blood cells are eating each other. A guy, let me give you a case in point. Had this fellow who was 49 when he came to me, and he's like an old man. He was a vegan for I think almost 13 years. This is the way he walked. 47 or 48 years old. That's not old. Walking around like this, almost hunchbacked. I put him on the diet, three years on the diet. Looks like he's a foot taller because he's standing up straight. He's probably only about 5'3". But he looks like he's much taller. He's standing up straight and feeling good. He said, Aajonus. But it's still noon, 11 o'clock noon before I have the energy. I'm so tired. It's hard to get going for the day. I said, John, how many seminars have you been to? How many workshops? Three? This will be the fourth this weekend. I said, how many times have I said, five hours without eating, what's going to happen? Are you waking during the night eating? No. I can't help you, can I? You don't listen. So, he said, you're [unintelligible]. So, that night he woke, had his drink, milkshake, went back to sleep. Guess what happened the next morning? He had energy. Changed his whole life. That's just one thing. You pay attention. Some things are very important. It may not work every day because you may be going through a healing state. And in a healing state, you sleep more. 90% of healing happens in the sleep state or one of the advanced alpha states. Doesn't mean you have to go to sleep to heal, but your body has to be in a very sedentary alpha state to heal. And most people don't get there unless they're heavy meditators or they're in bed sleeping. That's why 90% of healing happens in the sleep state. I want to give you another idea about fat. The difference between fat and protein as far as energy goes. Remember Arnold Schwarzenegger? Bodybuilder? What's the highest weight he could lift? 200 pounds less than the greatest weightlifter. 200 pounds less. Mr. Universe seven times? Couldn't be the best weightlifter in the world? No, because it's about fat. It's about fat loss. It's about muscle popping. Your weightlifters are all fat. Your wrestlers are all fat. Why? Because the greatest amount of energy comes from fat. Sumo wrestlers. Do you know how much strength is in one arm of those big fat people? One of them picked me up literally by my collar with a little finger. I'm 170 pounds. Can you imagine picking up 170 pounds with your little finger? These guys are incredibly strong. Incredibly strong. That's fat. Fat is so important. Yes back there young man, you need to eat your fat. We need to talk about salt. Everybody is addicted to salt. The only time that I mention salt as a remedy in my book is if you have adrenal exhaustion.

If you can't move, you may have a salt problem. Why do I say salt is bad under any other circumstance? Because salt clumps. Normally minerals in the body transport a myriad of substances. Vitamin A, Vitamin D, E, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, a whole complex network of nutrients are absorbed into the cell by virtue of attraction by these minerals. The ions in the side, one to two ions per cell will attract an ion as it transports all these nutrients. It could be a sodium ion, it could be potassium, it could be magnesium, it could be any of them, calcium, any of them, carrying this network of nutrients. It says, oh, I want that grouping right there and it takes it into the cell. When you eat salt, it causes a clumping of sodium molecules without a lot of other elements to go with it. Sometimes other elements will group. However, sodium molecules are very large. It carries a lot of H2O with it. Not cellularly absorbable H2O, it carries a lot of H2O with it. So this clump of matter cannot get into the cell. So what happens is the magnetism here is so great that it rips the ions out of the cell. So they shrivel like a raisin and die. One little bitty grain of salt will kill two million red blood cells. So what you want to do is eat things that have high sodium in them, which will disperse evenly. Tomatoes, watermelon, except for the heart because there's too much sugar in it. Celery juice, avocados. There are lots of foods that are concentrated in sodium that you can eat to take care of that balance. But if you have adrenal exhaustion, you just don't want to move. And I don't mean in the morning kind of lethargy, where you haven't gotten up and eaten during the night, but I mean just general fatigue, chronic fatigue that was caused by adrenal exhaustion, then salt could be indicated for that particular problem. Water. Well, we need eight glasses a day, don't we? That's the advertisement out there. Do you know when that advertisement started? Bottled water came into existence, and it was eight glasses a day. Do you remember as a kid at the water fountain, maybe you took two sips a day? You had milk, you had Coca-Cola and other soda pop, mainly milk. That was in the 50s, most of the 60s, and then all of a sudden bottled water hit the late 60s, early 70s? Eight glasses a day. Everybody needs eight glasses a day. The water industry needed you to drink eight glasses a day to pad its pocket. Water consumed is less than 10% cellularly absorbable. What happens when it rains? It dissolves the earth so that plants can eat. It is a solvent. If you look in an archeological textbook in any university, even in a high school, the first element that is listed as a solvent is water. It will dissolve your own intestines. It will denature your own nutrients in your intestines. Not a substance to have very often unless you have no alternative. You have vegetable juice, you have milk. Milk is 86% water. Meat is 45% water. Every raw food contains H2O that is 100% cellularly absorbable. Water in a bottle is not. It carries no nutrient value with it and it leaches and leaches and leaches. So it is preferable to eat foods raw so that you can utilize the water in them.

If you are going to drink water, and you will need a little bit because you are so toxic with industrial waste, you do need some water. In the winter, I am lucky if I drink a cup a week. Fall and winter. In the summer, I usually drink a cup a day. If I am in Asia and I can't get juice, I may drink four cups a day. But let me tell you, after six, seven weeks of doing that, my whole body has changed and I am not happy. When I get back here, I am sucking milk like an infant that is starving to death to replace all that stuff that I dissolved. My whole nature is not as good. When you do those things, it is a risk and it is not optimally healthy. Okay, question and answer time. Anybody have any questions? I am supposed to have answered everything. Yes?

Q: When they give you MRIs and they give you that kind of stuff, what is that?

A: That is either barium or iodine. It is radioactive for 58,000 years.

Q: With the enzymes, the live enzymes...

A: Live enzymes is a misnomer. Enzymes are like virus. They are protein bodies. They are not alive. If the proper nutrient combination of proteins and other nutrient combination of the enzymes will either be active or inactive, but they are never truly alive. Just to be clear about that.

Q: You still recommend in your book your recipe for curing the effects of vaccines by molding berries and drinking the juice.

A: I mentioned that in this book. He asked to help remove the mercury and other toxins.... Well the mutant antibodies is what I say helps remove the moldy berries. Drinking moldy berry juice and eating moldy berries as I described in the We Want to Live book is for getting rid of the mutant antibodies, not the mercury from vaccines. If you want to get rid of the mercury, you have to do cilantro and coconut cream, something like that together with dark berries to do that. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Or put it by your bed before you go to sleep so you wake up, down it and go back to sleep.

Q: But it should be protein, not a juice.

A: No, it shouldn't be a juice. It should be milk or egg or milkshake or meat.

Q: And the eating of your fat and your meal, is it ok to eat the meat first and then the fat?

A: Absolutely. In fact, it works a little bit better. If you eat your meat before the fat, you will digest more rapidly because the protein will already start being broken down and you'll make the enzymes, remember almost all enzymes are like 70% protein structure. So your enzyme...  

[audio cut]

A: ...you know, he used to be the skinny 6 foot 1 guy that never got to be a bodybuilder and always wanted to be one of the gorgeous bodybuilders. And all of a sudden after two years, he found that he was full bodied. But not big structured like weightlifters. So he said, Aajonus, can I bodybuild on this? And I said, sure, just with a pound of meat twice a day, eat a whole lubrication formula. And he said, okay. So in two months he gained 6 inches on his chest and 4 inches on his arms. Gold's gym, you know what they accused him of? 

Q: Pumping steroids. 

A: Pumping steroids. He says, no, I'm telling you, it's just raw eggs and raw meat and raw butter. Sure it is. Sure it is. And he's been pumping iron now for three years. And he went from about my size in the shoulders to about here. He's huge. Huge. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I wouldn't buy anything from Organic Pastures if you have an alternate choice. Only if it's your last choice. But I've got a product list that gives you many suppliers. 

Q: I have a supplier, but I find that there's one out, [unintelligible]. And then after 12 weeks, it's turned into blue cheese, and that's just bad.

A: Well, there's a lot of other farmers. Yeah, just try more farmers.

Q: The coconut, you gave me a demo of the metal lid. Is that because you want that to dissolve [unintelligible]?

A: Yes, you want the coconut to go in there and dissolve that toxicity and remove it.

Q: Which toxicity?

A: Any kind of toxicity. Remember I said that it helps with the eyes, lymphatic congestion, metals. It'll dissolve almost anything.

Q: I'm needing to satisfy the urge to grind it with my teeth. And I know what to say about the fighting with acid and sunflower seeds or nuts, but what satisfies my teeth is sunflower seeds. I need that grinding.

A: Okay. Take a celery and chew on celery and spit out the pulp.

Q: I had thought of it. It's not as satisfying as...

A: It's even more satisfying. You'd be surprised.

Q: It's like the texture. You can't really feel that in your diet. That chewing, grinding. You want something crunchy.

A: Okay. Grab a bone. Chicken bone. That's true. The Eskimos will sit there and chew on a bone all night. Do it. It also shows that you're fat deficient when you have that problem. Too many sugars in the body.

Q: She doesn't look like she's fat deficient.

A: Very. Only for the first year did I get her to get fat. Now she won't get fat ever. You still have 20%? But a woman's supposed to have 27 to 30. 22 is okay for a man. 20% is okay for a man.

Q: And how much for a woman?

A: 27 to 30. Yes.

Q: How long do you think, relatively, to switch out, let's say, bad fats out of the body to ones that are more conducive to...

A: It's taken me 34 years to get to where I am, and I probably have another 5% to go out of my bones. Now, when I went to that, I had a hip size that was large. My hips were larger, my shoulders were smaller. Now, in the last 5 years, I've been removing the bone structure here and changing it. So I've gone from hips this size to hips this size. My bones are denser and harder now, and smaller. 

Q: How did you do that? 

A: It just took my body that long. It took me 30 years to get to that point where it started working on this bone structure that way. Yes?

Q: Along those lines, do you agree with what Sally brings out? How the primitive diet people have a broader space of dental structure and room for their teeth and don't have the...

A: Well, that's from Price. And Price was a theorist. He was not a scientist. He went around observing, and he had a great imagination like archaeologists do. No facts about it. If I can take you to the Maasai tribe or the Samburu tribe, and you have one guy that looks like a jaw structure like yours, and another guy has a jaw structure like him, in the same tribe, and they're all eating raw food.

Q: So they have more room for their teeth.

A: That's different, yes. There's a problem. If they get off on a bad diet, you're going to have dental occlusions, and not enough space, and all kinds of problems.

Q: If you're on a good diet, you're not going to have those problems.

A: Right, yes.

Q: What about cavitation? [unintelligible]

A: I've only seen people under 25 able to really regenerate dentine, and what do they call that, the tubules. To regenerate tubules and dentine, I've only seen that in people under 25 who are eating lots of dairy that was not refrigerated.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay, there's the main problem there. Remember I said the brain contains the most toxic metals? Concentration of metals, because the nerves and the neurons use the heavy metals, metallic minerals. Guess where they discharge? Gums, the tongue, the salivary enzymes, and the sinuses. The gums is the worst, and the tongue is the next. When you get a cavity, it's never bacterially oriented. It never is caused bacterially. That is all absolute garbage. So that you buy these antibacterial toothpastes, and make it just if anything worse. When those metals come out, you put mercury on anything. You put thallium on anything, it's going to damage the dentine. So it dissolves the dentine, then the bacteria comes as a response to eat the deteriorated dentine cells. That's why the bacteria is there. So, she's having a problem, she doesn't have a good diet. She needs lots of cheese. You know, lots of cheese with everything she eats. If she has a tendency to constipation, she needs to eat butter with that cheese. That's another thing we need to talk about. Go ahead and get your question first, young man.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: A dog? Yes. They should all eat raw foods. Lots of eggs, meat, butter, and a little honey. The dogs are scavengers, so they can have dates and a little fruit here and there. Most cats won't eat that kind of thing. You need to stick strictly to the animal stuff. Cats don't like old food. Dogs love old, rotting meat. Excuse me, are you going to have to take the kids out if this continues? The cats like fresh food. They don't like old food. Dogs love old, rotten food. They thrive on it. In fact, I have coyotes that visit me almost every day in my home in Malibu up in the mountains.

Q: Bye.

A: Bye.

Q: Bye.

A: I'd like you to stay, but you have too much energy.

Q: Yes.

A: I know. Bye. Now these coyotes, you know, man tells you and it's advertised all the time, survival of the fittest. Survival as a fittest does not exist unless you're in a desert where there's very little food and all of the animals are not at a peace of mind. The coyotes come up, the skinniest, the weakest always gets to eat. I don't care if none of them have been eating for a week. The skinniest, weakest always gets to eat first. Unless I throw high meat out there. Everybody fights. Everybody fights. The high meat just makes them crazy. It's like John Goodall, who was Jane's father. He was into apes long before she was. When I was so sick and ill, I needed to start making money again. My brain wasn't working to do flow charts anymore in programs, so I started editing motion pictures. I could be in the editing room alone and pass bad gas and do it in pots and pails because I couldn't make it to the toilet. I'd be isolated in a room and nobody would bother me. I'd just lock the door and I'd be in there with the film. The fellow in the room next to me was John Goodall. He wrote and produced and edited a film called The Beginning. It won the Academy Award for Best Full-Length Documentary. I think it was 1971. What he did was show many kinds of animals giving birth. He lived with an ape for 30 days to watch her give birth. It was wild. You see her sitting there, doing this, very calm in her cage. All of a sudden she goes over into a corner, goes like this. She's got the baby in her hand. She takes it and licks it clean, bites this placenta, umbilical cord, and takes care of that baby, licking it and stroking it. Two contractions, not one peep of sound. Women who give birth on this diet have the same thing. Two contractions, and the baby's out. Relatively no pain. Sure has happened with the last two.

Q: I'm just hoping to give you a message, the first mini consultation is Steve O'Connell. [unintelligible]

A: Cats mainly, and if it's a little dog, they should mainly eat chicken. Birds, that's mainly what they eat, and they should always eat the bone with it, not the skin. Dogs, anything depending upon the size of dog. Small dogs, bird dogs, basically that's it, they should eat rodents and small creatures. Cats, the same thing.

Q: Lab.

A: Lab, then chuck steak. Garbage, throw away food, best thing for them. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, well it was the cheese, cheese is a processed food. It's a dehydrated food, so it's no longer enzyme active. A lot of people, well it's raw, it has those enzymes in it, they're inactive. So what happens is it's high in a mineral concentration, so there's a lot of magnetism to it. So when you eat cheese with other foods other than honey, it acts as a magnet. So as the blood, the lymph fluid, and the blood circulates through the stomach and intestines, if there are metals and other toxic substances related to minerals floating in those serums, the cheese pulls it right out, magnetizes it right in. It doesn't do it to the good elements until, unless they're already locked with the contaminating elements. Then it will all draw in, the cheese draws it out. If you want to have a mineral supplement, if you need a mineral supplement to strengthen anything in your body, bones, maybe you have osteoporosis, anything like that, cheese and honey together, tablespoon of cheese, teaspoon of honey with it, have to be eaten together in the same mouth. Then the enzymes in the honey will convert the cheese, so all those minerals that are in the cheese and even the fats can be absorbed and utilized intracellularly. So it turns it back into an active food. But it turns it into, so it won't act as a detoxifier, like when you don't eat honey with it. Now you can have honey in a milkshake, and you eat the cheese first, it will not be absorbed, it will still act as a detoxifier. You have to eat the honey and the cheese right together for it to do that. And that is your best and greatest mineral supplement. This is your only perfect mineral supplement. And it works very quickly, very rapidly. Okay, yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, what did I say earlier? When the bee swallows it, it creates an insulin-like substance. So we don't have to build it. It's already done. That's why I say in my book, a diabetic should eat a cup of honey a day, because it already has the insulin in it. But it has to be a honey that's never gone over 93 degrees.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No. You've got to find a beekeeper that will not heat the honey at all while extracting it. So he has to extract it as soon as he brings the hive in, to bottle it quickly. And there are just certain people who do that.

Q: Uncapping a [unintelligible] with a hot knife, is that...

A: They do it quickly, and it's okay. It's not a problem.

Q: The coconut cream, is that something we create from the raw product?

A: Yes. It tells you how to do it in both books, how to make coconut cream. Because it's so important.

Q: It's so hard to find a fresh coconut around here.

A: Yeah, it is. What you have to do is go to an Asian area, or a Mexican area, where those populations are higher, and they go through them like hot cakes. So you always find the good ones there.

Q: And the papaya too.

A: Papaya too, yeah. You have to go to those communities. Chinatown, you know, if you have, like in Texas and Los Angeles, we have a little Saigon, you know. Any of those areas, you're going to find lots of fresh coconuts.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Coconut cream is not coconut oil. Coconut oil is the oil that's separated from the coconut cream. And it's mainly solvent reactive, and it only works with water-soluble fats, and water-soluble minerals and the vitamins. Coconut cream works with all, everything. It isn't just restricted and isolated. You can do what I did when I didn't have, you know, I bought the machinery in Thailand to make coconut cream on a big scale. So in Los Angeles, we have that for our Buyer's Club. But before that, I put up a three-by-five card at a high school gymnasium that said, need somebody who likes to break things, $8 an hour. I got about 50 calls from lots of athletes. I took an African-American thin end on a football team, good with his hands, could do work, think, you know, very well. Had him come in once every five to six weeks, juice eight to ten coconuts for me. It says there, you mix lime juice with it. It preserves it for a couple of months. So I'd have him come in, it cost me $60, he'd have a good weekend, and I'd have a good five, six weeks of coconut cream supply. Just remember that even if the coconut cream slightly ferments, it's even better. It's even more cleansing, maybe not as appetizing. And also another good thing to do with fermented coconut is to brush your teeth. Man, does it dissolve plaque. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Fermented coconut oil is a good replacement oil. You know, if you can't get the fats, it also will help dissolve certain matter. It's like olive oil, peanut oil, anything like that. It's a concentrated oil that doesn't really stabilize cells. It's not good to have a lot of it in the body, and it can help clean. It can help make solvents that help break down oils, oil products in the body. It won't make a cleanser that breaks down any other substance unless it's oil-based. That's why I don't like that as the best. Like coconut cream, where it can dissolve. It can make viruses and other kinds of solvents that will break down any kind of toxicity in the body. Yes.

Q: Why are [unintelligible]?

A: I said earlier, the body's going to burn it. It takes a lot of fat to fuel the body because of all of our toxic substances in the body. We use massive amounts of fat. You cannot eat enough fat. You cannot have enough fat in the meat. I have strips of fat with my meat like that. It's still not enough. I'll eat a half of a lubrication formula or five tablespoons of butter along with some honey, along with that, because of the mass amount of fat needed in the system. I've done it with tests. Humans and animals, you eat the meat with the meat fat, burns it. There's no extra, and there's no increase in cellular division. Just burn it up. Big waste. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Of course. For personal care products, you want to be very restrictive about it. My personal care product, lemon juice in the armpits, egg for shaving and for my hair, soap, that's it. Coconut cream I'll put in my bath. Coconut cream I'll use on my body to clean, fermented even better. I don't use any store-bought products for my personal care. The only store-bought item I use is Biokleen degreaser for laundry and for cleaning certain things in the house. Toilets and sinks. BioKleen, that's B-I-O-K-L-E-E-N degreaser.

Q: Wild oats sells it.

A: I like wild oats. I do not like whole foods. Whole foods is a bunch of hype. They have that Bush mentality. It's all hype. They talk about Go Organic and Go Organics. Every store that they have, they never offer more than 2% organic anything. And you have to always say Go Organic or Go Organic. When they had one of the best meat products in their stores, which is the New Zealand All Grazed Beef, they got rid of it for an inferior meat to make more money. Then they went the whole road. And I've talked to all the executives in Texas. And it's a Texas firm that bought up all these health food stores for the money and not one of them has a clue about health. It's all about making money. It's all about advertising. Go Organic. And they are the least organic of any health food store out there, except for those things that call them health food stores and they're just vitamin stores, supplement stores. That's the worst. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]. What is your take on that? How can you get that?

A: Go naked.

Q: That's a classic.

Q: Not all of us really can do that practically. We live in apartments [unintelligible].

A: Yeah. It's best to get as much sun as you can. The butter, you know, is pretty good. If you want to... The butter will last about three months before it starts going into blue cheese, but even when the blue cheese, starts forming into blue cheese, the vitamin D is higher. So...

Q: What about cod liver oil?

A: Cod liver oil is highly processed. It has to be purified both with the solvent and with heat. The FDA requires it. No protein in it or else it is of an environment for bacteria. So there's nothing good about cod liver oil anymore. And the 82 is when it stopped. When Reagan signed a bill that says no raw food will cross state lines, that was the annihilation of raw milk that was available in all states through Altadena Dairy in California. I mean, I could go to Alaska and get Altadena Raw Dairy. Once he signed that bill, that was it. It was an executive order outlawing any raw product across state lines for sale in its form. Hold on. So... Everybody who puts out cod liver oil as good is full of you know what. And I'm not talking about healthy shit. Full of myth.

Q: Why did Reagan do that? What was his purpose?

A: Oh, he was in the hands of money. Oh, he was in the hands of money, industry. Reagan was the biggest sellout we've ever had. Even when he was in SAG he was a sellout. You know, Bob Hope nearly killed him because when he was president he made a deal with Sam Arkoff the head of MCA and in Universal and MGM he made a deal behind the doors that there would be no residuals paid on any film made before 1960. Most of those old timers like Bob Hope made all of their films before 1960. So Bob Hope and all of those people, Frank Sinatra, all of them never got a residual on any of those films made before 1960. And what did they do for Reagan? They made him governor. They made him rich. Bought his land that he had that wasn't worth much for eight times what it was worth. They put him in the presidency. They gave him, do you remember Die Hard? The building they blew up in it? He had the 17th floor, I mean the 21st floor in that building free.

Q: And look what happened to him, he has Alzheimer's, so that's just punishment.

A: So he was a seller. He always did everything for anybody that would pad his pocket. Okay, questions.

Q: How long will the meat last, [unintelligible].

A: Well, did anybody see me on Ripley's Believe It or Not?

Q: I did.

A: Two people. July 17, 2002, I have a copy, but you can get it, you can call Ripley's Believe It or Not, and they'll lead you to the company that makes it and duplicates it. It's the most shown episode that they've ever produced. They've shown it 46 times at last count, which is a month ago. I guess somebody who watches for it. They've shown it 46 times since July 17, 2002. I'm eating meat that's over a year old. It is gangrenous. It's black with mold. It's full of parasites, flies, maggots, you name it, and I ate it. They've got an inspector there that's freaking out. Don't eat this. Don't eat this. It'll kill you. It'll kill you. I have three other patients who are eating it too. They come on for a few seconds that they're on there. I had no response. The poor cameraman was puking all over me. He had to get right down there with me and I've got my face in this stuff. Poor guy. Anyway, the guy had to get cotton balls with clove oil and stuff them up his nose to keep him from vomiting because he kept interrupting the whole session. So that worked to stop it, but it can be very old. It doesn't matter. Don't suggest you keep it in plastic, though. You put it in glass jars. Just remember that dairy and meats never go bad, they just turn into cheese. And if you want them, if you can't eat the meat, if it's jerky, you have to eat the honey with the meat. If it's cheese, you have to eat the honey with the cheese if you want it digestive. Just remember that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The meat will start disintegrating the plastic, cause phthalates and PCBs to gas into the food.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If it gets warm and starts starting...

Q: If it doesn't get warm.

A: If it doesn't get warm, that's okay. That won't do, that won't do. Okay. As long as it's kept cold. Cold enough. Yes.

Q: Do you have a recommendation of how to use butter? I mean, do you make a sauce?

A: Yeah, I love Roquefort sauce.

Q: How do you prepare it?

A: It's in the recipe book.

Q: I missed it, I'll have to look for it.

A: Yes, you have.

Q: Second, do you want to make a comment to people who don't know about not chewing their meat?

A: Oh, yes. People wonder about chewing their food. You do not have to chew meat. You should not chew meat. You got the ptyalin enzyme, which is alkalinizing. If you have too much of that in the food, you're not going to digest your meat as well. All hunter tribes, raw or cooked, only chew their meat two to three chews to crush it enough to swallow it. So do not chew your meat. Just crush it enough to swallow it. Unless you have no hydrochloric acid like I do, then rip it to shreds. I just take little bites and swallow it without chewing much.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you're eating fruit, if you're eating any kind of sugar, it doesn't only work with grains. Ptyalin works with any kind of carbohydrate. But if you're eating a fruit a day, you're going to continue to manufacture ptyalin. And the hunter tribes that don't eat fruit, even the Maasai, do not chew their meat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Shake it up. You just have different bacteria that break it down to lower temperatures. But it's still pre-digested, so it's still better. Just remember that your sour milk is pre-digested. Your sour cream is pre-digested. Anything that's soured is pre-digested and you're going to absorb more of the nutrients. You're going to have less digestive factors to have to accomplish. 

Q: Can you eat honey with high meat?

A: Yeah, you can, but you don't need it. It's likely to disturb a little bit of the bacterial balance in it. So I recommend not eating honey with high meat.

Q: When I make cream and I try to make sour cream, I always get a lot of orange mold stuff. What do you do with that? Is that normal?

A: Yeah, that's normal. Molds are like bacteria and parasites. They'll break down toxicity in the system. They're pre-digesting that cream. That's fine. That's what pre-digesting is.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, what are you putting your cream in? You must be using some kind of cleaning compound. I never get that unless there's some other substance involved in it. I've had many batches of cream sitting up to two years to make hard cream cheese. I've never had a pink development.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, that's what it is. You're getting a mold that normally isn't cheese.

Q: I don't think you finished your John Goodall story.

A: Oh, right, yeah. John Goodall was telling me, he did this film. I told you about the ape, but there was another story that he also told me and showed me in videotape. I mean, he shot it in 35mm. Or was it 16 blown up? I don't remember. Anyway, it was on film. And they followed this tribe of gorillas for quite a few months. They always ate green bananas, the peel in it. Very alamine. Plus, they needed saliva to break it down, which would be difficult. So they cut down a whole bunch of the bananas and put them in the back of one of the jeeps. When it turned yellow and they ripened, they threw it out to the gorillas that they were following. And the gorillas curiously went around, picking them. Go like that, they'd squeeze out all over. It took about 40 minutes to realize that one of them realized, peeling it, and everybody else, all the other gorillas, peeled it after that, were eating it. Within 20 minutes of eating those high-sugar bananas, they were all fighting. They had enough bananas to feed every one of that tribe for over 10 days. And they were fighting over the bananas. One of the infants got a broken leg, and one of them was killed. So that's how violent they were about it. They were such big apes, you know, they were silverbacks, that they couldn't get in to get the bananas away. So they had to wait until they had 10 days to eat them all. So it was a pretty big mess. You know, that's what high-sugar would make you, crazy. And the killer monkeys, they'll go on a 24-hour binge eating of fermented fruit, like figs and overripe bananas. And they'll do that for about 24 hours, and then they'll go on a 24-hour killing spree. Kill anything, mainly other monkeys, but anything that they find. If they find a pig, if they find a squirrel, any kind of creature, they'll kill any creature they come in contact with after eating all that high-sugar. So you don't want all that high-sugar. It makes you overly emotional, irrational, and crazy. Yes?

Q: Do you want to mention something about the Rawesome food club?

A: No. Okay, we're going to have to get moving here. We're at 6:17. So we're going to take a short break, a ten-minute break. Nobody talks to me at this time. I've got to get ready to focus on mini-readings. Everybody can stay that isn't having a mini-reading, and you'll learn a lot more. How many people are having mini-readings? Two, four, six, eight, seven. Okay.

[break]

Q: Any more than that?

A: That's all? Are you eating salt? Oh, that's it. You're holding too much water. I'm going to recommend that every third day, a grapefruit in the afternoon is your fruit. [unintelligible]. Good. Okay. The left testis is about 50% hardened. The left adrenal gland is in very good shape. The left side of the pancreas is about 50% hardened. Left thyroid is okay, parathyroid is okay, tonsil area is okay. The right testis is about 60% hardened. The right adrenal gland is pretty good, a little weaker. The right side of the pancreas is about 60% hardened. Right thyroid is okay, parathyroid is pretty good, tonsil area is okay. Still have a scar in there, but it's okay. Lots of bile in the intestines. Overall improvement over the last year is about 2.5% to 3%, so you're right on schedule. Pretty good. How much do you do the diet? Still have a lot of heavy metals in the brain and spread throughout the system. That gangrenous type mold is likely to cause some diarrhea, some vomiting, so you might eat some cheese to help absorb it. If you're eating enough dairy, it might not. Mineral balance is pretty good. Still have a lot of dryness in the tissues. Are you eating the lube formula at all?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's got to be together to do some of this. [unintelligible]. So go back to eating the lube formula with everything. Otherwise, you're doing pretty well. Improving everything, face, everything. All that bile still is there, irritating your system, so it still may be difficult for you to relax and be very calm. So you're going to have to exercise still a lot. Burn that off, so you won't have so much high anxiety. Okay? 

Q: I think you told me to do everything the same.

A: It's working. Don't change what's working. Are you the one that wanted to buy the book? Okay, just give her a second. You already did? Okay. Okay, let your hands go forward. Left ovary is about 50% hardened and protein deficient. The left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Left side of the pancreas is about 60% good and 40% hardened. Left thyroid is a little low. Parathyroid is excellent. Tonsil area is okay. The right ovary is about... It's pretty good. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Right side of the pancreas is about 90% hardened. Right thyroid is very good. Parathyroid is excellent. Tonsil area is okay. You still have some liver problems, mostly gallbladder problems. Lots of metal in the gallbladder. Right kidney is working probably by 40%. Left one is okay. Left side of the spine is drying quite a bit. Lots of water retention there. Left shoulder is same. Are you eating any carrot juices? I'd like you to have 6 ounces of carrot juice a week with 3 tablespoons of coconut cream and 2 tablespoons of dairy cream. You have that in the afternoon in place of the fruit twice a week. Never closer than 3 days apart. Are you eating any fish? Which red meat are you eating?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You don't do this diet?

Q: No.

A: So you eat cooked fish or raw fish?

Q: I eat raw fish.

A: Is the red meat cooked?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Poor circulation in the intestines [unintelligible]. Do you eat a lot of cheese? A lot of cheese, the left side of your body is mineral deficient. [unintelligible]. The muscles are stable on the left side of the body, especially on the left side of the spine. [unintelligible]. Eat raspberries with some coconut cream and cheese, instead of butter or cream. Four tablespoons of coconut cream, one and a half tablespoons of cheese, and three quarters of a cup of raspberries. Twice a week. Drinking any raw milk? You need at least four ounces a day.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible] Okay, the left ovary is a hollow area, have you had surgery? 

Q: Yes.

A: [unintelligible] It's almost like a desert in that ovary kind of circulation. So if you use a hot water bottle, you're going from the left side over here, the left side, just to start speeding up circulation. The left adrenal gland is about 30% hardened, it's okay. The left side of the pancreas is about 80% okay. The left thyroid is pretty low, parathyroid is pretty low. The right side of the right ovary, that one's fine, it's in good shape. You've got some hardened tissue there, about 20%, that's good for me. The right adrenal gland is a little waterlogged, but it's functioning okay. It should retain a lot of water and fluid, but it's not a healthy thing. The right side of the pancreas is about 40% hardened, 40%. The right thyroid is okay, parathyroid is fair. The tonsil area is very poor. The gallbladder has lots of metals in it. The liver is in pretty good shape, kidneys are in pretty good shape. The right [unintelligible] has lots of metals in it. The left kidney is okay, but it's shriveling a bit. The whole left side of the body is shriveling. It's starting to dry. You can feel it along the spine, especially from the shoulder down to the shoulder blade. And then at the waist, just for that dip in the waist. The whole right is weak. [unintelligible]. Lots of metals in the brain, especially in the left, right ear. Bring up the right ear. Lots of metals all over you, from the bronchioles to the right bronchioles. You were raised around a smoker?

Q: Mhm.

A: There's some pretty nasty tars in the upper left lung, below the [unintelligible]. Your danger area. Tumorous activity there. It doesn't manifest solidly. Here, yes, there is a little bit of fibroid activity. I'm going to suggest you get some raw tobacco, green tobacco. Juice it and ferment it. You have a few drops of it in your vegetable juice every day. You have to start doing that out before it turns into such a big deal. You probably have about four years to do it. That looks like four years. You have poor circulation to the spleen. [unintelligible]. I suggest a vegetable juice to you of 85% celery, 2.5% cilantro, 7.5% parsley, and 5% carrot. I suggest that you do 1 to 1.5 tablespoons of coconut cream right before you drink this juice. I'd like you to have two juices a day. First thing in the morning about 12 ounces. Then about 4 ounces in the afternoon. I suggest you do two meat meals a day. [unintelligible]. The other day you can have dark berries, blueberries, blackberries, and boysenberries. With about three to four tablespoons of coconut cream. A tablespoon of dairy cream and a half tablespoon of butter. No, maybe three quarters of a tablespoon of butter. And about two teaspoons of honey. On the opposite days, I suggest for your digestibility here, that you have custard. Two meat meals a day, at least a pound of meat a day. I suggest that you eat a lot of fish as part of that meat. At least 50%. If you eat oysters with red meat, it gets rid of this metal poisoning in your brain and the upper part of your body. And it goes down to the left side, all the way around the heart, and down out here to about your thigh. To help remove that, I suggest a cup of red meat and three oysters, twice a day, six days a week. That'll help remove it quicker. I had a woman who grew up under London Airport, and she did that for one year. And she was on the diet a year and a half before that woman off, couldn't stick with it. So when I gave her that formula, she ate it. And in that year that she ate that, she did it religiously. As much metal as most people remove in five years, in one year. So that'll help you move quicker in that direction. So follow eating schedule number two, which is to meat meals a day in the recipe book. Okay? You're welcome.

Q: Jocelyn Roy, come on down.

A: And which door do you choose? Oh, you get rashes?

Q: Yeah. [unintelligible]

A: How bad?

Q: Very bad.

A: Show me the worst part. Blessings. Oh, okay. Oh, so you dry spotted. Take a grapefruit, and you rub it on it, and it will decontaminate the poison that's coming from the skin. It'll also deaden the skin faster and sort of fall off. Because it's taking a long time for those skins to die. And even though the grapefruit juice will help it die quicker, it needs to die.

Q: Right.

A: To get those elements off, so you stop the itching and stuff like that. And it's very dry. You've got to eat lots of moisturizing formulas. You know, that butter and the lemon juice and the egg and honey. Fermentation in wine is [unintelligible]. Grapes have a tendency to mold even when on the vine. They're one fruit that will mold on the vine. So there's a high propensity to mold. In fact, Pasteur got started by pasteurizing this wine that had been molded on the vine to destroy the wine. So they sold it to the peasants because they pasteurized it. But it indicates how delicate and sensitive to molds the grapes are. So if you eat wine, you're asking for heavy trouble. So you need to stay away from it. Until it's removed, you might try like the French do, eat cheese and rich sauces with it. So it absorbs all that contamination and it won't affect you. But as long as you're as thin as you are, you better eat lots of fat with it and not eat it at all. Drink it at all. Okay?

Q: Okay.

A: You're drying up everywhere. It's like a desert inside. Also, you're protein deficient. So you're not doing this diet?

Q: No.

A: When did you learn about it?

Q: Today.

A: Today? You ended up in here today?

Q: It's a good place to be.

A: How did you get in here? You're extremely protein deficient. The left ovary is hardened about 80 percent. And it's protein deficient about 20 percent. So that ovary is not even functioning. Then this left adrenal gland. The left adrenal gland is about 25 to 30 percent hardened. The left side of the pancreas is about 75 percent hardened. So that's not good. The left thyroid is okay. Parathyroid is fair. The tonsil area is very poor. Relax. Well, the tonsils protect the brain. So if the tonsils aren't working, then your lymph system has to do it. If the lymph system isn't doing it, nothing can help you. Relax the thumbs. The right ovary is about 30 percent protein deficient, but it's not all hardened up. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Relax. The right left side of the pancreas is about 50 percent hardened, so you have 25 percent of your pancreas working, which is okay. Right thyroid is very good. Parathyroid is fair. Tonsil area is very poor. [unintelligible] Relax. Very poor circulation along the torso from the nipples down. Irritation all the way up in the high cavity. Shoulders, clavicle area. Relax. The liver, very poor circulation in the liver. Lots of metal toxicity. Got a long way to go. The liver is going to have to get to recover soon. Were you here for the whole? Okay. Remember the egg thing I said?

Q: 20 a day.

A: Yeah, we do 20 a day. I'd like you to do one every 40 minutes. All day long, a little cup of beef. An equal amount of red and white. So half a cup of white, half a cup of red. Preferably fish. Wild-caught fish. Wild ocean-caught fish. Definitely lubrication moisturizing formula. What I'd like you to do is make a batch that's... Is this being recorded for you? Do you have anybody writing this down for you?

Q: We're taping it.

A: You're taping it? I'd like you to make a moisturizing formula of three eggs, four tablespoons of butter, two and a half tablespoons of lemon juice, and one and a half teaspoons of honey. Tastes kind of like a lemon meringue. I'd like you to add two ounces about 20 minutes after your first juice in the morning. Then about five hours later, two ounces more. Five hours later, another two ounces more, and then two ounces before you go to sleep. That should help. And if you have any left, depending upon the size of eggs, then have it with your last meal of the day. Well, you should only have one meal, so have that with your last meal at seven o'clock. And eat eggs all day long. If you get too hungry, then you have one every half an hour instead of every 40 minutes. And have a cup of milk to relax your system if you need that. [unintelligible] and have a cup of milk that's body temperature or warmer with three tablespoons of cream. Vegetable juice I'm going to recommend is 90% celery, 5% parsley, 5% carrot. And have a tablespoon of cream. And follow eating schedule number two in the recipe book. Once you start eating. You know, other than lots of eggs. I'd like you to do it for at least... When you start feeling really good and energetic and like you're digesting better. So, it could be two and a half to three months. Every half an hour to 40 minutes.

Q: For three months?

A: And yeah, have a vegetable juice. A vegetable juice I recommend once a day. About eight ounces. During the night you could go, you know, almost the whole night. But you need to have, you know, not over five hours without an egg. You can sleep during the night without having an egg. All in your waking hours. It'll improve you much faster than anything else will. Depends on how quick you want to do it. Next.

Q: Marlise Roy? Did I butcher it?

Q: No, you did well.

Q: Really?

A: Did you say Marline?

Q: Marlise.

A: That ovary is very hollow. Do you have it? Did you have surgery?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Relax. It's like a huge hole there, so it's probably working by only 20%. The left adrenal gland is okay. The left side of the pancreas is about 50% working. That thyroid is good, parathyroid, excellent. Tonsil area is good.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, you shouldn't be. Both of them are good. You shouldn't be taking thyroxine. No, no, what you do need is just eat a good diet. You need to eat like egg with fish and egg with beef, and that should give you everything you need. You can have some zucchini or zucchini juice to help that bit. Also eating dates with butter, butter and cheese. Dates with butter and cheese would be very helpful for your thyroid. So like eat two dates a day, like medjool dates with equal amount of cheese and about equal amount of butter. So just once a day. That's it. So the left ovary is a little bit better. Probably working like 40%. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. The right side of the pancreas is probably 30% hardened. So 70% working. The right thyroid is excellent. The parathyroid is excellent. The tonsil area is very good. Your main problems are in your digestive tract. All of your problems are in your digestive tract. You need to eat good food. You might go every other day eating one day almost all eggs. About every half an hour to an hour. And then the next day eat a regular balanced diet. Where you have juice in the morning. The juice I recommend should be 80% celery. Make that 85% celery. 5% parsley. 5% zucchini. 5% carrot. And have a little cheese before you drink the juice. Like a teaspoon of cheese. And then meat. How old are you?

Q: 82.

A: So I'm going to suggest two cups of meat a day.
