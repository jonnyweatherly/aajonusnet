A: I got into this because I was a very sickly child. I was born a sickly child. I was born into a violent household where the discipline was the belt, the board, something. And also, I was raised both Catholic and Jewish and in the Catholic religion, you know... Back then, they were very violent people. And I was, I turned autistic at 18 months old from a tetanus shot. I had a brother who was still in diapers when I came home from the hospital and was very jealous. So he started torturing me the day I got home. And he used to push me on rusty nails and rakes and anything. My mom's a nurse, so when she sees rust, she panics. So it was injections and injections. And back then, a tetanus shot was supposed to last a year, now it's five years. Tomorrow will be a year, six months, whenever the pharmaceutical needs a little bit more money, they'll change the rules on it. And so my mother, in all of her career, and still, she's still alive at nine years old, 91. She only saw one case of lockjaw, yet it would still panic her. So by the time I was 18 months old, I'd gotten three tetanus shots. And the third one, mercury went to my brain, turned me autistic. I was unable to fit my brain around the idea of language and communication. So I became a parrot. I listened to sounds, and I repeated them back. So, I was always saying mean, incongruous stuff all the time. But because my parents wouldn't let me stay in my autistic stares, those ones where you just go off, you separate yourself, I would separate myself from all the craziness around. One thing that children have when they're born, at least I remember, is you can tell when something is not truth. This planet is hell. Because when a child comes in, he knows who's lying at all times and all moments. And almost everybody is lying at every moment, especially parents. They're always making up stories why you should behave and why you should do this. And it's all a lie. And you sit there and look at your parents. You both admire them because there are these gods before you. And you know they're lying at the same time. It's a traumatic and devastating experience for an infant. But by the age of seven, the child is so numbed to it. And he's doing it too, so everybody's a liar. As an autistic child, I was never able to get out of that experience of knowing who was lying and who wasn't and when. So it was even more trying for me because I would be... I just wanted to close down and never talk at all to anyone. Of course, the nuns and the priests and my parents would beat me to talk and also not to stare. So I learned that I had to copy people that they admired. And TV had just come in when I was a child. So it was black and white, little bitty boxes like this. And, you know, we had people like Flash Gordon who were heroes. But your realistic ones were Elvis Presley and James Dean. So I would copy. Stares like they were cool, Paul Newman. So that's why I emulated so people wouldn't think that I was a problem. But I was always a problem because I felt like an idiot because I could never express myself. And I couldn't use language. It was impossible to use language. I didn't understand the word the, didn't understand letters, how to put them together. 

I was 22 years old before I could comprehend the word the and spell it. So growing up that way in that kind of environment, I was always under stress.  We didn't have a lot of soda. We had milk that was pasteurized and homogenized and incredibly processed. We were allowed about one soda a day, which was helpful. But I became diabetic, borderline, so I would steal candy from the store. And I could go through a box of chocolate covered cherries in 30 minutes. And by the time I hit 12 years old, I was keeping colds anywhere from three to five months at a time. And very stressful, spent a lot of time in bed. And when I hit 12 years old, I had severe abdominal pains that I couldn't straighten out my body. They took me to the hospital, diagnosed it as appendicitis. They went in to take it, removed the appendix, found it in perfect shape. Took it out anyway, just in case there were any problems in the future. That's medical thinking. And in my research, in analyzing appendixes that have been removed, I found that contained all of the, any foreign matter that's entered the body, how to handle it, and all of the toxicity that's ever come into the body by way of food, air, or osmosis from the atmosphere. So, the appendix is a library of contaminants and what to do about them when they enter the body, so the body can respond within minutes. Without an appendix, your body has to reanalyze the subject, the substance. It could take 24, 30 hours to react properly. So, an appendix is a very important thing to have. Of course, because doctors don't know what it is. Well, last year a doctor came up with the same idea that I had and actually proved it. So, he doesn't say that it's so the body can defend itself against, but he says that it contains all of the substances that are bad for the body and it'll help the body react. So, to me, it's a library that actually addresses hormones that send it out. It's like I proved in my laboratory. But nobody accepts my laboratory analysis because I'm not an MD. I'm only a PhD in nutrition. That doesn't qualify as good lab work. So, they removed the appendix. And, of course, I was sicker any time I got involved in anything. I was accident prone. Still am. Accident prone and I was always getting injured and hurt. I mean, I was one of those people who was moving an aquarium once and was barely pushing it, went right through it, cut. And I mean, I cut all of the veins and the blood was spurting two feet across the room. So, I mean, whoever breaks an aquarium by pushing a good thick glass. So, this is part of me. So, I was always getting medication, medication, tetanus shots. And when I was 15 years old and I got my third polio vaccine, it caused angina pectoris and full-on blown juvenile diabetes. Now, this is within days after the third polio vaccine, the injected one, not the salt, the ingestible one. So, I started having heart attacks and I was having sometimes two weekly. So, between the age of 15 and a half and 22, I've had 300 heart attacks approximately. Fifty of them put me unconscious. Now, most people would die from a lot of those heart attacks because you weren't autistic. So, there was a benefit to being autistic in two ways. 

When you're autistic, you're not indoctrinated to the idea of the body being something that is a subject of attack. My parents attacked me. The doctors attacked me. My brothers attacked me. Nuns attacked me. The priests attacked me. But, the organism itself was never attacking itself like the doctors lead you to believe. That's the pharmaceuticals ways of terrorizing you to get you to attack yourself with medication, surgery, chemotherapy, radiation, whatever it is, cut, slash, and burn. So, I realized that when I had a heart attack, it was just like a charley horse. If you tighten and tense up against a charley horse, it gets worse. And the heart attack, when it's not congested, and I was too young to have congestive heart problems at the time, is a cramping. It's a charley horse from chemicals irritating the muscle. So, it goes into a cramp. Just like lactic acid buildup causes the muscle to go into a cramp. So, I would relax when I got the heart attack. I would just totally go limp and relax. So, even though I might pass out, I was in a relaxed condition. So, the heart would go back into working. Now, when I get into the glandular part of the workshop, you'll understand how the body has responses to make the heart go, and the lungs function, even though they may stop. But right now, I don't want to go into that. So, I had all those heart attacks, passed out 50 times, and they would just let me, if it happened in school, they would just let me lie on the floor, lie on the desk, wherever I was. That's where I would lie until I became conscious again. Now, because I used to strike those poses, James Dean, and Elvis Presley, and Paul Newman, they didn't realize I was autistic. If I had been allowed to behave autistically, then people would have understood that there's a greater problem here. But anytime I went into those stares, and that kind of behavior, I was beat terribly, even with a buckle of the belt. So, I did everything I could, every time my parents said, you look like an idiot, stop that. I did everything I could not to behave like a naturally innocent child. So, by the time I hit 16 years old, I met a girl who was enamored with me, and I had never had love. My mother gave love, but she had four boys, and she worked as a nurse, so she hardly had time for us. And this girl really liked me, and she was the second smartest girl in the class, in the school. I got excommunicated, or got expelled from the Catholic school, after I had my first day of my sophomore year in high school, which was such a disciplinary problem, in the first year. They said, I don't talk. I couldn't read anything. So, if I stood up, and I stood there without reading, the priests and the nuns would get angry, and think I was just a wise guy. So they sent me to detention. If you were mildly bad, you went to detention, and you wrote out what you did that was bad, and I will not do this [unintelligible] because, I became an artist. I could copy lines and figures. So when I copied words like that, I had not a clue what I was writing, so it was just art to me. So you'd write out all the things, so I'd have to write them a hundred times, and then go home. If you were semi-seriously bad, then you got sanding crew. So you got an hour and a half after school with sanding desks, the kids. So, the night, or whatever.

And then if you were very, very bad, you shoveled coal on Saturday. And Roger Bacon High School was heated by coal at that time. So you got all that mercury dust, you know, in the lungs and everything. So I got very sick from doing that. But I got two weekends of shoveling coal on Saturday. So, that's how bad I was. So when I showed up, I don't read, I don't understand anything. I go to show up at the school my first day of my sophomore year. I'm at lunch. And the dean comes up to me and said, What are you doing here? And I understood, What are you doing here? Conceptually, not by the words. I understood what he was asking me. What am I doing here? And I said, Going to school. That's a wise answer, according to them. But to me, it was a sensible response. I was parenting it, understanding that, yeah, I'm in school. So, send me off to the principal's office. They sent me off. So, I went to a public school two days later. So, a blessing. A real blessing. Because here, it was a preppy school, because we lived in a semi-affluent part of town. And the dean and the administrators, all were people who listened. And they sat down, and they realized I had a problem. So, they put me in all the classes where the teachers had special education abilities. So, it was very, very helpful. Still, no matter what they did, my brain did not function with language. Period. That was it. And the only reason I got through school was because I always picked the smartest, most sensitive girl to sit next to in class, and I would copy her hieroglyphs. Because that's all it was to me. And sometimes humans were going over a distance like that. I had 15-15 vision. I could see the hairs on the flies' legs. And I could see telescopically. So, not far away, I could almost see everything, but it had to [unintelligible]. So, I would write letters that weren't letters, words that weren't words. But I got through school with C's and D's. And then I got, when I graduated from high school, I was married. I got married when I was 16 to this girl. Now, she didn't really know I was an idiot. We were communicating on an emotional and some kind of a metaphysical level. So, and why she liked me, I don't have a clue. It's just some fluke thing. And she really loved me. She was, like I said, the second smartest girl in the school in the year ahead of me. So she didn't get that, she wasn't in any of my classes or anything, so she didn't really get to see me outside of our relationship together. And we didn't have to talk. We cuddled and we laughed and we'd look at each other and just laugh. And that's the relationship we had. And we ended up getting pregnant and married at sixteen years old. And the baby was born the first week of my senior year in high school. And in that summer while we lived together, while she was pregnant, she realized that there was something really wrong with me. And when she had the baby, the baby was so big, it split her, even though they gave her a slight episiotomy, it split her back. I didn't understand all this stuff.

So, she didn't want me touching her, you know, all the experience made her untouchable. I felt rejected, nuts, you know. I had to go through school half day, school ending in a half day because I only needed credits to graduate with a half a day. Then in the afternoon I would take care of the baby, and then at night I would go to work. And, of course, I didn't have to do anything intelligent. I was frying, you know, chicken legs and chicken breasts like that in a fast food place. And then my co-workers, you know, they were the same way. And they drank a lot after work, so I started joining them. Because the only thing you have to say with a bunch of guys drinking is just, shit, damn, cool, you know, stuff like this. So I could parrot those words very easily. And who do you think they say? Oh, cool, goofy, shit. You know, I just repeat those words. So I fit in and I was drinking a lot. But I got into addictions very early. Because when I was a child, I had chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. I was so sickly. If I moved my arm up, I would have burned like people who were lifting weights 50 times. And they had that burning just from lifting my arm. So getting out of bed was a problem. My parents had to come in with a belt to force me out of bed. Plus, I was very sensitive to the cold. So when we moved to Cincinnati from Tennessee, well, I was born in Denver. There was 14 feet of snow that year. My mother's from Alabama. She says, I'm not living here. So by the time I was six months old, when fall was coming on, because we got born in April, I was born in April, left in September. So we were out. So we went to Tennessee while we were in Tennessee. So I was used to a warmer climate. And we moved to Cincinnati when I was seven years old. And it was a destruction in my life. Because the cold was visceral in my body. Everything ached, everywhere even more. So to get me out of bed into a cold house was unbearable. My father had grown up on a farm in Illinois. And he was strong and hardy. He grew up on raw milk, all that fresh food off the farm. They never bought anything outside of the farm. Everything was grown pure and organic. So he was a very healthy man. I was a very sickly child with all this medication, all the junk food and so on. My parents thought all these canned foods were a blessing. They thought all this manufacturing was a blessing. But to the children it wasn't, of course. So, here I was in a bad situation where I couldn't get out of bed. I was in terrible pain all the time. I didn't want to move. So at eight years old, I don't know why, I just got some coffee. I got up out of bed in the middle of the night. At night they turned the heat off. So, the temperature would drop down to maybe 40 degrees at the height of the house. The heat turned it on and it got up very early. I only slept five hours a night, as long as I could. So, I went in one night and there was some leftover coffee. There was always some leftover coffee. And I drank it. It really buzzed. It got hot. And I had less pain. I thought, oh, this stuff is good.

So, the next day, my parents made the coffee. I wanted some coffee.  You can't drink that coffee. So, I was unable to drink it. So, I'd go in at night and put in the jar any coffee that they had remaining. Put it under my bed. So, when the wake-up call came, you know, pounding on the door or opening the door, Rise and shine! It wasn't rise and shine. Rise and shine! So, I'd reach under my bed. I was in a room with a brother at the time. Then, of course, I had to sneak in and drink it. But that would give me enough energy after about five minutes, and hopefully I wouldn't get belted in that five minutes, you know, before it would really work. So, I started an addiction at that time. I also realized I was getting very sleepy and was falling asleep in classes all the time. And the nuns would just go berserk. And, of course, they'd use either a comb, they'd take the comb out of my back pocket, and hit me with the prongs until I bled in spots. Or they'd take a ruler with the steel blade in it and hit me until it made a groove and sometimes bled. These people are supposed to be reflecting Jesus. And it wasn't that way then. Now I understand it's better. But back then, they were the devil, as far as I was concerned. So, I began smoking cigarettes at eight years old. See, during the day, I would sneak out of the class, go into the bushes, light a cigarette. One of my parents smoked a little bit and stopped shortly after. So then I had to go into stores and steal cigarettes. So I stole cigarettes to give me energy. So I would smoke the cigarettes to keep me going. So I got addicted very young. By the time I was sixteen years old, I could not sleep without drinking. Because I was smoking two packs of Lucky Strike non-filters daily, and drinking anywhere from five to eleven cups of coffee daily. So I'd be lying there at night, you know, like a zombie, unable to sleep. So I drank a lot at night so I could sleep. So by the time I hit nineteen years old, I was divorced. I was an alcoholic and a cigarette fiend. And I loved smoking. Truly loved smoking. I still would smoke today if it would help me. I used to smoke a cigarette and I would take it... Until my whole chest was full of that smoke, and the end on that cigarette was bright red. My mother would say, stop it, you look like a fiend. And I'd say, I am a fiend. Whatever a fiend did, I didn't know, but I repeated that I was a fiend. So by the time I hit nineteen years old, I was divorced. And, well, let me go back a little bit. When I graduated from high school, I didn't know what to do with me. I was working, you know, hamburgers and, you know, frying chicken and stuff like that. But my parents didn't want some meager labor in the family. They were both college educated. My father invented the first Bering computer when he was in college. So he worked for General Electric as an inventor, as an engineer. And here I was a blithering idiot. So they wanted to put me in some kind of school. SAT scores were horrific except in math, and then the ability was tremendous. Because I was like the rain man. You could put a problem in front of me, I could give you the answer, didn't know where the answer came from. And I didn't have to work out a formula. I just knew the answer. 

So I got accused of cheating, and the only thing I never cheated on in class was math. Because I never wrote down any formulas, I only wrote the answer. So one time they put me in a room with quizzes that they just made up before I missed, before they gave it to me. And I got all the answers right, with no formula. So they realized there was something special about me, with art and with math. So they left me alone there. Then they thought that I could read and write, and then I was really defiant, because I wouldn't stand up and read when called upon. Nor did I get good grades in anything else. Comprehension was zero, with language. And when they gave multiple choices, sometimes I got them right. Oh, I'll choose that one. Or I did cheat, I did the other person a favor. So I got chosen. So my mother, there was a new school that opened called Cincinnati Institute of Computer Technology. So she took my brother, who was a little older than I, who was not a very smart guy. Not because he couldn't be, because he just didn't care. He was the one who tortured me. Very defiant fellow. He ended up in reform school several times. Taken away several times. Very violent person at that time. He was a great guy. After he went to Vietnam and saw what happened there, he changed his whole behavior. So, almost killed somebody. One of his fellow GIs, by taking a shoe stick and hitting him across the temple. The guy was in a coma for 30 days. My brother was put in an underground pit for 30 days until the guy came out of the coma. So, that changed my brother's nature and he became a very good, funny guy. Except for me. It wasn't until five years ago that his daughters and sons read my book. They're not already seven or eight years to read my book. My brother still hasn't read it. My mother read it. My father read it. But, you know, because it mentions him and his behavior towards me throughout it. And they realized he still treats Aajonus that way. So, they all got him. One day, why do you do this? Why are you doing this to him? He's a nice guy. And my brother just, okay. And then he came. He just took that to do it. So, my mother took us to this institute for computer programming. Computer record wiring equipment. Back then, you know, computers were greatly impressed on cards and was punched in. And you've got all these cards to do each thing that you're programming for each sentence that you write. It has to be on a card. And then you run that through the data to the computer. And that gives us a program. Then you run the data cards through it. And that calculates an airline. So, we went to there and they gave us tests. My brother failed completely. And I got a perfect score. Because it was all math, it was all geometry, it was all that kind of stuff. So, then they interviewed me and realized I had a language problem. But they knew what I could do. So, they hired me out to various large corporations to write programs. Because I could write a program. In a day or two, or even hours, it would take them months or years to write. Without any errors. One time, there was an error.

And so, they made a lot of money with me. They didn't even have to teach me much. They just went through and showed me. And never without a word. It was always by showing me. And, you know, I put it all together easily. So, I worked for Time DC, the largest trucking company in the world. As a systems analyst. And for IBM. And, you know, Carte Blanche Corporation. So, here I was, a blithering idiot, making a lot of money. I was making 80 grand a year. That was back in 1966. 1965 and 66. So, I had an uncle, who was only 11 years older than I. He was the youngest of my mother's 12 brothers and sisters. Big family. And he was matriculating for his doctorate at UCLA in psychology. And he thought he could help me. So, I transferred out to Los Angeles, from Cincinnati. And worked there as a systems analyst. And got a house, a two-bedroom house in Beverly Hills. Not in the very rich section, so a small two-bedroom house. And I was living very comfortably as an idiot. And everything was good. And then, you know, I was still having to do all my coffee and cigarettes and alcohol. So, finally it put a hole in my stomach. And I was vomiting sometimes a whole cup of blood at one time. So, the doctors put me on Maalox, chalk. So, you know, dolomite, which is rock calcium. And, of course, that absorbs all the hydrochloric acid. You don't digest any protein. You don't digest foods anymore. Because you don't have protein, you can't digest your fats. If you don't have fats and proteins together, you can't digest your carbs properly. So, it's a catch-22. Now, consume... I didn't understand until I drank this. So, anytime I got a stomach acid problem, I said, that's what I drank. So, I was drinking sometimes a bottle of that. And it helped with the acid from the alcohol, too. So, I would drink it while I was drinking alcohol. So, I was going through a tremendous amount of that. And it caused such a caking in my system that it caused a tumor next to the ulcer. So, then I had cancer of the stomach. So, they said, okay, we've got to go in, we've got to cut you open, we've got to pull the bug out, you know, all the stuff. Which means that they cut all the beta cells to the stomach, so I'd never again secrete hydrochloric acid. So, they put me in the category of octogenarians, who don't secrete hydrochloric acid, and are in danger of death from eating any raw food. Any raw food. I couldn't eat an apple without it being steamed. I couldn't eat a banana without it being steamed. I was not allowed to eat anything raw. That was their concept. And I didn't know much. My uncle explained to me what I had to eat, how to prepare my food. So, I did nothing but get sicker and sicker and sicker. Within a month and a half of the surgery, the surgery was November 27th, 1967. I was maybe 21 years old. And that became tumorous. The whole thing developed into a tumor. All the way to the stomach, including the stomach. So, they had to irradiate that. So, I got 10 weeks of intense radiation therapy. And that's why everybody knows how malleable clay is. You know what happens when you fire it in cone 1 to cone 10? It becomes brittle and hard. 

So, as they were running that radiation, and it was just like that, they run it just like this, shooting radiation the whole time. Then it would go off and run for about 30 seconds. Then they'd turn it on again, you know? One x-ray takes a millisecond. And here, they're running it for 10 to 30 seconds at a time. Then it's going all the way up my spine, all the way down to the bottom. It's fine. So, they cauterized my spine. It was equal to a clay hardened pottery. So, my movement was like this. It was excruciatingly painful. So, they turned me into a cripple from that. So, every movement was terrible. To sit down could take five minutes. Because I'd go to sit, and the pain would be excruciating, and then I'd get back up, and it was just like, how do I do this? It was so slow to find a way to get back into a sitting position. I couldn't even lie in a bed, because if I were lying in a bed, if the softness moved in such a way that it cramped, pinched the nerve, and nothing was flexible, I would wake up screaming and in pain. So, I'd sleep on a hardwood floor, where there's less likelihood. That still happened. I was never able to sleep more than ten minutes at a time. Within two months after the radiation therapy, they diagnosed me with blood and bone cancer, multiple myeloma, because of the radiation. So, the Maalox gave me stomach cancer, the radiation gave me blood and bone cancer, and they're just doing nothing to help me. They're just making me worse and worse. So then, they gave me chemotherapy for the blood and bone cancer, multiple myeloma. I endured that for several months, three months, less than three months. And, because at that point, I had no hair except for a few scraggly gray hairs. My hair turned gray. It was about your color. I had this lower end with a dirty blonde on it, born to a light, because I got older and got a little darker. And I was in such excruciating pain, vomiting and defecating all over myself. We had to clear out the whole house. What they did for me, cleaned all the furniture out, the drapes off, plastic shower curtains had to be used in the house, because I lived on the floor. I refused to go to the hospital again. They couldn't take me out of that house, even if they tried to drag me. I was screaming in pain. If they pulled me, I could have diarrhea all over them and me. So they really realized they had to let me do what I was going to do. So I lived on the living room floor, and the living room was about probably from the back to here, all wood. The dining room was about the same. Two bedrooms were this way, and the kitchen was over here. And then there was just a cutout of the house over here, so there was nothing on that part. So I lived on the floor. They wanted to take me to a hospice. I was supposed to die by my 21st birthday, which is that April. And they wanted to put me in a hospital. I refused to go to a hospice. Because I went there one day, and they took me in. Who are all these sick people? And I still didn't know the language. I still didn't communicate. I wasn't going to get into it with these people. [unintelligible] So I didn't want to deal with that. So I just lived in my house, and I just lived like a worm. The only way I could get by with only slight pain was to drag myself with my elbows. And I'm like a worm across the floor.

So if I urinated or defecated on myself, because I couldn't get up on pots and pans, it was too painful. So I'd just go from one spot to another. So there were two volunteers that decided to help me. They came and volunteered maybe two to three times a week. They would shop for my food and bring it, and then take care of all the floor and all the mess, and prepare the food for several more days. Very nice people. One was an 18-year-old African-American boy. How does a young kid like that, find that kind of compassion. Here's an African-American boy who grew up in Watts. But he was a phenomenal singer. And he was working for the Ford Motor Company as one of the going thing group singer. So he was making 80 grand a year as a singer. This young black boy. But he had savvy. He talked me into drinking raw milk and raw carrot juice. It changed my life. 18-year-old. So he was one of the volunteers. He didn't have to do that. He had a mach one that they gave him. Classy clothes, everything. And here he was cleaning up my defecation and urine and taking care of me. So, still, why? He's a good person. So, my diet before that was donuts and RC Cola. Because after the radiation therapy, it destroyed the bone in my teeth. All around my teeth. So, my teeth dangled in my gums. So they dangled in my gums. So if I bit down on my own teeth, I would bleed. So I was losing half a cup to a whole cup of blood just from trying to eat. So I had to liquefy everything. So my diet, I loved powdered donuts. I could keep those in my mouth for a long time. But still I couldn't chew. So I put them in a blender. And I didn't like homogenized milk after the chemotherapy. Because chemotherapy made everything taste like cardboard. So, I blended them with RC Cola. So that was my diet. RC Cola or Sprite. Blended and sucked through a straw. And Steve, the young boy, got me into drinking the raw milk and carrot juice. So that started... that changed my life. And in ten days, after eating those things, drinking those things, I woke and I understood language. I said, oh, preposition, verb, conjunction, article. Oh, I get it. Oh, those make a sound. The sound makes the concept. The concept makes the understanding. I got it. Oh, this is phenomenal. My vocabulary was awful. I was Mr. Malaprop for several years because when I heard words, I had an emotional communication with words and I had my own definitions of what words meant that I was repeating and paraphrasing. So, most of them, the definitions were completely different than they were. So, like I said, they were Malaprops. So, I called my uncle. I had a telephone for an emergency. So, I called my uncle and I was talking to him in language, sometimes Malaprops, not constructed very well, but okay. So, he thought, I was in Los Angeles, and he had a comedian friend who did imitated voices of like movie stars or something. He made them funny. He was a comedian. So, he thought that this was his friend talking to him on the phone. So, 30 minutes went by and he said, okay, the gag's over. Let's do it. Let's talk. So, I said, no, this is really me. And he paused and I said, I'll prove it to you. And I told him in the incident only he and I ever knew about it. He was dumbfounded.

And I said, I'd really like, now that I can, you know, I can read, I would like to, you know, get a lot of books on nutrition, because I'm sure it's his carrot juice and raw milk that I drank. No, no, no, it's not that. He's a psychologist that did the medical reading and thinking, you know, intellectual. Because he graduated Magna Cum Laude in school. So, nothing was nutrition. He bought that garbage. So, he said, no, the first book you need to get is Siddhartha, using the spiritual metaphysical concept. And he said, it's about a fellow who grows up in an affluent family and rejects everything, goes out and becomes a whore monger, you know, a thief, a murderer and everything. And then realizes that he creates a lot of reality through his own mysticism and becomes a sage. And thinking, I grew up around jocks, you know, and the behavior was, you're cool, I'm not, I'm cooler than you, and that's all the behavior I ever experienced, you know, except in that school with those teachers. So, I got a little bit of a glint of compassion in there. So, I read, I called Steve, the young boy, and I told him, I had a conversation with him, and he said, see, food is your chemistry. And I said, can you take me to a store, and I can buy books on food and nutrition. And he said, sure. He said, but do you think you can move? And I said, I feel a little bit better. I'm not having half the pain I used to. So, if you give me a wheelchair, I think we can do it. So, he went through all that trouble, again, went through all that effort, took two days just to prepare to take me to the bookstore. So, I went to the bookstore, and he, you know, I was broken at that time. It was the medical profession. They had taken all my money to kill me, to put me in that shape. So, all my money that I had saved, which was about $85,000, and all of it was gone, so I was being evicted from the home, but they didn't have to evict me because they just thought I was going to die. So, I went to the bookstore, [unintelligible]. And one of them was to Siddhartha, and the rest of them were nutrition. Well, there were also two books on it, Mind Over Matter, which is bullshit. Because every time I would come back from eating, you know, I was, okay, I got it down now. Mind over matter. Because the more I ate the good foods, the stronger I got, and the stronger I got, the more I thought I was in control. So, I would go back to eating donuts and crap, and then you get back into the autism and, you know, the whole thing. So, I realized, okay, this mind over matter is bullshit. Maybe mind in conjunction with matter, but not mind over matter. You've got to take care of your matter. So, after many years, you know, I got to be 27 years old, got better the whole time, I decided I was able to keep the back pain down to, I mean, I could go an hour and a half, and then go into yoga postures, the plow, spinal twist, to make sure everything was stretched out in my back, so it wouldn't cause a great deal of pain. So, I had to do yoga every hour to hour and a half. So, I got on a bicycle and decided to travel all around the United States and live off of a bicycle. I wanted to live in nature and find out how to really heal myself, mainly from the damage done by the fall of the medical industry.

And I knew every book I had read, you know, $110 in 1968 was a lot of money, a lot of books, because you could buy a book for $0.25, a paperback book for $0.25, all the way up to $0.75. And it didn't have to pay any more, unless you had a novel that was very thick and I had to spend $0.75. But usually it was $0.25 or $0.50 for a paperback. And hardbacks were anywhere from $1.00 to $2.00, $1.95 for hardbacks with pictures in it and everything. So, he loaned me $110 and I bought all those books. Out of all of them, everything contradicted everything else. One book would say, carbohydrates is the way to go and stay away from proteins, and a little bit of fat is OK. Another book, don't eat any fat. They're dangerous, they'll cause hardening of the arteries, the heart, everything. Don't eat any fat. Ever. None. So, all these books, nobody agreeing upon anything. Everybody had their own idea. For every book written, everybody had their own idea about how the body worked and how food worked in the body. So, I was beside myself. I experimented and got the raw food thing with the milk and the carrot juice. By February of 72, I committed to only raw foods. So, I was eating lots of dairy at that point, and then I was moving into vegetarianism. I was feeling better. Like I said, I tried the mind over matter stuff. I was getting everything majorly confused. And, you know, killing animals was a bad thing. And then I stopped eating [unintelligible]. Then eventually stopped eating raw dairy and just eating fruits. So, I was his own bicycle doing all that, living out in nature, boy. Psychology, the stress of psychology, it's absolute horseshit that it can cause disease. You live out in the elements where you're exposed to the sun all day, the dark and the cold, the wind, all the elements, that is stress. And that is physiological stress. And I just got skinnier and skinnier until I got down to 92 pounds. I'm 165 right now, so you can imagine what I was at, 92 pounds. So, at the worst I got down to 86 pounds, but that was my own fasting. So, don't fast. Your body eats your own red blood cells. And so, I went through all of these things. I bicycled. I had my bicycle across the United States five times, all the way down to the Yucatan, where there was a tribe of Mayans down there in the jungles. I only spoke a little bit of Spanish, and I could do a little bit of Spanish. But no Mayan, and that's mainly their language. And they, because I was autistic, I was able to communicate with hands and language and designs with them very easily. So, they told me that if I ate raw meat, that would resolve my problem. And I was thinking, I'm a vegetarian, I don't eat animals. These are good creatures, I don't eat animals. I thought, these Indians are trying to destroy my white man for destroying them. So, they're not going to give me their secrets. So, then I went up and I lived with the Yaqui Indians. Don something lived with them, and studied [unintelligible].

Q: Don Juan?

A: Don Juan, yes. His real name, I don't remember. And I lived with them for about a month, about 38 days. And again, they told me raw meat would turn me around. And I thought, no, they've all got it. They've all had this little message. They send it up all the way along. The white man eats raw meat. He'll get brain flukes and die. Get rid of them now. So, then I went and lived with my mother's Park Cherokee Indian, I mean Sioux Indian. She's only an 8th, you know, so I'm only a 16th. And I went to live with the Sioux Indians for a couple of months in the Dakotas. And they also said raw meat was the answer. Raw meat will help you. I said, they really have it down. They really have their message all the way from South America, all the way up through the United States. So, I said, well, I heard that the Eskimos are really, really healthy. And I didn't know why I didn't think about it. In a cold environment like that, you only have meat to eat. So, I bicycled up to Alaska and went with them. I remember I took a bus because it was just too mountainous and too difficult. I should have done that many times in Mexico, but it was hot in Mexico, so it was easy. So, I put my bicycle on the bus and took the bus to this very remote area. And it's a tour bus, so they take you there and then they take you back. Well, I got my bicycle off, I talked to them about it, and then they would be back to bring people. I would go with them another time, but I wanted to stay out there for maybe a couple of weeks and see. And this was August, late August. Already getting cold at night. And I'm very thin, getting weaker and weaker. And I walked over this, I left my bicycle down, just wanted to look over this ridge. Blueberry patch, I mean a wild blueberry patch. There must have been 200 naturally created orchards. Nobody tended it, it was wild. All the grass and everything, bushes growing around it, and all these blueberry bushes. So I went and started eating these delicious blueberries, and all of a sudden I started seeing these round furry things all over the place. And they're moving, and I said, oh, these are grizzly bears. They're eating these berries, of course. So I backed off, and started walking out of there. A couple of them looked up, because they got my sniff of my wind, and went back to eating berries. But I wasn't going to stay there. I had my fill of blueberries. And then I found a tribe of Inuits, and they took me in. And, you know, we didn't live in igloos. We lived in teepees, because there was no snow yet. There was some snow, just on the caps all around. And, but it was getting cold. It dropped down to like, you know, 40 degrees at night, even though it was almost daylight cold, day and night. And they told me, raw meats the answer. But they really did get it. Sent carrier pigeons or something. Central America all the way up to Alaska. So I was very frustrated. I was to the point where if the temperature fell below 50 degrees I was in excruciating pain again. And every joint for multiple myeloma, who had no cancer, was resurfacing with a vengeance.

So I'd have to get in my sleeping bag before the sun went down, just to stay warm enough. I packed up to go to this one day, and they were having this celebration. Everybody was dancing and singing and happy. And we watched them dig out this hide that they pulled out of the ground and unwrap it. And it was moldy. It was patinaed. And I thought, well, this is disgusting. We're not used to that. And the person came a little bit, and there was a bird call from down the downwind. And they all of a sudden rolled back up and reburied it. And I said, what was that all about? They said, well, it didn't stink half a mile downwind, it's not ready. Already putrid. Stunk terrible. So they left it. And I decided to stick around for this. Too curious for me. So I wanted to know what they were doing. So two days later, they dug it up, stunk downwind. And they didn't take the same one, because that had been exposed to air. So it would have caused it to stink more than the others had dug up. So they dug up another one. That stunk half a mile downwind. So they immediately all gathered, kids reading handfuls. And it was so bad and in a stench that I couldn't get... If I got within five feet, I'd start gagging from the odor. The kids are chewing it like cotton candy. I'm not eating it. I'm not eating it. Everybody stinks. And the whole thing, literally, I could not... And they kept offering me this. And they said, this will really help you. So, finally, they talked me into it. They gave me some cotton balls with musk oil. They actually got it from moose balls. And very strong, a very concentrated odor. So, I put the cotton balls up my nose. And I ate about the size of a ping pong ball amount. And it just melted in my mouth. It was like tended braised in a randy land. And it tasted pretty good. And you didn't have to smell it. And I wasn't going to eat it anymore. Because, you know, I was in danger of death from eating a ping pong ball. And I thought it was herbs anyway. I didn't know that meat decomposed and got mold on it. Of course, it had never gone on me. Gangrene is a fungus on animal tissue. And I went to my sleeping bag early before the sun went down. I heard them singing and dancing all night. And they were eating this stuff for 24 hours. It could have been even 30 hours. They were eating this stuff. And the adults were eating like 2, 3, 4 pounds of it. And children were eating like a pound each. And they ate a lot of it. A whole area of it. So, I woke the next morning. Usually when I awakened, I awakened right before the sun popped up over the horizon. Maybe up to 30 minutes before. And I would have to let the sun beat on the sleeping bag before my body would be warmed enough that I could move without pain. So, then it would beat on the sleeping bag for at least 2 hours. Then I would crawl out of the bag and lie naked in the sun for about 30 minutes to be able to move. That's enough tolerance to pain at that time. So, it took me about 3 hours to get moving in the mornings.

However, after eating that stuff, I was out of the sleeping bag in about 45 minutes. I was up and on my feet in 10 minutes after being in the sun naked. And I thought, oh, that stuff, what was it? What herbs did they bury and what mold did it have? So, I went to them, right to the chief, and I had permission to go to the chief. And I said, what was that herb combination? He said, no, no, no, that was caribou and the seal blubber that we mixed together and wrapped in hides and buried. It was raw meat like I told you, raw meat. I didn't believe him because I didn't know that gangrene, didn't put it together that fungus could actually grow on meat. And of course, if you're in the ground, you have, these are anaerobic bacteria, fungus, we use fungus to grow, to break something down, to pre-digest it like we pre-digest milk and make it a kefir. Just have your natural fungus do it, ground fungus do it, and some ground bacteria, your probiotics. So, I didn't believe him, but this time I'm going to do it. I stayed another few days, kept trying to convince him to tell me what this herbal mixture was. Wasn't going to do it, so I got angry with him, and I said, you just want to destroy the white man, I understand it. So, I was so weak and sick at this time, it was getting colder, it was mid-September. So, I started hopping freight trains because I had no money, and I bungee corded my bicycle to the car, and the boxcar, and I hung my hammock between the two sides of the boxcar, so I could watch the scenery. You know, you never know where these trains are going, because you can't ask. So, I ended up in New Mexico, and I had to hop a freight train back to California, because I traveled all the way there. Several times I got sidetracked, but the worst was I ended up in New Mexico, and I had to get back to California. So, by the time I got back, it took me two weeks to get back to Southern California. I'm sure it would have taken two days, and if I had known what train I was supposed to hop. And I got back to the California desert, where I had worked before, living off the land. I worked in the date fields there, the citrus fields, picking fruit to make some money. To, you know, change tires, or spokes, or whatever. Sometimes to get an avocado, buy avocados. At that time, you could buy an avocado for 25 cents. And if I found, you know, ones with a little bruise on them or something, I could get them for 10 cents. So, I worked at, I would eat eight avocados, ten avocados a day, just to help. And I was eating, you know, anywhere from, you know, one to seven pounds of nuts a day. I was still working on it. Awaking the next day, I was losing weight. The elements out there are tough. I mean, in the desert, you can go from, you know, 80 degree of the day down to zero at night. So, pretty stressful. Anyway, so, I decided I was going to fast myself to death because I hadn't found the answers. I was in pain all the time. Joints, fibromyalgia everywhere, headaches. You know, I had never had a headache. Okay. So, I started a fast, drinking nothing but water, and a bunch of coyotes... I happened to pick an old Indian burial ground. It was at the foot of San Martins Mountains range, which was an old Indian burial ground. Everybody would meet me there. And coyotes lived right up in that particular canyon, in that valley, those foothills where I chose.

So, they came down every night and would wake me at midnight. Very annoying because I only slept maybe five hours a night. It would always be one, and then I would take naps in the day too. So, when the coyotes would come down and do their thing, they would wake me. They would sound like a bunch of, you know, everybody's seen Cuckoo's Nest, and they're all crazy and going nuts. Well, that's what the coyotes sound like when they play. And they played this little game where one would jog around and yell and scream and howl. And others would sneak past me and through the wash and around the bushes in these foothills. So, about ten days of that, that's the point where I could sense where they were, each one of them. I spotted eleven of them. The next night, they took me hunting. Actually, I had built a little stone rock house in the ground so I could stay away from the wind and the cold. And I would put sand over me to warm. And they came down and one rubbed his nose up against my knee and went like that. I said, okay, I was autistic, so I understood animals. So, I went out and followed them. And they hunted and caught a jackrabbit. You know, jackrabbits are about seven, seven and a half pounds. You know, its head comes up to there and its ears will come up to here. They're big animals. So, they caught the jackrabbit and it ripped its throat open. One held the head and the other took the throat and ripped it open all the way down to the stomach, put it on my feet, and offered it to me. And I hadn't eaten meat in six and a half years at that point, except by accident once. And so, well, the eskimos with their ball of meat. And it was warm and squishy. And it was the Easter Bunny. You know, I was a vegetarian. And they're offering me this meat. And all of a sudden, this dialogue that my uncle had had with my brothers and cousins when they were going rabbit hunting, went through my head. So this was like 20 years ago at that point. And I couldn't go because I was sickly. I stayed home with my mother and I learned to sew and cook. Because I couldn't play sports, I was too weak. So, my uncle told my brothers and cousins that if they caught, if they shot, they were hunting with .22s, if they shot a rabbit, they had to skin it thoroughly, make sure no hair was on it, and they had to cook it until it was dark inside. Cook, burn, because there's a microbe in it that will infest your intestines and will kill you painfully in two days. That was the dialogue. So I thought, oh, the coyotes want to help me die fast because I knew I could fast for 60 days before I would die. So I thought, oh, headaches, constipation, because I'd have to do enemas every day to keep from getting headaches. So I was drinking two gallons of water a day, doing enemas, still getting headaches, lots of nausea, and I thought, I'm going to eat this rabbit. So I picked it up and started eating it. I can take care of two days of pain, no problem. That's easy. Two days of pain will be easy. So I thought I'd die. So I ate, and the more I ate, the better it tasted. So by the time I finished, I ate a good three and a half pounds of that rabbit. That's a lot. I was bulged here in the tummy because I was down to ninety-some pounds, ninety-eight, ninety-nine pounds at that point.

And with the three and a half pounds of rabbit in me, I had gained three and a half pounds for that day. And I went back to my sleeping bag to die. And I knew I was dying because I felt good. And the only times I had ever felt normal and good in my life was when I had three near-death experiences. Two on the operating table and one from a drug experience. I left the body and there was no pain. And while I was walking after eating this rabbit, it only took me about forty-five minutes to eat that three and a half pounds. Like dogs, I'm taking down the whole thing in three minutes. It took me forty minutes to eat it, which wasn't bad. So, I get back to my sleeping bag. I feel so good. I know I'm going to die because I'm leaving my body. So, I wake in the morning, still in my sleeping bag. I didn't go through any magical tunnel. I didn't meet Buddha or Jesus or anybody. So, I knew I was still there on Earth and probably in pain. However, it was just like I had after eating that ping-pong ball the size of decayed, molded meats with the eskimos. I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in probably twenty minutes this time. Out of the sun in ten minutes, directly naked. And I was functional. And I was feeling pretty good. I still had pain, of course. Everywhere, moving. Any movement caused pain. But it was not annoying. I didn't say, oh, I can't move, I don't want to move, I don't want to move. It was, oh, okay, I can handle that pain. So, three days went by. No pain in the stomach. No abdominal cramps. No vomiting, no diarrhea, nothing. I said, another myth, another lie. Why don't I recognize those lies anymore? And I stopped recognizing them. When I turned off autism at 22 years old, I shut off the ability to have my lie detector work. So, I realized this whole myth about the rabbit was all nonsense again. It was a myth. So, I started hunting anything that I could find. I found some eagle eggs, I only took one of them. And, you know, some serpent eggs. Ate some lizards, tarantulas, scorpions, without the venom sac. And eat them. Just wasn't enough food in the desert. So, I got on my bicycle and bicycled to this big farm area in Thermal, California, in Indio. Near Palm Springs. And so I started, anytime I saw goats or cows, I stopped there to exchange work for milk and eggs and meat. So, I got work on three farms, and they liked me so much they just took me out on one farm, so I left the others. And I was milking goats and cows and shoveling manure and just doing chores. And within two and a half months, I gained 50 pounds, 55 pounds. Looked like a scale down Schwarzenegger. And I never looked fit in my life until then. And I said, I'm going back to Los Angeles to spread the word. Raw meat is the answer. Well, dairy of course, too. And so I went back to, you know, I had money because I worked so hard on the farm. I was healthy enough. The pain I could get through. And when I was on the bicycle all the time, I'd actually get off the bicycle every hour to an hour and a half. You had to do stretches, yoga stretches. In fact, I did. But after this, I had very little pain. I slowly had to go into stretches four times daily. It was pretty cool.

So, I bought a motorbike, went back to Los Angeles, and spread the word. Raw meat is the answer. Everybody said you're crazy. You're going to get a brain fluke and you'll be an idiot. And I said, been there, done that. So, but this meat is the only thing in my life that has made me feel like I'm stable and happy and really energetic. So, I continued eating it, you know, two or three days a week only. And, you know, I didn't think it needed more than that. I thought that was okay. It was enough to make me feel very good. Mostly I ate milk, you know, cottage cheese and raw cheese, and still lots of fruit. After three years went by, I'm hearing that nonsense, you know, you'll get your brain fluke. I said, you know, am I really going to get a brain fluke? Something like autism again, and so I started, continued to eat it, but with concern every time. Ate it. So then it went up to 1981. I'd written a book on nutrition, three volume book, 1,185 pages. Went to New York to get it published. Spent a month there, was well-received, but nobody bought it. And my parents had moved to Jekyll Island, Georgia for the retirement home. And I left New York to go down and wait for more responses from the publishers. And I got down there and did okay. Became, you know, started lecturing on nutrition like this here. And actually started a health food store. So, while I was walking to the beach one day, I ate a poison mushroom. Now, I know what Amanitas look like. There's a cup that comes out of the bottom. So you just move the grass away, you see the cup, identify it as an Amanita, you don't eat it. So I saw this, it was in the yard on the way going. I looked up, there was no cup there, so I pulled it out, ate it, big one. Very big, very delicious. So I walked to the beach and girlfriend was with me. And we both ate it and she became, she vomited it out right away. I didn't, I was getting high on it, felt good. And we walked maybe three miles on the beach and then I started getting dizzy, like when I had diabetes. Blackout, I had to get on the ground fast so I didn't fall over. And that kept happening every five minutes. I said, something was wrong with that mushroom. I said, it should be okay, it wasn't an Amanita, I don't know what happened. Maybe there's some chemical on that lawn that got into the mushroom. So, we flagged down a car, we went back over to the road, flagged down a car, took me to the house. And I had to get out, they had stopped the car three times for me to vomit. But nothing came up, just dry heaves. So, I went back to the yard and dug deep. And the cup was barely two inches below the ground. So something had deformed that mushroom chemically. So I realized that I'd eaten a death cap. Only deadly mushroom. Other mushroom chemicals will make you sick or hallucinate. This one really killed people. And I ate 15 times the amount to kill somebody when I saw it. So, it caused blood and bone cancer again. It destroyed 90% of my liver. So, I refused to go to the hospital. I forced myself to eat anywhere from one to two pounds of butter a day to kick-start the liver and get it going. And I knew that would put me in severe pain. I was passing out from excruciating pain. 

Every bone, every muscle in my body would buckle up and there would just be lumps all over. Anybody see altered states? You know, you see where all these muscles lump up and it turns into a big worm, that lumpy worm. Well, that's what I absolutely looked like. But I didn't get to go back into some kind of a worm. I just stayed with the pain. And after 20 minutes of excruciating pain, I passed out for 20 minutes. And if I moved anything other than my arms and head, I went immediately back into the cramps. So, that's the second time I realized that I'm not moving anything. So, I moved my arms. So, I just moved my arms and I [unintelligible]. And it took me all the way back to 10 years, 11 years, 12 years, or earlier when I was living off my hormones and so on. So, I pulled myself into the kitchen which I had 20 minutes to eat before the cramps would come on. Again, if I didn't move anything from my chest down. So, this went on for about four days. And then it got to be every two-hour cycle. And then after another three or four days, it became a longer cycle where I went into that kind of cramps maybe three or four times a day. And it passed out. But, the pain in my liver every time I ate anything was excruciating. But, I had to force myself to eat. I had to deal with diarrhea and vomiting for months. And, so, but I, you know, I kept doing a little bit of fish and a little bit of raw chicken and a little bit of raw fish and a lot of dairy. I wasn't moving fast. I was moving very slowly. I had multiple myeloma. I was weak. I had fibromyalgia. I didn't want to move. I didn't want to do anything. I had started a lot of borrowing money from my mother to live. So, it went on for a year and a half. And, I said, I've got to do something different. So, I started eating meat, even red meat, twice daily, every day. And, wow, within 30 days, it changed my life again. And, here I thought, fuck, I could have been eating that raw meat right away and it would have changed me instantly. You know, I was angry with myself for, you know, listing those words, you're going to get a parasite. But, still, I thought, you know, I still could get a parasite. So, moved back to Los Angeles, Beverly Hills, from Jekyll Island, took my parents, my mother, to Cincinnati. She hated Jekyll Island, wanted to go back to Cincinnati. So, we took her back, as my girlfriend and I were on our way back to Los Angeles. She had never been to Los Angeles, so we went back there. Returned there, again, with my new, you know, twice-daily meat and the energy that I got. Raw meat is in again. Going back to do that, I set up a practice there, started working again, and, you know, still that, you're going to get a brain fluke. Every time I look at the meat, I mean, good for me, but are you going to give me a brain change? So, 1987, rolling around, so I've been eating raw meat since 1976. It's been ten years, and I thought, I've got to see the proof. Because I've eaten pinworm-infested salmon, you know, was undulating with pinworms, didn't get one parasite, I have no hydrochloric acid in my stomach because of the vagotomy.

This doesn't make sense to me. Is it another myth like the microbe in the rabbit going to take me over? Or do I have some spiritual specialty? You know, and I never believed that. So, I looked at all the major universities who would have taken animals, fed them raw meat, and test their stools and blood to see if they had parasites. Not one test was ever done. And I asked those universities if they knew any other universities that did such a test. Nobody had ever done such a test. So, it was an absolute hogwash. So, I said, okay, that proves it. So, any time an MD says to me, you can get parasites, and I said, show me. Show me the test to prove that. There aren't any. I have the proof that it doesn't. I've been eating raw meat since 1976, even parasite infested, and full of that. Did anybody see my Ripley's Raw Meat Eater Believe it or Not episode? No? Well, you go online and you can look up Ripley's Raw Meat Eater. And you'll see me there eating meat that has parasites, fungus, flies, maggots, everything. Up to a year and three months old. And you look at it and you say, this is disgusting. And I'm eating it there, and it doesn't create any problem. It is a fiction. Just this year, somebody gave me a tape called The Last Dance or The Last Hunt, something like that. Of a tribe in Africa. And they are hunters. That's all they do is hunt. And the government has said you can no longer hunt on your property. This is all reserved, national reserve, for the animals you can no longer hunt. So now they're living on AIDS relief, you know, donated flour and water and powdered milk. Which are the worst things you can do to any civilization. Create lots of tapeworms with that kind of a diet. And the tapeworms are not bad. They feed on the excess carbohydrate that would deteriorate the intestine. So those parasites are good. Tapeworms are good. So, any time the doctor says, you know, you have parasites. Okay, show me the test, show me the evidence. Oh, it's everywhere? Well, tell me why. You can't get it from meat because it doesn't exist. It's not a reality. Anyway, this tribe, when they're hunting, if they come across a dead rotting carcass that will stink for miles, they follow it until they find it and they eat it raw. They cook normally when they hunt, but when they find an animal that's decayed, they don't cook it. They eat it rotten and they say it's so delicious and gives them so much energy for hunting.

Q: What tribe?

A: Pardon?

Q: What tribe?

A: I don't remember. It's a very large tribe.

Q: Bushmen, right? Bushmen tribe?

A: Yeah, it's a Bushmen tribe, but it's not in Australia. It's in Africa.

Q: Is it off that video you saw called The Great Dance?

A: Yeah, it's The Last Hunt or The Great Dance, something like that. And you could probably find, I think it got some awards. It did get an award. Switzerland or something? Anyway, it's a documentary on this tribe's last hunt. If you Google that, you might be able to find it. 

Q: I think I have that one. That's the one where they run a deer to death, right?

A: Yes! Can you imagine having the energy of... The Great Dance?

Q: Yeah.

A: They run without stopping for eight to ten hours. Can you imagine running eight to ten hours without stopping? You're running with the deer the whole time until you exhaust the deer. You don't get exhausted, they don't get exhausted. The deer gets exhausted and then they kill them. Incredible! And that's all they eat is meat. That's their diet. They run as fast as the deer. Sometimes the deer gets out of range, but they just keep running following the tracks. Eventually they catch the deer and the deer is just exhausted. It's a great film. You saw it? Yeah, it's a great film.

Q: It has to be like hot enough, the temperature hot enough, and then they just keep running the deer and it keeps getting stressed out because it's so hot. It's heart failing. They get to a place where the deer won't run any farther and then they kill it.

A: And there's only one of them that drinks much water. Only one of the three of the hunters that are doing this. The one they call the runner, who can run as fast as the deer. They call him the runner. He drinks more water because he probably perspires a lot. The other's don't drink much water. The other two. If running ten hours at his pace, because he made me stay ahead of everybody, he drank a quart of water a day. If you ran for ten hours, you'd be drinking two gallons a day. So very little water needed. And they're in a hot desert environment, sun beating and all that. So, that's how I discovered everything I know. That's where I am now. I'm here to let you know, 99% of what you hear from the medical profession is the exact opposite. That includes, if you've got an injury, you don't put ice on it. Think about what ice does. Think about the concept of that. Your body increases circulation to an area to bring more nutrients into the area. You put ice on it, what happens? It chills it, it shrinks the veins, and it decreases the amount of nutrients. Swelling is important when you get an injury. That's a massive amount of nutrients being taken to that area to heal it quickly. Cleanse the area and heal it quickly. Why the hell would you put ice on it? Because it numbs it and they can put the guy back out on the field. They don't care. So his knee's blown out when he's 38 and can never work again as an athlete. They don't give a shit. They're just worried about their game. That particular game. So if you want to heal anything, you've got pain anywhere, heat is your element and not an electrical heat pad either because that has an EMF field. Anywhere from 75 to 200 milligauss. It takes 3 milligauss to alter the molecular structure of humans or animals into something destructive or damaged. Use hot water bottles. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They're hard to find now, but you can get them online for really cheap. Those who are coming for consults can get a product list where you can actually get real rubber ones, not plastic ones with gasoline. They stink terribly, so you put them out in the sun for 30 days on either side. I have 7 of them.

Q: I think I've got mine in Walgreens, right where I live, I think Walgreens has some.

A: All rubber?

Q: Yeah, I believe so, but they do stink.

A: Well, the other ones stink, but the rubber stinks tremendously.

Q: Yeah, I'm not sure if it's all rubber.

A: I've never seen the Walgreens in rubber.

Q: I'll put a link to it.

A: Okay.

Q: [unintelligible] 

A: It doesn't have a bad effect, but it's, everything smells you. Like cheese, everything will smell like the rubber. But it doesn't cause any real problem. But you put it out in the sun and bake them on one side, the other side, two weeks each on each side.

Q: What about the warm things they put in the microwave and get hot?

A: Very bad.

Q: They are bad?

A: They become radioactively charged.

Q: In the microwave?

A: Yeah, well, the minerals that they use in it, you've got iodine, you've got barium, you've got radioactive material in there. And it's charged. That's why it stays hot so long. It's a radioactive element. I wouldn't trust myself hugging a radioactive element, especially if I'm [unintelligible]. I'm not going to heal properly. Remember, radiation...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Still, we've got minerals like iodine and barium, lead, in those, in seeds. And once they're irradiated, they will continue irradiating for hours. And radiation stops the reproduction of cells. That's healing. Reproduction of cells is the healing. Unless you're just going to take a lot of dead cells and pack them in some area, and then you have a stiff joint, an injured area, a scarred area. So, that's not the way to heal. Okay, now we're going to start the regular process. I want to, by the end of this course, this workshop... Now, workshop is normally you do something interacting with me. You're going to do it with your brains. Because I'm going to give you so much information, you're going to have to work very hard to understand and retain it. So, that's why I call it a workshop. But we'll take a break every hour and a half, so that everybody can get some nutrition. Let everything set, and then we'll start again after about 15 minutes. So, you have 15 minutes to eat and go to the toilet. So, we're going to do that now. When I come back, I'm going to tell you how your body works, so you will never, ever be afraid of it again. And you'll never have to run to a doctor. You don't have to panic because of what people are telling you around, because everything that the pharmaceutical industry says, the medical profession believes, because it's dependent on it. Pharmaceutical industries finance all the universities' tests and give them all the money to make sure that a drug is made, and nothing, it has nothing to do with your healing process, and medical processes, bodily processes. So, you will not panic. You will know your body. You'll know how to help yourself. My book, We Want to Live, has over 200 pages in there on foods and how they are remedies for your body. So, you go to the book, you don't have to run to some hospital or doctor and get an injection of some poison or get an irradiation or some biopsy that is destructive to your body that will cause cancer and health problems. So, go eat. Relieve yourself. I'll see you in 15 minutes. You're looking good and strong. That's what you need to be for a long time. I was that way for 20 years.

Q: I've got like bumps all over me. It's like all those baths every day for like 5 months, I guess.

A: It's good. 90% toxins leaves the skin.

Q: Did you fly in yesterday?

A: [unintelligible] I'm going right to work. I have to work. I'm so far behind.

[chatter]

A: I still only collected $47,000. I still have to get the $300,000.

Q: You need that.

A: There's no way I'm going to start a new procedure. Because then I'm buried, and I lose, and I have to pay them. Then it works. If I lose, I have to pay them.

Q: Yeah, then if you lose that, and you go to court again, then they can use that against you.

A: Absolutely. Just throw you out of court.

Q: So do you think... So you're still wanting to get people to contribute?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Do you think people are going to wake up to this?

A: Well, I'm going to keep going. I have until June 29th of next year to file. First I did wait about six weeks, then I waited three or four weeks, and now I'm just going to start hitting them every week.

Q: I wish you had time. You must have people who have contributed once. For people who are hesitant to want to contribute, maybe they got money, but they're hesitant to contribute because they don't really know. [unintelligible] Because then it would be more, like I know for me, I would want to do that.

A: Well, I just finished an email this morning. I sent it to the treasurer to look over it. [unintelligible] Because that's what people, a lot of people, I got a lot of emails saying, well, how's it going to speak to those who use it? All these kinds of opportunities. So I explained how it's been used and how we're going to use those funds. What they would not be used for. So that email should go out tonight.

[chatter]

A: Okay, we're going to get started. Now, usually I always end my lectures talking about water and salt. However, because I just had some salt that gave me a slight headache, I'm going to start talking about salt. Salt is the worst thing next to cooking. Let me explain why. Salt is an explosive. When you isolate sodium, it is more volatile than nitroglycerin. The government, the USA military, gave General Electric $2 trillion over 60 years to be able to control a sodium bomb. You can't do it. You know how you can move nitroglycerin and set it off? Sodium isolated is worse than that. It only takes one to two degrees change to cause it to explode. It is so volatile that a crystal of sodium this big, pure sodium, is worth an atomic bomb. It can level New York City. One crystal that big. They have not been able to control it. Pardon? 

Q: What do you mix it with to get rid of that?

A: No, it's completely isolated. They've tried mixing things with it to control it, and they can't. When you eat, see, when they make salt for you, they mix chloride with it. I mean, yeah, chloride, chlorine. Or they mix potassium or iodine with it. So you don't notice the volatileness. But you can taste it when it sparks your whole flavor buds. It is a volatile poison. Now the king and queen of England made a product of it, just like Hitler made a product of chloride, to calm the masses in the 1300s. That's when the king and queen of England, the Windsor family, got into making salt and giving it to everybody for very cheaply. So, to control the masses. There is a video on YouTube where some guys, I told them about what salt would do, so they decided to run an experiment. So they took fresh frog legs, they stripped them, I mean, we're talking about fresh frog, they killed the fresh frog, they took the legs and they took the skin off of it, and sprinkled twice, just over each leg twice. Those, you watch, those frog legs go into spasms for, in fact they end the, because the thing runs about six minutes, seven minutes, you watch those legs spasm for six, and they're still spasming when they cut the video off. Those legs will spasm for like 30 minutes. They also did one with pepper. You think pepper, hot, spicy, that would cause more than salt. They sprinkled heavily, they sprinkled that, and it made one jerk and that's it. That's the volatileness of salt. Dangerous stuff. And I've been saying it for, you know, 20 years. Salt is the worst thing next to cooking.

Q: How does it calm you?

A: Well, it starts, your brain cuts off. It wants to isolate, just like your body does with alcohol. It cuts off the analytical part of your brain.

Q: [unintelligible] your body.

A: Yes. Not only that, your body will separate the iodine from the sodium. So then the sodium becomes an explosive. And it kills cells. And it dehydrates them. It does all kinds of things.

Q: What about, [unintelligible].

A: That was, if I answer questions like this all day long, and I did that once in New York City, I didn't get out until 1 o'clock in the morning. So I'm not going to answer a lot of questions like that. But that was just what the Indian people could make their own salt. Because the king and queen of England owned most of the property in India. They owned the right to make salt. No Indian could go out and make salt from the ocean. Gandhi ended that. So they just get to make, that doesn't mean it's healthy for them. They get to make their own salt. They're not having to pay for it. So, OK. So salt is a huge contaminant in the body. I don't care if it's Celtic. I don't care if it's Dead Sea salt. Salt is salt. It's concentrated in sodium. And your body will separate the sodium molecule from the other molecules in the body. And then it does its damage. And I just took one bite of that cheese. And all of a sudden, after the other flavors that were in it, the garlic and everything, and then my mouth, my tongue started burning and swelling, insulin. My throat is swollen right now. And it goes expectorated and rinsed my mouth out with milk. And I got an instant headache. The milk is now relieved because I drank some milk to follow up on it. But that's how quick you're going to get to the [unintelligible]. Even if you're not sensitive, it's already doing it, even if you can't detect it. So a lot of people would say, even a little, just a little salt is good for you. In any form, it is not.

Q: Does it naturally occur in some foods?

A: Sodium does, yes, but that's different. Like celery, avocado, tomatoes, very high in sodium. But that sodium is ionically bound and the body will never separate it. But in a salt form, a dehydrated salt form, it will isolate it and separate it. Because it's rock.

Q: So that's the thing with the [unintelligible], like for surfers.

A: Absolutely. Why do you think people go into cramps and everything else? Drinking salt water, diarrhea, vomit, everything. Now, in the future, I'm not going to answer any more questions. If you have a question, write it. If I haven't answered it by the end, we will have a Q&A period. And let me tell you, I answer 99% of the questions. I'm going to go ahead into water. Water is a solvent. If you go into an archeological book, the first thing under solvent on the planet is water. When it rains, water goes into the ground, dissolves the rock, plants eat. Water is a solvent. It will take things apart. It doesn't put anything together. It removes things. It's a hungry substance. And it will just take anything it has and pick it apart. Ships in the ocean, what happens? And that's even with salt in the water. It takes it and rusts it. It decomposes it. It takes it to pieces. It may take centuries, but it's still taking it apart. When you drink water, it goes and dilutes your digestive acids and juices. It strips your body of the mucous coating on your stomach and intestines. And it dilutes and breaks down the villi in the intestines. It prevents you from digesting properly. Thirst is not really water. If you can look at your skin and you see it's not all dried and sucked in like the desert, you don't have a water problem. And even if you have dry skin like a lizard, that still is not the same as dry skin. If your skin is so dry that it's flaking all layers, and it's not psoriasis or eczema, you're not dehydrated. 90% of the people that the hospital says, oh, you're dehydrated, you're not dehydrated. Just the medical industry doesn't know what's wrong with them. So, just how you're dehydrated puts you on an IV. And that IV has sodium chloride in it. It has some kind of sugar in it. And, of course, your body starts dealing with that stuff. The problem you had is going to disappear for a while. But you think they cured you. They just distracted your problem with another poison. And all problems in the body, except for injury, come from industrial toxins, industrial products. Whether it was food, the air, water, or [unintelligible]. In your home, outgassing. They cause disease. Eating cooked foods by the tribes that eat cooked foods and aren't exposed to industrial pollution only have five diseases. Gout, arthritis and rheumatism, some thyroid problems, and some psoriasis. Bone problems.

Q: Osteoporosis.

A: Yeah, osteoporosis and bone problems. Now, five diseases, that's not so many. Those you can live with okay. But all of your other hundreds and 200 diseases, all are from industrial pollution. Chemicals. Chemicals are in anything and everywhere. Like I say, keep your questions. Do write them down.

Q: There's more of a comment. You mentioned outgassing. I bought these curtains with like an opaque backing on them. The first year I hung them up, it was the most toxic smell and I was trying to figure out where it was coming from. I couldn't figure it out. The following season, they had all outgassed and they don't stink anymore, but I breathed all that stuff in for that one season. It was awful.

A: Anytime you have something like that, you put it outside for 30 days. Let the sun and the cold temper it. Solidify it so it's not outgassed. Okay, so water should be taken minimally. You do need some solvent in your body. You need to help drag down hardened substances because people eat rock in their diets. Not good rock, bad rocks. Anything that's processed contains minerals. When it's processed, it's back in the form of rock. It's not in food form. So, all of that collects, collects and collects. So you do have rocks inside your body. Some of them will do it in the kidney or bladder where it can be washed out easier. But a lot of it isn't. Most of it isn't. You've got crystals all over in the body. If you smoke, you've compounded your crystals with tar crystals. So, water should be consumed in very small amounts. Maybe a sip at a time, a tablespoon at a time. No more than about three ounces a day. Unless you exercise, then probably up to a cup a day. Maybe a cup and a half. You should rely upon foods that are high in water, H2O. Meat is 55% water. Dairy is 86 to 90% water. Tomatoes are 92% water. Watermelon is 92% water. All of your fruits are anywhere from 90 to 92% water. And they're all ionically bounded. You can absorb every bit of the H2O. When you drink water, only 10% is absorbable into the cells. And guess what? That dries them out. Put water on your skin all day long and what happens? It dries out and cracks. Water is a solvent. It dries things out because it breaks them down. So you're breaking your skin down by putting water on it. If you want to nourish your body and strengthen it, you need to fill it with fats. Lipidate it. So if you put butter on your skin, what's going to happen? It's going to fill out, the dryness is going to go away, and your skin is happy and protected against what? Water! So, when anybody says, oh, you're dehydrated, oh, you're full of it, because you're not. You are dry from not enough fat, not water. Okay? And, you take a look at the aborigines. In Australia, did you ever see, oh, the rabbit fence? 

Q: Rabbit-proof fence.

A: Rabbit-proof fence. These little girls run away from an orphanage. They've been taken away from their parents because they're half-British, and they're half-Aboriginal. And the British government in Australia decided that children who are half-breeds should not grow up with native parents. So, they went and took all the children away from the natives who had British blood. And they put them in Catholic orphanages. These three little girls run away. And they were told that if they follow the rabbit-proof fence, they will make it to their village. Because it's at one end. Just a distance from one end of it. So, the little girls run away, but they go the wrong way on the rabbit-proof fence. They got no food. So, what did they do to eat? To drink? They take, there's these long plants that grow, they pop them and let the vegetable juice drop into their mouths. They'll pull out a root and they grate it and wring it. So on a half a cup of vegetable juice, they walk a hundred miles a day. So for 60 days, they went the wrong way. I think it was 60 days they went the wrong way before they realized they were going the wrong way. So then he says, wait a minute, the sun comes and goes. We're going the wrong way. So they go the other way. So of course, the orphanage and the government are waiting for them to go the right way. And they never find them because they went the wrong way first. So they go the right way and then one of them gets caught, the other two, the sisters, keep going until they get home. And they're happily at home and the government comes and seizes them sometime later, takes them away again. But the point is that when you know how to live, these are people in an outside desert that gets to 123, 126 degrees and they don't drink water. Think about that. We're so conditioned. And we never talked about, or heard about, nobody said, oh, you gotta drink water. Ever. Until 1961. Guess who got involved in selling water? Pepsi-Cola. Coca-Cola. Let's sell water. Nobody's gonna buy water. Oh yeah, they will. Watch. Remember what we did with milk? We got everybody afraid of milk and drinking raw milk. So we got them by creating fantasies that you're going to get acne, that you'll get dry skin and you'll look ugly. So they started hiring doctors to go around saying you need eight glasses of water a day. Or you're gonna get skin problems or you're gonna get acne or you're gonna get shit like this. So they brainwashed you into believing that you need eight glasses of water a day. When I was a kid, you went to the water faucet at school and had two sips a day, unless you were one of those athletes, then you had a half a cup a day. You said, okay, give me two ounces, then you go back to class. Or back to your sport. There was no, all this electrolyte water stuff. It is all garbage. It will make you hungrier. It will dry you out and make you thirstier. I have had no water, well I had a little water a couple of days ago, but no water for a month. Am I dehydrated? No, not at all. Does that look dehydrated anywhere? 

I have got a martial arts master in New York City that doesn't consume water. And he teaches and exercises and practices eight hours a day. Not all of them. There is an hour break here and an hour break there. But in a 12-hour period he is doing eight hours of hard martial arts exercise. Doesn't drink any water. Is that proof enough? So. Minimize your water. Drink things that have nutrients in them. And the water can all be utilized properly. One hundred percent. And that's in food. Like I say, even meat's fifty-five percent water. And unless you are a brief jerky, you are not dehydrated. I'm going to start talking about the body now. Go over the body and how it works so you'll understand and not be afraid of it and run to some doctor out of panic because you don't know what's going on. Because all the commercials out there and all the news is, you better see your doctor, you better see your doctor, you better see your doctor. And also something you should understand that all of these foundations for cancer and for certain kinds of research, they are false entities. They are created by the pharmaceutical and the medical establishment to make you think that they are objective and they are not. They are as objective as Rockefeller's foundations. Rockefeller's own controlling stock in five pharmaceutical houses. How objective do you think that's going to be toward cancer or anything else? Anytime you donate to them, you're just donating to the drug industry. Not donating to help women with their breast cancer. I gotta go into that too. Breast cancer. What bullshit. You have to understand your lymph glands clean the body. All of us have a massive amount of lymphatic glands here. We have nodes and glands all over the body, but they're concentrated here, here, and here. So, if you have poisons going into your lungs, into your food, from your food into your body, guess what glands are responsible for taking care of that area. So, if you have any cancer cells in the body, and cancer cells are a good thing. I'll explain why. Cancer cells hold a fluid in them that is like a virus. They're a solvent. What can they dissolve? They can dissolve dead cells. Why does the body make a cancer cell a cell that can dissolve dead cells? Because if your lymphatic system is too jammed and you're not getting the right fats and you can't make the solvent to dissolve dead cells, what's the body going to do with those cells that can't dissolve? It can't eliminate them because they're too big. It can't respire them. So, the body will collect them and make fibroids somewhere in the body. Most women have the advantage of having a uterus. Of course, it will mess up reproduction, but at least they can put all those dead cells in their uterus, in their vaginal cavity. So, it won't interfere with other tissue. It won't interfere with the heart muscles. It won't interfere with other organs and muscles in the body. But in men, it'll go to various areas and start shutting down function. And in women, it'll eventually get to there and the woman doesn't do it in her reproductive organs and she'll do it somewhere else and then she'll have the same problem as a man. And that's less dexterity. Reduce function of glands and organs throughout the body, everywhere.

So, we start collecting these dead cells. Hell, give me the cancer cells. You can dissolve these dead cells in an instant. However, the by-product is very toxic because we don't have bacteria, parasites, and fungus eating that degenerate tissue, that dead cell. They produce excretions that neutralize the poison. And then we can perspire that through the body. When your body uses a solvent to do it, you've got a very strong acidic product, that by-product, that can damage the tissue. That's why when the body starts making cancer starts dissolving tumors and you see things fall off and fall off. Healthy cells are involved in that because you can't control the acids that are a response for it because you're not eating properly. When your body starts using calcium and bone, and you get osteoporosis, everybody who has cancer has osteoporosis. Why? Because the body starts eating the bone to supply the calcium and phosphorous, manganese and potassium to neutralize the acids from dissolving the dead cells. So you've got a craziness going on there. But once you get in the traps of the medical profession, there's no way out because they will burn you, they will poison you, they will cut you. And just the cutting alone causes all these juices from the lymphatic system and the muscles, connective tissue, all different fluids, to all of a sudden start combining and poisoning each other. It's like putting, you know, milk in a gas tank. Sugar in a gas tank. You can't mix these things. That will cause the destruction of cells. And if you can't dissolve cells already, you kill more cells. So you keep adding to the massacre of dead cells. That's why the rate of life after you go to the medical profession, 96% of the time is five years after treatment. That means only 4% of the people who have treatment live beyond five years after medical treatment for cancer. That's a horrible average. And the people who receive cancer and live for that five years is 16%. The people who go on my diet, 95% reverse it and live far beyond five years. Food is your medicine. Medicine is your food. So, when your breast, all the lymph glands in your breast are working and using cells because it doesn't have the proper fat to do it, but isolates it right there. It uses the cancer cell to dissolve the dead cells in an isolated environment with lots of fat. You don't have cancer. Your lymph glands are swelling because they're working properly. They're taking all these dead cells and working in an isolated lab. And your lymphatic lab is where it does it. So, if they plug your lymphatic lab and find cancer, they say, oh, you've got breast cancer. No, you don't. So they lop off people's, women's breasts and take out their lymph glands and guess what? You don't have the lymph glands to do the work anymore. So, now you're likely to get cancer in your lungs, in your throat, somewhere around here. Because you don't have what you need to clean the body. Doctors are murderers and butchers. Period. That's it. Never look at them with any kind of view toward helping you heal anything. The medical profession is completely run by the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry runs all of the medical, all of the medical clinics and the institutions, medical institutions of learning.

All of the medical schools are run by the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry writes the medical procedures. And do you think they're going to write something to help cure you? They have a profit in mind. Diabetes is easily cured. Hippocrates cured diabetes by putting people only on a raw milk diet. They didn't need anything else but milk. Raw milk. Six to ten weeks, diabetes, juvenile even, cured. Six to ten weeks, cured. Now it takes longer. We don't have the healthiest milk we have. We have refrigeration. Theirs used to be neve refrigerated so it didn't damage the growth hormones. Refrigeration damages the growth hormones in milk. So, if you can get your milk never refrigerated, best. Never gone under 70 degrees, best. Or kept at 80 degrees and a half, 78 degrees and a half, it's even better. And eat it spoiled and, you know, and sour. It's the best way to do it because that's exactly the process that happens in the stomach. It sours and tastes just like it's digested because that's the natural bacteria in the milk. It's pre-digested. So you don't have to do all that work. Easy. You can absorb all those things. So, don't cut off your breasts. Don't listen to doctors. They don't know anything about health. They only study disease and interpretation, bad interpretations of chemistry. That all leads you back to taking Medicaid. Pharmaceuticals, it takes $12 to $1800 per diabetic a month. Diabetes, we have now 53 million diagnosed diabetics in this country who are on insulin. Multiply that by $12 to $1800 a month. How many billions of dollars is that a year, just in America? Just from insulin. You think they're going to let that go? They're a business. That's not going to happen. So, don't go to medicine for any answer about health. They don't know anything about health. Alright, so let's take a look at the human body. To know what to eat, we need to know our design because we've lost our instincts, we've been miseducated, so we have to go the back way. So, I'm going to take you through the back way. Okay, in the mouth, what do we have? We have salivary glands, and if you analyze the salivary fluid, what do we find? Salmonella, E. coli, Campylobacter, all of that, unless you've got to brush your teeth and rinse with mouthwash. You have no bacteria because it destroys them. But normally, we have more bacteria than dogs and cats. So, don't let anybody bite you. So, what does that tell you? The body is putting bacteria in what you eat. Well, then bacteria must have a great deal to do with digestion. Absolutely correct. The only unusual enzyme that we have that doesn't work on meat and fats is ptyalin enzyme, which the horse has. That breaks down some sugar. We've been eating a lot of sweet stuff for a long time. But we have enough ptyalin enzyme to digest one piece of fruit a day. So, let's eat one piece of fruits a day. When the food goes down, what's in the stomach? Hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid isn't for nuts. It isn't for fruits. It isn't for grains. It's for meat and dairy. Hydrochloric acid is it. That's all we have in the stomach.

Besides bacteria, lots of campylobacter in the stomach. And the campylobacter is created in the stomach lining. Only campylobacter causes disease, according to the pharmaceutical industry. So, you'll take antibiotics, you'll be appraised. And the food industry goes to put all kinds of chemicals in there, get rid of all the bacteria that causes spoilage in food. And if it gets returned to them, so they make more profit. So, don't buy it. Bacteria is not your issue, it's not your problem. So, then it goes to the lower part of the stomach, the duodenum, and what do we have? Bile. What does bile digest? Fat. And what do our kind of biles do? Does our liver make? Sixty varieties. To make sixty varieties of cholesterol. And all that cholesterol is for animal products. Not vegetable oil, not avocado, not nut oil, none of it. Although it will work on avocado, and it will work okay. The other oils, it does not. Not olive oil or any of it. It'll work to make them into solvents to dissolve and cleanse. Ninety percent of the chemicals you see thrown on, discarded. Ninety percent of the oils that you eat is passed out. You can look at your urine, there'll be some little oil spots on the top of your toilet when you urinate, or you break open your feces, and you mash it all, so all this oil, undigested oil, will surface to the top, including olive oil. So, our bile is meant to digest animal fat, whether it's from an animal, or whether it's from dairy, from the air. So, then we move into the intestinal tract. And what do we find? Well, we find some alkalinizing, about two, three percent cellulose-digesting enzymes in there that the body manufactures, but not natural to the system. It only manufactures them when you're a vegetable eater. When you stop eating vegetables, guess what? Your body no longer makes them. So, your body can't digest two percent of vegetables. That means three bites a day of a vegetable. Or, you just hit vegetable juice and leave it at that. Because what happens when you eat vegetables? You secrete alkaline juices all throughout. That interferes with the acidic bacteria, which is 90 percent of digestion. Well, most of you, probably 80 to 90, because you eat a lot of foods that are not good for your body. So, you're producing more alkaline fluids than you normally should, or alkalinizing bacteria. The bacteria in a cow, a goat, a sheep, and a horse, those are bacteria to break down cellulose. Our naturally produced and easily reproduced bacteria is to break down meat. So, again, and bile, you still secrete hydrochloric acid and bile all throughout the small intestine. But 80 to 90 percent of digestion is bacterially done. Just like you put the kefir grains or yogurt grains in milk. But those aren't natural for us because they're using the, the stomach of a cow, like rennet. The rennet from a cow is for the cow to digest, not for us. We use something different. So, if you want good bacteria, like I said in my recipe book, to digest milk for you, you spit in it.

That's your bacteria. Perfect bacteria for you. So, you work up a tablespoon of saliva and you put it into a quart of milk. There you have it. Now, when I was experimenting with infants with problems, all the infants got the same thing. Gave infants the cow bacteria, Digested Kefir, and they did okay with it. But I gave them the saliva, because what I can do is get them to suck and then I pull the spit out of their mouth. I hold them down like this, like a big drool. So, I just force them to drool when I get their spit. And then I put it in about five ounces of milk. So, I was feeding them that, and I would take that and put it in, keep it going that way. And it was for that baby. That bacteria was specifically that baby. The results were five times better for that baby. So, you cannot be afraid of bacteria. According to microbiologists of today, there's an argument whether it's 90, we are 90 or 99 percent bacterial. You get it? We are bacterial. We are completely bacteria. So, the whole notion that bacteria causes disease is absolute horse manure. No, horse manure is good. It's absolute contamination and pollution. Okay. So, take a look at it. Bacteria goes there and eats something, then how do we eat? Bacteria die, it decomposes, it's bacterial breakdown. And what do we end up eating? We're eating feces and urine of bacteria. That's our food. Feces and urine of bacteria. Oh, my God, we live on shit and piss. That's basically it. And then when somebody says, oh, God, you've got bottom feeders. Shrimp and crabs and lobsters eating dung from fish. That's their diet. That's what they're supposed to eat. And they're vibrantly healthy. Have you seen the beauty of a lobster? I mean, look at the radiance and color and the good strength of their shells. They are incredible creatures and strong. Oh, but don't eat bottom feeders. They eat shit. So do you. Your whole body eats it. So, you've got to get out of this contaminated thinking that the pharmaceutical and medical industry have drilled into you. It is your best friend. Okay, then you get into the bowel. E. coli. Now, E. coli, they've spread it around for almost 30 years. E. coli bad, E. coli bad. And then you have all these whole two generations of gastroenterologists of ignorance saying, man, the whole colon is full of E. coli. That's how it works. So, then the health departments and the medical industry had to come up with a bad E. coli guy. So, they come up with 157H7. Hello? Anybody get this? Does anybody find a 157H7? I've never found one. Even in the fields where they said it was in the spinach field. And I went and raided it at night with five other, five other not nutrition, not nutrition, but natural herbalists and things like that. We raided the field at night while all the feds were sleeping. Supposed to be partying. Now take a look at this. It was called an E. coli outbreak and blamed on the spinach fields. The Department of Agriculture and Health Department of California moved in right away. The county there locally moved in. The feds came in the next day and ran them all out. 

Why wouldn't they all pull their efforts together if there was really a problem? Because the feds made this up. The only 157H7 that I found came from a university in Northern California. And where did they get it? From the federal government. So this is a man-made E. coli that doesn't occur in nature. So wherever you find it, it's been planted. But they want to make sure every food's processed, there's nothing raw. They want to have long shelf life, big profits, and you sick. What's the advantage of you sick? Because they don't want something occurring in 1976 that occurred... They don't want something happening now that occurred in 1976. Healthy people that drank raw milk all the time, and it's majorly raw milk that they had raw all the time. Of course you didn't have stoves back then, they were easy to make, and you always had smoke in your house when you cooked in your house. So most people ate all the stuff raw, even meats. Only your wealthy people could afford to have slaves in their kitchens that suffered to eat cooked foods like that. They want you dumb and weak, so you cannot fight the government. Believe it. That's why they want chloride in your water. That's why they want chlorine in your water. That's why they want no raw milk. Why would they be giving up raw milk? Why would they be making up all these stories of raw milk as dangerous when there's absolutely no threat of scientific evidence? In fact, the scientific evidence shows just the opposite. Why are they going after you? Such zest. They want you dumbed down and stupid. Think about that. In that colon, full of bacteria, that's more bacteria than in the small intestine. You don't even have any digestive juices in the colon. It is all bacterial. They dump a little bit of bile inside, if the body's really in bad shape. The body will do some very different things if it's forced to. So you have all of this decomposing, and the last, where the body's pulling out all the fluids, drinking them, eating everything, so that the fecal matter passes through dry. Dry. The more bacteria you have, the less dry it has to be when it moves, so your body doesn't have to choke it and take everything out of it.

So anybody who's got a baby who doesn't move fecal matter through easily, it's not because that baby is constipated because of the raw milk, or the raw dairy, or anything else in the raw meat, it's because the colon is so deficient in bacteria, that what bacteria in there is taking every bit of that food that it can. It's not letting it move out of the body. I know people that are so starving that don't move until five days past, because their body is taking every bit of nutrients it can. It doesn't have any ways to give. But then when it does, it's very hard little rocks. And I mean as solid as rock. That's how much has been digested from it. Solid as rock. Doesn't make it comfortable. What can we do to alleviate that? Well, first of all, we've got people who are raised on terrible food. Terrible bacteria in there. By the time the food gets down to the bowel, all of the good fats are gone. So all of your microbes, the bacteria in your large intestine are starved for good fresh fats. Compounds it. You're going to have to hold it and take every morsel of fat out of that fecal matter. It is rock. Nothing fluid about it. Nothing soft about it. So, what do you do? Do you know that you can feed the body from anywhere. Put food on the skin. It will be digested in the skin and absorbed. Some vitamin D is formed. You have fat in your skin. As the sun hits it, it makes vitamin D right in your skin. It is absorbed into the body. As your body absorbs your color, it's absorbing the vitamin D. The more color you have, the more vitamin D you have in your skin. You don't get lots of sun, everybody in here. I don't see many people with much color. Another reason the black races are so strong. Such good athletes, because they have such a reserve of vitamin D that they can go one generation without ever getting sunshine and they would probably be pretty healthy. As long as they didn't eat a lot of toxic food. We white people don't have that advantage. We have no storage of vitamin D. We have to make it on a daily basis. We need sunshine or we need something like butter to make sure that we form vitamin D properly. So, in this bowel situation, feed the body fresh fats in the butt. You take for an infant or a child, you take one to two tablespoons each. For an adult you take three to four tablespoons each of butter, dairy cream, and coconut cream. If you only use butter and dairy without coconut cream, those bacteria are going to eat so much, they're not going to have even enough to make the fecal matter soft. The body's not going to digest much of the coconut cream, so it's going to leave there just to make the fecal matter soft. You can still rub all the good animal fats out of it, but leave some coconut cream in there to soften the fecal matter. So, you're feeding the bacteria the butter and dairy cream right from the back in. All those bacteria are very happy, getting everything they need. Then, all of a sudden, you see the child, the infant, and the adult having daily bowel movements without all that problem and trouble.

It could be every two days that you have to do it at first, after a couple of weeks, then every three to four days, then every week, and then eventually, when you've got such a population, and you're eating very good and always supplying good fats, enough to get to the bowel, you'll never have constipation again. I eat two to three quarts of milk a day. I can down two bricks of cheese a day, and I have soft movement. When I first started this diet, I had a bowel movement every five days, and I had to take a crowbar to get it out. You think I'm kidding? So, I was like the constipated mathematician working with the pencil. [unintelligible] All these memories of jokes that I, finally at 22 years old, I was able to read and comprehend language. Oh, that's what that joke meant. That's what that meant. Now, when I was talking to people, laughing. But I went through all those years as an idiot, not getting a joke ever. And one time, my body, my mind, put a couple of sentences together, and I was watching TV. And I was about, I don't know, 13 years old. And I didn't know how I put it together, but I did. And I came out and said, it was a toilet paper commercial. And I said, why do you need something soft to wipe your butt? My parents and my brothers went into hysterics. And I thought, what did I say? I thought, what did I say? How did I say it? I had no idea what I had said. It just came out of my mouth and my mind. And I didn't know what I said. And everybody is laughing. And I thought, oh, if I could only do that all the time. So, now I can. So, I take it in. Okay, so, that's how you can nurture that intestinal. If you still don't eat as good, that colon doesn't get old, but perhaps it needs, it's okay to feed yourself from the back end. How you do it? You put those in a four-ounce jelly jar with a, if it's for a child and infant, you only use a drop of honey. If it's for an older child or adult, you use a quarter teaspoon of honey only. That'll give them the sugars, so the bacteria doesn't have to convert the protein into a sugar. Normally that's what happens and that's normal and that's okay, but I find that the bacteria will not work as hard and the colon is not as stressed when you put just that tiny bit of honey in there to give it some carbs. Okay, so, then you take that little jar, four-ounce jar, and you shake it, shake it, and you put it in a bowl of hot water. Not hot enough to burn your hand, but hot enough to make sure it feels very warm. You set it for three to four minutes, five minutes maximum. And you do all this before the child or you go to bed. You get a bulb syringe. Very hard to get those anymore except online. And they are on my product list also. And you absorb into that bulb syringe that fluid. Then you get down on all fours and you bark like a dog. And then you insert it in you, either this way or this way, depending on how big of a butt you have and how comfortable you are. If you're a yoga, you can stretch around there. And if you can't, then have somebody help you. And squeeze it up in there. And when you do it, don't have tension here. Don't tighten anything. You've got to make sure to relax so it flows in. And if you have hardened fecal matter already in the sigmoid colon, it's not going to move in easily.

So you have to let your stomach fall. You have to relax. Then it goes up in there. You put your face and your hands down flat. Keep your butt and your knees up. And you roll your stomach like a belly dancer. Do people do that? And it'll move it down. You do that for about two minutes. Then you roll on your right side, not your left. Your right side, lift your left leg, and roll your stomach again. And it'll move it over into the transverse colon. And even some might get into the descending colon. So all the E. coli gets fresh... That's some fresh stuff. But they don't have to migrate over there and keep changing places. So you do that for five minutes. Then you've fed your colon wonderfully. The bacteria in the colon. Okay? Now let's take a look at the teeth. Vegetarians say, well, we're vegetarians. You ever see a human with all molars? Well, that's what all vegetarian herbivores have. They have all molars. Everything's a molar in their mouth. We have cutting teeth. We have canine teeth. We are meant to rip apart meat with our teeth. Cutting teeth. Sure, we can eat fruit. We can eat all the things that need cutting teeth. But we don't have the teeth to grind it. As much grinding as it takes. And how does a little horse and a cow digest? They chew, they swallow, they regurgitate, chew again. Up to seven times. Five to seven times. Per mouthful. Do we do that? It takes 48 hours for vegetation to pass through an herbivore's body. Our food passes for it in 24 hours. That's half the time. We have a digestive tract that is two and a half times smaller than all herbivores. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule. So we only have 2%. We can get 2% from vegetables. That's not much protein or fat at all. So, vegetables aren't for the human body. Like I said, they interfere with digestion of your animal foods. Because they create alkaline fluids that neutralize your alkaline bacteria and your hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid has to be highly acidic. Like a 5.2 to a 4.9. You have a vegetable matter in your intestines, all of a sudden it goes up to a 6. Guess what? Hydrochloric acid no longer dissolves in the big particles of food. If you ate ground meat, mainly like I do, where you take it and rip it in very small pieces. I do that because I have no hydrochloric acid in my stomach. If you ate chopped meat all the time, you would just mix around your mouth to get the bacteria going in it, but you wouldn't need much hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid and most of your digestive enzymes are to break down the larger particles of food so the bacteria can infiltrate and digest it. So, bacteria is your main digester. Okay, let's start with the glands, going over most of the digestive tract. I'll go over the glands and organs and hit the liver, which is mainly the pancreas, which is mainly part of the digestive tract, by going over the organs and glands.

So, let's start off with the endocrine glands. Endocrine glands means that a part of the body which can produce, manufacture, synthesize, whatever you want to call it, hormones to be put directly into the blood. Those are endocrine glands. What are hormones? Hormones are mainly fat-based substances that can do unusually dramatic things. They can change chemistry in minutes, even seconds. So, they're very special, glands are very special parts of the body and they make up a very small part of this infrastructure. So, we have the pituitary gland and the brain. So, that dominates all glands in the body and it covers growth. Now, if you evaluate the glandular activity of an animal and tribal Indians that eat raw foods, guess what you don't find? You don't find any hormones with a trace in your blood. Well, why? Well, let's say somebody has attacked them. Then you tested what? [unintelligible], adrenaline and estrogen. Oh, my gosh! It was a dangerous situation. Body needed adrenaline to help fight or flight. So, endocrine gland system, hormones are for danger, for emergency purposes only. We shouldn't find it in the blood. We should only find trace amounts. That's it. That is in a normal, ideal environment on an ideal planet diet. People eat cooked food, you're exposed to pollution, you're all the time in an emergency situation with contamination in the body. So, your glands are going to be active. However, if you have a low hormonal, let's say you have low thyroid gland, that doesn't mean you should take thyroxine because the pharmaceutical industry and some doctors says, oh, you don't have any thyroxine. You need to take this or your thyroxine is way down to 2 or 3. And it should be up to 13, 14, 20, whatever they decide for their [unintelligible]. How many drugs they're selling, how much thyroid they're selling is how much they'll tell you to take. Well, this level means you have to take it. So, I will get some thyroid in here. So, the pituitary, what would it be in an emergency situation when the body would have to use growth hormone when the body is not reproducing cells the way it should be and you're eating a bad diet. Or at times in humanity when they were around a fire, all of their food sources and animals were destroyed. So, they'd go around and eat [unintelligible] food. All of a sudden, the children stopped producing their normal growth hormones in the same cycle. So, the pituitary kicks in, make sure they still grow. They may be smaller for that whole generation. It grows up like that. It may be five years before the animals are populated enough. Or they migrate to a different area, which is what they're supposed to do. Migrate to a different area where there are still animals. It is unnatural for humans to be homebound. We are a migratory animal that goes with the food. Now, this country used to be full of 80 million buffalo. Indians could stay areas and always know that the buffalo would travel through and around. Or the scouts would go out and find them and bring it back to the tribe. But they always made sure that they were mobile. They could be gypsy. Because that's the human nature. If a man, if the human body lives on animal matter, it has to go where animals are. 

If there are no animals present, then people start eating fruits and grains and nuts and cooking them, what happens? They gradually go into osteoporosis heavily and they start having diseases. Now, the black plague, what was the black plague? Well, the rats caused it. How do rats cause a black plague without killing themselves at the same time? Absurd. What happened in the early 1300s? King of England decided to sell coal. Coal. They mined the coal and sold it. Very expensive. And they outlawed people bringing logs and trees into the town to burn them as fuel for cooking with water, which is called having mercury, high levels of mercury. So people were cooking with mercury, poisoning their lungs. All the way from 1310 is when the British Parliament, or not Parliament at the time, the British Royalty, the Crown, forced everybody to buy coal and live on coal. So what happened? A hundred years later, the Black Plague. Lung problem. From coal. The King and Queen of England knew it. The Royalty knew it. And then after the Black Plague, they said, okay, we have to do something different. We have to make sure people have chimneys. We have to have an escape for the coal smoke so it didn't stay in the house and they absorbed it. But they certainly didn't tell the population that they were responsible for the Black Plague. They blamed it on rats. And that's why the pharmaceutical and medical community always blamed everything on organisms. Swine flu. Bird flu. Always blamed, Spanish flu. That was when they were trying to go against the Spanish. We had the Spanish flu, 1900s. Know what Spanish flu came from. It was the first internationally marketed flu vaccine. Only the people who got the flu vaccine died. The other people who got normal flu went through their little flu episode and it was gone. They didn't die. Everybody who got that first marketed flu vaccine, worldwide marketed, died. Everyone, not one person who got the injection survived. Did you hear about that? No. The Spanish flu caused it. No, the poison is in the vaccine. Okay, so we have the pituitary. You know the pituitary kicks in when the body doesn't produce its own reproductive hormones properly. And then the pineal gland. Who knows what that's for? You know, everybody says it's mystics say it's the seat of consciousness, but I don't know anybody advanced enough to know that. I don't know. So, then we go down to the tonsils. Wonderful glands there. Well, let's rip them out if they keep getting swollen. Now what do the tonsils do? The tonsils protect the brain from contamination. Why? In the fifties, it was in the fifties, everybody started getting tonsil disease. It would start, all the white blood cells would go to the tonsil, it's like the lymphatic, it's part of the lymphatic system, to break down toxins that normally would be transported to the brain, stops them there, has to break them down and then dump into the throat and mucus to get all this infection and swelling. What is contaminating the body to cause that reaction? 

Had to be something you were eating to cause that. What happened in 1945? We have world war two, 1942 all the way to 1945. What did Rockefeller and Rothschilds do? For more processed foods, canned food. The new craze, canned food. When you put an acidic processed food with preservatives in it, what's it going to do? It's going to leach metal from the cans. So you've got all this amalgam tin poisoning, metal poisoning. That's in the cell of these foods now that you're eating. Guess who never had tonsil problems? The kids on the farms that didn't eat canned foods. But everybody, my parents loved canned foods. My mom loved opening that can and dumping it into the bin. She didn't have to cut up the vegetables anymore. She didn't have to shop for them. She just bought a can. Didn't have to wash anything. Opened the can, dropped it into the pot, and cooked it. Loved it. But what did it do to the children? It gave them metal poisoning. And the tonsils were there to prevent the metal poisoning from the brain. But the brain, why the brain? Why the metal contamination has a tendency to go to the brain? Tendency to go to two places, bone marrow and the brain. Why? Because bone marrow and brain have the highest concentration of fat. Up to and beyond sometimes 60% of your brain. I'm not talking, I'm talking about the normal physiology, the content of the brain, excluding a lot of water, 80% of the brain, almost 80% of the brain. And of the nervous system, only about 40% of the nervous system. The rest is fat. Concentrations of fat. Comparison to protein and carbohydrate, the brain is 80%, 60-80% fat. We know that the body uses fats to bind with the poisons so they don't damage the system. White blood cells are fatty cells. Phagocytes. Why do they call them phagocytes? Because they eat. They eat decomposing dead cells. They eat organic tissue. To do what? To neutralize it so it's not a toxin. Just like bacteria and parasites and fungus can do. So, you have all of this fat in the brain. So, guess what the brain also uses? The brain and nervous system uses more metals than any other parts of the body. How does the brain work? It works with electricity and light. What is the conductor for electricity and light? Transmitting light. Metals. Reflective metals. So, you have all of this metallic contamination in the brain. Tonsils are trying to prevent it from these canned foods. And then other processed foods that they use metallic minerals, poisons, to preserve it. So, nothing can grow. So, it kills bacteria. It kills fungus. It kills anything. So, you're eating that in your cereals and everything else. So, of course, we have an epidemic of tonsillitis. Then what did they do? They came in the late 50s and early 60s and said, fat's bad for you, go on a fat-free diet. Tonsillitis, for the most part, stopped because the body didn't have tonsils. The tonsils didn't have the fat to operate on. The whole lymph system started shutting down. So, people started looking like that tennis player, King. Billie Jean King.

Can you imagine being that stiff like a robot? You're so dry and dehydrated, living on a carbohydrate, no-fat diet. Now she's fat. She learned. She's huge. But it took her through all that suffering and not being an athlete anymore. She could no longer function as an athlete because she went on a fat-free diet. Okay, then we have the next glands, near the throat. This must be pretty important. We have two thyroid glands, four parathyroids. You've got a backup for the backup for the backup for the backup for the backup for the backup for the backup. What is so important that your body would build six glands to keep something functioning? Two things, heart, lungs. If you fall out of a tree, you stop your heart from beating, you stop breathing, these hormones will spit out tremendously. Your thyroxine levels will sky high. You know, only doctors who see an injured person in an automobile accident or, you know, some kind of sports injury where, you know, they've been tackled by six people, badly damaged, do you see thyroxine levels that high. And you see most of these guys don't stop breathing because the thyroid has been working for them fine. You don't see any skinny football player. You don't see any skinny good athlete. They all have fat on them. Tennis players are not involved in, you know, brutal engagement with the ball, so they get away with it. But when you have contact sports, everybody's fat. Wrestlers are fat. You never see a skinny wrestler. You never see a skinny weightlifter. So, they have the fats. So, when that thyroid kicks in, if they get winded, they're breathing within a second, two seconds, from the thyroxine that's emitted. You don't have to worry about it. But people who've been fat, those thyroids will be the difference between them living and dying. So, it kicks in, lungs start working, heart starts beating, within a minute, two minutes maximum. If a person is very skinny and they've had that injury, they may never recover because they don't have any fats to build proper thyroxine anyway. But usually, the endocrine glands, the body protects the endocrine glands, and even if anything else is dry in the body, there will always be fats for the endocrine gland. It helps you live. So, again, emergency purposes only. Everything's for an emergency purpose when we're talking about the endocrine gland. Then we have the thymus. Now, it's right next to the lungs. Everybody thought, oh, it helps the lungs. We don't know how or why, but it helps the lungs. No, it doesn't. It helps digestion. Poisons get into the stomach, especially from vaccines, go to the stomach lining. Now, why would the body store the most toxic substances that can enter the body, through choice or not, into the stomach lining? The stomach lining manufactures and synthesizes hydrochloric acid that can dissolve bone, yet it doesn't dissolve itself. Pretty spectacular tissue, that stomach lining. So, it will take about 80% of an injection of mercury, aluminum, liquid mercury, lithium aluminum, ether, formaldehyde, and detergent fluids. That's five of the products in every vaccine. And even in the tiny trace amounts of, let's say, dimerosulfate, we're lying. It will go to the stomach lining and hold there, so your body doesn't die instantly.

Now, animals, herbivores, who Pasteur experimented with, do not have the same stomach lining. So, when I studied at the Sorbonne Institute in Paris and looked all over Pasteur's records, they had been translated in English, so I was able to read the English one. Not one, not one of the animals he ever injected the vaccine with survived, all died. So, all of a sudden, why 20 years later did it become a thing to sell? When Rothschilds and Rockefellers made a big lie and scared people into thinking that some disease was going to get them, he gives them a preventative for it. And you can't prevent. You can't prevent a disease that's not going to come. Do you know how the disease comes? You can prevent it, but an injection of poisons is never going to do it. But, all of the Homo sapiens have a stomach lining that cannot be destructed easily. So, the body puts the poisons there. However, it needs to get rid of them. So, a trace amount of every time you eat or drink, a trace amount of that poison enters your food and poisons your whole body in a slow way. So, the thymus is there to protect it. Now, that thymus used to be just a tiny little thing. In Lucy, that thymus was about this size, about the size of a sugar cube. Well, our thymus is now about this big. Right? Because all the poisons are going into the stomach. There's a backup fat secretion, a hormone secretion for the stomach and intestine. Emergency purposes. And, of course, we're constantly in an emergency. Every part of our body is constantly in an emergency because of the pollution. Then we have the pancreas. Now, the pancreas is considered both a gland and an organ. It puts insulin right into the blood, yet it puts other hormones and other enzymes directly into the intestines or other parts of the body. So, the pancreas is two very, very important gland organs. Now, we're told that the pancreas is to convert sugar through insulin into a storable sugar. Glucogen. Glycogen. So, glucose. However, if you look at the, if you take a tribe that doesn't eat any carbohydrates, like the Maasai, illegal to eat fruits in there. They're so skinny. They have no reserved absinthe. It was illegal in that tribe to eat fruits. So, they ate no carbohydrates whatsoever. So, what was the purpose of having a pancreas? And their pancreas is very small. Two and a half times smaller than us. It's because the pancreas is the architect of the body. When it takes in a food, it analyzes its structure. Every food is different. Food grown in different soil, animals grown eating different foods. Every food is different. That's why if you go out on a wild farm and you taste everything, a tomato on the same vine, everyone will taste differently. If it's, you know, if it's a natural, what do they call, heirloom. If it's an heirloom plant. Every fruit, even a berry will taste different than another berry. There will be that fine distinction. Most people don't have the flavor buds anymore to detect it but that's the way it used to be. When I was a child, I noticed the difference. I'd get all of the, you know, get a lot of apricots off the same tree.

Each one of them tasted differently. Remarkably different. And my parents didn't have that same ability. Oh, it all tastes the same. Tastes like an apricot. Yeah, but this one tastes like maybe it's a walnutty. It was in my head, because I had a picture of a walnut in there, you know. And like a honey that Cohen's have, that Brandon Cohen has. He's got some hives in the back. The honey has a taste, and it's an unusual honey. These were collected just around in the area. It tastes slightly like pecan, I mean walnut, with, let's see, what was it? Butterscotch. Phenomenal honey. Every honey I have, fifty honeys in storage at home, every one of them tastes remarkably different. So, we've lost all that tasting ability. In the pancreas, the pancreas registers every food ingredient, how to restructure it to make the human cells. How to restructure it for when the bacteria completes its job in eating it, is those nutrients absorb and are made into the human body properly for the human cells. Either functionality or reproduction of cells. Now, this is the job of the pancreas. It's a multi-level job. And it does it phenomenally. So, that, I need to just drink it, it's getting very dry. So, the pancreas is a very, very, very important organ gland. Now, since we've become a carbohydrate eater, a lot of grains, breads, and cereals, and food made with cereals, and soy products, and all this garbage that's high in carbohydrates, the pancreas is now two and a half times larger than Lucy's and these tribes who have a small pancreas. Two and a half times larger because of our grain and carbohydrate consumption. So, you want to know why, as we get older, we just keep getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger? Because we're not eating a diet that's natural to the system. Now, when I started eating this diet, I remained as big as he was for a very, very long time. Because I needed to reabsorb those fats and readdress the body. So, the pancreas isn't [unintelligible]. Then we have the gonads. In women, they produce the egg that the sperm goes into and become a human. In the man, we have the testicles that produces the sperm that enters the egg and produces it. Now, those, you'll go around normally with high testosterone. Unless, in animals, unless the woman is, the female is in heat. She's producing her eggs. Then a man, through smell, all of a sudden his testes start working, he produces testosterone to get active. And to impregnate those eggs, that one egg. In us, it's one egg. In the other animals, it can be from three to twelve, or two to twelve, offspring. So, that's the way it works. It's always in an unusual circumstance. We shouldn't have testosterone all the time. We shouldn't be going around masturbating every day like I did as a kid, you know, five times a day. That's unnatural. All males in all species, only when the female goes into heat, does the man get horny. That's the way it is. Except in domesticated animals who have dead toxic food, just like humans are. And you'll find dogs going around humping at trees and lampposts and anything, a person's leg. 

You feed them right and all of a sudden they stop that behavior after a year or two. It doesn't happen automatically. You don't go on this diet and everything works all the time. It takes time. Forty years. So, we've been taking care of the endocrine glands. Now let's go over the lymphatic glands. I've talked about what the lymphatic glands stand for and where they are concentrated. Now normally the lymphatic glands get their food directly from the lacteal system. When you digest everything, the bacteria finish digesting everything, it's a milky substance. That's why we call it lacteal. So, it's a web network that comes out of both the small and large intestines. As it absorbs into the lacteal system and it's delivered to the lymphatic system, it turns it into a translucent milky appearance. Like milky mucus. Slightly milky mucus. Then the lymphatic system is supposed to deliver that food to every cell in the body. It doesn't today. They're trying to feed it through the bloodstream. The lymph system is no longer feeding the body anymore. The lymph system had a double job. It was all supposed to clean everything. It was supposed to take waste products. It was supposed to break it down and then dump it in between the skin and the muscles to perspire it out of the body. Ninety percent of all toxins are supposed to leave through the skin. Ninety percent. If you wonder why you have an acne, why you have rashes, you should be happy. You know the poisons are leaving that way. Eat right. Feed your skin from the outside to help protect it from those contaminants, from all that industrial pollution that's already in your body, to get out of your body. If you don't have rashes and all that, that means the body is trying to dump most of it out the intestines or storing it in the body. If it's doing it out the intestines, that means it's damaging your food production, your digestion, your food absorption, and you're going to get weak. If it's going into your body and storing, you are going to get cancer or some other severe disease, period. So you've got to have skin rashes unless you know how to deal with them. I can't even stop. I had a bout of a rash here that lasted for three weeks, scabbing and itching and crazy. The coconut cream on it had burned, so I had to just put butter on it. Then I got five skin tumor cancers here and then four over here and present a tumor right at the top of the incision. They had done that when I was 20 years old.´I'm almost 63 now. So that tumor was developing. Three week cycle, all gone, everything gone. That was a product breaking down. Now, usually I would think I thought it was chemo coming out, because that's the way chemo usually comes out of my system, up here all through the chest and here. But here it was just concentrated here. And there was no odor from the chemotherapy that I had had, which was basically the Freon that they did, and the AZT, which was poisonous, and the Aldol, the year after they gave it to me, as too toxic for cancer therapy. And then all of a sudden I smelled and tasted the smoke tars.

And it went on for days, and I thought, ah, I've been smoking from age 8 to 24. All that smoke tar started breaking out, created that odor, and set up in my lungs. It did it in the skin, where it could handle it easily. If I had to do that in the lungs, my lungs would have been filling with water, I would have had issues and a lot of problems. But it did it out the skin. I'm sure I have scars from it. I have scars from all that. You see the scars. From all that, those little white spots, they'll go away. Eventually, coconut cream on there will dissolve it slowly, gradually, and they'll go away. But I handled it without any traumatic event, except for that itching that would drive me crazy, until I put butter on it, and butter on it calmed it pretty quickly. And you can always put butter on your body. You know, put primal facial body care cream on your body. If you don't like, you know, if you use butter like I do sometimes, I went into a, I was going to a board of supervisors meeting, and I had just butter on my skin. And there was a group of people talking around, I wasn't far from them, and I was waiting for somebody to leave the main building, and this was in a foyer, this building. Somebody said to me, who's got the butter cookies? Who's got the butter cookies? It made them very hungry. I didn't say a word, I knew where it was coming from. It's not a bad thing, but you might be eaten. [unintelligible] butter, coconut cream in the food, and coconut oil, and those things, so you don't smell just like butter. You might smell like some tropical food. It might be a little bit better for you. But, butter is probably the easiest to assimilate and protect yourself. So, put it on those areas where you've got rash, unless there's more itching. If you put butter on it, and there's more itching and more hives, you have to release it. It's not perspiring in that area, and the fats will block it. So, you put tomato, like I say in the book, the tomatoes or cucumber, rub those into it. You know, mash the cucumber juice and rub that on it, if you will. Or the tomato slices were better. So, to soothe the itching of hives. 

Q: Aloe vera?

A: Aloe vera doesn't work very well in that kind of situation, but it's pretty good. Not as good as tomato and cucumber will. If you use the cucumber and tomato first, and then use the aloe vera, that's better. So, your aloe vera dries, harder. The cucumber doesn't dry like that, nor does the tomato. It doesn't dry to a scaly-type film like aloe vera does. The others are a little bit better. And, of course, you could put butter on top of that. Once you cool down the itching and neutralize by the fluids in the cucumber and the tomato, you've neutralized. I had a case of hives one time that was so bad that one hour I would rub the cold tomato slices on, the next hour it would be the cold cucumber, and then it would be the butter. And then every hour I'd have to alternate all three of those. And that was for two days. Also I got into a hot bath, like I recommend in the book, for hives, the tomato, you know, in water and vinegar. Now, you can use vinegar on it too. It'll help neutralize some of those poisons that cause the itching, but also cause more dryness and more scaling and maybe scabbing. But still, it's something to use if you have nothing else. I would just put the vinegar on, let it sit for no more than ten minutes, then rinse it off with some milk and then just leave milk on it and it'll be a good way to neutralize any kind of poison that's coming to your skin. Shaving guys, nothing better to shave with than milk. And what about milk? I used to use egg, I used to use coconut cream. I used coconut cream and I never, ever cut myself. And I had no coconut cream and I had to use something. I didn't have any eggs at the time and my beard was like yours is and I needed to shave because I was about to do a workshop and I wanted to be shaved and I had nothing but milk and I was on the airplane. So I said, okay, try the milk. It's the easiest shave I'd ever had. With the coconut cream I had to have hot water to get the whiskers that would get into the blades and take it out to where I couldn't shave anymore. You took hot water, no hot water, on an airplane. You know? And here I was shaving with cold water, rinsing it with cold water, the milk. It was a breeze. Now I use milk. Unless I don't have milk, I'd still use coconut cream. But milk is the easiest and the best. You can rinse the blades, and women too, with milk. You just rinse it with cold water. You don't have to have the hot water. For me, going to Asia a lot, you don't find hot water anywhere except in the shower. And that's rare too. Because you don't need hot water over there. Everybody wants to be cool from all the heat. So even in the showers, you very rarely find any hot water in any houses. So where was I? I was talking about the glands, the lymph glands cleaning the system. Feeding and cleaning the system. We know they don't feed it now. So they mainly detoxify. Now why are people not, people will start collecting tissue like this under the skin and in the tissue. Why does the lymph system get blocked like that where it's not perspiring out on a daily basis? Because vegetable oils.

We were told 30 or 40 years ago that animal fats cause heart congestion, heart disease, and arteriosclerosis. Hardening of the artery. Absolute fallacy. All the tribes in the world that eat mainly meats, even if they cook them, have no arteriosclerosis at all. No heart disease. So it's a lie. Then they put vegetable oils in everything because it's cheaper. They don't have to raise the animal. They don't have to butcher the animal. They don't have to put all the kerosene that they use, the kerosene byproducts, to purify the fat. They can just go into a plant, press it, clean it in an instant with chemicals, and it's done. So, a lot of that margarine crap nonsense, eat margarine. Animal fats will cause disease, cause heart attack. Absolute lie. Just the opposite. Your vegetable oils will cause hardening of the system. Why? Because we don't digest vegetable oils properly. Nut oils, seed oils, we don't digest them properly. Vegetable oils are the worst. Safflower oil is terrible. What happens in the human body is it doesn't digest it properly. In an herbivore, if an herbivore eats them, it has a body temperature of 101 to 105 degrees. It can keep vegetable oils fluid at that body temperature. Ours, 98.6 or lower. What happens to vegetable oil? It crystallizes, hardens in the human body. First, it takes on a nature like refrigerated margarine, refrigerated butter, or refrigerated olive oil. What happens? It turns solid. Then water separates from it. Then it becomes a crystallized substance. So, if your body has used those oils as its structure, as its fat supply, it hardens, it blocks. Now the lymphatic system cannot help you dump out the skin, where 90% of the poisons are supposed to leave. So, it tries to dump out the urinary tract, out the bowels. And what does that do? That poisons your digestive environment and your urinary tract. Why do you think so many women and so many men get urinary infections? It's not a natural process in the body. So, you've got to melt these things to get them out of the body. You've got to melt that lymphatic system. And you have to do that between 102 and 108 degrees. You have to get into like a hot tub with a controlled temperature that you can regulate right around 104, 105 degrees. 108 if you can take that temperature. And sit in it for 45 minutes just to get rid of the waste under the skin. You see this under the skin? Everybody see this? How much toxin she has under the skin? Now, that's in some fat, but it's hardened toxic fat where [unintelligible]. You see how much I have? Women should have a little bit more than I do, but this is what it should be like. You should be clean under there. If your lymphatic system is working properly. If your skin is working properly for the first firing. So, the lymphatic system, when it's finished, it dumps its waste under the skin for the first firing.

So, 45 minute baths every day, 45 minute baths, will help gradually break that in and melt it and get it out of the body. Then, after you do that, you get that freed up. So, now she can go right into using a deeper bath because she doesn't have all that waste. Her skin is perspiring properly. Hers is just like mine, only she should have a little bit more fat. She needs to be very athletically inclined. So, she can go down and break her deep lymphatic congestion where the lymph glands are hardened and all of that toxic, crystallized fat needs to be melted so her system can flow better and she can become an even better athlete. You have to stay in the bath 60 to 90 minutes to do that. Then you might want to keep the temperature down to 104 so you can last that long. Also, take a movie in with you and watch a movie because you won't be able to stay in the water easily. Also, take a bowl of cold water, put it in the refrigerator, put some ice cubes in it, and a washcloth. So when you're in there, you say, put that on the top of your head, only on the top of your head because you need to perspire out your neck. Put it on the top of your head, not on your forehead either because perspire out the forehead better than anywhere else. Put it right on the top of your head and breathe slowly and deeply and that will all cool your system. When your brain gets too hot, that's when your body reacts. You just need to cool your brain, cool the top of your head, and then that will all go away and you'll be able to stay in the bath. So you may have to do that every five minutes. Even if you're somebody with high blood pressure, then you may need to do it every three minutes, every two minutes. So, lymphatic system is very important. Now, what other fluid systems do we have in the body? We have the blood stream. We have red and white blood cells. What are those red and white blood cells supposed to do? The job is supposed to be ultra-simple. Red blood cells carry oxygen, so the fat cells in the body can be used as energy. Energy. That's all the red blood cells are supposed to do. All the blood stream is supposed to do. Then the white blood cells, as the carbon dioxide gets into the red blood stream, the white blood cells eat the carbon dioxide, and any dead tissue of the red blood cell dies, the phagocytes of the white blood cells eat it. So the blood doesn't get contaminated. It's a natural process. And a white cell, a blood cell can get very large, and when it dies, it goes to the lymphatic system to break down. Or we may urinate it or dump it out in our feces without having to be broken down. Because we have many exit points directly from the blood into the bowels and the urinary tract. So, that's part of the blood stream. Now, when you look into the blood stream, we find all this lymph, this lacteal. Why?

Because the lymphatic system is so jammed, we're having to feed every cell through the blood stream. A hundred years ago, before we had all this contamination, when people ate all raw milk and nothing but, and lots of raw foods because cooking was a chore. I remember looking at the workers on my farm, you know, my grandparents' farm, in the 40s and 50s. These farmers were so rugged. They ate only, you know, the raw dairy. That's all they had. They'd eat corn right out of the field. Raw corn. And raw meat. You know, they'd be so hungry just to eat it. They didn't want to wait for it to be cooked. And they would take these bales over 60 to 90 pounds, and they would throw them up into a loft that was 12 feet high, just to the bottom of the loft. So they'd throw them 15 feet high, throwing them up with one hand at a time. Now you see a farmer who's on a crap diet, and you see he has a forklift. And you see him lifting a bale that's only 30 pounds, and he's going like this to struggle. It isn't like it used to be. We are very sick and weak because our bloodstreams are feeding the body instead of just doing the oxygen and your dioxide exchange. The body does not function well by all these changes. Then we have the neurological fluid. Now what is [unintelligible]? We talked a little bit about that. The transmission of electricity and light. Keep the body and how it works, just like electricity uses it and we don't understand how it works. You have thought processes. Now how does the thought process and the body stay in communication? To have motor responses, we need to be able to do all of this, even talk. How does that all work? We don't know. But it involves metallic minerals and this exchange of light and electricity. And that's what the fluid system and the nervous system is all about in the brain. And it uses minerals. Now if those minerals come from an isolated, where you've cooked it and you've fractionated that metal from the other bonds that it has, with vitamins and proteins and fats and carbohydrates, and there are carbohydrates in the system, and it has that combination of all of the vitamins and all of the nutrients, it's an asset. It doesn't become a free radical toxic substance. But when it is, it is a toxic substance. Aluminum can work very well for transmitting light. So if you have aluminum like in strawberries and other foods that are high in aluminum, that's a good thing because it's in a natural raw food. But when you get it from an injection like vaccine with the liquid aluminum in it, what does it cause? It causes Alzheimer's and malfunctioning. What does aluminum do in a fluid system? Drop liquid aluminum into an aquarium, and what happens? Fish hit the bottom and no longer swim. Aluminum in the brain fluid, synapse fire, doesn't go anywhere.

Aluminum stops the transmission of data, Alzheimer's, all kinds of mental, you lose the thought. It's either low glucose in your brain or you've got aluminum, high aluminum in here. If you take an egg and suck an egg, and your mind comes right back, there's low blood sugar, glycogen for the brain. If it doesn't work right away, it's aluminum in your brain causing the inability to recall the thought or the word or the sentence and to remember. Normally, I bring eggs in the meeting and I forgot to put them up here, and I'm due to suck an egg right now.

Q: I have one from a famous Noah [unintelligible].

A: Oh, please. Absolutely. He grows them the way I like. Now, normally, I say shells aren't good for you because you don't digest them, but that was a prejudicial viewpoint, because I have no hydrochloric acid. He gave me one. Thank you. So, I found that with some people experimenting, not from my viewpoint at all, but started eating eggshells, and they had like three cavities that all mended in four weeks. Eating the eggshells, but from chickens that have no soy. No soy. These were Amos eggs, eggshells. So, I'm going to eat this eggshell later. Oh, let's show you the way to eat the egg. So, you don't have to wash the glass. You know, you can eat Rocky style, break it through glass and down it, the way Rocky did. And then you wipe your mouth like this, it doesn't work. It's the macho guy. So, if you want to take it right out of here, so you don't have to wash your glass, you want to fracture the eggshell at the bottom, the fat end. This is the smaller end, this is the fat end. So, you don't want to break a hole in it, because then you have to hold your finger over it, it could drip all over and make a mess. So, you take your eye tooth and you hit it on here to fracture it. See, no hole and lots of fracture. Everybody see that? Then this end, you take the eye tooth and you hit it down, so it makes a hole. Everybody see that? There's a hole. Then you hold it down like this, and there's a little fecal matter in there for E. coli. Getting the bacteria in it and sucking the egg white first. If you suck gently, only the egg white will come out first. And when the egg white goes in first, you'll digest the egg yolk quickly. Otherwise, it's a slow process. Because I suck, see the reason for dipping this in? Because you've got a membrane in there. It's like the sac around the baby inside a woman. It's got a membrane in there. If you don't, you can suck on that all day and it's not going to come out. But the membrane will move with your sucking. And also you'll be able to get all the matter out of it. If you don't break that, and you end up, you're going to break it open, you're going to find the egg yolk and the white inside there, most of the egg yolk that you haven't consumed stays inside in that membrane. So, I've gotten almost all of the egg white out. So now I'm just going to turn it upside down. See that membrane? Sucked right through. You see any egg in there at all? Not a bit. So I got all of it. Now I don't have to wash a glass. Me too. And this is organic, you can throw it anywhere. I mean, not on the pavement, but anywhere. It'll break down and feed your system. I'm saving that for me to eat.

Q: How are you going to eat the shell?

A: I will crush it and then wash it down with milk. Normally I will put it in a blender and blend it into a powder, and then we'll digest better because I don't have the hydrochloric acid. Most of you have plenty of hydrochloric acid. You wouldn't have to do that, but that would be better. But I want some right now because I've got a Amos egg. Okay, so what time is it now? How long have I been going on? I know. What time did we start the second round?

Q: It's been about two hours.

A: Since we had the break?

Q: Yeah.

A: I'm sorry. Somebody's going to have to remind me because I can go on six, seven hours without stopping. As you see me, I'll suck some milk and egg here and there. But you haven't been. So let's take a break. Fifteen minutes.

[chatter]

Q: Awesome. Well, he'll be in Sedona if you want a road trip.

Q: You guys want one of these?

Q: Sure. Sure.

A: Somebody had cavities, they did that, and it healed the cavities. I've got five people reported to me.

Q: So what do you think is in the shell?

A: Because I haven't had anybody over 24 years old repair a tooth. Now I think that there's an answer.

Q: But how much? Because it would be easy for us to do too much, right?

A: They were doing like three a week only.

Q: Well, maybe you could brush your teeth with egg shells.

A: It is very fine if you do it, but it's very abrasive.

Q: Yeah, with the chunks.

A: No, I mean, even if you broke it up, it would be too much. Still like glass. Yeah.

Q: Is it better to just eat it?

A: Yeah. Eat it. And also, you know, you have your clay and either butter or coconut cream. That'll polish your teeth completely.

[chatter]

A: I used to have big ones too, but the orthodontist drilled them down. It took four of my teeth out. It pulled my whole mouth together, so my mouth is too small for my tongue. So I lisped from the age of 15, when I put the braces on and took the teeth out, until I was like 24, 25. I went into the acting business, and they said, you lisp. There's no way you can work. So I thought, how can I make it different? I didn't do a lot, but I did it. So I said, oh, I know how to do it. Membrane right here. That used to be way out to the end of the tongue. I took a scissor and went snip. And my tongue moved away from my teeth, so I no longer lisp. It grows back about every ten years, so I'll snip it again. I snipped it two years ago. Again. You take a very sharp professional hair shears. They're used for cutting hair. Very sharp. Snip like this. Put a little ice on it. On the first snip, it doesn't bleed. Pretty quick. Okay, are we ready? Okay, so we talked about the pancreas. Now, the liver. Now, the liver is supposed to do one thing. It's supposed to manufacture bile, and bile is used to digest fats. It says that we have 60 varieties of bile that can be produced by the liver if it's fed properly. If we feed our bodies properly, and 60 varieties of cholesterol that will be made from those 60 varieties of bile. So, a third of them will be used to cleanse the body. A third to strengthen and stabilize the body. And a third will be used to burn as energy, or to utilize, transform into energy. The liver makes bile. That's its sole purpose, to make bile. A third of them is for energy, a third for cleansing, and a third for stabilizing and protecting the body. That bile that is made, again, I say it depends entirely upon the fats that you produce, and proteins. You can eat all the fat and butter in the world. If you don't eat a protein, the body is only going to assimilate about 20% of the butter. So, you've got to make sure that you eat protein with your fat, and fat with your protein. It works both ways. So, the liver will send the bile to the gallbladder. The gallbladder does one thing. It stores bile. It sends it to the duodenum when fat moves into the stomach. So, it's there ready to enter the fat, to break it down, so the bacteria can eat it. Puts it into a substance that makes it very rotten. That's why when you see rotten fat, that you can eat it without any problems. Because it's the same thing the bile does to it. It allows bacteria to go in and infiltrate and break it down, so that we can absorb it. Fat that isn't broken down with bacteria, you can't digest. So, the bile prepares it for the bacteria to be able to absorb it in the body. So, the gallbladder, its sole job is to deliver bile to the stomach and the intestines. The spleen is over here, right beside the pancreas, and it does what? It stores red and white blood cells. Its purpose is to store red blood cells, not white blood cells. But with all the illness we have, and the problems with manufacturing and reproducing red and white blood cells, that our body will store excess white blood cells even in the spleen. So, let's say we were swinging around in the trees, and we fell and a branch and cut the jugular vein. And we lost three cups of blood for clotting. We would be a meat. We would be dinner for some tiger or whatever, because we couldn't run.

We wouldn't be able to transport enough oxygen to the muscles to run or climb or whatever to get away from the animal that was pursuing us for dinner, or lunch, or breakfast, or whatever we were going to be. So, the spleen dumps the blood right back into the bloodstream once the clot is done. Clot's finished, spleen starts dumping its blood reserve into the bloodstream. No longer anemic. You have just as much energy as you've had and lost the blood. But, you're now deficient in red blood cells, and your body has to make up for it. Red and white blood cells are reproduced in the bone marrow only. A lot of doctors say when your blood reproduces in the spleen, it does never reproduce in the spleen. The body takes the mature cells from the bone marrow, whether they're red or white, when they mature, it sends them into the bloodstream. If it has an excess, take it into the spleen. Now, usually not white blood cells. People are so contaminated that the body's usually infusing all the white blood cells, invading the intestinal tract because of all the poisons that you eat, and the cooked food. There's a doctor who showed that leukocytosis occurs when you eat cooked foods. Up to a third, he said in one person, even half of the white blood cells left the bloodstream and enter the intestine to handle the toxicity. He called it leukocytosis. So, not a good thing. If you're eating cooked foods and the body's sending out white blood cells, which are phagocytes, that deal with toxins and waste, that's a sign we shouldn't be eating cooked foods. With people eating cooked foods, a lot of the white blood cells are getting into the intestines. And then they become food too. So, fat, fatty food, combined with the toxins. So, there's a whole chain reaction that goes on when you eat cooked food. So, then we have the, what else? What other gland do we have that I didn't talk about? I think I covered them, didn't I? Okay, so we have the muscle tissue. Everybody knows how the muscle tissue functions. There are fibers that allow for shrinking and expansion to allow us to lift things and carry things. And the more fat in the muscles, the stronger a person is. Again, like I said before, if you want strength, look to the people who are strong. You never see a skinny person who's very strong. Except in the ant community. They are very strong and very skinny. But if you break them open, what is their entire fluid system? It's all fat. They're skinny, but it's all fat. Roaches are the same way. It's all liquid fat inside. And all women are used to eating roaches. All women have been eating roaches for a very long time. Roach guts. Every one of you. Especially the older ones. You know why? Lipstick was made out of roach guts up until 10 years ago, 12 years ago. It was the only substance that they could get to adhere to the lips. It wasn't toxic, it was non-toxic. Now they don't give a shit. Now all of it is made with chemicals and they don't care what it does to you. But all lipstick had been made from roach guts. There was, I visited one laboratory, and the laboratory was a mile long shells of roaches.

And then they just put them into a vat, they cause them to die by heat, and then they would crush them. And all this white fluid would come out of the roach, crush the roach and you got white fluid. And that's what you used as lipstick. And they put a solidifier in it, a polymer in it, to seal it so it would stay on your lips. That was used until 12, 15 years ago. Now it's all chemical. So you've eaten roach guts a long time. And that didn't poison you, and I didn't worry about kissing a woman with lipstick then. Now I won't do it. Lipstick, you won't get a kiss from me. Because it's all poison, it's all chemical. Even with kerosene in it, formaldehyde. People are eating that stuff all day long. What my patients do is they take berries, and you mash the berries. And you can change the color, you take blackberries, or blueberries, or beet juice. And you put the blackberries in the beet juice, or the blueberries in the beet juice. And you get a purple out of it. If you use just the red, then you get that. If you break it down with a light, like a white berry, like a mulberry, then that will lighten it to a pink. And then when you put it on, it stains. It gets in so you can't lick it off. So your lips stay bright and happy unless you lick your lips a lot. And then after many, many hours, you will fade it out. But it stays for hours and hours, even the whole day. And you can rosy your cheeks up the same way. You can make all kinds of different colors. Dilute it with a little water and put it on. So it's very easy to make makeup in an easy, special way. Very easy. And you just get a good paintbrush and put it on because you don't have the stick to do it anymore. You have to paint it. Okay, that pretty much covers the body, you know what the bones are. So you can stand up and you're not a worm on the floor.You know, and you don't have that shell on the outside like ants. So our structure to be able to be firm and pivotal is the bone structure. And everything depends upon what you eat, period. Baby doesn't grow on osmosis. Baby grows on milk. And we eat other things as we get older. As I said, we are built to eat animal products, period, in our entire system. But maybe with 2% vegetation, vegetable juices, and 5% fruit. Now, during the summer months when it's hot and perspiring a lot, you can eat more fruit than that, but try to always eat a fat before. Now, when I talk about fats, I'm going to talk about them a little bit more thoroughly now. Fats are your major source of energy. You get two and a half times more calorie from fats than you do from protein and carbohydrate. Again, that's why you wrestlers, you weightlifters, that's your bodybuilder. But all of those people who are in rough sports, high active, high energy, or high contact sports have to be fat. They need protection. You look at those wrestlers. I mean, that's all a show. They have a, they're trained, when somebody's slipping, they know how to put their body in a way so their fat will catch them and the fat will protect them. But they do amazing stunts. I mean, that's more than a gymnast does. These guys take battery all day long in that ring.

And then they're practicing an exercise. And you don't see them bruised very often. You see boxers bruised because that's the face. But very rarely do you see it bruised along the body because of all the fat there unless it's a skinny person. In Thailand you'll see a lot of bruises because there's no fat on these Thai boxers. So you'll see bruises throughout the body after a match. So fat is so important. Like I said earlier, fat arrests the toxins in your body. If you have no fat, you have no protection. So the poisons are going to go intercellularly where there is fat. And it's going to do some damage to the cells. So you've got that. Now you can say to me, Aajonus. Damn, you're not fat. You can have a glimpse of a six-pack there. I'm only 5'7 3 quarters. I'm 165 pounds. On a chart, I should be 147. I've got a lot of fat in me. I've got a lot of dense tissue in me. If I get on the scale that measures fat, I'm at 18% body fat. Athletes who look like me only have 7 to 10% body fat. If you're eating raw fats for as long as I have, since February of 72, your fat molecules are tiny. When you eat a cooked fat, it swells 5 to 50 times its normal size. You see pork rinds. What happens when it's raw? That thing is very thin and flat. Then you boil it and what happens? It swells up and you've got this crispy, swollen fat molecule all over you. Blown up fat cells. That's what happens when you cook fats. So I am very concentrated with fat. You just don't get to see it. Because it's in my body solid. When I first got onto the diet, especially eating lots of raw dairy and raw meats, I stayed like him for years. 10, 12 years. After the poison mushroom, I got huge for a while. I had to get all those poisons out of my body and get it back together. So I think everybody should get fat for a while. If you haven't had a baby, 12 years. I have some women who have had even babies after 12, 14 years. Slim as slim can be. Less condensed fat as I am, in fact more. 20, 22% fat. When a woman should be really 50%, 30%, she's on a toxic diet. But she is on the diet all this time. She's been on the diet like 20, 22 years now. And she eats a tremendous amount of fats like I do. Like this morning, last night I ate probably 4 tablespoons of butter. This morning I ate 4 tablespoons of butter. I don't exercise. I don't exercise. My mouth and doing this, you know, is exercise. I carry my groceries once a week and walk from the car to the airplane. That's my exercise. I do nothing strenuous. Well, I just bought a farm where I'm climbing a mountain. So, it's a very steep way to go up there. And I'm helping them cut brush and stuff like that in the jungle. So, I am doing a little exercise, but that's only when I'm there and for a few days at a time. And I'm withstanding it very easily. I've got guys 35 and 30 years old who are working for me. And, you know, the heat and everything is bothering them. The younger ones, you know, they do it better than I. But I'm 63 years old. 63 and a half. So, I handle it very easily. All that fat. But they still complain of the heat. I don't complain of the heat and I don't complain of the cold. 

You know, when I was a child, I complained of both. But you can be fat, eventually, without looking like it. But right now, most people won't have to look like it. You're healthier because you have defense. You're not as healthy, you are in between. You're pretty good. You're very good. You're excellent. You know, so, you're pretty good. You're very bad. You're okay, but not really. You're not so good. 

Q: 90% of my diet is fat.

A: Yeah. But you're assimilating with that. You're getting better. You're okay. Eat some more. You're bad, you're bad. You go to the back of the class. But you're very good. So, fat is so important. I can't tell you how important fat is in the body. Okay. Carbohydrates, as I said, when we're going through the digestive tract, we need very little of them. According to several doctors who studied energy production, in the citric acid cycle of utilizing fuel, whether the fat was made from a carbohydrate as an acetone or it was made from a protein as an acetone, or whether it was a cholesterol made from good animal fat. Always it burned, eighty percent of that energy was produced from fat. Fifteen percent from pyruvate, which is made from protein sugar, made from protein. Five percent either citric acid from certain kinds of fruit or carbohydrates from certain kinds of fruit. So, only five percent were necessary. Five percent. So that's why I only eat one fruit a day. If I'm in the tropics and I've been climbing my mountain and working out a lot, I may eat, you know, a whole section of watermelon this big in the day. Not all at one time. I'll break it into thirds and eat a little at a time. So I'm eating like a cup and a half of absorbable water. One hundred percent absorbable water. Not water. So, or I'll go into my waterfalls and I've got a whole stream of waterfalls going down the property this way. Got a very big piece of property, 108 acres there. So it's got, it's a whole kilometer long, half a kilometer wide. And I've got a whole bunch of waterfalls going all around the back. And I feed my water system with that. And then a huge river of waterfalls coming down on the north side of the property. So I've got them on three sides of my property. I've got water, waterfalls. And sometimes I decide I don't want to eat a lot of water. I can bring it with me. I'll go in the waterfall and just wade in the waterfall. And my body cools itself. And then I don't have to drink water. Weirdest thing. So it must be absorbing something to the skin. But the skin seems to be able to do it better. And I don't have to dilute my digestive juices, which I prefer. So there are other ways you can handle it. So the citric acid cycle, only 5% carbohydrates necessary. But when I do prescribe a lot, I will eat watermelon if I can get it. And then it's tropics, you can always get watermelon. It's one of the best. Now for you guys, if you have any potency problems or erection problems, erectile dysfunction, in the watermelon, can I use this cup? If you get fortunate enough to have rind this thick, there's an active ingredient called, as long as it's good for the other nutrients, it's called citrulline. And it's like a Viagra, a natural Viagra. So, if I eat all of this, like I did last night, you know, all of the rind, I had an erection from the time I went to sleep to the time I woke up. So, pardon? The white, not the green. I'll eat the green, the white part. It will also affect women in the same type of way. It causes erection in the clitoris.

If you pickle it, it doesn't work. I mean, it'll work a little bit, but not as well. And I usually don't eat the heart because there's too much carbohydrate. I'll eat from the seeds down all the way through the white. And I actually eat almost to the green, but not quite. Maybe, you know, maybe a tenth of a millimeter down to the green. So, it works very well. So, that's just a little tidbit for you guys. Because you don't want to go to any of those viagra type ingredients. Because in the laboratory animals, they don't put this in the leaflet anymore. But when they first came out on the leaflet, it said a certain part of the animals had a certain disease. So, I looked at it. I never heard of the disease before. I looked it up. It only happens in laboratory animals that are given experimental chemicals. And it's penile deterioration. Where you completely dissolve your penis and it disappears. How does that happen?

Q: It's pretty cruel, too.

A: Yeah, tell me. Completely gone. You've then got a clitoris. So, it evolves from dick to that. So, what happens is, and that's why they say, when you have an erection over four hours, you get to a hospital. Why? Because you're bleeding. All those red blood cells get into the penis, and then they rot. Turn black and blue, and your penis falls off. Because the blood cells, as they decay, decay all the muscle with it. And all the veins, so the penis is gone. And they didn't tell you that it's like 13% of the animals suffer it. And these are healthier animals than you are.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It was for Viagra, it was for Cialis, it was for Pitrel, or wherever the other one is. Anyway, it was on all of them. And then, after a year, they took it off. They removed it. Because people like me were saying, hey, they went on radio. And they took it out. Rather than saying, yeah, that's the truth, they tried to hide it completely. Took it off the pant and the leaflets. So, not a good way to do it. There are other things that will help, too, and I mention those in the book. But the watermelon is the best. A doctor at Texas A&M is trying to breed genetically modified water rules to produce an extraordinary amount of it. Because when they separate the citrulline, they have to use so much of it to get it to work. If you just eat the rind, it works wonderfully. Because it's in the other ingredients that make it work properly. So you have to have phenomenal concentration. But they want a drug that they can make a lot of money. And there's no drug that's made more money than Viagra. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, but they don't tell them that's the reason. You say it's some other disease from some sexual disease. And everybody buys sexual diseases will disintegrate you. And that's a fallacy. It's not real. It's not contagious. Only sexual diseases that are contagious are yeast infections. They live on the skin. Fungus and yeast live on the skin. You can transmit that. But anything that lives in the tissues and the blood, you can't transmit it. I can implant it. I can take that disease, cut you open, and put it in there to seal you back up. And you'll have that disease. But you can't catch it from having sex. You can't catch syphilis. You can't catch gonorrhea. You can't catch AIDS. You can't catch HIV. None of those from sex. There are 236 couples, right around there, who have been together since the early 70s. One partner diagnosed with AIDS, who are still living. Well, most of them are still living. And they have a group and community. They realize that after using protection for like six or seven years, and once in a while doing without it, the other partner never got anything. So now they full-on have sex without any protection at all, and the other partner never gets it. The one partner who has it, all of the partners who've had it have had an injection. Either hepatitis B vaccine or they got a transfusion from somebody who had it. So, according to the book called BioAttack Alert, the man who studied AIDS, it was created at UCLA in 1961 to, so-called, to produce cancer laboratory animals so that they could study cancer. Absolute bullshit, because as soon as it produced what it did, they gave it to the military. They sidetracked it to the military. They put it, they experimented, and the military's been doing it to many populations in the United States since 1950s. You go online, you can see all the reports now that are coming out, because they have to release it. They're only allowed to keep it for 30, 35 years as national security. So you see all these reports coming out. They contaminated a million people in Mississippi and New Orleans area, and all throughout Canada, the United States, everywhere. So they decided that the undesirables to experiment on were homosexuals. So the homosexuals they found had a lot of cases of hepatitis. Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, and New York City. So they decided to put it in the hepatitis vaccine that was meant for those cities. So they did. So that's why 10% who got the vaccine were heterosexuals. So it was only 10% AIDS in heterosexuals. It's all documented. It's a bio-tackler book written by an attorney who tracked it down. Three months after he finished the book and it was published, and it was pulled off the rack, it's only available now through his brother, who's the doctor that found the whole disease and where it came from, the UCLA. It's been documented. But an attorney who wrote it, who's his brother, was dead within three months, and the Wisconsin senator who was going after the military about the AIDS thing. They were both dead in weeks of each other from so-called suicide.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: We'll save that for later.

Q: Okay.

A: So, you know, and then the smallpox vaccine contaminated with AIDS. Why do you think the United States and the British government gave them a billion dollars' worth of free vaccine? What happened from the AIDS? You can get a glimpse of it from reading Financial Hitman. You bankrupt a country and you take over their assets. So what they did was, the United States and Britain, together, worked to annihilate these countries' strength, took over all their mining, their jewels, their gold, everything, and put them in debt. Well, we've got the medicines to help you, but if we give you all this money, you will owe us, and, you know, you'll have to repay us. These countries don't have the industry to pay back. So, the United States and Britain took over 27 countries in Africa with the AIDS thing. 27 countries in Africa. By bankrupting them with the AIDS thing. So, they put it in the smallpox vaccine, donated it to them, and caused the AIDS epidemic. And then they did it with Ebola. Ebola is man-made, and you can look up the [unintelligible]. He's got several doctorates, biochemist, MD. Emerging viruses. Emerging viruses. And he explains how Ebola was created and how it was given to the Africans. So, let me tell you, all this contagious garbage is absolute nonsense. You cannot get a cold from somebody who's coughing. Sure a lot of people in a family will get a cold at the same time, because it's the season. Everybody detoxes. Detoxification is seasonal. When the climate's right, certain bacteria come out of hibernation. It's no more than like bears. Bears come out of hibernation in the United States first, then they come out of hibernation in Canada, then hibernation in Alaska. Is that contagious? No. It's hibernation. So, these bacteria, parasites, fungus go into hibernation. The whole system can be overloaded at once, although it should be as toxic as we are. But the body's smart. Some people can't handle. Some people are so toxic that it just completely takes them over. In a situation like that, death is probably the better thing, because you're not going to live a quality life after that. But some people would rather live poor quality than not at all. It doesn't make any sense to me. I wished I were dead the whole time. I was sick like these people. And I wished a thousand times a day that I was dead. I tried to commit suicide in every way you could imagine. And I learned back there again, I would still try. Now that I'm here and healthy, of course, I've got a great life. But when I was in that shape, everything was a problem. Pain was constant, day and night. Couldn't sleep, couldn't relax, couldn't be happy. Didn't have love, didn't have money. On the streets. Homeless, you know. All that stuff. It was not a happy situation. I didn't want to live. But, these things are climatical. They are cyclical.

So just because one person or everybody gets it in the family, doesn't mean it's contagious. Again, it's like the rooster crowing. The rooster always crows when the sun comes up. But does it bring the sun up? If this rooster stops crowing, does the sun not come up? People are so narrow minded and let the media and the bullshit, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry, get you to believing anything with a fraction of evidence. And it's so shallow. But they program it into you constantly. On these sound bites and TV and radio and literature. You just can't escape it. Okay, so bacteria, parasites, fungus, they are good, they construct and they destruct. If 90% of your body, 99, 90 to 99, I go with the 99% because the microbiologist that makes that statement, I like her word better. She still believes in the bad ones because she hasn't been taught that they're janitorial and they eat up dead or very toxic cells that are about to die. They don't feed on healthy tissue. Most people have a lot of degenerative toxic cells in their body. So they're going to eat some cells that are alive. But that's all they point to. See, it eats live cells. See, it's deteriorating the whole cell. It's eating up your body. It's destroying you, causing disease. It's just the opposite. They are the cure. They are the janitors. The only thing that can cause destruction in the body are industrial chemicals, starting with cooking your food, to burning coal in your house, with all the mercury poisoning, to being around industry, to having car pollution and inhaling it, to eating additives. All these poisons cause damage in the body, kill cells. Let's say you eat a lot of chocolate, and that chocolate was not made with good pig oil anymore, like it used to be, or chicken fat, or some kind of lard from some animal. It is now made with vegetable oils. Hydrogenated vegetables, the same molecular structure as plastic. So it gets into your body, it outgases, and it causes damage. It starts disintegrating cells and tissue, destabilizing. It's like having a psoriatic sore, where you're opening and you're seeping, and you can never close that wound, because you've got that contaminant in that tissue, in that area. So you may have a microbe, whether it's bacteria, fungus, or a parasite in there eating that tissue to get you well. But they say, see what it's doing to a cell? It's a janitorial thing. You want that infection. Now you see an infection with pus, people say, whoa, whoa, whoa, it's contagious. Shit, it's 99% white blood cells. White blood cells aren't contagious. White blood cells aren't bad. You can eat that. You can eat pus. There are dogs that lick it, cats that lick it. They want those white blood cells. They know you're going to waste them. So they'll take them.

Q: That's exactly what you were talking about. That was my arm a number of years ago.

A: Yeah, that's right. I have it everywhere on my body. That's from chemotherapy. Everywhere. So, industrial pollution in any form, even if it's just cooking your foods, causes disease and breakdown of tissue. Bacteria are only your benefit. Microbes of any kind are your benefit. There are few funguses on this planet that cause any kind of destruction to an animal. And it's mainly to certain ants. Certain ants get a little too aggressive and they start getting into deteriorating the life system around them. They eat a certain kind of thing and fungus start growing and you'll see mushrooms sprouting out of their heads and everything. Only animal in the world, creature in the world, that fungus will kill. Unless you're eating the poison mushroom, the death cap. I only survived because I've been raw food for nine years, completely raw food for nine years. So, that's how, and I forced myself to eat all that butter to get some pain and deal with all the liver pain. Every time I ate the butter, I was in excruciating pain there. But I knew if I could keep enough fat in my body with the rest of the poisons, then I would get well. So, it was either kill myself. It was very impossible to do at that time. And I wanted to mitigate the mushroom. I had tried to kill myself so many times, that it just made me worse, no matter what method I used. So, it was do the best I could and survive and get through it. So, I got through that fungus. But it didn't kill me, but it sure screwed me up for eleven and a half years. It took me eleven and a half years to get the strength and energy back that I had until that time of eating it. But normal fungus that occur in the body and bacteria and parasites are perfectly beneficial. How many people were told here that, what is that parasite that happens in pigs? Trichinosis. How many people have been told trichinosis is bad for you? About half the room. Okay. I was taught it was a deadly thing. Never get trichinosis. Always cook your pig, your pork until it is black. Never eat chicken, you'll get trichinosis unless it is thoroughly cooked. You see I'm a sucker. I like to suck my fluids too. Why? Because like a baby when they suck they get that saliva with all the bacteria in there. So I start off my digestion with the bacteria that should be in there. Most people just drink their fluids down and they don't chew them so you get bacteria. I don't feel like chewing my fluids most of the time unless it's egg white. So I suck. That pulls the bacteria from the saliva into the milk. Still didn't do it. I need a new one. Anybody bring a supply of eggs, I'd like to see everybody do this. You heard the membrane pop? Okay. So these microbes in the body are mostly building. 90% of your body is bacterial. You've got some for building the body and some for janitorial duties. Trichinosis. Joel Weinstock from the University of Iowa was studying pigs. Now he grew up on a farm so he knew what pigs were like. They were all contaminated, rolling around in pig shit and everything else. All eating it and getting sloppy. Pickle matter and urine in their trowel with all their food. 

Perfectly healthy animals. But the pigs they had in sanitary conditions at the university were sick as sick can be. So he said that doesn't make sense. So he tested the, because he's a gastroenterologist, he checked the whole digestive tract for enzymes, for bacteria, for everything and found that the main difference was that the pigs at the farm had trichinosis, the whipworm. And the ones at the university didn't. So he spiked the pigs at the university with the trichinosis and they were all well and healthy in five days. So he realized that trichinosis, the trichworm, whipworm, is there to help digest food when bacteria is low. The two species on this planet that carry trichinosis as a regular part of their digestive tract are pigs and humans. All the tribes have trichinosis. Perfect health. Even if they cook food, they got... They don't live as long. They die in their, you know, depends upon their diet, but they die anywhere from 60 to 80 to 100 years old. The tribes that eat only raw foods, raw animal foods, live to 150 years old. I met one tribe in Philippines just a year ago, year and a half ago, that eats three foods. Shoots the hell out of USDA, doesn't it? Food pyramid, 16 things, you got to do this and that. And it's all built around cooked, processed food to get you to eat all of it. It's not health. This tribe lives on fish that fish is for every day, coconut meat, and a fruit, either mango and choose a green or a banana and it's partially green. Those are the only foods they eat. That's it. And they live to 150 years old. Teeth, can you imagine having perfect teeth at 150 years old? Solid, perfect teeth. I looked at, you know, I got to interview some of them, and I got to see a guy that was about 80 years old. These people look no more than 39, 42, 45 at the most if you really look hard around. Incredible, perfect teeth. And I got to interview four of the women and only one of them was missing a tooth and she had a scar above the tooth. So, it's obviously an accident. Injury. Perfect teeth. No cavities. Whole 150 years. Think about that. The Philippine government threatened me with 10 years imprisonment to go back and find these tribes. Why? Because they don't want people to know they'll ruin industry. People will go back to the farms and eating if they know that they can just live happily without that. But they put them on this crap food and tell them it's good with all this TV. Do you think the TV ads are here bad? In those third world countries, they take no responsibility for their lives. No responsibility for what they do to the people. They tell them anything without all of the, you could resist, you know, we have ads here, take this medication, you've got ten things that you could cause problems with, but buy this. It's good for you. There, there's no little things like that. This is good for you and that's what you take when you have a problem. There's no scruples there. 

So they don't want people knowing what these trucks are doing. And they're trying to wipe out the tribes little by little. And they poison them and say they died in some smallpox. Smallpox is a joke too. It's not real. Smallpox, anytime you have poisoning, your body's going to try to throw it out through the skin. Now that they've got you on margarine and all the stuff, your intestines jam so you can't recognize it as well when you're poisoned. But you'll have the same reaction for many poisonings. It will all look like smallpox. So when they went around poisoning the people in Hawaii and South America and Central America, it was a poisoning, it wasn't smallpox. This is a lie. This is another way of having war to take over assets without spending a lot of money on arms. And that's just the way that smallpox is a joke too. Those people died of poisoning. If you read the work by the man who wrote Savages, I can't remember, it was a play that was written that was only performed in New York and Los Angeles in the mid-70s. It was about how Coca-Cola and the diamond and ruby industry went in and hired people in bars in Brasil, the city of Brasil, gave them machine guns and poisons to go after all the tribes they could. And they gave them, and this was back in the 50s and 40s, 40s and 50s, early 60s, they would give them $1,500 American dollars, or German dollars, depending on who was doing it, a week. That, you know, $1,500 in the 40s and 50s was a fortune, absolute fortune. In 1966, before, you know, while I was doing, while I was boiling chicken, I was making, what, $3.12 an hour under union. So I made what? If I did work overtime, I made about $68 a week. And that was in the late 60s, you know. These people were making $1,500 a week to go slaughter the natives, documented it. 

Q: What was it called?

A: It's called Savages. There's a play called Savages. I forgot the, it was performed at the Dorothy Channel Pavilion in Los Angeles. I happened to have a patient who was one of the native girls from Peru in there, in the play. Now, she's the one that got me really interested in eating raw eggs. Because she said when she was a little girl, she grew up with many brothers and sisters, and no father. You know, her mother kept having relationships with different men. So all of the fathers were different for all, for like 11 brothers and sisters. But she was so hungry, and the boys got more of everything. She was the only girl out of all 11 kids, that she would go into the garbage pits, you know, garbage baskets of other people's and pull out their eggshells and lick out a little bit of the egg white or egg yolk that was left in there. She said it helped her a lot. So it was very easy to digest, and it would give her instant energy so she could do other things, like climb trees and pick fruit and sell the fruit. So she was a jungle girl, tribal jungle girl, jungle girl. Anyway, that's how I learned about that. I didn't know any of the stuff like that existed. They would contaminate blankets and give them to them with formaldehyde in it, and say it was contaminated with smallpox, you know, so it would damage them all. They would drop them from airplanes to villages. Very ugly stuff to get over and take over their resources, with their diamonds and rubies and emeralds. Coca-Cola involved in that. Ugly people. Ugly people. They have no respect for humanity. And when they come out and say they're Christian, absolute joke. Absolutely. Every time Bush got on his knees, I said, you go kill babies, you know, in Afghanistan and Iraq, and you call yourself a Christian? Give me a frickin' break, you know. My poor evangelist brother just goes nuts when I say that. I don't understand the logic. It doesn't make sense to me. Thou shalt not kill or murder. These are babies and children. You handle it a different way if you've got a problem. Don't kill women and children. Anyway. So, disease is mainly not contagious. Things that live on the skin are contagious. Crabs, you know, lice, they crawl from one skin to another. They're contagious. They can produce on any skin. Yeast infections, they can be produced on any skin. So, if you have sex with a woman who has a yeast infection, you can get it. Not likely if you're healthy, but you can get it. But syphilis, AIDS, gonorrhea, those are not contagious. I've done laboratory tests. I've done tests with actual people. I even list one in my book, Byron. County Health Department came in and said, this woman who has syphilis said she had sex with you for three months. He usually had sex with a woman once at a time. You know, he was a philanderer. But he had stuck with this one woman he really liked for three months, so he had sex with her for three months and a lot of sex.

So, he called me and he said, I've got syphilis. I said, Byron, you've been on this diet raw for almost as long as I have. You just went on the meat and dairy like I have. But you mainly were a raw fooder, let's say 80% of your diet was raw food. You're not going to get any kind of syphilis. Syphilis is a breakdown of the genital and lymphatic system. The lymphatic system and the genitals. And you have to have a lot of waste products to store them. Mainly from, anybody guess, tetanus shots in the butt or thighs. It goes to that area and contaminates and destroys the tissue in that area. It's not a contagious disease. And they call it a virus. What is a virus? If you look at all the pictures of viruses they produce from not their new images that they put out, but everything that was shown in every photograph of so-called virus is just waste product. Particles of cells that have been disintegrated. You can see the RNA and DNA in them. And all of this dissolved solution is a waste product. And you've got some kind of chemical acid in there that help break it down. There's nothing alive in the virus. Viruses are not alive. Thirty years ago this was known. If a doctor found virus-like contamination, in other words, no parasites, no bacteria, no fungus, it was called, and there's degenerative tissue there, not broken down and eaten. Because when the parasites, bacteria and fungus eat it, they eat it and break it down into feces and urine. Secretion, excretion, that are very microscopic and tiny, that don't have a relationship to the actual parent substance. So, when they see larger particles of cells distributed around, fractionated, and there's no digestive enzyme present, they say that's a virus. There's nothing alive in the virus. There's no life there. It's what your body does when it can't harbor bacteria, parasites, or fungus. The body's too contaminated. Those cells are too contaminated. So, what happens? The body makes a substance, a solvent, to dissolve that tissue and break it down. But what happens when you have that? When you have a dog eat your trash, he has a little bitty poop, and there it is. I mean, you can feed him a whole chicken, and he'll have a little turd this big because he's absorbed the rest of it. And if he dissolves it properly, it'll be all white. When it dries out, it'll be all white, turned into dust. Completely bacterial degenerated. And it doesn't look like anything. But if you take that, and you put muriatic acid on it, and it dissolves it, you've got all this animal tissue in this toxic solution. You've got it. Then you add water to it, trying to dilute it, like the body does. It doesn't neutralize it at all. It is a contaminated substance in your body. So you have massive, massive swelling. The body trying to get fats to the area, and then the nutrients to the area, and water to dilute it, because it will cause damage to healthy cells.

That's why when you have meningitis, whether it's spinal or cerebral, in the brain, that a viral meningitis is more dangerous, because the swelling could cause permanent paralysis. When it's a bacterial meningitis, you don't worry about it because there's very little swelling. In fact, they're eating there, lowering the swelling instead of increasing it. So, I ate some of that chocolate. So, yeah, all those microbes, they are not your problem with disease. No matter how many times the pharmaceutical and medical industry scare you into taking antibiotics. Dumbest thing in the world to do. What do antibiotics do? They kill all bacteria, microbes, not just so-called janitorial bad ones. So, what are you doing to your digestion? What are you doing to your own body if your body is 90-90% bacteria? One cycle of five days of antibiotics will reduce the bacteria in the body by 1%. Ten-day round, 2% of your body is destroyed. And most of that, if you're taking orally, will be intestinal. So, you're going to get weaker and weaker for months until your intestinal tract repopulates. You're likely to have constipation or diarrhea, all kinds of problems from taking antibiotics. Most people get constipation when they take antibiotics. So, not a way to go. If you want to lower a bacterial detoxification, take lime juice. Lime juice and honey. Take about three tablespoons, three or four tablespoons of lime juice. Put it in about half a cup of, well, first take the lime juice and mix it with about two, three tablespoons of honey. So, you have almost equal lime juice to honey. Stir that and mix it. Then you pour that into a half a cup, three ounces to four ounces of naturally sparkling water. It'll foam up and bubble and all that. Drink that. That's a natural antibiotic. Now, lemon juice won't do that. Lemon juice causes more bacteria. It helps fermentation. That's why we use it as a ceviche. But lime juice stops it and prevents it. So, making lime juice ceviche is not a good thing unless you're trying to lower your bacterial detoxification. I would never, ever stop a parasitic infestation because they never cause harm. Ever. They never cause excessive symptoms. Bacteria, because of the swelling, can. And fungus can. Fungus, because almost all of their discard goes out in the vaginal cavity or the skin or the rectum, it can cause mass itching because of the dryness. So you have to apply butter in those areas. You can get butter, coconut cream, something you can make. You can't get anything else and you have to go for some kind of oil. It's not the best thing. It usually causes it to go longer because there's no breathing when you put an oil on it. So, that's the way to look at it. Don't look at it like things are attacking your body. The only thing that's attacking your body are the pollution that you're putting into it. You reduce your pollution in every way you can. Stop using soaps on your body. Stop using deodorants unless it's lime juice. 

Lime juice and lemon juice are okay. Lemon will cause still a little bit of fermentation activity. It's going to cause a slight bit of odor. Lime juice won't. But you can use those as an anti-odor method, as a deodorant method. Your body, I use coconut cream mainly. I'll let it, you know, that stuff that gets too old, I leave out, just leave it out to turn pink and gray and whatever it goes. Because the more it ferments, the more alcohol, the better it cleans your body. And the less oil it leaves, it doesn't leave as much thick oil. But it will always leave a little bit of oil on the skin to protect it. So you get all that good cleansing just with coconut cream. My girlfriend doesn't like to use it over there. She doesn't like to use heavy coconut cream. So she'll take the coconut cream and dilute it with water. The part that she's going to use in her bath, or shower. And she'll put it on diluted. I like that oily feeling on me. She does not. I love the oily feeling. She hasn't been on raw food diet as much, very much. She only does it like 50%, maybe up to 60, 70 sometimes. But she doesn't quite like the heat. So when she has that oily, she gets even more heat [unintelligible]. So she doesn't like that thick oil coconut oil. I do. Keeps the moisture in for me. She needs to release hers. Anybody that eats spicy food that's enough to cause your nose to bubble while you're eating it. It's that hot. It better perspire. It's going to heat the whole body up if it doesn't. And all of those Thais. One time I was sitting and girlfriend put some raw meat into her bowl of soup that came at a restaurant. And she just put that in there to cook. And I mean I wasn't tacky or anything, but she said, this is what I'm going to eat, raw meat. And she put it in the soup and I thought she just cooked it. So I put it in there just to see. And this is going on in my head. I didn't say it aloud. And I put my finger in there. It wasn't hot. It wasn't hot enough to cook the meat. I thought, oh good. I had to get ice, a cube of ice on my tongue. It actually caused a welt, a burn welt on my tongue. A burn welt on my tongue. And these people eat this three times a day. I don't know how they do it. But no wonder they can't handle the heat. They fill their bodies with hot, spicy substances. There's a lot of metallic substances in there. It's food. Body temperature is going to raise in the brain. So, weird. So, protein, protein in the body. We talked about the ability to digest. We digest maybe 2% of nuts. And when we digest the nuts, it's mainly starch. And even the fats. We don't digest nut oils very well at all. We're lucky we digest 4% of nut oil. Again, something we can't handle. Olive oil, you may digest it, but it's going to be a solvent. It's going to be something that would help build a cancer cell or help build a fluid to cleanse the body when bacteria isn't available or fungus or parasites are available. It's helpful in that way. 

But the more that you have, the more you have to rely upon solvents to clean your body rather than bacteria. Because they destroy bacteria. So, it's a catch-22.  Look at all the countries that live on olive oil. The passion and tempers that they have, the lack of logic that they have, the mafia, the Italian [unintelligible]. Again, they've got to spark and fuse this fast. The Irish have it because of all their alcohol, differently. But the Italians and their Greeks, it's because of all the olive oil. It's an acidic, irritating substance that constantly irritates the nervous system and body. Those Italians who live on a farm and are not eating all the olive oil and eating the butter and milk, they don't react like that. They're very calm people. So, understand what different foods do. And in the last section of my book, We Want to Live, over 200-something pages, the foods that you can eat to alleviate your symptoms. So that's where you go as a reference when you've got a symptom. Well, what did Aajonus find worked? Don't say, What did Aajonus say? What did Aajonus find worked for you? Worked for people. That's the key. Because if you say to somebody, Aajonus [unintelligible], they think you're just following some crazy guru. That's not me. I'm just following nature, what I've discovered. So say, Well, Aajonus discovered that the body reacts this way with this particular substance for this particular ailment. And it works 85-90% of the time. That's a high ratio of effectiveness. Whereas your pharmaceuticals work 10-20% of the time only. That's pretty failed. And a lot of times they're taking something that they found from a food and they're utilizing something and making it chemically rather than how the food produces it. Because they knew that the food did it and now they want to make some chemicals that they can sell for $2 a pill or $5 a pill or even Viagra, $10 a pill when it costs them 10 cents to make. So you've got to trust your body. So in the protein substance that the body can handle, it's always the animal fats. Only way you're going to get good protein is from animal substance, whether it's dairy or meats. Avocado has 80, it's like coconut, 80% fat, 50% protein, 5% carbs. However, the oils in the avocado will dry out and harden. Rub it on your skin, you see it turns green and it gets these little dark things as it dries. If you put coconut cream on your skin, it won't be able to dry out. So the coconut oil is more like an animal fat than any other fat or oil, in the crops that we can grow. Coconut is the only one that's near an animal fat. It still is not. But I learned from that tribe that they eat, the men eat up to a whole coconut meat a day. It's the matured coconut, not the young stuff. They will give that to the kids, but they don't eat it themselves. It's for health and to eat well and grow. So, but for the adults, it's always the matured meat. Females will eat about half of one a day. Males will eat a whole one a day. They're going to eat anywhere from one, two, three pounds of fish daily and maybe a banana or a mango a couple of times a week, three times a week.

Q: Do they spit out the coconut?

A: No, they actually swallow it. Otherwise, but that's all they eat. So they seem to digest. I saw some of the feces and I could see coconut meat in that, but still most of it was broken down. So, and I think that they do digest it well enough to break down the cellulose in it, but they've been doing this for thousands of years. Three foods. That simple. You know, once when I saw that, I thought, I'm trying to get my cheese, and my honey, and my dairy, and my eggs, and my meat, and every day, all five of them, you know. And then after that, I thought, huh. Fish, the coconut, and a fruit once in a while. And I do very well sometimes with that. Because of the vagotomy not as well as I'd like to. After, you know, living that way for five or six weeks, I get overly hungry. Because I have the vagotomy. It's a problem. So, I don't digest my meats as well as they do. So, I start getting too hungry, and I start wanting to eat everything. So, then I have to have dairy. I have to get dairy somewhere. And that'll calm it right away. Even if I eat, you know, I'll eat pockets of fat. I'll go up to the, I always shop where there's flies all over the place. I won't go into carrefour supermarkets or something like that to buy my meats. Because I know they have chlorine and all kinds of stuff on the cutting boards, and it gets into the meats and everything. So, I go by at the public markets where there's flies, and they have a little flag with a [unintelligible] to keep the flies off. And that's like, you know, it's waiting for somebody to come to buy their meats. And that's the way it is. It's good, healthy food there. And, you know, the fly waste is nothing other than the waste where any good bacteria eats it. So, those are our nutrients. There's an old tribe in Georgia, Russia, up until the, I think it was in the 1960s, and then the Russian government came in and stopped them. But they used to eat fecal matter from the buffaloes. The buffalo digested the vegetation. And this is not, this is a tropical, this is an environment like, let's say, New Mexico. So, they stood out cold and they had seasons. But they didn't get a lot of meat. The individuals who were poor, they couldn't afford chickens and stuff like that, and they worked in the fields, the rice fields or whatever, the grain fields. And they would go along eating the buffalo shit. Why? Because it's 65 to 70 percent pre-digested in the animal. When the animal's food goes into the bowel, it almost starts going into the same bacteria that we have, the same kind of acidic form. So, when they eat it, they're able to, and they eat it fresh, they eat it with all the still, the nutrients alive in it, and they get to digest it that much more. So, it's pre-digested and they can finish digesting. And these people were vibrant. So vibrant. Incredibly vibrant. Now they don't do it anymore. The Maasai have no more cows. The 10-year, 11-year drought now has wiped them out. They're accepting dehydrated milk and cereals to live on. And that's weather control according to some documentation that they're trying to wipe them out of those three countries where the Maasai live. And we're very powerful and strong. Now they're almost decimated. Oh, frustrating.

Okay, so, proteins, you're not going to get much of them in any other source. Now, if we're talking about digestibility and turning around the illness or disease quickly, your best food are eggs. Eggs digest in 27 minutes, especially if you eat the white first and follow it with the yolk. The next easiest food type to digest is raw milk, but that takes 6 to 10 hours. Now you saw me, I started getting a little spacey in there, I sucked an egg, and then I was right back to my full clarity and energy. Think about that, quick eggs. I tried the milk, it didn't work, remember? I waited 3 minutes, it didn't work. Because it takes too long to digest the milk. Maybe it's kefir or yogurt or it's a little faster. So the egg is your best thing. Remember, those people who have read the recipe book, the woman who had emphysema and her doctor called me on a Thursday night, probably must have been 1.30 in the morning her time, because she was calling from Massachusetts or Maine, and I was in Los Angeles at like 9.30 my time. And she said, I have an emphysema patient who was diagnosed with emphysema 7 years ago. She's been mainly on machines and bedridden for the last 2 years. She's probably, in fact I'm sure she's going to die this weekend. Is there anything I can do? And I said, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she said, well, I'm an M.D. and we can only go to alternatives when there's no, when it's a last resort or the person has been taking our medication, our therapies for 10 years. So, if you are condemned to the medical professions procedure for 10 years, whether you get good or bad results, the only thing they can suggest to you are their medically ordained procedures that are written by the pharmaceuticals for you not to get well. So, I said, well, that's your conscience. But the only thing I can suggest to you at this point, you get her as many dozen eggs as you can, and you put them on her bed table and tell her to eat one as often as she can, and there's no limit, and eat as much. So, this is on Thursday night, so I got a call on early Monday morning, my time, back in Massachusetts, it was later, and she said, I'm out of bed, off the machines, and what else can I do? I said, well, who are you? And she said, well, my doctor called, and you told her I was supposed to die this weekend, and I ate a lot of eggs, and I'm out of bed and off the machines. I said, well, how many eggs did you have to eat? She said, well, I ate 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday, and I was out of bed this morning, so what else should I do? I said, keep going with the eggs, 33 a day, for six months, and start adding raw meat to your diet and raw milk. You know, but stay with the eggs for a long time. That many or more. And she called me a year later, normal voice, everything was fine, I was working, back to work. And the medical industry had it for seven years. Didn't get better. You have to take a strong look at that.

Don't panic and go to the doctor. Don't go to a hospital. Look in the book. If it's too hard to go through a book, get the PDF version on wewant2live.com. So you can put it in a computer and you can come up with every tab, every reference to what your problem is. So you can have it right there. So you don't have to go through the pages, the indexes, back and forth. Reference it. You can make it easy for yourself. Do not panic. There are devils all around you who believe all the medical stuff. That's terrorism, medical terrorism. The worst terrorism in the world. So you have to ignore it. Call me if I'm in town and have a chance. Send me an e-mail with an emergency. There's no day or week that you have to move. If you have cancer and your breast is rotting off and your flesh rotting out, it may be an hour that you live, but you're already dealing with it. But if you've told your head you're having arm pain, left arm pain, and you think you're having a heart attack, and your heart's racing 100 miles an hour, you know, 170, 190 beats a minute, and your blood pressure's up to 250, and your cholesterol is 675, don't fall for it. It is absolute bullshit. I've got a Hall of Fame basketball player who keeps 675 blood pressure and a cholesterol level at the same, I'm sorry, cholesterol level is blood pressure is 230, 227, something like that. He can outdo young kids on this diet. He's out there playing ball and he's in his 80s. Easy. I've got a patient, new patient, who has an irregular heartbeat and she's been suffering it for about six months. And every time her friends and everybody, you're going to die, you're going to die, you have to go to a doctor. And she says, I'm not going to do it. She'll call me, it's happening again, it's stopped for a week, it's on again, I feel crazy, I can't sleep, my blood pressure's high, my heart's racing, and she goes through all this drama. And then I'll talk to her and bring her down where I'm going to say, make sure you're drinking, sipping the cream every 20 minutes, you need a little honey and butter, put a little hot water bottle in your heart, calm down, breathe slowly and deeply, and do all of that, and it'll bring it down. And it'll bring it down. Okay, and it does, and she's gone six months with this condition as her heart detoxifies from what? What do you think it is? The same thing that gave me heart attacks. She had a, because she is a therapist who worked in a hospital, a dietitian, she took a hepatitis B vaccine. Screwed up her heart. Same reason I got heart attacks. But her body's still trying to clean it out, and it keeps doing it. She doesn't panic. I mean, she'll panic and just send me an email that is desperate. I'm dying. I, you know, I can't believe it's racing this fast. It's 210 beats a minute, you know, and she'll just go on and on. And then she calms down and comes out of it. You have to let these things take their course. Going and having poisons injected into you, whether for diagnostics or for therapy, is no help toward health. It's an absurdity. Don't panic. Trust your body. Your whole body is working very hard for you. The only thing that works against you is poison. Time's getting... Is it four minutes until we're finished, or just until break?

Q: Four and a half.

A: Four and a half. Okay. So, we're just going to still take a half an hour. We're going to go over Q&A. I think I've covered just about everything that I need to cover. I'd like another hour, but we're just going to take Q&A. So, anybody have any questions? Yes.

Q: Going back to the Vitamin C [unintelligible].

A: There's no damages from the sun. No damages from the sun. [unintelligible] If you want to have a sunblock, there are two sunblocks. You have coconut cream, but you have to put it on the night before because there's 78% oil in it. Coconut oil is a tanning lotion, so it draws more sun into the skin and it causes more sun to absorb. Okay? And that's good the night before because all the oil will be absorbed before you get into the sun. Then use milk. Just put pure milk on your skin. Fresh, pure milk on your skin. Completely blocks the sun. Even if you get very red, it will all be gone the next morning.

Q: From here we take you to brush your hands on the aspen trees. They block the sun.

A: There may be some kind of evaporated oil.

Q: It's like a dust.

A: Not a dust. It would be a vapor, an oil vapor.

Q: I saw you about 4 years ago and I had a parasite. After I saw you, I just panicked. I've been on a parasite program for a long time. And I had my disease and I just found out one of the things that happens when you get an infection with the spirochetes and there's a little hitchhiker in a lot of the spirochetal infections and they're usually a nematode. You know, I get that body of the spirochete. So when you get this, it provides the spirochete. You also get the nematode infection. I think there's a connection there. And you know, I kind of went, oh my gosh. I have had whatever they did for so many years. And I've been trying to kill and kill and kill. [unintelligible]

A: There's no such thing as Lyme disease. If you look at the science behind it and you go through it as a microbiologist with my clarity about it, it's all bullshit. They wrap you around in a circle and they're presuming certain things about it. Yet they can give you five tests to prove maybe you have it. Wait a minute. If you know what Lyme disease is, you can call it disease Lyme, that means you have identified the main body of substance that occurs in that disease. They can't. Five tests can't even prove you have Lyme disease. So they really can't identify it. They're going to nematodes, amoebas, they're going to find protozoa, they're going to find everything in your body because you're made up of hormones.

Q: [unintelligible] If you concentrate on something hard enough, about not being well, not doing, you know, squat, not that, not...

A: Exactly, so what do you get? You get more of that. But it's not. Just remember that you cannot fantasize a monster to come up in your life.

Q: I can't fantasize a monster?

A: A monster to come up in your life.

Q: Oh.

A: That is, that is something that I don't believe in because I've tried it.

Q: Yeah.

A: And if, let me tell you, everybody would be a billionaire with as much as they fantasize about spending and buying and having millions of dollars. The amount of time that people spend on fantasizing, everybody should be a billionaire.

Q: Yeah.

A: If mind over matter worked that way. It certainly helps to be positive and to move along in a positive way and get positive reactions from people. Because you're going to get positive if you're positive. That doesn't mean you're going to manifest a monster if you think about it. It doesn't mean you're going to manifest a million dollars if you think about it.

Q: [unintelligible] I think everybody's trying to kill it. And I think that's my point. [unintelligible]

A: They're your friends. They're working for you.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: But they're there helping you already. The problem, like I say, I reiterate, a trillion times, industrial pollution. That's the only thing that can cause disease.

Q: Well, the antibiotics can almost kill you.

A: It's their industrial pollution.

Q: And I'm probably still getting over that. And that's probably why they don't... whatever the parasite is.

A: And look at the dryness in your skin. You have no bacteria underneath your skin.

Q: Right.

A: You should start rubbing butter into your skin. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible] Going back to my daughter, who's at the consultation, we get her...

A: I'm going to see her, so let's not talk about that.

Q: Okay. [unintelligible]

A: So what you do is you get a Pyrex dish.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: Okay? And you put it a little on its side like this in the refrigerator so it makes a triangular-like popsicle. And of course, you can put some kind of piece of wood underneath the two points where the sticks go into it. And you just let it go that way. So you're not using a plastic mold which will put the BPAs into your popsicle. We'll just...

Q: What about all those BPA-free products out there?

A: There's any type, any product that is plastic is a problem anyway. And if you freeze anything or cook anything, it's going to get in your... Metal is a problem when you freeze anything. Aluminum, no matter what it is, has to be glass.

Q: Okay. And silicon is considered, what, like a plastic?

A: Yep. Silicon is a plastic. BPA. It's a thing that they use to harden plastic. It causes mass destruction of cells, DNA destruction, all kinds of things. Lots of cancer. Anyone else before I go on?

Q: Yeah, I wind up creaming a lot of coconuts, but it always winds up fermenting before I eat it all. And when I ingest it, you know, from my mouth, I wind up getting a lot of gas from it. So, I usually keep it to use in my baths and things like that. But the fermented coconut cream is okay to use in them as well. It's not going to cause any sort of gastrointestinal...

A: Well, it's already broken down. Just depends upon how fermented it is. Just remember, anything that's fermented digests better. So, if you're eating the sour coconut cream just like you eat soured milk, it's going to digest better. Eat too much of it, you're going to detox too much, because remember, coconut cream, even though it's, you know, is more like dairy. It is not dairy, and it will be mainly used for detoxification. And I've seen people go through horrendous detoxification, because they didn't listen to me to keep it to no more than 4 to 6 tablespoons daily. 

Q: So, if I'm having issues just with letting it ferment longer, that it's, you know, whatever it's going to do, and then it'll release less gas once I eat it, so the longer the better?

A: Well, not the longer the better, not the funkier the better. But you let it get to a certain stage. If you put alcohol in it, then it's going to really detox you. But, when I'm looking at you, I wouldn't use much coconut cream. You need to stabilize your body. Your body is very weak and anemic. So, you need to eat butter and cream and meats just to build yourself. Don't worry about detoxification. Once you get strong, then do it.

Q: What about the flu vaccine?

A: Pardon?

Q: What about the flu vaccine? Is that another one that you stay away from?

A: Okay, I'm going to do... There was a Saturday Night Live type skit that they did in Canada. And they go around interviewing people about, oh, would you take the swine flu? Is it really free? Are your governments giving it to you? And you're going around asking those, oh, yeah, I take it because I want to prevent the disease. And then they go to, then a guy, they cut to a guy with a blender. He's got a rotten, stinky egg, and he puts that in first, and the egg's shell and all. Then he takes a thermometer with mercury and puts it in there. Then he takes some liquid aluminum, puts that in there. Then he takes some ether, puts that in there. And then takes some detergent. I forget, a Tide or something. Pour a little of that, blends it, and say, hey, this will help you stop the flu. One time. Nobody's drinking. He said, then why are you injecting it in your blood? In your body? Are you crazy? There is nothing helpful. And those are the five ingredients that occur in every flu vaccine. Plus there are another 36 to 56, 53, 54 other ingredients which are all chemicals. There is nothing helpful about a vaccine. Why in the world would you put all poisons up to, from 43, 46 to 63 poisons in your body and expect that to help you? Help you do what? Now you have to think about flus are viral, right? If flus aren't alive and they change over, your body is changing fluids to digest and in three days the flu isn't the same anymore. If they make a flu vaccine it takes 18 months to get it on market. It was already gone 18 months ago. Never had the same relationship. Completely different flu. So the whole idea of stopping the flu with vaccines is not only inane, it is outright stupid. If you know the chemistry like I do, why would you completely poison your own body? Doesn't make any sense.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I don't know. I haven't experimented with that. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: We're going to need to keep these to general questions. If you're talking about a specific person, you may call me and talk about it.

Q: I just want to, he's been on vancomycin now for 6 weeks and we're trying to get him off of it.

A: Don't try, get him off of it.

Q: I know, but I don't know what to do with him after that.

A: Well, then you'll have to consult me, by the way, because I'd have to have a lot more information. You know him, and if you go to my book and whatever you've gone over today, you might really know. You might figure it out very easily. And you may not even have to call me. That's why I'm educating you. So you can do it on your own. You can take care of yourself. You don't rely upon me. You can use my books. I don't have to be there. I'm here to give you the information so you don't have to rely upon somebody like me. So you don't have to rely upon the doctor. You can figure it out yourself. Now you know the body. Just keep thinking about it in the ways that I've given you. But that doesn't mean you don't need to call me. If you still can't figure it out, then you call me. Yes?

Q: I already intuitively feel that these water ionizing machines are bad. Can you elaborate into why?

A: The ionizers, ions, are particles that react in combination in relationship to protons. Protons is a positive charge. Ions are a negative charge. Now when you get a lot of pollution in the air and pollution in the body, it destroys the ions. So you have all of these positively charged protons and they're causing havoc and destruction in the body. So that's how these chemicals work. They break down the negative charges in the body and the positive charges are like an atom, a broken atom, a split atom. They bounce everywhere and cause mass destruction. Ionization is good, but through water, that's not a good thing. From foods, you get the proper ions combination. It's like water, you get it from your foods, not from some machine. What happens in my research to 75... excuse me. It was 73 through 74 with ion machines. I put them up in a laboratory room and I let the exhaust come in from a machine. I had, a few days I ran diesel fumes into it. The other days I ran just a regular gas into it. And what happened was these ions that are created mechanically go and penetrate and knock and take the charge out of the protons. Good thing, however, when the protons reacted at first, first splitting them, they bombarded whatever was around them. And I had some pictures on the wall and some furniture in the room. I wanted it to be more like a house, to see what it was like. I removed, after a week of doing that, removed the pictures and the furniture. Everything was black except for where the furniture was. And, you know, taking a rag off of the furniture and the picture, all that black was on the furniture and the picture. So what it did was it caused the toxic proteins with the pollution it carried to penetrate whatever it was, the walls, whatever was in the room. You don't want it on in the room, when you're there, because it will penetrate your tissue. I couldn't clean it out of the walls. So, they've made the machines a little different now. You can't get that same reaction as well. However, even though it splits the molecules, so you can't see the dirty look, and it bleaches it, the poison is still being driven into the tissue, into the walls and everything. So if you're going to use an ionizer, it should not be water, because that goes right into your body, and it's going to shoot everything right through your intestinal walls, and everywhere, everywhere. And that isn't bound by tissue. That isn't bound by mucus, and it will go right through. It is a charge. It's an electrical and magnetic charge. If you're going to have an ionizer in your house, at night you put it in your living room and other rooms, and keep it out of your bedroom, keep that door closed. Then in the daytime, you put it in your bedroom, if you want to. Around here, if you don't want to have that kind of pollution, you shouldn't need an ionizer here. You know, if your questions are specific about a person, not general...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Any kind of bacteria, you're loaded with anaerobic bacteria. Your whole body is 90% anaerobic bacteria. You have other aerobic bacteria in your lungs, in your nasal passages, in your ears, but the rest of you is anaerobic bacteria. Again, that's a way of avoid to get you to take antibiotics and fear your body and nature. Yes?

Q: Have you heard about alternative medical therapies injecting, like, good E. coli bacteria into the brain to, like, get rid of, to eat brain tumors and to leave healthy tissue around, kind of like the medicinal maggot thing, but deeper? Does that seem to be legitimate?

A: Well, the E. coli does not normally function... It functions in the bowel. That's where it belongs. So, you put it in the brain, you breed it there to clean up the brain. I'm not sure that... See, the byproduct of E. coli is supposed to be absorbed as nutrients. If your brain can make food of that, I would say fine, but I don't know. I haven't done the tests. I think it's a dangerous thing to do. I say eat shit and live. Don't inject it into your brain. Okay.

Q: I have a question.

A: Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Any of those mined compounds are rock. They are not microbically bound. Clays are. Clays are full of the only elements in the world that are shape-shifters besides other microbes. But clay, especially terramin clay, T-E-R-R-A-M-I-N, do you have terramin here?

Q: Yes.

A: Terramin clay. Okay. That is mined from an old hot aquabed. Never mined in an area where the temperature of the water was over 98 degrees. That means all the phosphorus is stable. Every bit of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, all the alkalinizing ones, every element, even though it's high in aluminum, it's still not in toxic aluminum. All of them will work very well in your system to detoxify metals.

Q: Okay.

A: Now, it will help extract it, but not like chlorophyll will or chlorella. Also... The mineral supplements you were talking about is not a good thing. It's rock. And when I say in my recipe book to prepare clay properly so it doesn't dry out and harden to your intestines and prevent proper mucus and so you don't build up with mucus and clay in your intestines, is you soak the clay for four to five days before you take it. You get the microbes in it changing form. And they'll adopt whatever form you need. They're shape-shifters, just like stem cells are. And the only safe clays I know are ones that are not from volcanic ash. Volcanic ash [unintelligible] volcanoes. It's got anywhere from 1,800 to 3,200 degrees. All of your alkalinizing minerals are burned up and ash and gone, vaporized. The only thing you have left is molten metals. Who the hell wants to eat clay with molten metals? Ingesting the molten metals? Not right. So anything, and you have to ask, where did this come from? Is this from volcanic remains or is this from an old aquifer? Only what I've been able to find is French green clay that's from streams that had never been exposed to volcanic ash or, and now they're calling some French clays, French clay, because I've said that, that are really from volcanic ash. So you have to ask. The only way that I'm sure about and know about is Terramin clay. I know where that comes from. I've been there at the mine.

Q: Can you take that in capsules?

A: Your capsules are very toxic.

Q: I understand that, but I thought people take those capsules.

A: They do, but it's not healthy.

Q: Okay.

A: The capsule will melt in the stomach, poison the body, and the stomach lining, and then it'll go through dry. And it can stick to, let's say you have a dry spot in your intestines, it'll stick there, take there, and you won't feel it.

Q: Okay.

Q: Did you say that you soak it in water, vinegar?

A: Healthy waters.

Q: What about vinegar? Do you use that sometimes for what you have?

A: That's for good for the skin, but not if you want bacteria to grow. The vinegar will kill it. Vinegar is an antiseptic.

Q: You were talking about the tribe in the Philippines and the coconut. What is the difference between the Thai coconut that you get and the other coconut?

A: Well, it's very different. You have the solid proteins in the meat, but in the young coconuts, you mainly have carbs and fats. Very immature fats.

Q: So that's good for children?

A: It's good for children. Yeah, or if you've got indigestion or a stomach problem. I still eat them. I'm not well yet. Oh, it takes 40 years to, if you're on a perfect diet, it takes 40 years to completely get all the crap out of your body and rebuild every cell. And that's according to Pottenger's and Howell with sick animals. It took them five generations. It takes them seven to seven and a half years to change over every cell in the body, including the bowel. So it takes you, and then every generation will lower. It's like, you have a baby. It eats out of you and what you eat. So it's going to be as toxic as you are. So if they stop eating toxicity, they're going to still transfer a lot of the toxicity in the cells to the next generation. But it gets less the next generation. And both of them found that it was five generations. So five times seven and a half years is 147 years. I mean, 47 years. 38, 37 years. So it's 37 years for you to get clean. But people don't go on 100%. And even if you do get to 100%, you add on three years. I'd say 40 years. I still have, and I ate my poison mushroom. I had other contamination. I was subdued in the Philippines and injected with the swine flu vaccine. Three of them. And I broke out and came out my skin and it caused massive amount of toxicity. All that burned through. I had all the skin tested high in aluminum and mercury. I just, I had to wait. And I kept shaving the hair off to have the hair analyzed to see what the body was building into the hair. So the hair's not very heavy on the legs and there's not much there. So I had to wait a whole year to get enough hair, a year and three months to get enough hair to be able to analyze it. And it came back with chromium off the chart. And two other things that were off the chart that aren't normal. You do not find in the human body. Obviously it's what they injected in me. What that whole soup, I don't know, was. When I had the rest of my hair tested and the tissue tested, it tested very high in mercury, thallium, and aluminum. Again, those are things that are in vaccines. So, the reason that happened to me was because I was one of the first ones to go on about this swine flu epidemic that was supposed to come along, because I had gone through it in the 76 version. I was very involved with Ida Honorof and Dr. McBean, who showed that it was a scam in the pharmaceutical industry. So, I was very prepared for all the information. So, I went on the national radio and then gave all that information, all the references. I got death threats on the phone. I'm going to track you down and make sure you keep your mouth shut. And it went on. I thought these were just pharmaceutical people who were just blowing, speaking, just angry doctors.  But when I went to the Philippines and that happened to me, it was pretty devastating. Very devastating. But as soon as I got back, I went right on the radio and talked about it again and again and again. And guess what happened? The $7 billion that we paid, none of it got used. Very little of it. I think there were maybe only a million out of the 300 million vaccines that we had bought. Didn't happen.

Q: Now, you know they put the Swine Flu vaccine into this year's Seasonal Flu. So it's a triple. [unintelligible]

A: Yeah. And you can better believe you're going to be very sick.

Q: And it's going to be what's left over.

A: Sooner or later. So, no, flu shots are not good.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay. Again, you're looking at an industry who is thinking good and well and wanting to help when it was good people trying to find it. But you have to understand anything that is eliminated, when you take, fractionate anything and you have to isolate an ingredient, they have to use a solvent to do that. Or they have to use heat or they use both. So, all natural, what does that mean? That means they used a kerosene derivative. Kerosene is natural. You soak your food, let's say you soak a peach or an apple in kerosene for 30 minutes and then wash it off immediately. Kerosene goes right into the tissue. So, any supplement. I don't care what it is, it doesn't matter. Any element that is isolated is chemically manufactured and produced. You have to isolate it from the food. And you also think about it, vitamin E. And vitamin E, even if it's natural vitamin E, only 5 units will be either from corn or soy. The other 95 units are from Kodak and Fuji. What do you mean Kodak and Fuji? The byproduct of developing fluid. They spent somewhere around $600 million a year to isolate the byproduct of the developing fluids, put it in vaults, 12 feet thick concrete, in stainless steel, everything very expensive, stainless steel barrels. There were anywhere from 55 to 100 gallons per barrel. The land and the mining and the building and storing all of this every year was costing them $500 to $600 million a year. So they hired and paid out over $200 million every year to scientists to figure out how to break this chemical byproduct down to where it wouldn't be dangerous to the planet. So they had one scientist who came along and said, Hey, this has 70% of the molecular structure of vitamin E. Let's call it vitamin E and sell it as vitamin E. They handed the technology to the idiot FDA. And let me tell you, they hire people in the FDA who've been in the pharmaceutical industry or worked for Monsanto or Dow. All of the last heads of the FDA have that background. So all of the minions in it are hired the same way. So they look at that, oh yeah, 70% structure vitamin. It's like saying, hey, I've got a shell of a Rolls Royce out there with no engine. But the car is made out of plastic, but it sure looks like a metal Rolls Royce. And it's an absurdity. It's inane. It's stupid. So anyway, the 95% of the vitamin E that you take from the health food store is Fuji and Kodak And they still got thousands of barrels to sell you. They've got enough for 60 more years. Now the digital is in, and you don't have to use all the chemicals for developing. That's gone. You don't have to worry about it anymore. But they still have thousands of barrels to sell with vitamin E. The vitamin E that you get from a pharmaceutical house or from any just health food store is 100% food Fuji and Kodak. Developing food. Vitamin D. What is vitamin D? Manufactured vitamin D, they take it. Hydrogenated vegetable oil. Remember, when you hydrogenate a vegetable oil, it is plastic. It's the exact same electrical structure as plastic. That's how you make plastic.

You take an oil, whether it's a mineral oil or a petroleum oil or a vegetable oil, and you hydrogenate it, and you have plastic. So they take plastic and plastic oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, they expose it to radioactive material and call that vitamin D. See, because the sun takes oil in the skin and turns the oil into vitamin D. So they tell the FDA, see, we've got an oil exposed to radiation the same as the sun. Vitamin D. No relationship to vitamin D that's made in the skin. None at all. Highly toxic. All those vitamins are made to, some people have some very good intents, but you have to understand, none of them are chemists or microchemists. They have a little bit of chemistry. Then they go to a pharmaceutical house because who's going to make it for them? They're not going to make it. They don't have a lab, so they have to go to a higher chemistry laboratory to make it. Labs want the money. Of course we can make a natural substance. They're not saying, I can consider kerosene natural, and that's what I use as a solvent, that I will give you an all-natural life. And that's the way it is. So, no vitamins, no supplements, no minerals. Minerals are all rock. It's just rock. No animals digest rock. Plants are just rock. We don't. So it's built up to cause problems in the body. Live food, rock food, there's no substance. Live food vitamins are in your food. Those are live food vitamins. Anything that's distracted in any way, it's not alive. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible] essential oils?

A: Essential oils are distilled, even the, what's his name?

Q: Yum.

A: Yum. Even the yums are distilled to 257 degrees. That's 200 degrees less than your pharmaceutical house distills at. But if you read in [unintelligible] books, nature distills it at 57 to 62 degrees. That's all.´And when you distill an oil, what does it become? It becomes a kerosene-like substance. It penetrates the cells and irritates them and injures the cell whether it wants to or not. Very toxic. Very toxic.

Q: I mean, like, my sister last week, she just tried peppermint oil from [unintelligible], you know, which is now [unintelligible] for young women. And so she gave her some peppermint, a couple drops, and then put them on her stomach, and when she came home in the morning and she was sick, you know, got the stomach, you know, blah, blah, blah. And then a half an hour later, she was, she came home, and she said, well, I'm not sick anymore.

A: Well, what that happened was they put it in the mouth where there's mucus to protect it from entering the cells. Then it went in as a fat, because it's still a fat, and it bound with some toxins. But it also poisoned her system, and the system said, okay, I have to stop the detoxification, because now I have to deal with the peppermint oil, the distilled peppermint oil. It's like gasoline. Very serious. Look at it under a microscope. That's all you have to do. Nobody does that.

Q: But why do they distill it, then?

A: Because that's the only way you can get it that thin. The FDA won't let it out. They won't sell it. It's dirty. Remove all the proteins and all the fats from it. It's the FDA's rule. The FDA does not want you to be healthy. Back in the 70s, we used to be able to get cod liver oil. It was stern. It was dirty. It was messy. It was awful. But it was healthy. Now you can't buy cod liver oil like that anymore.

Q: Are there no good vitamins or supplements?

A: No, there are none. Yes. Well, vitamins, yes, in food, but not supplement.

Q: With the distilled oil, you can take most of those substances and just put them in a jar of water and turn them. The oil will just naturally rise up to the top. [unintelligible]

A. That's the way to take those oils if you want those oils. Remember, they're not animal fat.

Q: That's right.

A: They're still vegetable oils.

Q: Ah, yes.

A: Very different from animal fats.

Q: Do you recommend using them in that fashion or not?

A: Not really. Not exactly. Butter is the best thing. Butter is fantastic. They make you smell good. If you're going to use a perfume, I prefer to use that because that mainly stays on the surface. Okay, I think we're going to have to stop this because we have to get going. Some people have to leave. Is anybody behind this going? Some people are here. They came for me to look at their daughter. 

Q: She's pretty calm right now. Whatever you need to do.

A: It's up to you.

Q: Let me just tell you very quickly about the raw cow share system in the state of Colorado. The way it works is the raw dairy program here is based on the cow share system. You have to own a piece of a cow to legally purchase raw dairy. So they've recently ordered a cease and desist for all of our raw dairy, goat and cow [unintelligible]. No more making yogurt, butter, kefir, cheese, cream, any of that stuff. However, we have a private co-op here that is under the right to choose healthy foods that Aajonus started. We can legally do that as well. So even though the other cow share systems can't do it, we can do it. We're still going to be making it ourselves and offering it under our co-op. So don't worry about that. We just had a little glitch in the transition this week where they had to stop. I had to get extra milk to be able to make it. So I'm going to start making yogurt and kefirs tonight and butter. So it will be available by Monday at least at the latest. So you guys are aware of that.

Q: There's a lot of talk right now about bioidentical hormones and that they make them through a compound of hormones. Is that the same negativity of what you're talking about with the hormones?

A: Complete fraud. Bioidentical to what?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No. Because everything they extract and make them from is a plant. There's no animal cells involved in any of that chemistry. Bioidentical to what? Bioidentical to you that they take your tissue and break it down and see how it can go to your exact chemistry? Bioidentical is a false term. They should be sued in court until they're blue. Until they're bankrupt and not in business. Bioidentical is ridiculous. And what is that other one? Human growth hormone. It's all vegetation. There's nothing animal in it. Human growth hormone. One of the most ridiculous ads in the world. Again, it's a scam.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: What they do is they take the growth hormones from like wheatgrass and tell you that's a growth hormone for you. It's got nothing to do with the human growth hormone. It's a grass growth hormone. It's all a lie.

Q: [unintelligible] All you hear about is how good vegetable byproducts are compared to meat and the fats from meat. And you're saying just the opposite.

A: Like I said, 99% of what you hear from the medical profession and the scientific community is just the opposite and you'll be right. 99% of that.

Q: So medicinal plants are pretty much useless.

A: Let me tell you about medicinal plants. It's one thing I said in my book. I was going to do a lot of investigation once I got to a farm that could produce them on a regular basis. So I was in the, see this toe right here? See how bad, two of them are damaged? Okay. I was putting some, they were building my house in the Philippines. It was potentially going to be a clinic, a health spa clinic. And one of the guys loaded the pickup with these about 90-pound piles, wooden teak piles, very heavy. Rolled off, slid off the truck, and I'm talking to somebody else, right on my toe. The edge of it, a 90-degree angle, and let me tell you, it split that toe in two. So, this whole toe here, came across this way. All the skin from here to here was off, all the way down to the bone. The bone was split all the way up the center. So, I writhed in pain for about an hour. Yelled at the guy, which I usually don't, but I yelled at him for doing that. And I took lime juice and I squeezed lime juice on it and let it burn me to death. And then I put a honey and coconut cream and then meat over that. And then wrapped it and went back to work. So, I was limping for days because when you split a bone like that, it throbs, throbs and throbs. So, I didn't even notice the pain in here as much because the throbbing bone overtook the sensation. So, it was growing its tissue back and I only took the, you know, I got in the water. I never changed the bandage for five days. Took it off. It was almost sealed. It was just down to here where it hadn't been up. And some of the natives there said, oh, we have a plant. So, we went to the forest and we got the plant and they ground it up and then put it on my toe. I started having a massive pain by the night time. This was somewhere around four o'clock, five o'clock in the afternoon. By the middle of the night, I woke up in excruciating pain. Took it off and that had taken all of the skin off that had grown in those five days. Just deteriorated away. I said, oh, shit. So, I put the, you know, the honey and butter, I mean, the honey and coconut cream and the meat back on it with the lime just to help clean the herb out of it. And then, after about five days, it almost grew back again. Then I went to the Philippines and I'm working on my property there. And they had an herb. I said, okay, I can't be close-minded here. So, they had an herb which was different. They showed that herb to me. They said it heals wounds. One guy showed me how he put it on his wound. He had a huge scar there, but it healed and it was a nasty wound. So, I said, okay, let me try it. He doesn't eat the way I do, and maybe my body [unintelligible]. It did the same freaking thing. In less than 24 hours, it took all of that tissue away. So, I said, that does it. No more herbs for me. Experimenting with, you know, composting with the body. So, I put this on, and I let it on for five days without cleaning it, and there it is. But, you'll notice that I didn't put anything on this little toe right here. This one. Do you see how bruised the nail is? That toe was as bruised. The big toe was more bruised than that one. 

But, having the meat on it, drew all the bruising as red blood cells that have bled into the system and not broken down. So, the meat and the other ingredients I had actually helped break down all the blood cells, and I didn't lose that nail. That nail was ready to pop out. Now, the nail is solidly in there. It is reattached to the skin. I mean, that's pretty amazing to me. So, then I just stopped putting anything on to see what would happen about three days ago. I could walk on it, jump on it. That was three and a half weeks. And the bone, I mean the bone sealed. No bone pain. That was the last thing to go. I mean, if I do this a lot, there's a little bit of some kind of energy right at the base of that cuticle. That's quick. So, that's what I think about herbs so far, and I'd like using them.

Q: Hot springs.

A: Hot springs are wonderful. Hot baths, like I said, help you get rid of all those toxins that the lymph system dumps under the skin. Wonderful. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Sometimes I've gone to those places and I take a bottle of vinegar with me, and that gets dumped into the hot springs, and I leave it in there for about 30 minutes, and then I'll go in. Vinegar neutralizes the chlorine. 

Q: The raw vinegar, though.

A: Raw, it has to be raw.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, vinegar will help, like, lime juice, but not as safely. It will help lower bacterial levels. It also helps dissolve plaque in the body. So, vinegar and lemon juice and honey together with some sparkling water will help dissolve plaque in the arteries and stuff like that. But you have to be very careful with it, because it will start dissolving healthy tissue, too. Because you're dealing with a chemical there. Even though it's a natural chemical, it's from an apple. Yes?

Q: Well, women used to take the vinegar to help lose weight, and it affected their teeth and so forth, and they always dropped their teeth.

A: Yeah, because they took too much of it. And I watched it. I have a very good friend who had a grandmother that, you know, she read my book, and she says, well, I'm going to take the coffee substitute. So, you know, that's the vinegar and honey and water, lime juice. And she would drink that every day, and a whole half cup of it. And I say, Grandma, please don't do that. You're wasting all this energy. I'm going to do it. You young whippersnappers. And she was a farm, you know, she grew up on farms. If, you know, in ten years that she did it, this is the way her spine went. You do it. You have to be careful with vinegar. Probably a tablespoon a day, as long as it's with some kind of fat is enough. It may be too much. That's probably five days weekly, and then take two days off. But I only recommend it if you have, you know, congested arteries. Or you've got a stone somewhere in your liver.

Q: I'm trying to get my cholesterol down, but they want to [unintelligible].

A: You've got to have high cholesterol. If you're toxic, you better have high cholesterol.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's not good for you. Cholesterol protects you. Like it's listed in the recipe book. Read the cholesterol myth. Read it. You'll never, you'll think the old cholesterol thing is a scam of the pharmaceutical industry, and it is. They get you on meds to bring down your cholesterol. You'll be sicker and you get more meds. That's the whole point. Okay.

Q: One thing that I think might benefit everyone.

A: Okay.

Q: I'm concerned about, you know, when it comes to the point of we're fighting for our rights. I don't have the ability to talk to court or what not. Like, you're so well informed, so how do you suggest someone like us deal with courts?

A: Courts?

Q: Yeah, like going to court.

A: For?

Q: For, say, anything like, well, when she received antibiotics in the hospital, you know, and it wasn't...

A: Oh, [unintelligible], you know, just get a medical attorney who suits that criteria. You go on the Internet and you find a bunch of law and review. It's probably a pretty good win, but antibiotics in the courts are considered safe, even if they're not, you know, not prescribed by the parents or accepted or approved by the parents. A lot of doctors, unless she was in danger of death and we didn't give her that, courts [unintelligible]. You have to have scientists in there who are medical doctors. I can't even, because I'm a Ph.D. in nutrition. You have to have a medical doctor say that was wrong, it did more damage to her than good, and she was not in danger of death.

Q: What about our farms that are being threatened by the government?

A: Well, I'd stop that. I've got lease programs, so Right to Choose Healthy Food I formed. I contract to farmers, so all the clubs under Right to Choose Healthy Food, it's their members, own the animals. So you own the milk. Now, you've got the cow share program. They've already infiltrated that with the law, because Colorado has a law, they've allowed themselves to control it. They don't control my lease program, they control the cow share program. That's why I don't like the cow share program, because if government gets a hold in it, they rule it. They can do anything they want, but I won't let them in the cow's lease program. Anybody that starts going to a regulatory board, a legislature, asking for the legalization of my lease programs, and I've got them trademarked and copywritten, my lease programs in a legislature, I will knock it down instantly.

Q: Do you have these set up in Australia, too?

A: Yes, I've sent them... I haven't set it up there, but people have asked me there, and they're starting to use it. 

Q: When you go there, you can check one out for us.

A: So, what I do is, the farmer comes to me, we sign a contract, right to choose healthy food, owns the animals. Sometimes the land, if we want crops to grow, that they don't allow to grow, or they're going to grow too many crops. Once I take it out of, nobody can come and get any of the food unless they are members. It's closed to the public. So, that rules out commerce. Government only has jurisdiction over commerce. They don't have a jurisdiction over private organization. As long as they're not distributing cocaine or something, it's ruled a poison, under rules. So, as long as we're not engaging in that, we're engaging in food. So, there's no jurisdiction. Members own the food. When they come and pay something, when they pay for the food, they're paying for the farmers servicing, producing it for us, bottling it, milking, doing everything, packaging it, shipping it to us. That's what we're paying for. We already own, it's our food. They can't prevent us from having it. They have no jurisdiction. So, when Hershberger and several of the farmers were getting raided by the FDA and the local, the federal FDA and the local FDA, the state FDA, and their local county health department, and the Farmer-to-Consumer Legal Defense Fund was having them sign up, oh, we did a bad thing, but we'll follow your regulations after this. I said, don't you dare sign that. They'll have you bankrupt, you know, in two years, and you'll be out of business. And I get on [unintelligible], and Sally found out about this all the time. Because they let 23, 24, 26 farmers go down the tubes and out of business in the last six years. So, I, Hershberger, I found out, so I contacted him, one of the members of Sally Fallon's group, I should say, listen, we need your help. So I came in, signed up the agreement with Hershberger, an Amish farmer. I addressed a letter telling them the circumstance, now Hershberger is under right to choose healthy food, only members get it, you have no jurisdictions. You come onto the property again, you're trespassing, you're breaking and entering if you come in with an illegal warrant. If you come in with a warrant, it has to be a falsified warrant, because the only way you can get a warrant to trespass is your felony offense. Making milk without a permit is only a misdemeanor. [unintelligible] All four of them that were going to go down the tubes with those Cox and Kennedy lawyers at Farm to Consumers are now safe. They're still in business, and their families are doing fine. You know, so that's the way it is.

Q: She needs to leave. She wants to do a mini-consult.

A. Okay. Let's do it. I need two chairs.

Q: While he's setting up, I will tell you, we still have a couple cases left for the private iridology consultation. They are $385 for the first consult. You will get more out of this consultation than $100,000 with the Western Medicine Diagnostic, which will never give you... It's done on a cellular level. At the iridology, you close the irises up and read them. Talk to me if you're interested in doing that, and then we'll let you do that.

A: Okay. I'm going to need silence here. Do you have somebody recording this or writing it?

Q: Are you fine if I keep recording it? Because I'm sending a recording to everybody.

A: Is that close enough?

Q: Well, I first... OK, so I won't record it. Most people do, but.

Q: Thank you.

A: Give me your hand. It's OK. She can hold it. Look at your hands. Look at this. Look at these lines. See the lines in your hand? See those lines? See yours? Well, all of her glands work very good. Every one of them is functional. She has, you know, she has dark spots all throughout her body, which means bacteria deficient. It looks like she's bleeding internally in places that could be from the antibiotics. So, I suggest you get some green head cabbage. Not the Chinese leaf cabbage, the head cabbage. Green. And you take it, give her a tablespoon of that every day for four days. If it's too hot, you taste it first. If it's too hot, mix a little cream in it. That's okay. But if you're using a tablespoon of the cabbage, then put only two drops of the cream in that and give it to her. Then it won't be so hot. And that'll help. But she has bruising all over, as you can see. And that's internal bleeding. So the antibiotics probably have damaged her capillary system. To rebuild that, she needs collagen. Does she like cucumbers? Does she eat cucumbers?

Q: She used to when she was real little. Her diet's real picky.

A: Well, she can't digest.

Q: Yeah.

A: The bacteria is damaged.

Q: Yeah.

A: So, I mean, she doesn't have to eat anything other than milk and dairy. I mean, meat.

Q: She does. She loves the meat, loves the milk. Constantly. The constipation will do rear enemas. 

A: Don't do enemas.

Q: No, no, no. Implants.

A: Okay.

Q: And that, for a while, was traumatizing her. Because we have to wait until she can sleep. Because she won't do it any other way. Not the positions that you were talking about earlier. It usually helps to pass it, but then, probably about two weeks into it, we have to do it again. We've been doing it for about two or three times a month.

A: That's good. That's very good. And she doesn't have to go every day. She can go once every five days. She's anemic. She's going to eat every bit of her food. How much of it should come out?

Q: What happens is when she does have it, she tries to pinch it off, but it hurts.

A: Hurts a bit, yeah.

Q: It does.

A: Well, at that time, I would put some fresh cream in to help her pass it easily.

Q: Okay.

A: Or butter. Melt the butter, even better. Melt some butter and squeeze that up in there.

Q: Okay. Okay, and so this constipation problem should, as she's getting the more bacteria...

A: The more bacteria. But she has to destroy it. She has an antibiotic that's growing in her body. Pineapple can destroy it. Lime juice can destroy it. Probably for her, pineapple would be better. Because lime juice has a tendency to destroy the good and the bad. I mean, lime juice has a tendency to destroy the good and the bad, but when there's too much of it, too much lime juice, it will only go after the bad first. The fungus that is not good. But the pineapple should be fine.

Q: Do you think it's penicillin or something?

A: I don't know. Well, it looks green, so it looks like there's some kind of tetracycline type. It doesn't look like penicillin. They gave her something else other than penicillin. Or they gave her penicillin and something else. But this is a green fungus, and that's usually some other antibiotic. When you have a penicillin, it's usually yellow. But you have yellow cast all over, around the bruised tissue. This is green. Does she like pineapple?

Q: She eats it once in a while.

A: That's all. You know, cube like this a week. Inch and inch by cube. You know, little pieces, give you a little piece a day. You know.

Q: Okay. [unintelligible]

A: It's fine. It's good.

Q: Okay. Okay.

A: Fruits are the only thing that aren't damaged with freezing. All of your dairy, butter, everything will be mitigated. When I did tests with animals, giving them frozen meat and raw meat, when they ate the frozen meat, within six weeks, six to eight weeks, they all got a skin disorder. One got it so bad it had scurvy. So, frozen, and the group that ate the same meat from the same animal, raw, without being frozen, no skin disorder. They were happy and fine. Then I took raw butter to do that experiment, because I know butter corrects any kind, raw butter will correct any kind of skin disease. So, I decided to freeze the same butter and to give one, the sick group, half of them the unfrozen raw butter and that frozen raw butter. Those who got the frozen butter took five times longer to heal. So, when Sally Fallon says, and everybody else says, freezing does not destroy nutrients, they are full of shit. No, if they were full of shit, they'd be really healthy. They were full of chemicals.

Q: So, coconut cream in the freezer is okay?

A: That has a lot of fat, that's different. But I still say it's okay. When you make ice cream, when I say you eat it right away, it hasn't had enough time to have a long stage breakdown. So, you eat it right away, you don't keep it refrigerated. It's not as bad. You will gain weight from it faster than if you eat it non-frozen, which is an indication that you may not digest it as well, and you may store more of it. But it's still okay. And for her, I would not give her the coconut cream with the pineapple. I would give her dairy cream and the pineapple. So mix a little dairy cream in the popsicles.

Q: Okay, anything else that we should not do as far as, you know, making the problem worse?

A: You put butter on her skin.

Q: Okay.

A: Butter on your skin will help draw out the poisons, help smother the fungus.

Q: Okay.

A: And you can put a little bit of pineapple in some butter and then blend it. And I mean it's like, say you have two ounces of butter and you have a little sugar cube the size of a pineapple. Blend that together and rub that into her skin. That will help also.

Q: Does the pineapple need to be on the slightly green side?

A: No.

Q: Okay.

A: It can be medium ripe.

Q: Okay.

A: In fact, if it's yellow for the skin, it probably would be even better because it's slightly alcohol-rich. And the body uses alcohols to break down certain substances and fat to digest it.

Q: Okay. Very good. Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Okay, are we going to call it an evening or do you want to hear some more questions and answers?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it's up to Kim if she needs to close the house down and leave or we know what your consensus is. More information?

Q: A little tidbit right now. Why peel the cucumbers?

A: Because the cucumbers are hard cellulose. See, the cucumber is a fruit, but the skin is a cellulose.

Q: Okay.

A: It's like a vegetation, so you're not going to digest it. It'll complicate things.

Q: Okay, I just made a big batch of green juice, so I actually juiced the cucumbers. So if I juiced the skin, then that's okay.

A: But it's still, you know, because they use petroleum to wax it.

Q: Yeah, I mean, it's organic, but in the future I'll peel it. I just want to know if my batch of juice is okay right now.

A: Well, it's truly organic, I would say, okay. Truly organic cucumbers are dull. There's no shiny finish on them.

Q: Okay.

A: They're a flat, dull finish. Anything that's slightly shiny has been, has had petroleum on it. And they can use 50% petroleum on it, so-called organic, according to the FDA. Which is not nice. I'm creating a new label. It's called BioEcoOrganic. And the FDA, I've trademarked it, and the FDA could not ever touch it. See, the FDA, in the 60s, well, mid-70s, decided they were going to rule and take over organic. Nobody had copyrighted the word or trademarked it. And you can't organic by itself, you can't trademark a single word. Like, I own, trademarked Primal Diet. I can't own Primal, and I can't own Diet, but I can own a combination of Primal Diet. So, I've trademarked BioEcoOrganic. So that, in the next few years, that'll be the key to let you know that not even 15%, chemicals of any form, I don't care if they're gibberellic acid, that's taken from rice bran or anything else, it is not an organic substance. Only thing that can be used in BioEcoOrganic are manure, urine, and compost.

Q: You want to take a look at this? I'm getting this in the mail. Two months ago, I got it in a formal letter on letterhead. And I don't know if I should just ignore it, or if I should tell them, please stop sending it to me. That was addressed to my daughter.

A: It's better to just ignore it. Don't make a noise about it. But of course, you know, whenever they go to school, if she's not going to be homeschooled, you know, you can send a note. Go to Sherri Tenpenny's website. She has a Facebook website and a regular website. And she's an MD that is pretty much an expert on all vaccines. And she has a book that tells you every state and how to get out of it. She names 12 or 13 states where there's no way to get out of it. She says move. Don't contaminate your children. Move from that state. Sherri, S-H-E-R-R-I, I think it is. And then two R's and then the I. Tenpenny, T-E-N-P-E-N-N-E-Y. If you put it close to that, the right website will say, do you mean this?

Q: We can opt out in Colorado.

A: Yes, you can opt out in Colorado. Absolutely. And you don't have to homeschool to opt out. 

Q: So, to what extent, when you talk about medical profession and pharmaceutical industry, FDA, to what extent do you think that it's actually bad people with malice or it's just good people who are misinformed?

A: I would say that in the top echelon, they're all bad with evil intent. To be in complete control and to make sure that people are too sick to be powerful. They do not want a new revolution. And let me tell you, if people were well, there would be a revolution now. When we're giving welfare to the rich, giving welfare to bankers, I mean, come on, give me a freaking break. Trillion, eight trillion dollars now, ten trillion dollars, and no accounting for it. So, it's a bad system. Most of your low level, like she was in the pharmaceutical industry, she totally believed them.

Q: I'd like to comment on that. They got you right out of college. And you know, you want to work hard, and you want to make a lot of money, and they pay you a lot of money right out of school. And I swear, I believed everything. I was telling all my family members to get on CupSid, and PrimoSec, and MediCor, and Beck saved them. And they get you, and they really train you, and literally brainwash you. And even up in the level, and I honestly believe that once you get to that most powerful level, where you find out the truth, then you're making so much money, like millions of dollars. And by that point, you have kids in college, you have a $3 million house, that you have a new BMW, and you're not going to give that up. Because you've worked really hard to get to that level, then you become the evil, not wanting to be. But I think that everybody's intentions are truly good intentions. And I know a lot of doctors working in the industry over almost 15, 18 years, they all really believe what they're doing is good. They really do. And the only thing that they're taught is here's the disease, and here's the drug that you give them. And that's all that they know. It really is. And I can tell you as a drug rep, we were told, you go in and when you're selling your vaccinations, you talk to that doctor and you say, Doc, you only get your mother in there that first year to the first two years of life. You've got to get as many vaccinations as you can into them. Because you only have them in there because that mother's scared for their child. And they believed every word we said. And I can tell you as a pharmaceutical rep, we made all of the rules as to how much pharmaceuticals are prescribed and the vaccinations were to be given. And we told the doctors and they just went, Okay, I'll put that up on my board. Every one of them did. Every single one of them. So their intentions are not bad. But they get to a level, they make so much money and the money is more important. They don't give it up. 

Q: Then I think some of them are sick at that point from the poisons that they've been eating.

Q: Right.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: You guys don't know, but Tisha who was sitting here, her son is a ER doctor at the Clinical Principal Hospital. They didn't vaccinate any of their children and they're all drinking raw milk.

A: I have probably 60 MDs on this diet and they leave my books in their office so people, patients coming and sitting waiting can read the books. These MDs saw what was happening, realized it, like she had to leave it. They had to leave it too. I've got doctors who are no longer practicing doctors. They're practicing nutrition or some kind of sports therapy or rehabilitation. They're not practicing drug use anymore.

Q: Where did you get your PhD?

A: Richmond University in London. Now, they came to me. Now, I've had three universities, three universities come to me and offered me honorary doctorates over the years because I started getting popular. Some very influential people were nominating me for a Nobel Peace Prize because of the way it changed people over and made them happy people and relaxed people rather than new, lovely people. It was getting a lot of press from 1997 on. So, I had a university in India that approached me and they offered me a doctorate and I said, why do I need a doctorate? You know, it doesn't change anything about me and it doesn't give me anything. It just straps me to the system and you think that I've got my degree from your school. Not going to happen. So, I didn't do it and I had another one from here offered and then this one offered from England and they have a lower biological BS degrees, bachelor of science degrees and in dietetics and nutrition but no PhDs in it. I said, I'll take you because you have nobody else to fly, you know, to do that. So, I'll take yours. So, I took theirs. It hasn't helped me at all. I thought, I will, you know, finally discovery, channel discovery has come after me to do a show on me four times. We've been in pre-production and everything, very elaborate to do it. Two days before the episode is going to be filmed, the New York office has to okay it. Every time they said, no, you cannot do that. That was it. So, the last time they came to me, I said, give me $3,000 up to $6,000 up front. We'll set it up and we'll start it. If you can cancel, I'll sue you. $3,000 to $6,000. And that stopped it right there. And Oprah Winfrey was going to have me on the show. And she found out the day before, the day before, she reads for the next day. And she says, this is a raw meat diet? No, absolutely not is that going on the show. That was it. I thought the doctor would get me somewhere. But it hasn't. People see raw meat and they freak out. It's stupid, but they freak out. They've been so brainwashed to believe that raw meat is dangerous. 

Q: Well, if you think that's also an addition to that, going back to what we were referring to, which is the politics.

A: Oh, and let me say one more thing. If they offered me the honorary doctorate and didn't give it to me, I had to do a test. I had to submit my books as my dissertation. Then they tested me on the books to make sure it was my information. When they gave, when Juilliard gave Bob Dylan an honorary doctorate, they didn't make him sit and sing for them. An honorary doctorate is an honorary doctorate. You don't have to test, you don't have to do anything. They just invite you to receive their doctorate, and that's it.

Q: That was the un-honorary option there.

A: So go ahead, I'm sorry.

Q: Oh no, I was just referring to the politics of the economics. [unintelligible] I worked in the health insurance industry, and that is the one other industry that's equal, if not worse, and more powerful, and has more money and influence. I worked for Cigna, and of course that's the...

A: Oh gosh, huge.

Q: [unintelligible] and what they then train and teach, because they're the only ones who actually can tell physicians what to do, and they tell the pharmaceutical companies and other companies. So when you get the evils of health insurance, which is the biggest money out there, with the pharmaceuticals, that is what's driving this information, all to do with commerce, politics, economics.

A: It's all down to money and power.

Q: So then your understanding of chemistry, with food, with the body, all the health...

A: But let me tell you, I still think what I say is bullshit. I use that because it takes intellectuals, because I've taken their information and made it weave it, made it work. The only true truth is, does it work, and repeatedly. And on how many people, in what percent. That's what I go on, that is my law. All the stuff that I say, that's just to get you to open your mind to experiment and do it. As far as I'm concerned, I'm full of shit. In my intellectual, but I have to be intellectual with you, or you won't get it. You just won't get it. 

Q: I can never regurgitate what you, even if I listen to it a thousand times, I can never regurgitate the science behind it, in order to open family and friends to the thought.

A: That's why I wrote the book to seduce them. That's why I wrote the book. People read that story, and my publisher did a test. He gave it to some very cynical people and doctors. When they finished that, 95 out of 100, he tested 500 people, 95 out of 100 said, it's very logical and it's possibly true. Even the famous researcher, Ralph Moss, said, this is bullshit, but I went out and bought my nuts, and my fruits, and my everything else, in his criticism of me. Now here's a man, Ralph Moss, he's the one that was for the pharmaceutical industry, doing the work with laetrile. And he was doing these tremendous things with these laboratory animals. Yet the pharmaceutical industry didn't want him to reveal that information. They didn't want a cure for cancer. But it didn't work on laetrile, in the lab work with the animals, it didn't work with humans. But he was the one that came out and said, I'm going out, and created a news press, release, and said, this is what laetrile is doing, we should really investigate it. The university, the pharmaceutical houses, fired him. He's an independent researcher now. And he investigates everything. But he doesn't really do any research anymore. And he came and listened to my lecture at the Cancer Research Society. And, you know, came and interviewed me and all of that, and we talked about it. And he said, you know, can I interview your patients? And I said, give me a call, here's my email address. He never called. And then he goes online and writes a report, nobody's ever talked to his cancer patients, yet, a woman just like that, Elnora Van Winkle, a physicist and biochemist, who was responsible for cataloging over a 47 year period, all of the chemicals in the brain, for Millhauser labs, and at Columbia University in New York. She, I gave her my list of people, she called everyone, and found that, 95% of them were still alive, and doing very well, and only 5% had died. So she went, she wrote a report, it's on the back of the recipe book, that she said, the statistics on Aajonus' diet, are true, they're realistic. You know, so, and she went on the diet, and changed her frickin' life, and you know, she did this really skinny thing, and she was getting up there, late 60's, went on the diet, started putting away, had more energy, and felt great, and then she went into, Instincto. And Instinctos eat what they, smells good to them, and tastes to them. So she went into heavy fruit, she was dead in a year. Stopped eating all the fat, and everything, died dead in a year. Stupid. She should have known, fats are the most important for her, because she was so skinny. You think she was skinny, she was 10, 15 pounds lighter than you, when she came in. That skinny. 

Q: I don't think I'm skinny, you think I'm skinny.

[laughter]

A: Okay, let's have a vote. How many people think she's skinny? Alright. Okay, that's everybody. Just because you have few spots of cellulite, doesn't mean you're fat. Remember, cellulite is congested fat, hardened fat, from usually vegetable oils, and toxins are in them, and the body's not going to dissolve, let that go, until the right amount of fats infiltrate the whole body. Then the body will start working on that cholesterol, swell it up so it looks horrendous, and then it will break it down gradually and go away, and you'll never have cholesterol again.

Q: How does it get, like, how does it start coming out of the body? Is it through urine?

A: Through the skin, it's supposed to, through hot baths. Or you can put hot water bottles around you, cover yourself at night, put towels under you, and sweat like a pig.

Q: Can you, I mean, doesn't, if you exercise and you wear something so that the heat is...

A: What's the hottest the body can get even under exercise?

Q: So it doesn't get up to... 

A: 100 degrees. That is it, maximum.

Q: But why is it...

A: I don't care if you sweat like a pig. 

Q: ...you can get a fever of 105.

A: Pardon?

Q: I've had a fever of, like, 105 or 107, and when I exercise, sometimes I feel like I'm that hot, too.

A: No, you're not. Take your temperature. I've done it with athletes. Never over 100 degrees. Unless they're going through a cold or a flu at the time where the body is raising the temperature to get rid of stuff like that. That's why it goes into high fevers.

Q: What if you wear, like, a big, warm suit?

A: It doesn't work. I've had people wear sweatsuits, like, you know, surfboarders, and run on a treadmill. Body doesn't get any over 100 degrees. 

Q: You do sweat out toxins. You just can't break down these vegetable oils.

A: Hardened fats. Crystallized fats. They have to be melted.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Just using uric acid and lactic acid, the end product of utilizing your fat as fuel.

Q: [unintelligible] What do you call this system? The lymphatic system, which is all along the surface, right? It's, like, close in.

A: No, it's deep. It's everywhere. It goes through every part of your body. But it dumps under the skin. And look at you. You've got plenty under there you're not perspiring out.

Q: I need to take baths again.

A: Just relax. See, and you've got way too much for a man. That's what a woman should have under there. You should be like this.

Q: Yeah, yeah. I stopped bathing for a while.

A: Well, don't do that.

Q: These lymphatic baths. You have me on a lymphatic bath.

A: Yeah. Everybody should be doing lymphatic baths.

Q: Well, my question is...

A: But if you're too thin, you want to wait until you put on enough weight.

Q: Well, I've put on like 15 pounds the last time I saw you, which was a year ago.

A: Yeah, but that's a good thing, because you need it for the toxins in your body. Your eyes are cleaner and more relaxed. Take that weight off. If you hadn't put that weight on, you'd still have those toxins irritating you. You'd be darker, and your liver would be more damaged. But your whole body is more relaxed, even when you're big.

Q: So, my question with lymphatic baths is that... I don't get to the point where I feel like I'm too hot, but I become very dehydrated. And I just want to drink anything.

Q: Oh, I so relate to that.

A: I've got a sport drink that you make and take with you. And also milk. The sport drink is... 2 to 3 cups of watermelon. Well, 2 cups of watermelon, 1 cup of cucumber puree. So you've got 3 cups there. You've got about 1 tablespoon of vinegar. Or a little less. 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. 1 tablespoon of lime juice. 3 to 4 tablespoons of honey. 2 tablespoons of coconut cream. 2 tablespoons of dairy cream. And 2 eggs. Blend that all together and that will make a good quart. Cucumber and watermelon. You don't juice those, you blend them into a puree. So you're going to have a thick substance. And you peel the cucumber. Of course, you peel the watermelon. Take the green off.

Q: Did you say water in that or not?

A: With that combination, no. If you're using only cucumber, sometimes I say water. If you're using tomatoes and you're using cucumber because you don't have watermelon, then yeah, you can put some water in it. 3 or 4 ounces of water. So when you can't get watermelon, you use like a cup of tomato and 2 cups of cucumber puree. Tomato puree and cucumber.

Q: And a half a cup of water.

A: And a half a cup of water. And all the other ingredients are the same.

Q: Can you [unintelligible]?

A: You sip it. You just keep sipping it. Keep sipping it. You let it roll around in your mouth. Drink it. Have some honey and butter there too. Just a half a teaspoon of butter once in a while. 

Q: And it doesn't have to be a pineapple drink that we do with water.

A: You have to do that too. But that has to be consumed as soon as you get in the bath. Or right before you get in the bath.

Q: It just doesn't interfere with it.

A: No, it doesn't interfere.

Q: Does it help with dehydration?

Q: Yeah. I'm so thirsty. I can't stand it.

Q: I'm sorry. In the absence of watermelon, there was a half a cup of water and how much tomato?

A: A cup of tomato puree. Two cups of cucumber puree.

Q: Tablespoon vinegar.

A: Pardon?

Q: Tablespoon vinegar.

A: Yeah, only a tablespoon of vinegar. Unless you have congestive arteries that are pretty bad, then you could use two table spoons of vinegar.

Q. So it's like once or twice a week? If you could really do it twice a week, would be good?

A: Twice a week is good.

Q: Pineapple each time?

A: I had a man who did it every day for almost three months.

Q: Well, that's an idea.

A: Changed his whole life.

Q: I can do that.

A: He only did it four days a week. Well, I want you to do the 45 minute baths five days a week.

Q: That's an hour.

A: No, let's do just the 45 every day, seven days a week. Until you get rid of the stuff under the skin. Then you can go for the long ones for deeper.

Q: Should I do that too, 45 minutes?

A: Well, yours isn't too bad underneath the skin. So you can do five days, 45 minutes. And then two days with your hour and a half.

Q: I read about a case recently where a woman was losing weight constantly. Diarrhea, vomiting. It looked like she was certainly going to die. The doctor who was an MD had tried a whole lot of different things. And as a last resort, he decided to take some of the intestinal flora from her husband in a saline solution and give it to her. And it seemed to work. So my question is about salt, actually. It has an effect on the cells in the body, obviously. But how does it relate with bacteria?

A: Well, salt can destroy bacteria. That's why the Jews have kosher meats. Because when you soak it in salt, it stops all of the microbial activity. And you have to understand when that Hebrew Bible was written, the Torah was written, that was a time when the Jews were living in the desert. They had no caves to cool anything in. You know, in the caves, let's say, they got down to maybe 68 degrees. That's not cooling food enough, not meat. So, you know, they drained the blood because that would cause it to break down quicker. And the thing was, that's clean, you know. The hierarchy was, clean meats.

Q: Does that technique that they use sound like a viable thing to you, to kind of kick-start that process?

A: The body needs bacteria, absolutely. But it wasn't, it was, they used the husband's fecal matter.

Q: Right, yeah.

Q: So, putting salt on the meat just made me think of something. There's a lot of people that have asked me about, like, emergency preparedness. Saving food, how do we do it in a primal diet way? Can we do it by making biltong, you know, meats into biltong? Making it into, you know, putting the salt on it to cure the meats and preserve them?

A: So, do you want headaches, do you want to be, do you want to have problems in that emergency situation? Or are you going to kill each other?

Q: Well, you can't get meat for a period of time.

A: No, but like I said, I think I have it in the recipe book. You take meat and you put it, immerse it, you know, you cut it and you put it in strips in half gallon jars or quart jars. Quart jars are probably a little bit better. Then you pour vegetable oil, peanut oil I use in vegetable oil. Now, it's not going to get into the meat thoroughly, but it's going to get some of that oil into the meat. And then you seal the top with beeswax. I kept it, I did it for, even though I didn't believe it was going to happen, Y2K. So I kept about 30 pounds of deer, like that. And I broke open the last one this year and I still ate it. 

Q: How long ago, 10 years ago?

A: 10 years. There was a man who took, like I mentioned in the book, there's a scientist who used a kefir, you know, a buttermilk, to keep his meat for 10 years. If it stinks, that's fine. It's pre-digested a bit. The bacteria's already pre-digested some of it. But when you use the olive oil, bacteria doesn't grow in olive oil well. Not at all, so it preserves it. Peanut oil is the same way, it preserves it. I used some in some coconut oil that fermented and decayed a bit, but I was still able to eat it. It was more nourishing than the peanut oil soaked in the olive oil. But you don't have to put a lot of oil in. You put the olive oil in there first, just a little bit, like a half a cup. And you start stuffing the meat in there. And when you see, you'll see the olive oil start coming up on the sides. Then you pour a little bit more in, and you keep stuffing the meat in until it covers the top of the meat. But there's not much olive oil in there, really, just enough to go in between the meat slices to preserve it.

Q: Sounds kind of good.

A: It actually was. Every time I ate it, it was really good. But the time that I ate the really not-so-tasting, good-tasting stuff, was the coconut oil and the meat. Boy, I was charged. I didn't sleep for three days.

Q: He is putting the beeswax around the top, too, because I did that technique one time, and when I opened it, it smelled like there was something, like botulism, or something around the edge, maybe.

A: Botulism only [unintelligible].

Q: Okay, but could that have been from the metal lid that was on there?

A: Well, if it were, it would only be in the wax on top, and it would never set.

Q: Yeah, I didn't put beeswax on. I just put the lid on.

A: Well, I would just cut the top off, pour the top off.

Q: Okay, so if I scraped the top off, it would have been...

A: But you'll see botulism is black.

Q: Right, it was black.

A: Oh, it was black?

Q: Yeah. So, I could have scraped it off, and it would have been...

A: Yeah.

Q: Speaking of the lids, I was using the canning lids before without the enamel coating, like the Kerr brand ones, and I actually had a thing of apple cider vinegar sitting in my cabinet for years. I kind of forgot about it. It fumes or whatever from the apple cider vinegar. It wasn't actually touching the lid. It went through the lid and was coming through the top of it.

A: Absolutely.

Q: And the enamel will hold up well enough that if you were to have a similar substance and you put it in the back of a cupboard and forget about it, it starts kind of growing a mother the way that...

A: It may make a hole in the enamel and get into the metal, and you might see black leaking out of one or two spots. So, it still will. Well, as I say, if you put a sealer on top of that with beeswax, then you just take the beeswax out and toss it. Take that lid and toss it. Okay, guys, we're going to end it now.

Q: Awesome. Thank you.

Q: Thank you.

Q: Every time you come, I always think there should be 500 people here.

A: Do you know in Finland that's the way it was?

Q: Really?

A: I made them wait seven years before I went. By the time I got there, there were 500 people, and half of them were vegetarians. After my lecture and for the next month, half of those were no longer vegetarians. They published my books in Finnish. So, my books are in finnish.

Q: And they keep coming out as the healthiest and the most sophisticated political system.

A: Yeah, the Finnish. They eat lots of raw fish and aged and decayed and rotten fish. Even shark. It's one of their niceties. Their gourmet foods. And you know, shark is nasty because, and shark and stingray are very nasty because they grow in ammonia faster and ammonia can be poisonous. It can actually kill you, even if it's natural ammonia. I had to do it after I was poisoned with those injections. When I got a stingray and let it age, you know, it happened to be a day old already, so it's very high in ammonia. And I was so dizzy and sick from that ammonia that I had to do it. You know, get rid of the poison injections. I ate it, you know. I couldn't chew it. It was so bad, the ammonia was burning my mouth, almost bleeding. So I had to take a knife and chop and chop and chop until I could just wash it down with coconut water.

Q: What does that actually do to help you through that process?

A: Well, ammonia helps you, like the cigarette industry used an ammonia product to make sure that you utilize the nicotine quickly. It was absorbed into the body. So I used the ammonia to break down the vaccine components. And I was eating, you know, as much fat as I could, animal fat, to bind with it. So I wanted to make sure it was broken down into a small enough substance so it didn't get stuck in the liver or in the intestines or somewhere like that. And then you need some ammonia to break it down, like a water softener. When you have a water softener, it doesn't soften water. It breaks down the minerals into smaller particles so they don't, they aren't hard, they don't crystallize. So I could perspire it out of the body faster. But man, I was passing out, I was going dizzy, everything. But I made it through in about 48 hours.

Q: How did you know how much it took?

A: I was going on instinct. Take my time, let my body tell me, okay, this is how much. And then when my body said, no more, I couldn't actually put it in my mouth. This is impossible. Once you've been healthy long enough, then you can start communicating with your body. But right now, most people's instincts are not very good. 

Q: You know, like a few times I went past the no more signal, and I was like rolling on the ground. And now when I hear it, I'm like...

A: Okay, that's enough. But you're enough weight now. You're perfect weight.

Q: I used to be able to eat all that stuff, but now the food is so damn rich.

A: Well, you're doing great.

Q: I wanted to clarify about people who spend all their time in the ocean. It's not a good thing?

A: They should have some oil on their skin. Coconut oil is best. Butter, olive oil, something to protect their skin. Because the salt will eat into that top two layers of skin. Anytime I go in, I coat my body with coconut cream. Okay.

Q: I'm glad you said that, because I'm about to go to Australia. My daughter's getting married. Okay, and your resources for Australia?

A: Pardon?

Q: Your resources for Australia?

A: Yeah, you can get in touch with Barbara Morgan, you know, and there are other people there.

Q: Okay.

Q: Queensland, right?

A: Yeah. 

Q: Gold Coast, yeah.

A: Brisbane, around that area.

Q: Okay.

Q: So you're into spearfishing?

A: Oh, yeah. It's very hard. The first time I did it, I didn't get anything that day. And my stomach hurt from cocking that thing. And it was very, very turbulent waters in Thailand.

Q: Go off Koh Samui?

A: Koh Samui, yeah. Koh Samui.

Q: I just bought a Bahama Hawaiian sling, have you seen those?

A: No. 

Q: So it's a manual and they make it for the Bahamas. It has no string on it. So if you shoot the shaft, you have to be sure you have enough air to go chase the shaft. And so you shoot down at the fish or across towards the shallows. But they do it because it keeps the people from decimating the fish population.

A: Right, yeah.

Q: But I'm all psyched about it because it's like bow and arrow but underwater.

A: Well, I take my crossbow underwater now.

Q: Oh, you do?

A: And I have a 50-pound nylon string with a thing that unravels. So, yeah, I've got my crossbow in there.

Q: Yeah, I heard about that. I heard it's pretty cool.

A: It's illegal, but I do it anyway.

Q: In the Philippines?

A: Anywhere it's illegal to spear fish with a crossbow. Because it's so easy to cock. You've got a plate in there, a little bracket. You just hold it down, you go cock, put your arrow in and shoot. That easy.

Q: But you lose the arrow.

A: You've got to pull it into your stomach. They make it very difficult so you don't get lost.

Q: And you lose your arrow, right?

A: No, it has a string on it.

Q: Oh. I'm totally into that. I did that down in Mexico. I was like a predator. I loved it.

A: Yeah, yeah.

Q: Can I ask you one more question?

A: Uh-huh.

Q: Have you ever heard of detached irises on people?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay, I think that might be happening with me. So what do you suggest?

A: Lots of eggs.

Q: Lots of eggs.

A: Lots of eggs.

Q: And eggs is good for you.

A: And also, now you think that because there are a lot of nerves in the eyes, that fish or chicken would be better, but red meat always affects the eyes better. Strengthens the eyes.

Q: Okay.

A: Red meat and eggs.

Q: Okay.

A: Steak tartare is a good thing.

Q: Okay, very good.

A: Now, steak tartare with the egg yolk, not just the egg white. I always down the egg white first, and they have the egg yolk with the meat.

Q: Okay.

A: Do you know steak tartare?

Q: I've never really had it.

A: Chopped meat with egg yolk. Then they usually put capers and salt on it. When I go to a restaurant, I say, no capers, no salt. Just chop up a tiny bit of onion. Crush a little garlic if you want. And, of course, chop the meat. And put the egg yolk in there. And put the egg white in a little cup on the side. That's what happens. And I tell them sometimes they'll chop a little parsley or some tomatoes and I can eat that instead.

Q: Is it possible for anybody who wants to come to my Iridology reading to be there to see... I think it would be interesting for people to see my eyes eight years ago, you know, compared to today. I mean, I'm welcome to send an email out when I figure out what my time will be. I'm just going to put myself in wherever there's time. But anybody's invited to take a look at that. Because it's incredibly inspiring when you see from one year, first year, even two years later or three years later, the difference, the rebuilding and the decontamination that happens. So I'd be more than happy to let anybody see that.

A: But if we do that, we're going to have to schedule an hour and a half instead of just...

Q: Well, we can put me at the end of the day or I don't know.

A: I don't care. It can be any time as long as you have to schedule an hour and a half.

Q: Okay. Okay. I just think it'd be really inspiring for people to see it.

Q: Awesome.

Q: Thank you.

Q: See you tomorrow.

A: For whom? For me. For real?

Q: Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's all kids eat. That's all they need.

Q: She loves fish, too. And lately she's been, you know, taking eggs and biting the shell. I don't know where she gets that, but it's interesting.

A: It's natural.

Q: She wanted to eat the eggshell. She's not all that interested in even the white or the yolk, but she likes to bite the shell.

A: Right. Better than biting the nail.

Q: Yeah, true.
