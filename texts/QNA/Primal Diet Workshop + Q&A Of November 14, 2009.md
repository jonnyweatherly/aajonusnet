A: Ok we are going to begin. My name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz and I got into health by being very sickly. I was born into a very violent household. I had a brother who was still in diapers when I was born. And he never forgave me for taking mom's attention away in the snap I ate at home. So he would do everything to torture me. And he found that if he pushed me on something rusty, my mother who's a nurse would take me to the doctors and I'd get a tetanus shot. And then I'd be very very sick for weeks. So that was his favorite thing to do, find something rusty to make sure that I got on it. And back then it was believed that a tetanus shot would last a year. Now they say five years. Depends upon how much money the pharmaceutical industry wants to make, how they determine the longevity of a tetanus shot. But at that time it was a year, but they were giving them to me every three months. My mother saw lockjaw one time in all of her career, at least that's what she's told is lockjaw. Because I've looked all over the records in major universities and never found a case of true lockjaw. Lockjaw that was really MS or some other disease that had nothing to do with tetanus. Whether there really is a disease called tetanus, that's another issue. But anyway, mercury, they have 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury in a tetanus shot. They have the liquid aluminum, they have formaldehyde, and they have other ingredients like squalene. All of them are poisonous individually, and when you put the soup together, they're very poisonous. So the third one, when I was 18 months old, caused me to be autistic. So I was unable to communicate with language. I couldn't relate to hieroglyphs on a page relating to a complex word, even word, or phrase, or sentence. So I had no concept, my brain absolutely did not work in that area. So by the time I was 8 years old, I learned to parrot. So I'd repeat the phrases that I heard at home when I heard some other sound that sounded similar to what I should be addressing. So when I got into school, I grew up in Catholic schools, and the nuns were pretty rough back then. And of course, the kind of phrases I heard at home were, shut up, sit down, you're stupid, go away. So when I would repeat these to the nuns, they weren't happy. And the priests, I was constantly getting abused because of that. In my family, you laughed when you said, you're an idiot, you're stupid, you know. So I didn't really know what these meant, and I thought, that was what you say, and I wanted to show everybody I wasn't stupid. So I just put out these phrases even though I didn't know what they meant. So that's how my life went continually for 22 years. I had always chose to sit next to a girl who was very sensitive in the class, one of the smarter ones, and I would cheat and copy the hieroglyphs off from their pages onto mine. To me it was just art, it's hieroglyphs, but I knew that if I copied it from a particular person that always got accolades and everybody liked, then I was bound to be liked too. So that's what I did, I cheated. Many times the translation from someone else's desk to my page, my paper, wasn't even a letter. So I couldn't even get the concept of the letter T meaning something, or any letter.  

So I wasn't quite, and everybody wrote differently, so I was very confused about anything at all. So I would actually write a person's exact handwriting. So it was like a duplicate of their paper with a few mistakes because of the translation and visualization and trying to sneak peeks into my paper. But I got to school doing that. Because I talked that way to other children, of course I got beat up a lot. So by the time I was eight years old I learned to pick a big kid in school, no matter what age he was, and beat the hell out of him, sucker punch him and just beat the hell out of him that first year. So everybody left me alone for the rest of the year. So that's how I survived being able to talk unkindly to people not knowing that I was. But that's how I got by with it. I was keeping colds anywhere from three to five months every year. I was bedridden for usually three months of the year. I had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue from as young as I can remember. Getting out of the bed every day was the greatest effort in the world because I ached everywhere. So moving, especially during the winter here in Cincinnati, was very difficult for me. So I would wait until the heater came on. My father was raised on a farm, so he would turn the heat off completely at night. To him, it was no big thing. To me, it was traumatic. So to get me out of bed, it took a belt. So I got the belt a lot. That's the way my morning started. So I just kept deteriorating and deteriorating. After the third polio vaccine, when I was 15 1⁄2, it made me diabetic, juvenile diabetic, and gave me angina pectoris. So I was having about three heart attacks a week, and I had 300 heart attacks from the age of 15 1⁄2 to the age of 22. Fifty of them put me unconscious. I didn't die in any of them. And remember, I was autistic at this time. So my mother and the people at school, teachers, the principal, saw me go unconscious after grabbing my chest and my whole arm, and I would fall unconscious. So they took my mother, took me to friends of hers who were cardiologists and gave me all the exams. They only looked for congestive heart failure or malformation. I didn't have either, so they said it's all in his head. Take him to a psychiatrist. I was autistic. It's all in my head, right? No, it was the mercury, formaldehyde, the liquid aluminum, and all the other ingredients in the polio vaccine that went to my heart muscles. And what do some of those ingredients cause? They cause cramping in the muscles, a charley horse. And that's what a heart attack is many times when it's chemically generated. So a lot of the people who are having heart attacks out there who do not have congestive heart failure or malformation, deformation of the heart, like a valve or a hole in the heart, they have poisons in their muscle tissue in the heart. And that's all the heart is, is the muscle tissue. So that, and they are always sent to a psychiatrist saying it's all in their head, and they take psychotropic medication that doesn't correct the situation, and they continue with heart attacks all the time or soreness going all the way through their body, projecting from the chest area, and they have no recourse for it. They stay on these medications.

It keeps them malfunctioning, unable to function in society very well. So the medical profession is not your friend. Remember, the medical profession is run by the pharmaceutical industry. The pharmaceutical industry writes all the procedure manuals for doctors and Mercks is this thick. And if you read through that, which it's biased to, surgeries that the result of eternal medication, anywhere from 5 to 15 medications per surgery. Your thyroid is removed. You have to take a thyroxine and multiple other medications to supplement that. If you have other surgeries, a gallbladder, you're forever taking other medications. The more surgeries you have, the more reliant upon medication they say you should be. So if you want to address health, do you go to a pharmaceutical house which is interested in profits and not your health? That's like me going to the guy flipping hamburgers at the corner to learn how to be a millionaire. Do I go to Donald Trump or somebody like that? Or do I go to the guy flipping hamburgers? So if you want to know about health and you go to a doctor, you're sadly mistaken. You're going to the wrong person. That person knows nothing about health. They study disease and drugs, period, and that's it. They know nothing about health. Absolutely nothing. And when they talk about what you should eat, they have no experience in diet. They have zero training. No hours in any of their education. Yet they will be arrogant enough to tell you what you should eat and what you should not eat. That's insane. This all started when Rockefeller and Carnegie started supporting colleges with grants to make medicines so they could make profits. They robbed all of our ability to know anything. All of the people who were herbalists were called quacks. They demonized anybody who had a natural healing ability with anything that had to do with foods or herbs. Take a look at it. A hundred years ago, you couldn't even become a carpenter without 12 to 15 years apprenticeship. Now we have people going to colleges, learning all this trash information, and when they go out there, they're supposed to be experts. And nobody has any wisdom because nobody does the work. That's where I said wrong. When I trained, I had a nutritionist that trained me from the age of 22 to the age of 27. And I saw the mistakes of what he was telling me to do. So then I said, when I was 27 years old, I said, that's it. I'm not going to accept anything unless it works. And I'm going to take years. So I experimented many, many years before I even wrote my book. And I wrote the book from 1990 to 1997, We Want to Live. And it was based on experience, not on theoretics. People come out of colleges, they get into nutrition and they're new. Because they have good adroit minds, they think that what they think is right. Take, for instance, Joseph Mercola. Good intentions, wants to help people. He went from using medication into diet. So he worked with me for about six months.

And finally, he would call me before he wrote his newsletters, he'd do everything. That's why he got into using raw milk and raw dairy and all those kind of things. And I said, listen Joseph, I said, people ask me about you, whether they should go to you or not. And I say, Joseph is new to this. He doesn't really know, he has no wisdom in it. He has theory, he has what I tell him and other people he reads. And he mixes all of this information and then comes up with his own ideas. If they're applicable or not, he doesn't know, he doesn't even see patients. How could he know anything? So Joe hung up on me and that's the last time he ever called me. So take a look at that. Now he's making 40 million dollars a year selling supplements. Supplements are chemicals, they're not food. Once you take a substance, whether it's from food or whatever, you isolate it. To isolate it you have to use wood alcohol and heat or kerosene derivative. Now how many of you would soak your food in wood alcohol for 30 minutes or kerosene and then rinse it off and eat it? I don't see one hand. Well that's what you do every time you take a supplement. Now a lot of people are putting out, oh we've got all natural supplements. How are the supplements made? They'll go to a pharmaceutical house and say, I want to make a natural vitamin. Can you do it? All natural. Nothing unnatural. All from food. And the laboratory wants the work. Millions of dollars for them. And they'll say, sure we can make it. So what they're not telling everybody is that they have to use a kerosene derivative. Kerosene's natural. That doesn't mean it's healthy. When alcohol's natural, that doesn't mean it's healthy. And the processes all through it. They deceive the producer of these vitamins. This is, I want this. And then the laboratory makes their money. It is all money oriented. It is not health oriented. The person who went to have the vitamin made, the supplement made, sure had good intentions. Take vitamin D. 99% of the vitamin D out there is vegetable oil that's subjected to radioactive material. Does that sound like the sun's vitamin D that's made in your skin with fats on your skin? Absolutely not. Highly toxic. Vitamin A basically is made similarly. Take carotene and add it to some vegetable oil and call that vitamin A. Vitamin E is the worst. 99% of it comes from Fuji and Kodak. And where do they still get it now that they're not using developing fluid? Because that's what it is, developing fluid. They were spending hundreds of millions of dollars storing this waste product, developing fluid, into barrels that had to be buried in 12-foot thick concrete tombs. They had to be stainless steel cauldrons, 55 to 100 gallons. Very expensive. Lots of land making these tombs underground. So Fuji and Kodak were spending millions and millions of dollars a year with scientists trying to figure out how they could neutralize this substance and make it into something harmless or recyclable. Weren't able to do it. 

Hundreds of millions of dollars later, a scientist comes along and he's looking at the structure of those molecules and says, oh, this is 70% of the structure of d-alpha-tocopherol, vitamin E. Let's call it vitamin E. We can convince the FDA, because we can argue all of this structure is 70% like vitamin E. We can tell them that it is a different kind of vitamin E. And then we put it in capsules and sell it to everybody. So 99% of the vitamin E out there comes from that. The other 1% comes from either corn or soybeans. So if you get an all-natural one, or one that has natural vitamin E, it's labeled by natural vitamin E, you'll have five international units per 100. Yes, rest is Fuji and Kodak developing fluid. They have enough for another 80 years in their vaults. Now that mainly there's very little developing anymore. People are using digital cameras. But they still get to sell that as vitamin E and make hundreds of millions of dollars a year. Let's take a look at that. Don't take any supplement. Once it's rendered into a hard pill form or any liquid, it is then again a rock form. If you want to get some of those nutrients, as long as it's in vitamin E, if you put those substances into your compost pile, feed it to your plants, the plants will make it into a substance you can utilize. You juice the plants or feed them to your animals, and it will enrich them. But for us, indigestible and toxic, especially if they have kerosene or wood alcohol. Sure, the earth can break it down. Soil organisms can, but we can't. Not even the bacteria in our intestines. So, let's get back to my story. So at 15 and a half, I got angina pectoris, heart attacks, because they couldn't find any malformation or congestion. They just treated me with psychotropic drugs for a few months, and then I completely hid my heart attacks. I would completely go relax and act like I was sleeping, so that I would not be abused anymore by the doctors. So they would not know I was having heart attacks. I would hold my stomach instead of my heart, so they'd think I had indigestion. And then when I would pass out, they'd just think I went to sleep. And they pretty much left me alone when they found that I couldn't be handled. And, you know, by that time, Elvis Presley and James Dean were the big things, so I imitated their stances. I started smoking at eight years old. When I started smoking at eight years old to give me the energy, I also started going into the kitchen at night and taking the coffee that my parents left and were going to dump down the drain in the morning when they made fresh coffee. I would put that in a jar, put it under the bed to give me some energy. So I was smoking to get the nicotine to give me energy, and I was taking coffee and eating lots of chocolate with theophylline and theobromine in it to stimulate me. And I would go through a box of chocolate-covered cherries in about 40 minutes, and they were 50 to a box. So, of course, my diabetes was off the chart. I was injecting myself all the time. And, of course, I'd go up and down with that. Of course, the behavior when you're diabetic is you're emotional. You're never relaxed. You're never at ease. Sugar levels going up and down all the time.

One minute you can be screaming with a knife in your hand you're going to kill somebody. The next minute you're loving and kissing them. It is an irrational, chemical process of handling diabetes. If you look back in the records of Hippocrates who was called, so-called, the modern doctor of medicine. Take a look at it. Hippocrates said, let food be your medicine, let medicine be your food. We're not doing any of that and yet we praise him as the father of modern medicine. Those are all tactics to confuse you. Hippocrates, he was considered the greatest healer on the planet of all the technicians out there. With that record, the medical profession has used him as their icon and yet he was against all chemicals. He only used food. When he would give somebody who had diabetes, he would give them only a raw food diet for six to ten weeks. Their diabetes would be completely gone. Six to ten weeks on a raw milk diet, nothing but raw milk. That's all they were allowed. We're too toxic now for that to work. Some diabetics that I get, none of them are diabetic anymore. I've had over 120 and none of them are diabetic. You just have to get the pancreas working, period. And properly, you have to give the pancreas the nutrients it needs to make the proper insulins to do the work. And stop eating all the sugars. Human wasn't meant for that, but I'll get into that in the workshop end of it. So, I got sicker and sicker, weaker and weaker, so I had to rely upon more and more drugs. By the time I was 16, I was taking amphetamines, smoking two and a half packs of Lucky Strikes, non-filters a day, one after another. And I would, to really get the high energy from it, I was a fiend. I would take a cigarette and I would go... Until it just burned, and that would give me more energy. And that end would be like, my mother would say, Stop, you look like a fiend. I said, I am. I am, yes. And then I started drinking to go to sleep at night because then I had so much energy I couldn't sleep. So, I started drinking alcohol. So, I was drinking up to a fifth of gin or bourbon a night to sleep. And this was at 16 years old, so by the time I was 19, I'd created an ulcer. Now, in that time, I was kicked out, I was expelled from a Catholic high school, Roger Bacon, because I was considered a disciplinary problem, because I was still autistic. The priest couldn't stand to be told, Shut up, go to hell, things like that. So, I was expelled the first day of my sophomore year and put into Finneytown High School. And it was a good thing, I mean, there weren't any blacks, there weren't anybody but white bread people. But they were people who cared. They looked at me, realized I had a learning problem, they put me in certain classes with certain teachers, and even though I really can't say that I learned a lot, I learned compassion from different people for the first time in my life. These people cared. It was an unusual experience. So, I was much happier, I wasn't in fear every day, no matter what I did. And I didn't feel I was compelled to talk and say things. So, I was more silent than I'd ever been. And it was good for me getting through that. 

However, I was still very sick, I was smoking a lot, doing a lot of things. I met a girl there who was a year older than I was, not a year older, but older grade. She was older than I, but not a full year. And she was a grade more advanced than I. She and I had some kind of rapport that surmounted dialogue. So, we could be together and just laugh and look into each other's eyes. And it was wonderful. And she didn't live with me, she didn't have to be with me. I'd learned enough dialogue from watching Elvis Presley movies and James Newton movies to know the right things to say to a woman. Although I didn't know what the hell I was saying, I knew they were nice things. So, this is what she heard. I knew I had to say them only a few times every day and every night. So, everything was cool. So, she got pregnant and we got married and then we had to live together. I was just finishing my junior year. We got married in my junior year. And then when it came summer time, she graduated six months pregnant. And nobody knew... or five months pregnant. Nobody knew because she did exercises, wore sweaters. So, she got out of school. We got an apartment together. And then she realized she was living with an idiot. So, things got more complicated. Then the baby was born just a month later in the first week of September, second week of September. And then, you know, I was going to school in the mornings. I had to take care of the baby in the afternoon and go to work at night. So, we didn't see one another. And then, of course, I was drinking heavily after the baby. She didn't want to be touched. The baby was so big that it ripped... They did an episiotomy, but still the baby was so large it ripped her all the way up to the rectum and beyond. So, she didn't want to be touched sexually. I didn't understand all that. I was 17 years old and an idiot at that because I had no way of understanding her education. Not that you have to have education to be smart because most of your primitive tribes are very bright people. And I've been with quite a few of them in the last 10 years. And quite a few of them back in the mid-70s. And you can have intelligence without having education. However, if you've got a chemical in your brain causing damage, it is a malfunction of the brain and I had the malfunction. So I ended up getting a divorce at 19 years old. Went out to live with an uncle who was matriculating for his doctorate in psychology at UCLA. And at that time they were doing a lot of work trying to help people who were autistic who had psychological problems. So I was one of the guinea pigs. So they gave me 732 micrograms of LSD. It didn't even take me off, so I was rejected from that experiment. But they put me in a lot of other experiments. None of them helped because they were looking for, again, a problem of stimulating the brain. That's what they were thinking, stimulate the brain. Well, if the brain is poisoned and the cells are dead and not malfunctioning, there's no way to relieve that unless you go ahead and cut out the toxicity of that part of the brain and let it regrow, or you detoxify it and then let it grow.

So they don't have any concepts like that because the pharmaceutical house does not want them to think cure. It's treat, treat, treat, so they make money every day. Every pill you take. And how many people do you know that are over the age of 60 that live on medication? 5, 10, 15, 20, 30 medications. It's endless. My parents take 86 a day, each of them. 90 and 93. And they buy it, they buy it, you know? I don't understand. When they were having a lot of troubles in the early 80s, I said, you know, if you go on this diet, you know, at least do some of the things, and here's the things you absolutely can do, even though if you won't eat the raw meat, have some raw eggs with some orange juice, and some raw cream with it, or some raw butter, with it all together, olive oil. My mother used to like to put hers in the stone-pressed olive oil. So I got them to eat the stone-pressed olive oil, which is completely raw, butter, raw cheeses, raw eggs, and not much dairy. They still had the fear of raw dairy is going to be bacterial contamination. So I got them to do quite a bit. So let's say 50% of their diet was raw, and good raw foods. They got incredibly better. Then 12 years later, they decided we've lived long enough. They were in their early 60s, mid-60s at that time. Early 60s for my mother, mid-60s for my father. So after they got into their late 70s, they decided it was time to go. So they stopped eating it. Now they're 90 and 93. They don't function well. My mother is on a walker the whole time. And my father had a stroke three years ago, and he's never been out of the bed since. Without somebody picking him up and putting him in a wheelchair. Now when I'm here, he will drink the raw milkshakes. And I said, I will get somebody to come every day and feed you raw milkshakes. Oh, I won't do it if you're not here. So it doesn't make any sense. And my mother said, Oh, thank you, sweetheart. I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. I'm not going to eat any of that stuff. So what can you do? So anyway, they live on medication. Now, why would they take medication? If they're not going to take the raw foods that make them feel that, why take medication? Oh, frickin die. The rationale is because the brain is sick, just as my brain was sick. There is a whole mal-education that we're given by all of these ads about the drugs and pharmaceuticals on the radio, on the TV, and they are considered the hierarchy of praise, doctors. Yet they are the most destructive, worse than war criminals on this planet. When you've been through what I've been through, when you've seen what I've seen, and when you wake up to the reality of they don't want you well, they want to make money. Period. And that's it. Because when I see that you can heal diabetes in weeks, that's a $1,200 habit for the pharmaceutical industry. All of a sudden I've taken $1,200 away from them hundreds of times. 120 times. And all the people who they've influenced to get off of their insulin to do something else to get rid of their diabetes. 85% of the people who are diagnosed with diabetes aren't even diabetic. Almost every one of your type 2 diabetics are not really diabetic at all. 

Their pancreases just aren't functional. That doesn't mean it won't work. It just means it's not functional. They have one sugar blood test, and it comes out bad. And instead of a doctor saying, well, let's watch this. Let's see if this continues for a two-year period. If it continues for a two-year period, you're probably diabetic. Let's treat it at that point. They'll immediately put you on insulin. It's an absurdity. Because everybody who eats sugars and processed carbohydrates of any kind is going to have malfunctioning pancreas periodically. They're going to have fluctuating and very high sugar levels. But it doesn't mean they're diabetic. But again, the pharmaceutical industry runs it. So, out here in California, I didn't get better. I got worse. I was drinking more. My mother took me to a new school that opened up in Cincinnati when I graduated with C's and D's. And not on my own merits, by cheating. Except for math. Like a lot of autistic kids, I was an idiot savant with math. Give me a problem, I didn't have to do the formula, I had to write down the answer. So, they always thought I was cheating. So, even at Finneytown High School, they put me into a room with tests that they made up an hour before or so, and then gave them to me, and I just wrote the answers, and they were always right. So, there was a new technical school that opened in downtown Cincinnati called Cincinnati Institute of Computer Technology. So, my mother took me there, and they tested me, and there was no comprehension test. It was all geometry and physics and stuff like that. Of course, I didn't have to think about it. Great marks. So, they took me in, and they realized that I was an idiot savant, and they always put somebody with me, and they farmed me out to companies like IBM, Time DC Trucking Company, and Carte Blanche Corporation. So, I was a systems analyst. So, here I was, a young kid, an idiot, making 80 grand a year, and they were making more than three times that off of me, the professors at this university. But I was happy. I got a small bedroom house in Beverly Hills, California, 19 years old. I was 20 when it got to that point. And then I got a house, and I lived pretty nicely. Then I got an ulcer. I was vomiting blood. So, my uncle, of course, took me to the doctors and his friends at UCLA, and they said, oh, he's got an ulcer, we need to give him Maalox, you know, to absorb the acids so he'll stop eating into his stomach wall. And it wasn't the acids, it was the alcohol and all the nicotine that I was consuming, a massive amount of it. So, I didn't stop those, I just drank bottles of Maalox, you know, chalk, to absorb the alcohol and the nicotine and the acid, so I stopped digesting, basically, and then it got worse very quickly. So, a tumor formed right next to or as part of the ulcer. So, they said, oh, we're going to have to extract that. We'll do a vagotomy pyloroplasty, which means they're going to sever the vagus nerves to the stomach, so I would never again secrete hydrochloric acid.

So, they put me in the category of octogenarians, who are not supposed to be able to digest proteins anymore, because they don't produce hydrochloric acid, unless they have it as a supplement. Of course, that's more money for the pharmaceutical industry. So, they performed that surgery on me, and then if I ate meat after that surgery, I broke out in boils all over my body, from head to knees, everywhere. You might see Lawyer Lawyer with Jim Carney. He's got one of their employees, or junior lawyers, who's got a big pimple on the end of his nose, and he just wants to break it, and squirt it, and get rid of it, and it pops on him one day, and it's all over the place. So, I had these all over my body, and people look at me and want to get away. So, I had to stop eating meat. Of course, I couldn't at times. I'd be so hungry for it. And I always had to suffer those boils. They were pretty nasty, and very painful. And they said that I could never, ever eat anything again cooked, I mean raw. Not even bananas, not even apples. Everything had to be steamed, or cooked, or baked, or microwaved. So, my uncle went through all the process of showing me what I could and couldn't do in the kitchen, and taking the food and what had to be done with it. So, of course, I got sicker, and sicker, and sicker. The incision from here to here turned tumorous, went up to three quarters of an inch high, up to an inch and a half wide. It places, it was a gnarly tumor. So, they said, oh, we're going to have to irradiate that. So, they gave me ten weeks of intense radiation therapy. It was radiation therapy. It's burning the body, infiltrating it with radioactive material, radioactively charging the iodine, any kind of metal in your body. It becomes radioactive for 55,000 years minimum. If it is a natural. If it's uranium or something like that in the body, then you've got 550,000 years as a half-life. So, think about that. So, they gave me this intense radiation therapy for ten weeks. What happens? It's heat, right? What happens when you take malleable clay and you fire it at cone two? It becomes brittle and hard. You take it from a clay malleable substance into a piece of pottery. And if you go very high with certain, you hit China. Take it up very, very high and then you have glass. So, different heat temperatures. So, after ten weeks of that, this was my movement. And it was excruciatingly painful. I was painful in my back if I talked. I couldn't do anything without excruciating pain. So, that gave me what? Blood and bone cancer. Multiple myeloma from the radiation therapy. Then they said, oh, we have to give you chemotherapy for that. There's only a 1% chance that you'll live, but we have to give you chemotherapy. You do what the doctors say. I'm still an idiot. I don't know what I'm doing. I just let them treat me. So, after three months of periodic, sometimes I didn't show up. Many times I didn't show up for the chemotherapy. So, I forgo, but after three months of it and all my hair was falling out or did fall out.

And I was vomiting and defecating, urinating all over myself. I lived on the floor. I had to have all of the furniture in the house removed. All the drapes taken off and aluminum venetian blinds put on because I could not even get up on a bowl or a jar to urinate or defecate in. So, I laid on the floor in my urine and defecation every day, all day long. And would crawl like a worm because this is the only place that I could move without going into tremendous pain in my body. And even that was painful. It took me 30 minutes to go 10 feet on the floor. So, I'd go from one spot to another. So, right before that they wanted to put me in a hospice to die. And I took a trip there in a wheelchair. And I could see that everybody was terribly ill, deathly ill. And I was autistic and there was no way I was going to be in that environment to die. So, I just said, you know, they leave me in my home. And, I mean, there were certain phrases I understood and they got the gist of what I meant by that point, 22 years old, 21, 22. So, two volunteers offered to come to my house, two, three days a week. They would shop for me, clean the house, clean all the stuff that I planted all over the floor, all of my excrement and excretions, secretions. And they would clean that up and the house stunk. That's why everything had to be taken out of the house. And I'd close off the bedrooms, the two bedrooms, and just lived on the wood living room floor, which was about twice as long as this room, all the way back to that space back there, and about as wide as this. That's how big the living room, dining room section together without walls. So, I had a lot of places to go in a few days, and that I wouldn't be completely lying in it all the time. Sometimes I was just so painful that I'd be in it for 24 hours just collecting, and it would all be diarrhea. It was a mess. So, one of the volunteers was an 18-year-old African-American boy who had wisdom. How can you have wisdom at 18 years old? And he brought me carrot juice and raw milk. It took him a while for me to taste them, to experiment with them. He was patient. And finally, I tasted the carrot juice, and it tasted delicious. If you ever had radiation therapy and chemo, you notice that everything after that tastes like postage stamps and cardboard. Nothing tastes good anymore. Everything is disgusting. And a lot of people just stop eating and will get anorexia and die just because everything is revolting tasting. So, that was the situation with me. So, I had this carrot juice, and it was delicious. So, I drank a lot of that. I drank the milk. It was pretty good, too. It didn't taste rich like the carrot juice, but it still tasted good. And it felt very good inside me. So, after ten days of drinking these and nothing else, before that my diet was, if you go back after the radiation therapy, within months, all of the bone around my teeth dissolved. You have to understand during cancer and or radiation therapy, the body has a tremendous need for minerals in the body.

So, it will start deteriorating your own bones. That's why a lot of cancer patients who are treated by the medical profession get osteoporosis. So, I lost all of the bone around my teeth. They dangled in my gums. So, if I bit on my own teeth, I would bleed. So, I was getting two transfusions a week. Once in a while I got three. So, I would have all my food blended and drink it out of big fat straws. So, my diet was powdered donuts with RC Cola or Sprite with sugar on it, extra sugar in it. That was my diet. I didn't know any better. So, when I started drinking this care juice and raw milk exclusively, all of a sudden things began to change. My brain, I woke and I said, a new space in my brain was opening. And I actually understood nouns, prepositions, everything. It just all of a sudden dawned on me. I said, this is what it's all about. What I'd been missing. So I called my uncle to have a conversation with. He thought it was an actor friend of his, a Hollywood actor friend of his, who was imitating my voice and having a conversation with a lot of malaprops. Because as an autistic child and an autistic adult, I always related the feelings that I had for sounds to what something should mean. Wrong. So I had all these concepts about what a word meant by what I thought it should mean. So I was loaded with malaprops. But I had this conversation with my uncle. It was 30 minutes before I told him an incident only he would know about in the family. And he denied that it was the carrot juice and the raw milk, that it was just my brain making a switch. Of course, he's indoctrinated by the regular medical profession and the universities. So that's his thinking. So I told him that I wanted to study nutrition. He said, well, it's a waste of your time, but if you want to explore it, it's a good thing to do. Then you find out the rights and wrongs. And, you know, you find out that I'm right and you're wrong, basically is what he said. So I called up Steve, the fellow, the African-American boy. Now, he was independently wealthy because he was a great singer. He sang for the Going Thing group, which was financed by the Ford company, and they were in all over the world singing the Going Thing, you know, the bright idea, the smart idea, Ford products, and they came out with the Mach One, and they loaded him up with one of the big mock ones, and all the kids in the group, nobody under 28 years old, was in that group. Well, he was one of them. He made 80 grand or more a year just by being a singer. So, he was a very compassionate young man. So, he was helping me, and I called him, and I said, Steve, you know, I have no more money, and he also had to step back because here I was talking mostly a lot of sense, even though malaprops were loaded in there, and I didn't have a great vocabulary, but I was able to get my point across. The money, the doctors, everything, I'm going to be evicted from the house. Obviously, everybody thought I was going to die, so they left me to die in the house and not evict me.

And I have no money, but I want to go buy books on nutrition. Would you help me? He said, well, it's going to take a while. We have to get a special car. We have to, you know, get you a wheelchair. We have to do all this stuff. So, after about a week, he took me to a bookstore, and he gave me $110, bought $110 worth of books. In 1969, that was a lot of books, because you could buy a paperback for 50 cents, 45 cents. A big, thick book was $2. You know, a picture, a hardback picture book was $1 to $1.95. So, I got a lot of books at that time, for that amount of money. There was only one book on Mind Over Matter. There was one book that my uncle told me to get first, which was Siddhartha, about this young man who grows up in an affluent family, becomes a druggie, a whoremonger, a murderer, and he ends up being a mystic and sage at the end, because of all the stuff he experienced. He had wisdom for everybody in all areas. I thought, people can be so much in one lifetime. Wow, this is spectacular. I grew up in the white bread society, and life is narrow. That gave me a whole different reality on behavior. I realized that I could be compassionate, as well as stern. I could do all of those things that seemed to be contradictions, that they were all necessary at times, which comes with experience and wisdom. So, over the years, I would experiment. I would just stick mainly on a raw diet, those raw foods. The bone grew back from eating all the raw milk around my teeth. Took two years, but it regenerated and healed. Still my teeth in there. I mean, they're not great teeth, and most of them are capped up here, but still I have my teeth. When they wanted to pull all of them, when the bone deteriorated, they wanted to extract all my teeth. I'm already in excruciating pain, and they want me to die after having all my teeth extracted? They have no common sense whatsoever. No compassion. Very few doctors have any compassion. How can you have any type of intelligence when you go, you don't even look at the patient, look at figures on a paper, and then leave the patient? You don't know what's going on. You have no idea. The pharmaceutical industry has railroaded you into believing that numbers determine somebody's health. I've got a professional basketball Hall of Fame athlete. His cholesterol is 672, constantly. He should be dead, right? He should be having heart attacks, perfectly healthy. When he goes down to 400, he can't even function. I have a silver medal gymnast. She's retired now from it, but when she was working out, she was on the U.S. team, and would constantly get colds and flus, like every four or six weeks, so badly that she couldn't function. Doctors told her it was her 365 to 375 cholesterol level was the problem. So they took her off cholesterol, and she couldn't even work out when she didn't have a cold. She didn't have the strength. So Paul Cohen, who was an Olympic tennis champion in the mid-early 50s, had been on the diet for 15 years. So about seven years ago, he said, Take her to Aajonus. He'll take care of her diet. And he was the coach for McEnroe for 10 years. He said, I only knew then what I know now. McEnroe will still be playing and be a nice guy. 

So they brought her to me, and I said, Okay, she needs a $375, a 375 count cholesterol level, period. Let's give her the good fats. So she went on six months later to win a silver medal. You have to reject all medical implications of figures. They have nothing to do with an individual. They are geared to make money. What was the cholesterol level 60 years ago? Double what it is now. But they can get more people to take cholesterol lowering medication. More money. So they changed the figure of what was appropriate and good. Okay, you can have this level now. We'll make more money. And literally that is it. Most of your doctors, I would say, are in complete denial. If you watch the doctor's show on TV. You know, I was on there last February. And we've got this young Dr. Stork. I think his last name is Stork. They call him something else. And he's a complete idiot. I mean, you can argue science with him. He'll just argue... There was a taping last week about vaccines, and this man and this woman were talking about the science. Showing that science proves that vaccines have no implications of success. Absolutely not even in the degree of 1%. And there are many of them. Yet all of these things that they put in vaccines have been proven to cause disease. Repeatedly in experiments. So they're giving all this information to the doctors. And all of a sudden that doctor, you know, he's the pretty one on the panel. Really cute and suave. You know, all this shit. And he just, he is irrational. And he starts, you're attacking me, you're attacking us. And he just talks about from a gut emotional level. He doesn't talk to science. Doctors have to be there to do what they're doing. If they aren't there, if they aren't stupid and ignorant. They would not be doing what they're doing to people. So don't think that doctors aren't culpable. Just because they're ignorant, they are. They haven't been taught to remove themselves emotionally from anybody but their suffering patient. They don't remove it from their own, you know, needs and wants. So you have to understand where doctors are coming from. All of the trials and tribulations that are in their lives. And how you can't trust them for anything. My motto is that if a doctor or the medical proficient or the pharmaceutical industry tells you anything to do, do exactly the opposite. 99% of the time you'll be right. Literally 99% of the time you'll be correct. Do exactly the opposite. So I started getting better gradually. Then when I was 27 years old, I could mitigate the pain in my back to 6-7 hours a day. And I did that by doing yoga postures. Stretch my back out so the back wouldn't pinch and press on the nerves. So at 27 I got on a bicycle, an Italian Ligi bike and a touring bike and decided to travel all over North America, live with tribes, animals, to find out the truth. Because all of those books that I had read by that time, it was all nonsense. They were all people I realized they had no empirical data. They had learned something from somebody else or learned it in a school and were coming with no wisdom and no knowledge, no experience.

And when they were in a particular place in their head where they thought something was right, they wouldn't let go of it. They would argue it to nonsense just like that guy does, Dr. Stork on The Doctors. And even in my case, he says, well, I can admit that it's worked for you, but it's a dangerous diet. Don't anybody do it. And I said, well, how many people have you worked with that have eaten raw meat? Well, none. I've worked with over 25,000 people. Now, the only reason all that was left in the show and wasn't completely debasing me was because I didn't sign the contract until five minutes before I was on the air being taped, and I crossed out all the things that didn't give me equal voice. No, they couldn't have had, they could not have used my segment unless they gave me equal everything. So, in the editing room they had no, you can see it, they will attack viciously people. The only other one I've seen was this vaccine one where they let the doctor look like a complete idiot, a moron. You can find it on, you know, YouTube, that segment, it is incredible. You can find my segment on there too, somebody put it on, I don't know how they did it. So, I bamboozled them in, you know, I said, you can't use this segment unless you read this contract and you better give me equal clarity. So, I got to put all this stuff, I said, well, how many people have you worked with who eat raw meat? I worked with 25,000 people and nobody has gotten diarrhea or sick from it. Well, it is still a dangerous diet, you know. And he looks like, they ended that segment, that show on, if all, if nothing else do not eat raw meat, it's a dangerous thing to do. They ended that whole show, that hour show with that statement. Again, that was nothing, absolutely nothing. So, let's get into how I found out that it wasn't true. When I started off, I was eating lots of raw milk, lots of raw dairy, and some raw fruit. Then I listened to a lot of vegetarians, reading books about spirituality, of course I wanted to be spiritual. And it's like any other religion, it's got its huge limitations. So I became a raw food fruitarian, vegan, and of course I wasn't eating any dairy unless I absolutely had headaches and crazy and I couldn't help it. I'd run into a health food store and buy some raw cheese and eat it, eat the whole thing in an hour. And then suffer constipation for days, but I suffered constipation from the day I was born. So, I traveled around living with different, I lived with coyotes, I lived with alligators, all kinds of animals, I lived with four Indian tribes. And they all told me what I was missing was raw meat, that I need to eat raw meat. I thought, oh, they just want to kill this white boy. Revenge for the Indians, the natives. And this is the Mayans down in the Yucatan, a bicycle all the way down there, then the Yaqui Indians in northern Mexico, the Sioux here in the Dakotas, and then the Inuit in Alaska. So, that was three years that I lived like that off of a bicycle. And after about two and a half years, a little bit over that, I was in Alaska with the Inuit. And they also told me what I needed was raw meat. And at the end, I was down to 108, between 112 and 118 pounds.

I would eat seven pounds of nuts a day and wake up a few ounces lighter the next day. The diet didn't work, no matter if it was complete protein or not. Of course, I wouldn't eat cooked foods because I had studied that enough. Even chemically, you produce 32 toxins in the body. So you're dealing with toxins in a cooked diet. So that, of course, will reduce the lifespan of any animal, including us. So I would not eat any cooked foods, regardless. But I just kept getting weaker and weaker. The multiple myeloma came back, the cancer of blood and bones. I was aching as the temperature dropped below 50 degrees. I was aching in every joint. By the time it hit 48, 49 degrees, I was immobile in pain. It was getting that cold, even though it was late August, early September in Alaska. You know, their season is three months, their happy summer season. In fact, their spring, their summer, and their fall is all in the three months. You've got nine months of winter there. So I was in a lot of pain. I was getting ready to leave. They had this celebration, and they dug up this stuff that was wrapped in a hide, unwrapped the hide. It was about between 6 and 12 inches under the ground. It reeked, it stunk like a nasty slaughterhouse that had been abandoned and never cleaned after they abandoned it. They stopped utilizing it. It was rank, and everybody smelling it, happy. And then there was a bird call from downwind, and they wrapped it up. They buried it because it didn't stink enough. It didn't reach downwind, so it wasn't ready. So they buried it for four more days. So I stuck around to watch this, even though I was suffering. So they dug it out, and they had many of them. And, I mean, the kids were jumping around smelling that. It was like cotton candy or something. Jumping around for the adults. The kids ate about a pound each. And the adults ate two to three pounds each. And they did this every time in fall, going into the winter, to fill themselves with bacteria. High, they call it high meat. High in bacteria makes you high and happy. So, I didn't believe it, because when they unwrapped it, it was patinaed, it was moldy. I didn't know that meat molded. I never put gangrene together with flesh. I thought that you just turned to hardened dust, and that the worms or ants didn't eat you, or some vulture or something, and that was it. So, when they were telling me it was meat, you know, caribou, with seal blubber, or whale blubber, I forget which it was, that had been buried into mold and rot, so they could digest everything with the high bacteria, because in winter they don't get enough bacteria. 90% of digestion is bacteria. 10% is enzymes and hydrochloric acid. To break the larger particles of food down, so the bacteria can infiltrate it and digest, their waste is our nutrient. So, the Eskimos would do this because freezing destroys bacteria, so it would help them all through the winter, by eating a bunch of this right before the season came on full. So, I didn't believe them. I thought it was some kind of herbal mixture, and they were going to give me the herbal mixture. They were going to kill the white boy and get their revenge.

So, that was my... So, I was too weak to really bicycle at that point. It was mid-September. And I started hopping freight cars, and I'd bungee-cord my bicycle to the side and hang my hammock among the sliding doors so I could watch the beautiful scenery. So, it took me about five days to get back to Southern California where it was warmer. And I decided I was going to fast myself to death. I was not going to suffer anymore. I was just going to leave my body. Screw it. I was in too much pain. I wasn't going to go through it again. I was down to 98 pounds. Right now I'm 170. So, you can imagine what I was like at 98 pounds. The lightest I got to was 94. Almost 5'8. So, I decided I was just going to fast myself to death. I was just going to drink water. I knew it would take 45, 60 days and I'd be dead. So, I picked an old Indian burial ground in the desert. Out below Palm Springs. Near the Salton Sea. And the den of coyotes would come down in the canyon. Because they lived up in that foothill. Why I picked that one, I didn't know at the time. Set myself up here. Now the coyotes would come wake me up every night at midnight. It didn't matter. Wake me up at midnight right on the dot. And they'd play this game. Sounded like they came out of the cuckoo's nest. And like a whole group of crazy people. Yelling and yiping and silly little sounds. And I thought, oh, they're just playing. They're just chanting to help me die or something like that. When you're fasting, you have all kinds of weird thoughts. So, not eating, not feeding the body, not feeding the brain. So, the coyotes came down every night. And after about the tenth night, got to the point where I thought I'd play a little game. I was getting bored with it. So, I sensed where they were. Because one was staying out there. They would all make noise until they got down. Then one would dance around, do his yelping. And the others would disappear throughout the wash and everything behind sagebrush and whatever brush was out there in the desert. So, I got to the point where I could sense where they were. I was getting very perceptive. The next night, they killed a jackrabbit and brought it to me. Ripped it open at the neck, pulled it apart, put it on my feet. Now, another reason I wanted to remain vegetarian was because I loved animals. And here was the Easter bunny they put on my feet. Warm, raw, you know. And I thought, oh, God. They're trying to give me something. They want to help me. I kept hearing, this is what you need, this is what you need. I said, no way. Then this dialogue that I heard from my uncle many, many years ago when I was probably about nine or ten years old. He gave a speech to my cousins, his sons, and my brothers about rabbit hunting, because there was rabbit hunting. I wasn't allowed to go. It was too sickly. So I stayed home and learned how to cook and sew. So basically, that was my exercise. So they got to go hunting. My uncle told them that wild rabbits have a microorganism in them that will take over in your body, and you'll have very painful disease, intestinal disease, for 48 hours, and you'll die, absolutely die. It's worse than uncooked pork. That was the dialogue.

So it went right through my head, and I thought, Oh, the Chinese want to help me die quickly. I can handle 48 hours of pain easily, no problem, after what I've been through. So 48 hours, I resigned myself to 48 hours of intense cramping and death in two days. So I picked up the rabbit and started eating it. Of course, every time I did for about five or six times, it came right back up. Couldn't hold it down. So I went back to the dinner table at my home. And again, I remember I was autistic, so I didn't know how to talk about it or anything. Anytime we got a cooked vegetable, and that was at every meal, I vomited for years. So when I hit about six or seven years old, my mother and father decided they were going to put a stop to it. So I had to sit at the dinner table for an hour and a half to two hours every night and everybody watched Gunsmoke and Little Old Man and other things on the TV, which is a new thing. TV was new back then, it was all black and white. And I sat at the dinner table. Now what I had to do was, if I had Brussels sprouts, I could hit that wall. If I had peas, I could probably hit this young woman right there. If I had cooked carrots, I'd probably hit you. So depending upon what vegetable it was, determined the velocity of my vomit. So, I was four, so what I learned to do, if I vomited, they would give me that much again, but I had to eat, they only allowed me to have a cup of milk at dinner to wash it down. So, what I had to do was I had to mash it in my mouth, cut off my taste buds, sip a little bit of milk, wash it down. Maybe that took anywhere from a minute and a half to two minutes per bite. In small bites, we're talking like a teaspoon at a time. Then, I had to wait three to four, sometimes five minutes to repress the vomit. And then when it settled enough, then I could try the next batch. If I felt it coming back up, then I had to spit that out into my spoon and then work a few more minutes and wait. So literally, I was at the table an hour and a half to two hours every night unless we were fed corn on the cob. No problem with corn on the cob. Corn cooked with carrots and peas and stuff like that, I vomited. But corn on the cob by itself, on the cob, was fine. When it wasn't on the cob, I vomited. It was autistic. They kept saying it was in my mind. I got no control over that vomit reaction. That's the body talking at that age. It was that kind of mental condition that I was in. So I remembered all of that when I'm sitting here with this rabbit, and I said, okay, I'm going to do this. So I psyched myself all the way back in and got into that state when I was at the dinner table. Then I began eating this rabbit, holding it down, getting through that. After about the 10th, 12th bite, it became delicious. So I ate about 3, 3 1⁄2 pounds. A jackrabbit's about 7 pounds. They're pretty big. And so the coyotes ate the rest, went on their way. I went back to my campsite to die, and I knew I was dying because I felt good. The only times I had ever felt good in my life was in near-death experiences. Two on the operating table with the vagotomy and then with the appendicitis when they performed that surgery when I was 12 years old. I died on the operating table, and they revived me. When I died on the operating table, I left my body with no pain. 

I just hovered over my body, and then as I was leaving to go into what they call the tunnel of light, I was pulled back into the body. But there was no pain, and that's the way I started feeling as I was walking back to my campsite. I knew I was dying because I was feeling good. So I got back to my campsite, fell asleep, and I thought I'd be dead. I wake the next morning, still in my sleeping bag, and didn't die. No tunnel, no white light, no nothing. So I started to move, and when the sunlight hit my sleeping bag, it would take me two hours of the sunlight being on the sleeping bag before I'd be warm enough that I could move without excruciating pain. And then I'd lie in the sun for 10, 20, 30 minutes naked, the sun beating on me, and then I could move with moderate pain in every joint of my body with effort, but still I could be functional to some extent. And it was better that morning. I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in 45 minutes and only spend 5 to 10 minutes in the sun naked, and I was relatively functional. So I said, I'm still on my way to dying. I waited three days for the cramps to come in, the organism to take over my intestines and the cramps. It never happened. No diarrhea, no nothing. So this was a myth that was created. So after the third day, I still had more energy than I had in my whole life, and I felt better than I had in my entire life after eating that 3 1⁄2 pounds of that rabbit. So a sidewinder rattlesnake went in front of me at that moment, and I'd seen native Indians go up to three years of living outdoors, and you live with the Indian, you're going to see them catch snakes and eat them. So I watched them go up with their foot, put their foot on their head and pick it up in front of the rattler, spin it around, snap its head right off. Without thinking, I'm butt-naked, and I walk over and put my foot on the head, pick it up in front of the rattler, and I said, oh, hell, what am I doing? Oh, my God. And I started getting sore, I was afraid it was going to come back and snap me and bite me in the face, you know, in the ear, the jaw, nose, somewhere where it could get a hold of and I would be dead. And I thought, oh, I'm getting very sore, weak in the arms, and I probably wasn't swinging that thing around more than three or four minutes. And I said, well, I'm dead or it's dead. Well, it snapped, and sure enough, the head just snapped right off. So I peeled it back. Where these cats came from, from these neighboring farms, I don't know, but six or seven cats showed up. So we all shared the raw snake. The snake does not taste like chicken. It tastes like raw fish. Maybe cooked it tastes like chicken, but the snake tastes like fish, raw fish, with a lot of vertebraes, a lot of bones. So you have to eat around the little bones. So it took hours to eat snake, hours and hours, because, you know, my teeth were still, gums were still very sensitive, and I couldn't bite on anything hard at all. Chewing on a nut was a great chore. And seven pounds a day, I had to eat, you know, walnuts and soft nuts, pecans, soft nuts to be able to eat them.

So I ate, you know, I got healthier and healthier. I started hunting birds and chipmunks, and, you know, it's only two bites by the time you skin it. Nothing left of those animals and birds, two bites, three bites of an animal. So I got on my bicycle and went and made deals with the farmers around the area to shovel manure, milk, cows, goats, anything in exchange for meat, chicken, you know, beef, chickens, goat, goat's milk, cow's milk, butter, anything that I could get that was raw, lots of eggs. So in about two and a half months, I gained 50 to 60 pounds. I looked like a scaled-down Arnold Schwarzenegger. I went off to Los Angeles to spread the word, and I got there and said, are you out of your mind? You're going to get a brain fluke. You're going to get a brain parasite from eating raw meat, and you'll be an idiot. And I said, well, I've been there and done that. I said, I feel good on this stuff. This is the only thing that's ever made me feel complete in my life. No cravings, no nothing. I have to eat this raw meat, raw dairy. It's perfect. And they said, yeah, but you're going to get a brain fluke. So I dismissed it, and I still continued eating raw meat three days a week, just one meal at a time. So three raw meat meals a week, whether it was fish, mostly fish, chicken, and some beef. And then about three years of hearing people say it every time I mention raw meat or eat it, you're going to get a brain fluke. You're going to get a brain parasite. And I started thinking, am I? Maybe I will. And then ten more years went by, and I never got diarrhea from it. I never got the parasite. Anything from eating raw meat. And I had the vagotomy, remember, so I don't have that extra insulation for the hydrochloric acid to dissolve the parasitical eggs and the parasites. Because that's what they say. This is why most people don't get parasites, is because the hydrochloric acid destroys them. Again, that's irrational, illogical thinking and very shallow thinking of medically oriented people and people who want to defend this, that you're going to get parasites from me. And because you haven't, it's only because you have hydrochloric acid. I have no hydrochloric acid. So thirteen years went by, and I've just spent ten years of the last thirteen years worrying about parasite, and I still haven't gotten one. There's something wrong here. So I went to seven major universities looking for these experiments that they've done with animals eating raw meat and getting parasites. You know how many I found? A zip zero, not one. And yet it's written in stone that you will get a parasite from eating raw meat. It's absolute horse shit. Excuse me, horses. Horse shit is good. But that malarkey that they deliver to us, the only thing I think is raw meat is good, it's wonderful, all the tribes that eat it have no disease whatsoever, not even dental caries. So it must be the plot of the pharmaceutical industry to make sure that people stay sick. So they created this myth. But just like they created a myth about raw milk.

Raw milk does nothing but heal the body. And it has all of this scourge. And people who are indoctrinated in the medical profession, and people who work in the health industry, absolutely believe that it's true. Again, I have no hydrochloric acid, and I eat two quarts of raw milk a day. And I let it rot sometimes. The higher the bacteria, the better. Kefir and yogurt, a high bacteria is already pre-digesting it for you. I let my meat get rotten and stink like the Eskimos do. I get healthier. If you see me on an episode of Ripley's Believe It or Not from 2001, it was first aired July 17, 2001, and they've aired it more than any other episode. I saw myself speaking in French in Paris when I was there, turned on the TV to see what was going on in the news, and there I was, Ripley's Believe It or Not speaking French, and I don't speak it well. There I did, excellently. And when I was in the Philippines, I was speaking in Spanish and Tagalog, and I've seen that episode aired all over the world, the most aired episode, where I eat rotten meat up to a year and three months old, and you see worms on it, you see everything, the dang green on it and everything, and I'm eating it. Two of my patients were eating it with me at one point in the episode, and these were patients who had been on psychotropic drugs five to seven daily, one up to 20 years. Twenty years, can you imagine? This was a famous yoga instructor who had DVDs out teaching people all this meditative stuff, but shit, she was a basket case, taking seven psychotropic drugs a day, daily, on and off the diet, it was hell going with her, you know, helping her for a year, and I said, finally, I said, listen, you've got to try the high meat. Just try it one time, if it doesn't work, I'll keep working with you, but if you won't at least try it, I can't help you anymore, I'm going crazy as you are, I'm honest. So, she said, I'm already doing this crazy diet, you know, it's already anti-social, bam. So, she called back about an hour later, she said, okay, how do I make it? So, you cut up the meat, you put it in jars with an equal amount of air space, and you, if you want it to rot fast, the bacteria break down fast, like it does in your intestines, you let it sit in the cupboard, not in the refrigerator. If you want it to go slowly, then you do it in the refrigerator. If you have it out of the cupboard, I mean in the cupboard, out of the refrigerator, you need air once every day, once a day or every two days. If it's in the refrigerator, every two to three days. She said, I don't have two to three days, I may kill myself tonight. I said, okay. So she hung up and then she called back and she says, okay, you have any? And I said, no, I have a friend, I have some, but it's for me. I have a friend who has some and he makes a lot for himself. He majorly eats, you know, high meat every day. So he'll probably have some that he may sell you. So she got in touch with him and sure enough, she got some. She called me like seven o'clock, nine o'clock at night. She says, I always screen the phone at that hour. So I get the call and she says, I got the meat, I ate some, the high meat, I ate some.

It was disgusting, it smelled terrible, but I ate it and I'm really nervous. I need you to talk to, please call me back. You better answer. I said, no way I'm answering that. I'll be babysitting her all night. She'll want to go over to my house, you know, babysit her. So she called every 45 minutes to an hour. Same thing, you know, I'm really nervous. You know, it's been several hours. I can feel gurgling, I can feel movement in my intestines. I'm going to vomit at any time. I have no nausea, but I may vomit or have diarrhea at any time. So it got to be about 4.35 o'clock in the morning. She said, okay, I'm going to stay on this phone and hear you answer. Whistling and very happy. And I said, it's time to answer. So I answered and I said, see, it worked. You're happy. I worked with you for a year and a half and I never heard you say a funny thing or a happy thing. And definitely never whistled. And she says, oh, yeah. Oh, I guess it worked. And I said, you did it all on your own. You didn't need my help all night. You're okay. Just eat it as much as you can, as often as you can. You have to understand that your intestines digest with bacteria. Their waste products are our food. So if you're eating high meat, it is already predigested. It's like eating yogurt or kefir, predigested milk. This is predigested meat, even though it stinks. But if you were to remove that meat in the process as it's going through your intestines, you would smell like high-foul-smelling meat in your intestines. But that's how your body handles it. But you don't stink like high meat, and people who eat the high meat don't stink like that. The only trouble you have is you have a cameraman that's shooting it, like Ripley's movie or not, he was vomiting from the smell. He tried to use, you know, his, but we were on my back porch and there's limited space, so he had to get pretty close at different angles to observe all this, so he was puking over my railing. So I got him some cotton balls with some clove oil in it and put them up his nose, and that's how I got to eat it the first time with the Eskimos. They got me to eat a ping-pong ball-sized amount, but they had to put musk oil on some cotton balls and stuff them up my nose, because I was dry heaving it five feet away from it, it stunk so bad. And I felt good. I was able to get out of the sleeping bag earlier. But again, I thought it was the herbs. I didn't really believe it was raw meat. I thought they weren't going to give me the answer. Then when the coyote business happened and all the others, then I grew. It took me too many years from indoctrination to grow out of it. 13 years, 10 years of worrying that I was going to get a parasite from the raw meat. From superstition. And the medical profession claims to have science on its side. It has the least science of anything in the world. Engineering has more science than anything in the world. That's the only technology that we're advanced in. And we're not retarded. And we shouldn't be because we're building technology that doesn't benefit our planet. The waste products are tremendous and destroying. So we aren't so smart there either.

So anyway, that's how I got there. I'm 62 years old. I finished my 63rd year in April. Started my 64th year. I was supposed to be dead at 21 years old. Here I am. I've suffered innumerable things over the years. Near death experiences again. And I'm still here rebounding. So take a look at that. Okay, we're going to stop, take a break. We're going to go into the workshop. Now in the workshop, I'm going to explain how your body works. How food works in your body. How your glands work. By the time you finish that workshop, you will never be afraid of your body again. You'll never have to say, I don't know what's going on. Oh my God, I have to run to the doctor. You're going to get your blood taken, get weaker, have radiation put into your body for x-rays and tests, and just destroy you. And how many diseases are caused during testing? They estimate 700,000 a year. So you can multiply that probably by 10 and come out with 7 million a year. People that are damaged and cause disease by the very therapies. I didn't have cancer until I had the Maalox. I didn't have my multiple myeloma until I had the radiation therapy. Of course we know that radiation, animals subject to radiation get cancer. A lot of them get bone cancer. Hello? Oh, well we're going to take care of you. You go to the doctor. Oh, we're going to take care of you. Yeah, we're going to give you more diseases while we explore what to do, and then you'll need us even more, because you don't know what the hell is going on in your body anyway. We don't either, but we make you believe we do. And that's basically the dialogue that should happen any time you have someone who's a doctor. So when you finish the workshop, you should never be afraid of your body again, and you'll know what to do by the time we finish the workshop. It's going to take five to six hours to do that, and I'm going to tell you how to eat, patterns through the day, why to eat certain things at certain times of the day, why to combine foods, how they affect you, so that you will know, you will have your own life in your hands. And then I will do mini consults after that, which means I take a look at the palms, not a palm reader like that, but I look at the coloring and the mounds on the hands a lot like the Chinese, but I created my own system because I tried using the Chinese system. It didn't work for me. So I studied people's palms for five and a half years and irises to see the similarities in people who had various diseases and see how they showed up in the hands and in the eyes. So I got a pretty good basis for reading by looking at the indications in the hands. So I do mini readings. They take six to ten minutes, cost $40, and I will tell you how your glands are working, how they appear to be working, your bloodstream, what kind of meats would be best for you to eat, and the type of foods. I won't give you a schedule to eat because there's not enough time, and I can't get enough information just in the hands and your skin tones.

Then on Sunday and Monday, I do full consults where I photograph your irises, and I can see a pinprick of the eye as big as my little finger. So I can see all the toxicity in the body, where it is, where you're malfunctioning. It takes an hour and 15 minutes the first time, and it's $375. Follow-ups, people have been to me before, it takes an hour, and we compare your last photographs of your irises with your new ones, and if you've done the diet pretty well, you can see the changes. The most dramatic one I have that will come out in my detox book, this woman with black eyes, eight years later with orange and blue eyes. She was born with black eyes, she will have blue eyes when they're finished. My eyes were brown and green 42 years ago and now they're blue. So it doesn't mean everybody has blue eyes. There are blue eyes, there are hazel eyes, and there are brown eyes, but the brown eyes should be amber. Clean brown eyes. There should be no black eyes and no dark brown eyes. It should be amber. That is the method that we have. I think I'm all booked up on Sunday. If I'll stay at the hotel even longer or we can go up to the hotel in Dayton. I'm going to visit my parents for about four days, so I can always do them up there if I leave this hotel down here. So I think I'm pretty much booked up. There may be one appointment left on Monday, but I'm staying here a little longer, so we can book more if you want. Okay, we're going to take a 15 minute break. Those people who haven't signed up for the workshop that want to and paid, then do that. And other people, there's raw meat here that you can sample. They've been dearly kind enough to make, so you can enjoy that. Sample it if you like.

Q: I have an announcement to make. There's a sign up sheet on the table. We're having a raw Thanksgiving dinner on the Friday immediately after Thanksgiving, and we also have raw potluck every couple of months. And if you're interested in either of those, sign up on the sheet, and I'll be in touch with you.

[break]

A: Okay, is everybody ready? So first, we're going to talk about the human body. Now, talking about the digestion is primary, and digestion starts in the mouth. Now, what do we have in the mouth? We have saliva. Whenever you eat something, saliva dumps into the mouth, I mean into your food, and into the food. Now, the greatest component of saliva, human saliva, is bacteria. We have more than dogs and cats. The only creature that has more saliva are flies, and they actually have enzymes to dissolve their food before they eat it, so it's pre-digested. Everything they eat is completely pre-digested. We don't have that kind of bacterial content, nor do we have enzymes like hydrochloric acid in it like the flies do. Hydrochloric acid-like enzymes that they have. But, it's bacterial, and the bacterial that is in saliva is not for vegetation. It does not feed on anything but animal products. So, that gives you a clue right away what we should be putting in our body. The only enzyme that occurs in our digestive tract that's anything like an herbivore is ptyalin. And the horse has ptyalin, and that's to digest carbohydrates, starches, and it's very little. So, it means we need a little bit of carbohydrate, whereas the horse is inundated with ptyalin in its mouth. So, we have very little of it. When the food goes down into the stomach, we secrete hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid to digest animal substance again. It is not effectual on vegetation unless it's cooked. And then it will react on vegetation because once vegetation has been cooked, guess what starts occurring? Immediate breakdown of bacteria. Bacteria we like. So, our body starts digesting the bacteria in the cooked food. If it were raw, fresh, whole vegetables, our hydrochloric acid wouldn't do a thing with the vegetables. Then we move into the second area of the stomach usually called the duodenum, and we secrete bile. Bile digests, breaks down fat molecules into smaller molecules so that they can be made into cholesterols. We have 60 varieties of cholesterols that form from bile. So we have 60 varieties of bile that are formed by the liver, and 60 varieties of cholesterols that will be formed from the breakdown of those fats. So, cholesterol doesn't come in any food, we make cholesterols for our bodies. And that happens with the interaction of the pancreas. So, the bile helps break down fats so we can utilize fats, and I'll talk about fats later when I get into foods. So, we have the process of protein breaking down larger food particles by hydrochloric acid. First we have the bacteria introduced into it, so the bacteria surrounds it. Then the hydrochloric acid infiltrates and breaks up in little streams that you've had from, you've broken it up, cracked it a bit with the chewing. So the hydrochloric acid won't destroy the bacteria, it'll go in between and start breaking up the larger particles of food so the bacteria can infiltrate all of it and digest it. And that occurs the entire time that you're in the small intestine. 

You secrete hydrochloric acid, you secrete bile, as 10% of digestion and 90%, if you haven't taken antibiotics, and you don't have a lot of poisons in your stomach, 90% of digestion will be bacterial. Bacteria eats the substances, their excrement and secretions are our food. That gets absorbed into the intestines through the lacteal system. Now the lacteal system is a webbed network that attaches to the small intestine and the large intestines, and it's called the lacteal system because every food, no matter what it is you eat, turns into a milky white substance, just like fresh milk. And it's absorbed into the lymphatic system, and the lymphatic system transforms it into a slightly translucent substance, which is not really clear, milky kind of clear. And that is supposed to feed our bodies. So the lymph system is supposed to feed the body, but I'll get into that later. So then, as the food travels all the way through the small intestine, the nutrients from that area are feeding everything in the body except for the nervous system and brain. Then we have the bowel, I mean the bowel. So we go through the ilicical valve, some people call it the iloquial valve, and it goes up the intestines all the way around to the bowel and down and descending to the sigmoid colon, where the body absorbs everything that the bacteria has broken down. So a lot of people have constipation, but it's not true constipation. It's true constipation where you have a block in your intestine and then peristalsis stops. It doesn't get beyond that point. When you have the body hold up the fecal matter in that sigmoid colon, it's to absorb everything that the E. coli has digested. And that's how we feed our brain and nervous systems, via E. coli. So the pharmaceutical industry wants E. coli destroyed. So your brain and nervous system don't function. So you know their little ploy two years ago? What can we scare the daylights out of people? We'll take the thing we've been taking, telling everybody for years is the best thing, spinach. Even Popeye ate it to give strength and health. We're going to say that was contaminated with E. coli and people died from it. It's a story, it wasn't true. I visited the fields where the contaminations were supposed to exist. And when it was called out, the FDA called it, not the local health department. And when the local health, when the county and state health departments went into those fields to investigate it, the FDA stepped in and said no, it went across state lines, it's out of our jurisdiction. All of it got suppressed by the local government. Why did they do that? Because it's a whole ploy, it doesn't exist anyway. So several of us snuck onto the land at night and took samples and there was nothing. No E. coli whatsoever, except for a manufactured E. coli, which is the 0157H7. It is manufactured, you can't find it anywhere in nature, the only place you can find it is at a university. They've been given a sample from the FDA.

So I have found that no bacteria in food is bad. There is no good bacteria and bad bacteria, it is all good, except where man has made a bacteria. And the 0157H7 is a man-made bacteria. It's a mutant bacteria, which is a lot of nasty things. In nature, penicillin is a good thing, it's part of the bird community. It's an avian disease. It's an avian disease, when they're trying to break down their grain matter, it's a mold that helps them to digest in times of trouble when they are getting too dry a food and not enough water. So the mold will occur and start breaking down the grains and help their gizzard. We grow it and then we sterilize it before it's injected into us. It destroys the RNA to tell it to go into hibernation because all molds work in patterns. They'll work in 3 months to 5 months, they'll go dormant for 3 to 5 months, allow the body to adjust. Comes in, does it's work, which is break down toxicity in the body, or helps digestion of matter that you've eaten and move it through. But it shuts off. Penicillin, once injected into you, has no intelligence to shut down. So it's always working. And the byproducts of fungus, if they collect and add up over a long period of time, cause massive skin disorders and dehydration and drying of the tissue inside, cause sclerosis, multiple sclerosis, all kinds of diseases. So one of the, they say, you know, best thing, penicillin's been the best thing since the wheel, for the pharmaceutical industry, yes. Because one round of antibiotics and an injection of penicillin will destroy 2% of the body's entire bacterial levels. 99, understand this, 99% of your body is bacterial. All functions are because of that bacteria. Every time you lower, you take antibiotics for 7 days, you destroy 1% of the body's bacteria throughout the system, not just in the intestines, everywhere. A shot of penicillin will destroy 2% of the body's bacteria, each time you're reducing your functionality. Antibiotics are the worst thing you can ever do. Even Dr. Mendelsohn, who wrote Confessions of a Medical Heretic, said that no antibiotics are good antibiotics. None. So, the large intestine is where E. coli and other bacteria will make the final stages of digestion of fats and proteins, making them the finite particles that feed the brain and the nervous system. Now, as evidence to prove that that's the case, when my patients eat high meat, they're happy and giggling in 10 to 20 minutes, after they've eaten high meat. Why? Because the bacteria in the meat has already predigested the fats and the protein to the level to feed the brain and the nervous system. So, high meat turns that off instantly. And you can have a person who's been completely psychotic, neurotic, or whatever, completely medicated for 27 years on all these psychotropic drugs, all of a sudden stop cold turkey and be happy. Impossible in any other situation. Yet, repeatedly, in every case, it has worked. I have one fellow that will only eat high meat. He was the most depressed, cynical person I'd ever met. He was a bear of a man, and he became a landscape artist because he hated people. That's how cynical he was. And he was on and off to diet, you know, psychotropic drugs, and a diet just like that woman was. And finally I got him to try the high meat. And he got so happy the first time. He eats only high meat. He'll eat one to two pounds a day. Only high meat. 

The next time that I went to Nevada City where I lectured there, he had, now this was a man who had no relationships since he was a teenager. He was like 36, 37 years old. Hated people. He had three girlfriends at that workshop. All 10s. And he's about a six and a half. But because he got happy and felt so good and his brain started working, his nervous system started working, he became one of the funniest, most charming people in the world. You know, it's difficult to have one girlfriend and have them together. You have three girlfriends and they're all great looking girls. All at this workshop. Happy together. You've got to be charming to pull that one off. So that's what the high meat has done and what it can do for everybody. So, don't be afraid of the odors and don't be afraid of the bacteria. It is not your enemy. It is your friend. They are your friends. The medical profession wants you sick. They do not make any money unless you are sick. It is that black and white. So, the E. coli and other bacteria are the final stages for digestion to feed the brain and nervous system. If you have low bacterial levels the body is going to hold that fecal matter up and you are going to have so-called constipation. And I'll get into how you relieve that later. And then when the body secretes or excretes the fecal matter, then what is left feeds the rest of the world. And we have our soil level increases every year, so the planet gets bigger every year. It's fatter because of our organic waste. If we didn't have any organic waste, then we wouldn't have that reaction of feeding the planet growing. So, that's our contribution. So, we don't digest everything unless we are in a starving or low food intake period. So, if there are times when food is low, you'll find that you will have very little excrement. If you eat a lot, you'll find out most of the time you'll have more excrement. And that just means feeding nature a little bit better. And if you're like I am, I live out in the mountains of Malibu, I don't go in the toilet. I just go out and feed the other creatures. And let me tell you, that fecal matter doesn't stick around. It's gone quickly. Not by flies either. By coyotes, by wolves, by the hawks, the ravens, they all come down for mine. It's a good raw substance, there's good raw meat in it. So don't worry about how much fecal matter you have. Don't worry about the color of it. Don't worry about if you have diarrhea. That's all a process of the body adjusting its bacterial levels for proper digestion. And none of it is a problem. It is only a natural process of cleansing and digesting properly. So do not fear diarrhea, do not fear constipation. If you're constipated and you're actually still moving stuff, it's just hard. You have too low of bacteria, the way to increase that is to eat high meats to help input, give more bacteria into the body. Or doing a suppository of three tablespoons each of butter, coconut cream, and dairy cream with a quarter teaspoon of honey. Only a quarter teaspoon. Put that in a four ounce jelly jar, mix it together, then put it in a bowl of hot water. This is before you go to sleep at night.

And you'll take a bulb syringe, fill it with the warm, it has to be a little above body temperature, up to 105 degrees, and then get on all fours and bark like a dog, and then squeeze it up inside you, and roll your tummy like a belly dancer, you know, with your shoulders to the ground, your knees, your buttocks still up on your knees, and then it'll move into the, from the sigmoid colon and move up the descending colon and cross over. Then it will start feeling, feeding the E. coli from the back end, and they really need fat. Because most of your fat's all absorbed by the time it gets down to the sigmoids, the ileocecal valve. As soon as the food has moved into the bowel, almost all of the fat in the raw food diet, if you haven't been on the raw diet for 30, 40 years, is all going to be absorbed. That means the E. coli and the bacteria in the colon get very little fat. Unless you eat a phenomenal amount of fat. And still then it won't absorb a lot. So then it moves, you know, then if you feed it from this end, of course then the E. coli gets the fresh stuff. Well, if it's high it's even better. Sour cream is even better to put up in. Moldy butter that smells like blue cheese is the best. Anything that's pre-digested is always better to put inside... Slightly fermented coconut cream is better than fresh to feed the bowel. Remember the bowel gets the end of digestion anyway. This already has things pre-digested that come into it. It's just the final stage.

Q: The third on that was butter, coconut cream and the third one was it dairy or was it...

A: Dairy cream.

Q: Dairy cream, okay.

A: Three fats.

Q: Okay.

A: Because they need a variety. I found that this is a variety.

Q: And how much?

A: Three tablespoons each.

Q: It's interesting how many of us are writing this.

A: And usually you only have to do that once every two weeks. Some people once every three days. You have to see how long it satisfies you and then use it again. And there's no harm in ever doing it. I mean if you push it up in there and then, you know, you stand up right away and you move it, not going to do much for you. Very, very little. So you've got to keep it in. And rolling your stomach while you're down, shoulders to the floor or bed, wherever you are. And your buttocks up is going to move it. Then you can lie on your right side and roll your stomach some more and that'll help it travel down to this side too. You can all take belly dancing lessons. The belly dancer didn't teach me, I learned that when I was a kid. I was an autistic kid to get the food to move through. Because I was sitting at the dinner table so it wouldn't hang up in the stomach. And that would help move it through. Let's get into, that takes care of the digestive tract. Now all along the way, all of the bacteria, all of it, is meant for animal matter. Dairy, eggs, meats of all kinds. Our body has to adapt and change to handle vegetation, nuts, starch, anything like that. It's a whole change to the system. That's why even the tribes, even the American Indians who are here in the Ohio Valley, for the last 15,000 years, the Coster excavations that occurred here all through the 60s and 70s, they found that for that 15,000 years that they studied the remains, that the Indians around here were mainly nomadic. And they tried to become agriculturally based, and would hang around in this valley because of the river, it was good for growing, irrigating, and stuff like that, that they would always get osteoporosis after a few hundred years. So they'd have to pull up stakes and become nomadic again, and not live off of anything but their hunting. And very rarely did they ever gather anything. Gathering took a lot of work, you'd have to take pine cones and break the nuts out of them. Massive amount of work for very little nutrition. So you only do that if you're starving, if you're not hunters, you know, you've already exhausted, when you stay put, you exhaust your animals around unless you're into husbandry, into breeding them, helping them breed fast. Out in nature, they don't breed fast. Nothing breeds fast, except, well, even rabbits don't breed fast. Unless they are the only creatures, like in the deserts of Australia, that's the only place where rabbits have the freedom. They don't have a lot of dogs and coyotes and everything to eat them, then they multiply faster there than anywhere else. Nobody's competing with their food out there. But all animals, including humans, do not procreate quickly when they're in small tribal environments.

So, anyway, they tried to be agricultural, they weren't able to do it, started developing osteoporosis, teeth got bad, teeth got loose, couldn't chew on things as well, so they became nomadic again. They showed that pattern eight times in 15,000 years. So, again, we are made to digest animal products. Okay, let's take a look at the endocrine gland system. We have a glandular system that has both endocrine gland and non-endocrine glands. Endocrine glands are those that dump, that manufacture hormones and dump directly into the blood. The liver is a gland, but it's not an endocrine gland because it doesn't dump its bile into the blood, it dumps it into the gallbladder and the gallbladder dumps it into the intestines, to the stomach and intestines. The endocrine glands are pituitary, pineal, whatever you want to call it, thyroid, parathyroids, thymus, adrenal glands and gonads. Those are all endocrine glands. Now, endocrine glands are for emergency purposes only. If you fall out of a tree, knock the wind out of yourself, let's say you fell 50 feet, you knock the wind out of yourself, your heart and your lungs stop working. What happens? Thyroid will kick in and produce thyroxine. If that's not enough to make the heart and the lungs go again, then the parathyroids will kick in. Now, this is the only gland where you have backups to the backup. You've got two thyroids and you've got four parathyroids. You've got a backup and a backup. These will kick in first and if necessary, these will kick in. You've got six glands there to make sure the heart and the lungs keep working. That is in emergency purposes. You shouldn't need thyroxine to function at any other time. If you're going through a period where you've been in a fire and all of your animals are destroyed, and the children are not going to grow, you're not going to heal properly, the pituitary gland kicks in and puts out growth hormones. If you're on a good diet, there's no growth hormones necessary because your food is of a value that will help the division of cells rapidly and normally. If you're feeding your child pasteurized milk, powdered milk, stuff like that, then the pituitary reads, the body reads, the body is in an emergency situation, starvation, and then the pituitary will kick in and then you have normal growth. However, the degree of health depends upon what is eaten and if it's cooked foods and you're allowing your pituitary to secrete your growth, you're going to be short-lived and not as healthy. Now, the thymus protects the intestinal environment. If something goes wrong in the intestines, you eat a poisoned mushroom, you eat something poisonous, let's say you were experimenting and had a bunch of rosemary. Rosemary is poisonous if you have too much. You use a little bit for flavoring, but let's say you juice it, and I've experimented with it, definitely will kill you, and I juiced it, made it 10% of my juice, and I nearly died in 24 hours. 

It made me dizzy, completely lost consciousness, I was vomiting, had diarrhea, at one point I couldn't even stand, I couldn't crawl, I was just a blob on the floor, and that went on for about 10 hours. Like I say, I don't accept anything that anybody tells me until I've experimented with it myself. I'm still alive, but I didn't exaggerate, and I didn't eat the rosemary alone, and I had it with other juices, vegetable juices, and I didn't do it to the point to kill myself, but I needed to see what would happen. Very old shark can do the same, very old stingray, because the bacteria breaks down those particular proteins from those particular animals into high ammonia. Ammonia can also kill you, even natural ammonia. It can also help you in small amounts. So this is the kind of thing that you will learn as you read other information that I have, but I can't get into those kind of details. If I did, we'd be here five, ten weeks, you know, eight hours a day. But just to give you an idea of there are ways that you can poison yourself even naturally, so you have to be careful. So the thymus would kick in in that time, so I could feel my thymus working heavily to save me. The thymus is the only gland that is almost completely flat, fat. I mean it's completely white, it looks like it's all fat. And you can't tell that it's a functioning gland because it's just fat, it just looks like a glob of fat. And it has no, you can't see the functionality, it's all prostaglandin effects which means the activity happens within the cells in that tissue and the whole gland doesn't have a particular shape that has muscle tissue and all of our glands have muscles. The heart and the liver are both organs and, well the liver is both a gland and an organ and the heart is just an organ, but those two are predominantly fat, I mean predominantly protein, very little fat in them. The thymus is strictly a fatty substance, it's like the white blood cells, phagocytes, and it will go in and protect the intestinal tract in emergencies and health and if you haven't poisoned yourself too badly, the thymus can prevent death and even severe illness or too severe reactions. And as we go down we know with the adrenal glands, let's say you've been beat pretty badly, you've been hunting and you got trampled on by a herd of buffalos or something and you're not going to get up and move. The adrenal glands kick in and then you have the strength of usually two times more than you ever had before, sometimes three times more. There was a woman that a car was running over her baby and she went and picked up the back end. It was a three thousand pound car, two and a half tons she was able to pick it up. Why? Because that adrenal got into her glands in an emergency situation, I mean got into her blood, emergency situation and lifted the car. Normally that would never happen, can't get it to happen, impossible. 

We know that if you inject adrenaline into the blood or the heart it will start pumping and it will be really strong for days from that injection and if you pump too much into the body then of course you could kill it because you cause it to pound so hard it goes into a cramp. You have a charley horse and the heart's dead from pumping too hard. And when you get a shot of adrenaline there's very little adrenaline in all of that fluid. They have to dilute it tremendously. It isn't even one percent of that fluid. It's barely 0.001, one hundredth of a percent of that fluid is adrenaline. Tells you how powerful it is. Then we have the gonads, that's for reproduction and most tribes are very considerate. There's always seven years between babies until the mother completely recuperates and the succeeding babies aren't malnourished until the mother is completely recuperated. And when the tribe has a baby, the whole tribe has a baby. It doesn't belong to just the woman or the man who donated to the biological. They all take care of the baby. So it's a very considerate environment. We on the other hand will just mass produce and we just hope our children grow up good. Do they? Many times they don't because we don't know how. We're not taught how to raise kids like tribes do. They're very much more conscious about it. So we reproduce and reproduce. So again the gonads are for reproduction but always for specific purposes. Even though they can be our intent. It still is not something that the body uses constantly. There is one animal that has sex all the time. I forgot what animal that is. Oh, the rooster. The rooster will have sex 30-50 times a day and I want to be a rooster next time. That is the only animal that just goes around. But eggs are so much produced that in order for the eggs to be of some value of creating offspring, the eggs have to be fertilized. So that's their reality. But for us to have sex, it's pleasure as well as procreative purposes and we just have to be careful with it. So that takes care of the endocrine glands. Now with the other glands, we have the brain, not counting the pituitary and pineal. I left out the pineal because nobody knows. People say, mystics say it's the seat of consciousness. I'm not that conscious to know, to be able to discern that. But it has some kind of connection in our sleep so it could connect with other realities in the dream state. The brain is an organ, is a gland and an organ and of course it handles the information from the body and also creatively it handles it from its own creative processes. But mainly the brain is to make sure that we can function as a human being, as an organism. So without the communication, I couldn't lift this arm, even though it's automatic and I don't have to think about doing all of this. I say, okay, I want to move this finger that way, this finger that way. I want to tilt over here, move over this way. It just happens, it just does it automatically.

That's the communication between the brain and the nerves, the spinal cord that goes through all that. It's pretty much instantaneous. Unless you're a cell, then you see it as a very slow process, all of that movement. But for us, it's instantaneous. Now that is how we function. The light and electricity, there are light and electrical currents that travel through the nervous system to the brain and that registers information. So how do we transport light and how do we conduct electricity? Through metallic minerals. Now we have metallic minerals in every food that we eat. There's aluminum, there's gold, there's traces of all kinds of metallic minerals, of arsenic, of lead, of mercury. But they are all very beneficial in trace amounts and as long as they are in raw food where there's no fractionation of the bond between the ion and the mineral. Once they are so broken with cooking, most of them become free radicals and do damage. And they can do a lot of damage. They can reduce your life span by 50%. And we actually live less than 50% of the life we were supposed to. All animals live seven times the time it takes them to finish maturation. We finish maturation at 21 years old. Seven times 21 is 147 years. So we should be living to 150 years, basically. We're dropping dead at 60s and 70s, mainly. That's what we average. Around 62 years old is my age, is the average death age. Average death age. You see, there's few people in the world that live above 100. And then many, many people die at birth or in childhood. And it's a lot more to do that than live to 100 years old. So if our average is 62 years old, what is the real average if the medical profession were truthful? Late 40s? Same thing they're accusing of our lifespan being before they made it better, 100 years ago. Because that's what they said, the lifespan average of 47 years old, it's no different than it was back then. Still that age if you consider everybody. People who live longer over an average are people who live in countries and on farms. Very few early deaths. Why? Because they're not unless they're using chemical farming. But 100 years ago, those were the people who lived longest. Your women who died in childbirth were rarely ever farm people like you see on TV. It was people living in the city getting poor food, no fresh food, there was no refrigeration. So these people were cooking already degenerated moldy food products. When you mutate a mold or a bacteria, they can have a lot of toxic byproducts that can cause a lot of illness and sickness. So again, any of those statistics that you hear from the pharmaceutical and medical community are all designed to make them look good and not tell you the truth about what's going on.

Q: When you were talking about the metallic minerals, do you mean even things like mercury?

A: All those are good in small amounts. Now if you have a question in the future, write it down and if I don't answer by the end, we're going to have a Q&A and get it then. One time I answered, I let people ask questions during the workshop all through it. We didn't leave until 1 o'clock in the morning. Because when you ask me specific questions, usually I'll get into details about why and then some anecdotes and then I tell you much more than I intended to tell you at that particular event and we'll be here all night. I'm sure a lot of people won't want to be here all night. If you have a question, probably 99% of the time I will answer it, but you will have a chance at the end to ask that question if I don't answer. These minerals are very beneficial in trace amounts. The high mercury in flying fish and swordfish is very important for their buoyancy. Without that mercury they could never reach the heights that they do. The flying fish would never be able to fly without that mercury. It helps it stay lofty, especially in fluids, so it can rise up and fly or jump or leap very far. Also we found that some whales that leap very high are high in mercury too, not because of the pollution in the world, but because plankton that goes out there and breaks it down from all of the mercury that's in the rocks in the ocean. The algae breaks it down, the algae discharges it, the plankton breaks it down to a substance that certain animals, whales and seals and different animals eat the plankton. That's not a toxic mercury. Pharmaceutical industry wants you to believe it is because they are poisoning you with mercury with injections and they want you to blame our oceans and our fish for your mercury toxicity, but one injection of mercury, of any vaccine with mercury in it or any injection, even penicillin has mercury in it. Almost all injections have mercury, liquid mercury in them. The amount of toxicity from one injection would be like a hundred years of eating fish. But you're getting it all at one time, it's very toxic. You get into the fish, you're eating a little at a time, you'll be able to utilize it. There is no toxicity from that. Only from medicines are you going to get it, but of course the government and the medical profession are checking their butts for legal suits, so there's a legal argument. You can even avoid lawsuits because people are correlating, oh, I'm eating too much fish, I've got all this mercury in my body, hogwash. People don't even eat fish that are in the society have tons of mercury in their body, high mercury levels. So it can'r be the fish. I eat, mostly the fish I eat are high mercury fish. I like oysters and I like scallops and swordfish. Swordfish is my favorite and that's considered the highest in mercury. I had all my hair on different parts of my body checked and I didn't have over 4.28. And you're not toxic with mercury until you're 11 point something. And then you're very toxic if you're 14 point something. I mean some places, I took the different patches of my head.

They're always saying take it from the nap of the neck. And I said why take it from the nap of the neck? Let's see what concentrations are all over the body. So I took seven different locations of the body and sent them in and everyone had a different concentration. The lowest was back here. Why take it from there then? The highest was here at the temple. That was the 4.2 or 3.8. Again, even the naturopaths are locked in to taking it from the least toxic area. Why? Because laboratories are doing it. Where are the laboratories making most of their money from? The medical profession. If they're farming their work out, we'll do your hair analysis for you. Here's where we want you to take it from the nap of the neck. And I say, why? Oh, that's where you'll find the most concentration. Well, let me see the records from your test showing that you've analyzed all the parts of the head. Well, some university did do it. I said, well, what university? I want to go check. We don't know. We just know it's true. So I did it. Now what I did was, I'm on the radar for the medical profession. They've come after me many times. They've threatened me. They poisoned the food in my house. Last April 2nd, I was held down in a hotel room and injected with three vaccines. And I broke out over the next, or with whatever they injected me with, for the next five months with terrible eruptions that I was barely able to move. And this is the result. I've got these all over my body. And I nearly died from it. They weren't expecting me to wake up. They had a cloth over my face. There was something in it. It wasn't ether because I knew what that smelled like. But they were pushing me down. When I woke up, and by the time I became conscious, something ached in my arm. I looked over, a hypodermic was dangling and there were two more next to it. And they pushed, one of them pushed the cloth against my face, mouth and nose again and I was out in a few seconds. So, within 24 hours I was broken out. I had tiny little scars everywhere. I have freckles. You know, I have minor freckles. Freckles come from vaccines, toxicity, a lot of them, in people who don't normally have freckles. And people who eat a lot of moldy potatoes eat freckles, that's why the Irish have so many freckles. Different things create freckles. Those are glandular tissue, they can no longer function as a gland or an organ and get sent to the skin where they can still be alive and act. So from those injections I became like Robert Redford and I had very little freckles on my body before that. And then all of these I got huge open scars that became white and detoxed better than these did. And it looks like I had actual shrapnel in these different spots from this detoxification. So the medical profession is out to protect itself heavily. The reason they did that to me, I think, was I did a radio show on February 8th, last year and somehow somebody, a caller in or the host, I forgot who it was, mentioned the swine flu that was just starting to come up. And I had been to the swine flu fiasco of 76.

I knew the people who stopped the swine flu caper, Ida Honorof, who was a consumer advocate, and Dr. McBean, Eleanor McBean in San Diego. They knew that it was a hoax. They filed suit against President Ford, Rockefeller, who owned the Pharmaceutical House that got the contract on the vaccines. He was our Vice President, and then the Surgeon General, so he filed suit. Now because Ida Honorof was a consumer advocate and syndicated in 3,200 radio stations all over the United States and Canada, she was listened to. So she said, you watch the polling place where these people are getting their free government paid for injections. They're going to be dropping dead and getting very sick. They counted 2,300 dropped dead within six weeks. Do you know what the count is if you go to the CDC? 48. There were 3,200 people that dropped dead, and a lot of the news networks, the smaller ones carried it. The bigger news networks didn't, but they still carried it because back at that time, most of your news networks, especially papers, were still owned by families who had pride in giving out news. They weren't conglomerate owned by General Electric and Disney and those companies that own the networks now. It is completely in the hands of corporations, and those corporations feed each other, especially the medical profession. So I brought up the names, where people could go to get the information on the swine flu. The fiasco of 76, I got so many calls for that. I got calls for information, they wanted more, wanted me to be on lots of TV and radio stations, and I was getting death threats for three weeks. So I left the country to get away, and they got me. April 2nd, I woke to that, and then of course I blacked out. When I woke in the morning, I just thought it was, I remembered, I thought it was a nightmare until I went to turn over, and everything in my body ached. It was like I went back in time 30 years. These three bumps were there with a hole in the center, so they were injection spots. I started breaking out with all kinds of different forms of skin eruptions within 12 hours, and these lasted months and months. I still worked. I still went and did workshops. I very rarely sat like this. I was walking around and still functioned. I was able to do that, even poisoned to that extent. This diet can get you through anything. Not that you will go without being scarred, but this diet is that powerful. This food is that powerful that it can sustain you through almost anything. Of course, I know what foods to eat to mitigate those experiences. Because I was in Asia at the time on an island that wasn't very advanced, there was very little I could get. I couldn't get butter. I couldn't get dairy of any kind. I had some butter with me, which helped. I had to seek out the foods, the particular kinds of fish like the shark and the stingray. I had to look in ports and stuff like that to get what I needed to survive through it, and I did. Now, all of that experience in more detail, you'll find in my next newsletter if you subscribe to the newsletter.

You'll get all the photographs, because I did document this one, and all the stages of the eruptions and what they looked like. You see things coming out of it, fibers and insects and all kinds of things that were injected into me. So they were injecting some, like in the sky right now, you see all those chemtrails in the sky. They're dumping microbes from the sky which have some eggs in them, and if they happen to procreate in your body, you're going to be diagnosed with Morgellons disease, where you have fibers and insects that breed inside your body and come out of your skin. A lot more of that is happening only since the chemtrails, and a lot of people have analyzed the chemtrail discards, and they're pretty bad. They caught a plane doing it, I was reading an article, they caught a plane in China, and it was a Russian outfit, the crew that was doing it with an American government plane with discharging toxins in the air. They could evaporate like 40,000 gallons in like eight hours, discharged that much chemicals into the air. The Chinese military brought them to the ground, and they're under arrest for murder. They found all this chemical, insects, and all kinds of biochemical warfare agents that were produced in the United States on that plane. So, our government is not your friend, because you have to understand who's running the government. The government is spending all of Social Security, they say it will run out in 2041, but with my mathematical ability it's going to end 2021, 2017. What's going to happen to our baby boomer people? Not getting their Social Security, not getting their retirement, there's going to be a revolt, and who are they going to go after? They're going to go after Washington, D.C. So, what do they do to get rid of you? Swine flu, chemtrails, people going to drop dead early. Not going to make it to retirement, those in retirement are going to drop dead, whole swine flu fiasco. So far, if you look at Jon Rapaport's site, he keeps the statistics on with the CDC claims, with the news claims, and what is actually laboratory tested, J-O-N, Jon Rapaport, R-A-P. He showed that the statistics show that there's only 48 people so-called had been actually tested chemically in a laboratory and so-called proved to be swine flu. So, I said, wait a minute, you can't get swine flu until it's injected in you. So, the people who got swine flu in Mexico got a flu shot or a shot injection just before they came down and were analyzed with the swine flu. Thirty days before that, Obama was down there having a conference with the president and the vice president and a shipment of vaccines was accompanying with him. Medication, document. So, all of a sudden, 30 days later, we've got a swine flu epidemic. Now, to have swine flu because it was so rare and it only exists really in birds, the only way that you can be looking for it is you have a particular structure of waste products that normally come when a chicken or a bird of any kind is breaking down toxins in itself.

So, you have this broken down fluid, virus anonymizer like soaps or solvents. So, you infractionate parts of the cell that are damaged so that we can rebuild them. So, when you have these fluids that are the end product of the cleansing, that's what you call flu. Never been known to procreate. They don't remanufacture themselves. They don't self-duplicate. That's like saying tied soap duplicates itself. It's the most absurd and it's contagious. It's the most absurd thing if you know chemistry. So, what they did was they put that chemical makeup in the analysis machines. These machines are very expensive and it will go through and determine what properties are in tissue that you're having analyzed in sputum or scraped tissue like in biopsies or in mucus or in blood, whatever, and they test it and that machine will look for every product and then what levels they may show up. So, that swine flu has never been in any database until a year ago. Why did it all of a sudden show up in a database? Why did the swine flu show up in Mexico City right after those medical vaccines, those medical hypodermic injections were delivered to Mexico? If there is real no contamination, only 48 people have actually been found to have the test showing that they had swine flu biochemical makeup in it. People die, they estimate, estimate again, they guesstimate, 36,000 people die every, yeah, 36,000 people die every year worldwide from normal flu. So we are supposed to have the flu starting to occur last February and here we are already into November, mid-November and only 48 people have been diagnosed, actually diagnosed with swine flu and the CDC is throwing out, well, about 40,000 people have died of swine flu worldwide. The CDC themselves said, we are going to stop testing for swine flu back in April of last year. Now, why would they say they are going to stop testing for it? So they can throw out any number they want. You have to look at the inconsistencies and the fraud that is going on here to realize how bad these people are. They need mass deaths so people won't worry about their not getting their social security and all the money being drawn out of government and taking more and more and more of your dollars. So, the only way that we are going to be able to survive is to support people like Joe and Janet. Keep these farms alive so you can stay alive. You are not relying upon these grocery stores that have no food in them. Every processed food is pretty much valueless. It has at least 60 known additives in every food, even if it is organic. Do you know where the organic people get their food mostly? They go to a laboratory, like I told you before with your natural foods, I mean your natural supplements so called. They go to a laboratory and say okay we want to make a food that is organic and we don't want to use any chemicals in it, no processing, no herbicides and pesticides and stuff like that.

The only way they can get such a food and process to the point where they can make it into something in a package they have to go to Purina, General Mills, General Foods and say let me buy your waste product and they take the waste product that has already had tons of chemical treatments loaded with pesticides and all that, but they will not add any more. They will not make it with anything unnatural. They will use kerosene derivatives and wood alcohol and so called natural substances. They'll use gibberellic acid which comes from rice bran. They'll use stuff like that. Still once it's extracted from the food it is then a chemical itself. So all this stuff organic, it isn't organic. The only place you can get organic food is if you're getting produce that was labeled and is organic. Even your chickens and your eggs. Organic chickens are organically grown. One of the biggest hoodwinks of all of the FDA and USDA. Your organic chickens, 99.9% of all the growers of them are feeding soy to their chickens. Soy that was organically grown. What happens to chickens if they eat raw soy? They die. What happens if humans eat raw soy that are non-fermented? They die. So the only way humans and birds can eat soy if it's highly processed. It's usually a kerosene derivative. Plus you have to use heat to destroy the enzyme which can cause death. Now herbivores, cows, goats, horses, can eat soy. Their meat tastes like cardboard, but they can eat it without repercussions. And it's a great protein source. Easy to grow. Beans you can poison to hell and even if you don't have any leaves on your vine, you'll still get beans. That's why they love beans. They can destroy anything and still grow them and have beans. Even if the worst plant growth in the world is there, no leaves on the vine at all, you will still produce beans. So they feed this processed soy to chickens and still call it organic because the soy had been raised organically. But it's not organic by the time they feed it to the chickens. I went after the FDA for it, the USDA, and I've gone after chicken manufacturers who sell to health food stores. They said, it doesn't matter. The FDA says it's okay. I said, you're in the health food store business and you're telling me that's okay? I said, you're as corrupt as the pharmaceutical industry. Well, that's the way it is. They don't give a shit about your health. It's all about their profits. They can feed cheap protein to these chickens. They'll get fat strong. They'll get plenty of disease, but they know they're going to butcher them before you ever see it. So, protect your local farmers and buy from them. Then you will have good food, always. Especially dairy. You say, oh, food. I'm jumping ahead and talking about food, but the USDA has their food pyramid and they have like 10 things on the food pyramid. I just visited a tribe last November on an island in the Philippines. The Philippines has 7,107 islands. You couldn't visit all of them in 5 lifetimes. So, I'm trying to get to the most remote ones. Now, the Philippine government does not like that. It has banned in Mindanao, they banned me from being allowed to rent cars.

They have my name plastered. I can't even rent a car in Mindanao, the biggest island. I tried to get permission to visit some of the tribes there. They said, oh, the tribes here are cannibalistic, they'll eat you. We have to protect you, you can't go in there. You know, bullshit. Cannibalistic, most absurd thing in the world. But I tried, I said I'm a scientist, I experiment with food, I'm not going to add anything to their diets, I just want to observe them, get a translator, hopefully just talk to them about their health, observe a while, and that's it. I'm not going to bring anything to them, I'm not going to give them money, I'm not going to do anything. Go in there with just my clothes, and I'll go in with native clothes if you want me to. Would not let me do it. The more I talked, the more they banned me from doing things. Finally they threatened me with, you go to any one of those tribes, you get 10 years in jail and $10,000 fine for each day you're with them. So when I got that threat, I was really angry, so I figured I needed a massage, so I went to a S&M mall there. They have lots of S&M malls, as they call. There was a spa in there, so I went in and got a massage. But the receptionist, there was about a 25-year-old girl, native girl, dark skinned. She had a baby next to her in a crib, a hand-carried crib. The baby was as white as her T-shirt. White as her T-shirt. The father was pretty black, very dark, a native Filipino. I looked at that baby and the baby was catatonic. I said, what are you feeding your baby? She says, feeding him the best things. He was just born really sick. I said, what are you feeding him? The doctors in the hospital said, this powdered milk, this certain formula. I put my head down in my hands and I said, all the Pottenger experiments that used powdered milk gave the worst diseases to animals. They had the shortest lives and they were the sickest. This is genocide. Genocide. Because every baby, every health center in the Philippines, everywhere in the Philippines are told powdered milk is the best milk. I said, it's really a dangerous substance. Even if you pasteurize the milk, it's better than this. But your baby has leukemia because of the powdered milk. I went over to another island where I had found a dairy. I'll get on those islands and if I can't get a car, I'll get a motorcycle. So most of the time I'm riding motorcycles all over the place and dirt bikes so I can get back to areas where nobody else gets. Or I rent a 4x4 and then go in remote places where nobody goes unless you're going by foot or boat. I found a dairy on this small island that would sell me lots of raw milk. So I took her back about six liters of the raw milk and gave them to her and the baby's color was in and normal in three days of drinking the raw milk. Three days. [voice breaking] So the grandfather was so excited because he thought he was going to lose his grandson. I'm a softie, what can I say? So the grandfather, he was 53 years old, had left his tribe when he was three years old.

So it had been 50 years since he had been back with the tribe and it was a pretty primitive tribe. He said, I'm sorry, he was 53 and he left it at 20 years old. So he had been gone from them for more than half of his life. He said, I will get you to a tribe. He said, I work for the government and I work as a liaison between the tribe and the government. So I said, great, wonderful. So he couldn't even get permission for me. He spent a whole week trying and he said, I can't do it, but I'm going to tell you what, I'm going to take a leave of absence and we're going to go anyway. So we had to take a four-wheel drive, a day trip. We had to take a day trip in a boat and then we had to swim for about a mile and this is all to get to this one island where his tribe came from. We picked up his cousin who had only left the tribe seven years ago, last November, so we picked him up for better translation, better communication. So got to the tribe, they wouldn't let me into their village, so they brought quite a few of their villagers out to meet me and of course we had a three-way translation from their native language to Bisaya to Tagalog to English. So it took time, but I thought I was talking to late 30-year-old women and early 40-year-old women, and these women and men were in their 70s and 80s. Perfect teeth, white, solid. And I said, well, how old do you live? And they said 140, 150 is what we average. And we only have a child every seven years, and we straddle them, sometimes we have one every three or four years, by different women. And we keep the tribe low, we keep it self-sustaining, self-sufficient. We live like this, we go fishing every day, we eat raw fish only, and we eat coconut meat, and a fruit once in a while, a banana, a green banana or a green mango. And they don't eat much fruit. So they eat three foods, that shoots the hell out of the USDA pyramid. The USDA pyramid is to keep your manufacturers in money and you eat their garbage food. That's all they ate, fish. And these guys were stocky and big, and the women were solid. And I had this concept that if you ate fish, you'd always be skinny. And these guys were huge, and yet the Maasai tribe in Africa only eats red meat, and they're the skinniest, tallest, strongest, healthiest tribe that there were before the eight year drought, or nine year drought now. But they've deteriorated and they're accepting care packages. Dehydrated milk and cereals, so the health is going down fast. The tribes are almost decimated. They've lost over two-thirds of their tribal members and three-fourths of their herds by the droughts that were induced by our government, in conjunction with the UK British government. They created an environment by spraying over those. They created a desert where they couldn't feed their cattle anymore. Again, getting rid of the welfare class so they can take up all the minerals, the mining minerals and the jewels from the land without having to pay for it.

Then they're paying off these government people that are running the government phenomenal amounts of money, just like they did in the Philippines, and like they do in every country. They fatten the people in the government and everybody else falls and has a reduced life and happiness and welfare. The peanut industry by the British in Northern Africa. Eighty years ago, the UK went in there heavily and told them... 120 years ago, but 80 years ago it peaked. They said, your tribes, instead of getting three chickens a week per family, you're going to get chicken every day for the family. You'll increase your protein, you'll increase everything. By the time ten years is over, when you agriculture and grow peanuts the way that the British government did, and the King and Queen of England run that industry, and the Windsor family, they own 73% of all of the world's food processing and food manufacturing in the world. They're one of the richest families in the world. They created this whole hoax. By the time you raise peanuts for ten years, you can't grow anything in that land anymore. Nothing. Not a tree or a shrub will grow. It usually grows in a desert. It's that bad. All these tribes are completely left, no chickens, no meat at all, and decimated and died. Don't listen to the pyramid scheme or anything. We can live on two foods mainly, some kind of raw meat, and some kind of intense fat, whether it's milk product or coconut. We're not going to get coconuts here, so you better rely on milk. Coconuts don't grow here. If we don't have access to food, the only thing you're going to have is milk. That's all you need, meat and milk. Of course, if you have disease and problems, you're going to need some vegetables to help cleanse the body. We'll get into that when I start talking about that. Okay, let's go back to the glands and the organs in the body. We go down to the tonsils. Now why do we have tonsils and adenoids? They protect the brain. They process everything that goes into the mouth and prevent heavy metals and toxins from getting into the brain. Now why did the epidemic of tonsillitis start in the late 40s and early 50s? Canned foods came out with World War II. All the metal poisoning in canned foods. All of a sudden the body is taking all this metal, preventing it from going to the brain, and it completely started dissolving the tonsils. So kids were in constant tonsillitis, trying to break down those toxins that were deteriorating their own glands. So instead of, and they knew it, it happened in the animal experiments. They know what it caused. But they wanted to keep their canned foods and processed foods going in the racket. So they tell you, oh you just have to have your tonsils removed. There's no reason for it. It's just some microbe in your body causing the problem. Always blaming a microbe. You notice that when it's a swine flu or it's an Avian flu or used to be they would blame the Polish flu and the Spaniard flu or the Spanish flu. We used to be like that and then they decided well they can't attack the humans, they need humans to be afraid of organisms in their environment that they can't see and talk to.

Because if you talk to a Spaniard you're not going to think oh that guy's going to give me disease, going to give me a flu that's going to kill me. The Spanish flu is the biggest joke in the world. It's one of the first nationwide vaccines that they ever put out. And of course nobody got it unless they took the vaccine worldwide. It was the first world circulated vaccine and it wasn't even for something like tuberculosis. So that's what causes the Spanish flu. Of course they're going to give it a name that confuses you, that completely removes their culpability. So tonsils are to protect the brain. Do you have any tonsils? Your brain is in much difficulty if you eat canned foods and processed foods. Then we have the thyroids, I talked about that. They protect the lungs and the heart, keep them going and beating. And then we have the lungs themselves and what do the lungs do? Lungs absorb oxygen so that the red blood cells can transport oxygen everywhere in the body. The white blood cells, the phagocytes, white blood cells are mainly fat cells, 80% fat, 60-80% fat. They absorb toxins and will help escort them, dump them into the bowels or mainly out the skin so that the body can discard the toxins through the skin. And I'll get into that when we get to the organs and skin. So that's the process. So the lungs, where we absorb the oxygen, most of it, we can't absorb it from the skin too. So it's absorbed from the lungs, a major part of it, and that is how we get our energy. It's from oxygen mixed with fats, whether they're fats made from a carbohydrate, fats made from a protein, or fats made from fat. And the quality of fat is dependent, but we'll get into that when I talk about fats in food and how we process them. So then we have the liver, I talked about the liver, manufactures bile to digest fats. The gallbladder doesn't produce anything. It's a storage place for bile. It will contain enough bile for you to be able to eat about 10 gallons of ice cream in a few days. Who needs to eat that much fat? Why the hell do we need a gallbladder to store that much bile to digest that much fat? Well, when we were hunters, we'd kill a buffalo, a big animal, you needed to eat the fat right away and always the fat was eaten first. So you could eat 5-10 pounds of fat in 24-48 hours. If you didn't have that reserve of bile, what would happen? You'd have constant diarrhea and wouldn't digest it. It would just be passing through your body. So, you have a gallbladder to store that bile so that you can digest lots of fat. If your gallbladder is removed, you'll notice that if you eat an intense amount of fat, you end up with diarrhea and also bone deterioration because it will defat the body. I mean, it will demineralize the body. So, don't get your gallbladder removed for any reason. Don't get any gland or organ removed for any reason. So then, we jump over to the other side and we have the pancreas. Now, the pancreas, we're told, handles sugars.

Wait a minute, if we're a tribe, if we're a creature that isn't basically fit to eat sugars, what is the pancreas doing? Well, if you study the pancreas like I have, you find that the pancreas is the architect of the body. It registers every food that goes into the body from your mouth to your stomach. It analyzes what structure they are and because even the flesh from one animal is different from another, it has to be disassembled differently and restructured differently for the best of your body. The pancreas is responsible for all of that. If you're inundated by eating lots of carbohydrates, then what happens? The pancreas spends its time dealing with toxic sugars all the time. Nothing else is happening. I found that when you eat a cooked food, the pancreatic fluids increase exponentially because now the pancreas not only has to learn what to do with those proteins restructured, it's got a lot of missing nutrients. So the body, the pancreas will send out hormones to address every cell in the body and say, like thugs going around saying, you got a mess here. I need some raw enzymes, some proteins, some fats, some other nutrients, some vitamins. You need to carry them to the intestines to be able to digest all of this toxic matter. So it's robbing from the bank of health in your body and your cells. So you get weaker and weaker. So we see this tribe, these people were as fit as fit could be. The tribes in the Andes who also live on raw meats, the 90-year-olds are doing a 100-mile run every year. They have a kickball and tribe after tribe does it. We're talking 1,100 feet above sea level. Can you imagine exercising? They have this kickball that they make and they'll have nine people in a group and they have every age up to 90 years old in that. So they go all the way from a 10-year-old or a teenager all the way up to 90-something. And they rotate in different times and different ages so they're not straddled by age, chronologically in line by age, but they'll switch it around. They get a feeling for the athletes, for the health of the individuals in their particular line. And the front one will kick the ball, get it to move in a certain direction, he'll fall to the back, and then the next one. And they'll do that for 100 miles. How many people here at 90 years old can walk a block without losing their wind at this altitude? So you have to take a look at it. These people who live on raw foods, raw meats, have incredible health and vitality at very old ages. There's no reason that we have to go around at 90 years old with only a few cells alive in the body. And you're saying, God, I wish that guy would get across the street. He's only got 22% of the cells alive in his body, moving 100% of the weight. What do you expect? It's like wanting a drunk to be sober or a mouse to be an elephant. Impossible. Can't happen.

So when you eat cooked foods and toxins like that, the body is not going to be healthy. You're going to lose cells, you're going to lose health, and you're going to age. Instead of living to be 150, you're going to drop dead from 40 to 60 to 70 years old is the average. Think about that. We have a choice. Don't have to live like that. I should be dead so many times and here I am with lots of vitality with you sharing this. Why? Because I know what to do. I know how the body works and I never panic and distrust it. Like when this happened to me and those guys injected me, I didn't go right to anger. I got to what do I do first to reverse this and get this trap under control that's in my body? What can I do first? In that newsletter, you'll see what I did because I'm not going to go through it here. The pancreas is the architect of the body. It's also the defender for toxicity and you go around and make sure there are nutrients enough to digest the foods that can't be digested from being cooked or processed. Then we have the spleen right next to the pancreas and we find that that holds red blood cells. It doesn't produce anything. It's not really a filter. It just holds red blood cells. Now why do we need red blood cells like one and a half to two pints of extra red blood cells? It's like a liter of red blood cells. Why do we need a storage of a liter of red blood cells? What happened if you fell out of a tree, cut your jugular vein, you lost a cup of blood? You'd become a tiger's dinner. You'd be dinner or lunch or breakfast, whatever it would be because you'd be anemic. As soon as the blood clots, as soon as that wound clots, the spleen will dump that cup right back into the blood. No anemia, no tiredness, no lethargy. You don't have to wait 60 days to manufacture a whole cup of red blood cells or 30-40 days to manufacture a cup of red blood cells. You have them right there in the spleen. Also, when you get cold, the spleen will dump a massive amount of red blood cells into the blood stream and the kidneys will draw the fluids out. So your blood thickens and guess what? You're warm. The body is an incredible organism working with so many other cells in the body. Do you know that those jellyfish looking things, those man of wars, whatever they call them, they are not one organism, they are a colony of different, radically different organisms, sea creatures that bring together and make a whole colony that is completely different than they have if they are on their own. It is a combination of different organisms making up that one organism that looks like an organism. If you take that into the human body, you'll see that all your glands and organs are really different creatures all together, working to produce this incredible body that we can do so much with. You've got a whole cooperation there.

So let's cooperate with that body by learning what it is that they can handle best and what makes them healthiest. Your body is till death do you part, that's the only marriage that's till death do you part. There's no divorce unless you've got a gun or a poison or you die of disease. It's some death. It's death do you part period. That's it. According to the Essay in Gospel and Peace, the Dead Sea Scrolls, that's what Jesus taught. Jesus taught raw foods and he taught that your body was the only marriage that's till death do you part. That's in the Dead Sea Scrolls, if you have any interest in that. The fact that he taught vegetarianism at that one particular event, that was because he was dealing with lepers in the desert and he had to tell them what foods they could get out there. So it was dairy, it was goat's milk, it was mainly nuts and things that they could get. He wasn't teaching vegetarianism. A lot of people who are vegetarians point to that and say Jesus taught that, but Jesus also taught eating fish and stuff like that. He fed raw fish at the Mass Sermon on the Mount. That's how he got it to go so far. He said, no, we're going to serve this to you raw. You will be more nourished. So he was able to feed a lot more people with very little fish because their bodies were satisfied and more happy with the raw fish. So they were able to go throughout the day in a desert environment where it's difficult with eating raw fish. It helps retain the fluids better. You don't get as dehydrated. So there's a science behind all of it. Religions like to take it off in a whole different Lala land avenue when it is very, very specific and very, very down to earth. So that spleen is there to help us stay warm and to replace cells in case you bleed. What happens if a woman has a baby? How much blood does she lose at a time? Two, three cups of blood. Do they get transfusions? Not necessary. The spleen provides, has four cups, provides the three cups, the two and three cups in childbirth loss. Pretty great, isn't it? The body is a phenomenal organism. Okay, so let's go down to the other areas of the body and we talked about the other glands in that area and the kidneys. Now, what do the kidneys do? The kidneys allow the body to cool itself or to warm itself by removing fluid, H2O, but the kidneys would be an organism that is the entire size of your body if it had to filter out all nutrients so you didn't lose nutrients out of your urine. It does two things. It filters out the red and white blood cells only from your bloodstream. So, all of those nutrients in your bloodstream are lost in your urine, except the red. There are still traces amounts of red and white blood cells. The kidneys let some red and white blood cells go that may not be as healthy or just can't handle it all because of our toxic conditions. Now, if that's the case, let's get smart here. Is it good to urinate frequently? Is it good to drink water? What happens if we drink water? We dilute the acids and destroy the bacteria in our bodies, in our intestines and our stomach.

It gets absorbed into and goes to the kidneys. Of course, it goes a lot into the bloodstream. It goes everywhere into the body, into the neurological fluid and lymphatic fluid. It goes everywhere. And the kidneys are really fighting hard to dump all of this excess fluid. So the urine gets lighter and lighter and lighter, trying not to dump the blood, trying to get it out of different areas of the body. But what is that water doing as it washes through every part of your body? It's drying it out. H2O cannot be absorbed into the cells unless it's ionically bond with other nutrients. If H2O gets absorbed into a cell without nutrients, guess what? It dehydrates it. It dries it out. You keep putting water on your arm and what happens? It dries it out. It doesn't lubricate it. You put good butter on it and guess what happens? You're lubricated for days. Water just keeps getting drier and drier and drier until your skin starts peeling away. Think, when did water become an issue? 1961 and 62. The trust fund of the people who own Coca-Cola decided they want to get into the water bottling business. So they hired a bunch of doctors to say that we need to drink eight glasses of water a day. Before that, you went to school, people who weren't athletes took a sip or two a day. We're talking two ounces of water maximum that was ever consumed in a day. Unless you were an athlete, you may consider a couple of glasses or a glass, glass and a half. Not eight glasses, two glasses maximum. But mainly you went after milk and orange juice. Those were our main fluids in the 40s and 50s. Then all of a sudden water comes in because they paid these doctors to tell that. It is still alive today. Water is one of the worst things you can drink to dilute and cause problems in the body. Your urine should be thick, should be at least dark yellow. Mine comes out amber. Unless I'm drinking a lot of vegetable juices and it will come out yellow, a deeper yellow. But I don't drink water. I haven't had water in two weeks. But once in a while I'll take a sip. During the fall and winter I'll take a couple of sips. In the winter, I mean in the summer and spring, I might have a cup a week, half a cup a week because we need some solvent. That's what water is. Water is a solvent. If you look in an archeological book, the first thing that they have under solvent is water. What happens? It rains, dissolves rock, plants eat. Water is a solvent, the universal solvent. Why would you want to drink water? Except to have some toxins broke down in your body because you're a cooked food eater. These tribes, none of them drink water. Even your cooked tribes in the deserts of Australia, they don't drink water because they know they will die in that desert if they drink water. So, they'll take roots and they'll grate them and wring the vegetable juice out of it. Half a cup of vegetable juice will take them a hundred miles in the desert, half a cup, because they've never been introduced to the type of processed foods and the 60,000 new chemicals that are put in food now in the last 60 years since processed foods became full blown after the World War II.

It's my understanding that World War II was forced to bring in these processed foods. The King and Queen of England wanted processed foods in full force in the world, make big money that way. So, they created rationing because of the war. Our farmers weren't producing any less food. Why did we need to ration? Yeah, we were putting some in cans now and sending it over to our troops. But that didn't deprive us. We didn't have less food. They wanted you to think that processing and canning food was a good thing. It helps our troops. And everybody bought it. My mother absolutely adored it. Just go to open a can. She didn't have to prepare the vegetables. She didn't have to wash them. She didn't have to peel the potatoes. She didn't have to do anything. Just open a can and there it was. But they didn't tell you that there was 60 varieties of chemicals used to make them. There was metal poisoning from the metal cans in your food. They didn't tell you all of that. They didn't tell you it was going to create tonsillitis in your children. They didn't tell you it was going to create autism and learning disorders and all kinds of psychotropic problems. Schizophrenia, all of that, from metal poisoning, from these radical minerals disrupting the processes of light and electricity throughout the brain. So the kidneys are there to remove excess fluid. You watch a dog pee does the dog sit there and pee for an hour? No, it trickles a little bit here, it trickles a little bit there. The only reason the dogs drink a lot of water is because we feed them kibble, dried food, and there's no fluid in kibble. In all food we have plenty of water, raw food. Meat's 55% water. Milk is 86% water. Fruits are 90-92% water. Jesus, that's a lot of fluid. If I drink 2 quarts of milk a day, which I do, how much water am I consuming? If I exercised I would probably pee less, but I pee 3 times a day, 4 times a day, and it's always very thick with nutrients. And the only reason I'm doing that is I'm drinking more fluids than I did since this poisoning. So I need more fluids to help break this down and get the body going a little bit better. But I stick to vegetable juices or cucumber with its 92% water and all of its collagen precursors in the pulp in it. I've changed the formula for vegetable juices from that that's in the recipe book. Now I lower the amount of celery and increase the amount of cucumber for the pulp in it, but I'll get into that later when I get into food. So then we have the bladder. Now why do we have a bladder? Because if you don't have a bladder you're going to be pissing all over yourself all day long. The fluid is just going to be running out a little at a time. You're going to be wet all the time. So you have a bladder to collect until you have to go and discharge it. Very simple. Now let's look at the three circulatory systems. We have the blood, we have the lymphatic, and we have the neurological fluid system. 

Each one of them is a complex web network throughout every microscopic particle in the body. Tiny, tiny, what they call, in the bloodstream they call them capillaries. They don't have a name for them in the neurological system unless you're very familiar with anatomy and physiology. There are names for them. And you don't know those systems because you're not educated on that level at all. They want you to know as little as possible when you go through school. So you've got these systems flowing everywhere. The only one that's unusual in those three systems is that the lymphatic system has nodes and glands. And we have most of those glands in the jaw area around the ears, all in the throat, all in the shoulder area. Then the next network, huge network, is under the arms and breasts, this whole area. The next network is right here, all the way down into the thighs, all the way up here. Now the lymph system runs all over the body, but those glands are concentrated there and the nodes are throughout the system. Now why is that? Because the lymphatic system is the system that is ultimately the most important system in the body, in our toxic society. Lymph system is connected to the lacteal system that feeds off of the intestines, where all the nutrients go. All the nutrients go to the lymphatic system first, or supposed to. So that means that the lymphatic system renders that lacteal into lymph fluid, which can do thousands and thousands of things. It can clean the body, it can nutrify it with fats to make it stronger, fats to protect the body. And that's the main nutrient in the lymphatic system is fats. But, do we ever find the lymphatic system feeding your body? The second chore of the lymphatic system is to cleanse the body. It's responsible for removing all waste products and any culpable substance in the body that could do damage. It'll contain it in the lymph nodes until it can be neutralized to an extent. If it needs to be neutralized more, it'll be transported to one of the lymph glands for further neutralization and for liquification and then to be ejected out the skin. The skin is the last organ I'm going to talk about. The skin is responsible for discharging 90% of all the wastes and toxins in the body. We want acne. If this had discharged through this stuff, had discharged through my intestines, my glands, I would be dead. When you see the pictures of how bad this was, it was oozing. There were crystals coming out of it. There were all these solutions that could only come from a chemistry laboratory put into a human body. That's why I did that and logged it. Nothing natural happens like that to a human body ever, unless it is injected into the system. So the skin is responsible. So I did everything to make sure it discharged through my skin and not out my bowels and urinary tract because they could have been eaten away. I tried to keep it from coming out my mucous membranes too, but I couldn't stop it from coming out here. So I picked one hole in my nose and I was bleeding every day crusty stuff that looked like impetigo. Impetigo is a result of vaccines also.

A lot of children get impetigo because of all the vaccines. So you got this crusty crystallized yellow to amber fluid that was dumping out of my nose. I was discharging probably about two ounces a day of stuff out of here. Probably about a cup a day out of all the other sores in the rest of my body. A cup of toxins that were formed from my body fluids every day. Two ounces alone separate from that cup out of my nose. A tumor finally grew at the end of it. And the tumor was half the size of my little finger here to this joint. So it was a major tumor to be in the nose. And of course I put some fecal matter on it. I went like this, took some fecal matter and put it on it. Two times a day for four days the tumor was gone in four days. So we will get into that when I start talking about bacteria and all that stuff. So I know how to handle it. I knew how to survive. If I didn't I would definitely be dead. And that's probably what they were expecting. Oh he's got swine flu and he said on that radio show nobody can get swine flu unless it's injected into them. And see he has swine flu and he's dead. It's probably that's the only thing I can rationalize to do what they did to me. Was to give me some disease that would kill me and point to it and say see here's what raw food did to him. Didn't work. Didn't work. Because I can outsmart them. I'm way ahead of them. Because I know as much as they know. And you can better believe the military knows everything. Every diet what works and what it doesn't. They keep tracks of everything. They've experimented with everything. Right here at GE there were lots of back room experiments going on right out of the plant over here. That had nothing to do with the jet engines that were being produced by General Electric. My father was under top security and I saw some of the drafting plans that he brought. He wasn't allowed to tell us he did anything. But because I was a wiz about mechanical stuff, I looked at his plans and I knew exactly what he was creating. They were creating concentration camp torture stuff. He was a facility engineer for making chambers for torture and for chemical release of gases into his chambers. My father was involved in some very ugly stuff. He was an ugly person emotionally and mentally. I'm sure that they put us through some of the experiments, us as kids, because we weren't a nice family. We were no Brady Bunch and we weren't Leave it to Beaver or anything like that. None of us got along. We hated each other. Everybody hated each other in the family. How can that be unless there's something in that house chemically disrupting everything? Of course, there was lots of medication and I'm sure my father brought canisters home, released them in the basement, in the vent system. There was all kinds of stuff going on. These people are not our friends and they can hurt us, but you'll know how after today to defend yourself with a little bit more research with my newsletters will really help you if you get forced with the swine flu stuff coming up. 

Now, with all that swine flu stuff coming up and it being what happened the day before Obama ruled it a national security, swine flu was a national security, with no scientific method of ever checking. Remember the CDC stopped all definite checking of swine flu in April and it was fulfilled worldwide in June. They're saying 40,000 people died, a guesstimate of swine flu already in six, seven months, nine months. So, what happened the day before Obama declared a national security? Governor of New York declared that there's nobody in my state that's going to be forced to take that vaccine. Two days, or a day before that, a court in New York, the Supreme Court of New York, said the health care workers did not have to take the swine flu vaccine. They were saying all firemen, all health care workers are going to have to take the vaccine. Obama threw it out by saying national security. You know what that means. If he claims a national security that means that the laws of the state are no longer in power. So, if they want to declare a national security and make sure everybody gets vaccinated, Obama did it by declaring it a national security. Wiped out every state and their local laws. And the only way you're going to do it is the governor of each state is going to put up his defenses and fight the military and the guards. When this is all going, what did they do? They created 9-11 to have TSA. Do you know how many employees are now TSA? They've got a whole new military. Do you know how many employees work for the TSA? Homeland Security? We've got 500,000 people working in TSA. A whole new military. There is a friend of mine that works in border patrol and got a letter two months ago that said, as of December 31st, you will no longer work on the border. Your job will be on the interior and not on the borders. They're getting ready to do some very ugly stuff here in America. I'm gone. I'm leaving next week. I'm not going to be here for three, four months. Let this die over because I'm a target. In that last newsletter, I told people how to make a two month supply of survival kit with raw foods. To ensure you stay very healthy. You stay out of the cities. That's where they're going to be after people. They're going to pick a few, according to my understanding, people that are in the military that are being trained. They're going to pick a few little country cities. Could be Hamilton, Ohio here. You know, Fairfield. They could pick this area as an example. Go and gather you out of your homes, take you in, put you into concentration camps. They have 528 concentration camps now formed in the United States under Dick Cheney's direction for the last eight years or the last nine years. And they're still being developed. So get ready. On December 15th, that's when they declared that the military and everybody is being advised that that's when they have to watch for it. So you're going to have to fend for yourselves if it happens. We stopped it in 1976. They were trying to pull off the same thing, but we had too much of the media on our side. Now they've bought up the media in the last 30 years, so we don't have that to battle it anymore. We don't have the forces behind us.

Most everybody is going to be ignorant and think that we're really under an epidemic when it's going to be the vaccines that are causing the disease that they're saying is killing people, that they're going to blame on swine flu, just like they blamed all the deaths from that typhoid, or was it something other than typhoid, back in 1916-18 when they gave that first worldwide vaccine, and they call it the Spanish flu. They're going to blame it on that. Now all the people who lived in the country and didn't get vaccines, they didn't have any deaths. There were no deaths in the country. None. Only in the city and people who got injections in 1918. So think about that. You need to protect yourself. So the blood, so the lymphatic system is responsible for feeding every cell in the body and removing all the waste. Now the body is so congested with toxins, and I'll get into why, the lymphatic is so congested that it can no longer take on that chore, that feat that it's supposed to of feeding every cell in the body. It is strictly a detoxifier, a neutralizer now. The blood has taken on the responsibility of neutrifying most cells in the body. What has that done to the blood? The blood is no longer, its only chore was to deliver oxygen to the body so that you can have the strength of apes and monkeys. Think about that. We had the strength of monkeys and apes when we were raw fooders. We could swing from trees, we could do all kinds of things, we could lift things twice our weight, like gorillas and monkeys can. We can't do that anymore because of the cooked foods and because the blood is having to do a job that it was not meant to do. It's only supposed to deliver oxygen. The white blood cells are supposed to get rid of the carbon dioxide, deliver to the lungs to discharge or the cells to discharge, sometimes into the intestines and kidneys, but that's not a normal process. The urine and the feces are not toxic waste products, are not supposed to be. They are supposed to feed the planet. They are nutrients for the planet. There are tribes that live on urine. In India where vegetarianism is high and they only drink milk, they drink their urine because they get to recycle their protein. They know it. In fact, next month they are coming out with a urine soda. Literally in India coming out with a urine soda. Scheduled for the first of November. Why? Because whatever is in your urine was your blood without the red and white blood cells. Full of nutrients. And it was the Sikhs way in India of combating Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola in their country. So they devised it, they bottled it, they even made it slightly fermented and effervescent and it is going to, in India, you know it is going to take over. Word gets around and what is going to happen. So Coca-Cola and Pepsi-Cola, which are two of the biggest industries in the world. They are as big as the pharmaceutical industry almost. They have put 10,000 people into India in the past year to try to stop it. Payola, Payola, Payola. Stop people from carrying the urine. Pay people off. They know that money talks everything. So they are going to try to stop it. 

So take a look at that. Your body is not supposed to be a toxic site. It is supposed to be a normal organism that functions healthfully in every other, around every other organism. And that is the way it is supposed to be. So the blood is doing what it is not supposed to be doing. So why don't you have the energy that you should? Not only because you eat cooked foods that are full of environmental poison, because the blood is detoxifying and feeding the body. It is doing three jobs when it was only meant to do one, give you energy. You wonder why you don't have any energy? You don't have to wonder why anymore, you know why. Then we take a look at the neurological fluid system. Now as I said earlier, because the body is mainly transporting light and electricity to the nervous system, it is mainly fatty fluid, rich in fatty fluids. Lots of water, but mostly fatty fluids, as the major constituent of that fatty fluid. And guess what? It's not oil, it is water-soluble fats from things like coconuts, things like carrots that have high water-soluble fats. Your oils in any plant make up no more than 2-4% of that plant. In coconuts, it makes up 7-8% of a coconut, but the rest are water-soluble fats. Have a lot more chores, a lot more purposes in the body. If you isolate just those oils, you're denutrifying your body, you're demineralizing it. Why do you think there's more osteoporosis now from 1958 till now? Because they started using margarine, vegetable oils. They took the pig fat out, the lard. They removed all the vegetable and all the animal fats and told you they created hardening of the arteries and heart disease. They were causing all of those ill problems. Yet, you go look in Borneo and New Guinea and you see those tribes that only live on the cooked meats, they have no arteriosclerosis, they have no heart disease. Nothing to do with animal fats. Nothing. Even if they're cooked. Again, we've been lied to. Vegetable oils do not stay fluid in the human body over time. They harden and crystallize and cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease. So the very thing that they told us would cure us, which is margarine, all the vegetable oils, safflower oil, all those kinds of oils, especially hydrogenated, which made them into plastic, harden in the human body. Now an herbivore, an animal that eats vegetation, that kind of vegetable oil has a body temperature of 101 to 105 degrees. Ours is 98.6 and lower. So vegetable oils in our body harden, thicken, crystallize. So that's why heart disease has grown exponentially. Heart disease was a rare thing 100 years ago. Rare. Hardening of the heart, hardening of the arteries. Now it's predominant everywhere. So the neurological system is heavy with water soluble fats and some oils. And it uses metallic minerals, and of course if you're cooking your foods, most of those metallic minerals are going to be free radical, because they don't have their ionic bonds. The pancreas does everything it can to realign and make those fats that are going to be utilized in the neurological system the best it can.

But for some people it causes senility, thoughts lost, all kinds of problems, psychological and mental problems. So coconut cream is a very good thing to help your brain. Eggs are the best thing for the brain. You have the water soluble fats and the oils in the yolk. You have the protein in the egg white. But I'll get more into that when I get into foods. So the neurological system uses glycogen to utilize fat as an expression of mobility of firing the synapse. And if that fluid is heavy in gunky stuff from carbohydrates, yes, it doesn't fire very well. It doesn't move very well. So the brain doesn't work as well. And I'm going to get into that later. So we pretty much cover the body. You know what the skeletal system is so that you can be upright. You can lift something. Can you imagine if you had no bones and you were a worm? You could just lift something with your head, with your muscles, but it wouldn't be very high. But you couldn't jump up and down like this and do acrobatics and cartwheels and do all the things that we can because of our bone structure. And then we have muscles on that to be able to manipulate and utilize the body. And of course all the other systems that I've talked about. The muscles connected with the tendons that are connected with the bones and those can be weak. Any part of the body can have problems if you're not eating properly and you're eating poorly. And even badly. So I think we're going to take a break now. We're going to take a ten minute break. Everybody can discharge for themselves, secrete everything they need to do and eat and then we'll go for another couple of hours before the next break.

[break]

A: Ok, we're going to get started. Ok, now we're going to talk about foods. Now, we have basically three nutrients that we need to discuss. They're fats, proteins, and carbohydrates. Everything breaks down into those three basic categories. Now, the fats, we can't talk enough about those. Those are the most important nutrient in a toxic society. Why? Because as I said before, you will find the greatest concentrations of toxins in the fats. People who have lots of problems, more problems with people who are thin. You've heard the term fat and happy? Very, very real. I'll give you an example. About five years ago, a man came to me with terrible skin. He looked like he had done alcohol and drugs for at least 25 years. Thick, pockmarked rolls as the results of drug abuse and alcohol. And I did his eyes. I photographed his eyes. And I read his eyes and analyzed them and said, are you from this planet? You know, he seemed like he was mid-fifties. And his body, the insides, his intestines and organs were all that of somebody in their early thirties. And I said, it doesn't make sense. You're only like 15 pounds overweight. And you didn't have all the, you know, I can see that you've used drugs and alcohol for about 25 years. He said 30. And I was like, okay. So, and you have very little damage. He said, before I went on your diet three months ago, I was 300 pounds. Even bad fats will protect you. The people who don't have fats, those poisons get into the cells and do damage. If you have fats, it protects them. So, when I see people fat, I say, thank God you're fat. I know you've hated yourself for all these years because of fashion and all that. Forget it. Be happy you are fat. Be happy. If you're thin, not all thin people, but most thin people, they've got a fuse this short. Why? Because poisons are constantly irritating their system, so they're temperamental. Does anybody know Twiggy? Anybody go back that far? Okay, I took her on one date and I would never date her again. I never called her again. She was hysterical. And that's what I learned. I stay away from skinny women. Most everybody does. In Hollywood, I get that all the time. All these skinny women and women say, but I'll be fat. And I said, yes, but I won't get anybody. I won't have any relationships. I said, how many relationships do you have now? They don't have the temperament. I remember I had one producer, director, head of one of the vice presidents of ABC Films. And she was a writer and producer, pretty famous, did a lot of Nickelodeon stuff. And she was fatphobic. And she had a baby at 46 years old. And within a year after she had the baby, she was in chronic fatigue. She couldn't do anything. She couldn't even get out of bed to take care of her own baby.

Thank God she was rich and had money to take care of it. But in that next year, she went through all of her savings just to survive. And then she was sent to me. And then, you know, within a year, she was functional again on this diet. But she wanted to stay skinny. And I said, okay, you stay skinny, you have less energy, you can't do all the things you want to do, and you're not going to be as successful. And you'll think you're going to have a relationship. But how many of you had? She says, I had maybe 18. I said, okay, you're 48, 49 years old. I guess she was 49 when she had the baby. She was 50 when she came to me. I said, okay, you're 50 years old. And you've had 18 relationships in that time. What was the longest lasting one? Three months, and that's how she had her son with her. And I said, with that kind of track record, don't you think you should try something else? Maybe if you got fat, you might be a different person that attracts some other type of person that wants to be with you. Maybe you're not such a nice person, maybe so it is. Very aggressive. That's the way those producers, they like the producers, aggressive and nasty because they save the most money. So, sure enough, about four years, four and a half years into the diet, she got fat. Finally, she was depressed. So she allowed herself to get fat. Then she got happy and she was so funny. And guess what? She got a boyfriend of 15 years younger than her and was an ex-Chippendale model. He was doing her two times a day. And then a year later, a year and a half later, when she got skinny, he was gone. Because her behavior went back to what it was when she was skinny. So think about that. Everybody who thinks that they're going to not get a mate because they're fat are looking at the wrong person, themselves. You know, you'll be a much different person if you have weight. I know you're looking at me and saying, Aajonus, you're pretty skinny. I'm 18% body fat. I don't look it because I've been eating only raw fat since 1972. Strictly I mean without any since 1974. And it takes 40 years to clean out all the old fats in the body and everything to be completely rid of all of that. I've still got some time to go because I don't consider myself on the best diet until I start eating meat on a daily basis and that was December of 82. So I've gotten rid of all that old fat and when you cook a fat it swells up 2 to 50 times its normal size. So you can have all these huge fat molecules that are 50 times their normal size, have very little fat in your body but they're all swollen. Take for example pork rind. Very thin little strip and after you fry it what happens? That pork rind is this big. That's what happens in the human body. They swell up. They swell in the body. So I have a lot of fat on me but it's very reduced in size. People who look like I do, have muscles cut like I do. I mean most people like that have maybe 7% body fat. I have 18. When I was very ill and trying to get well like after the poison mushroom that I ate, I was 30% fat. I let myself get puffy and big and I felt better that way. I stayed that way as long as I had to. 

If I had had that kind of weight when this injection came on I wouldn't have had this much skin damage. But at that time I had been in Asia for about a month already and when I'm in Asia I can't get dairy easily. So I start losing weight even though I eat coconut cream and all the other stuff. I get very trim and fit. I start exercising which I never do. This is my exercise on a daily basis. But when I go to the Orient I want to climb mountains and do all kinds of things. So when I get there I start doing things and then losing weight. So when this happened I had lost a lot of weight so I had more damage from it. So fats are ultra, ultra important. Remember I mentioned the pancreas? The pancreas has a lot to do but it takes very little of the pancreas. Does everybody know Lucy? The remains of Lucy, the 3.4, 3.4 million 6, 3.4 to 3.6 million year old fossil of a woman that was found, a homosapien. You know how big her pancreas was? Two and a half times smaller than ours. Since we started becoming grain eaters, our pancreas has swelled two and a half times size as normal. What else changed? Her brain is a fraction of our size. Why? Our brain swells with toxins. The brain is 60 to 80 percent fat. So the brain keeps getting larger to be a dump site. Not smarter. Not anywhere smarter than any other creature. In fact, we're not so smart because we'll pollute our whole environment and get each other sick. No other animal does that in the world. No other animal kills for oil. None of that stuff. All animals take care. Even the coyotes that I feed in my backyard. I'll throw meat out there for them and the weakest or the hungriest always eats first. They're always very considerate. Unless I throw high meat out. If I throw high meat out, they'll fight over it. There's no camaraderie when it comes to high meat. Everybody wants the high meat. Usually the big ones get it. So I have to throw it out in different spots so everybody gets some. But if I just throw out a chunk of meat, the weakest and the hungriest will have it first and then the others will eat whatever's left. So, there's a lot of camaraderie. The brain is so much fat and keeps getting larger the more industrialized we became. The brain kept growing to handle the toxicity, the mining, the molten metals. A lot of people, I'm going to start talking about bacteria here in a few minutes too. I should have done that first before I went into foods. But the black plague, the bubonic plague, that was created by the king and queen of England. They started using coal. They got everybody to make coal, to use coal in their fireplaces in 1312, 1311. So, they got all of London, all of Paris, all of the major cities, burning coal. Smaller, dirty as hell, a lot dirtier than wood. So, specialized people utilized it and handled it and almost every person who was either a chimney sweep or a deliverer of coal got emphysema and died at a very young age, usually in their late twenties to early thirties.

Coal is full of mercury and thallium poisons. They vaporize into the air. So, you had a whole generation, I mean four or five generations of toxically damaging their lungs one after another before this big plague happens and then they blamed it on rats. Think about it. All of the people, all of the people who lived in the country that used their wood because they weren't going to buy expensive coal. Of course, by the time you got into town, wood was expensive too. But the king and queen of England were charging a lot amount of money. At first they charged less than wood cost and then when they found it burned quicker, hotter, the coal, then people started using coal over wood. They had the people in their lap and then they raised the prices just like everything else. And of course, the rest is history. People continue to use coal, continue to use coal. The Amish don't have a clue. I'm just now educating them about the toxicity of burning coal in their homes. Even burning coal at all. Go back to burning wood. Yeah, you have it, but it won't be toxic for you. So, coal was a very, very bad thing in relation. So, before I go into foods and heavily and the brain got bigger and bigger, the more industrialized we got, I want to go into bacteria, parasites, fungus, and virus. All of those are good guys. Bacteria mainly will always eat your food to help you digest. If you've got any decay in the system, you've got a cell that died, what is going to break that cell down? Is that cell just going to disappear? No, it's a whole organism. It needs to be digested and removed from the body. What's going to digest it? Bacteria. Common. But the medical profession will point at those bacteria and say, see, they're destroying a cell. What kind of a cell? Not a healthy cell. A dead cell or a cell that is dying and it needs to get rid of. You have to watch the medical profession. So, bacteria is always good that's inside your body. The only bad bacteria is man-made bacteria like the 0157H7 that you'll never find anywhere but a laboratory, never in nature, unless it's planted. And then it will never be alive. Bacteria can eat 50 times their weight in 24 hours. Both intestinally as a digestive aid or to get rid of dead cells in your body or any kind of organic waste product. Bacteria eats. Bacteria eats fecal matter, waste products, whatever it is, other bacteria, compounds, networks, microcosms and macrocosms of bacteria keep everything moving. On this whole planet it is bacterial. And if you really look into the microbiologist, there is one, I forgot her name, who even went into TED a few years ago, which is that organization of rich intellectuals that pat themselves on the back because of all these great things they are doing. They don't have a freaking clue either. They are closer, but they really don't have a clue because they are rich people. They like their toys and everything, so they can't get [unintelligible]. But anyway, there is a microbiologist and a bacteriologist who said 99% of the body is bacteria, you are 1% human. And that is so true.

So we should be, and she believes in bad bacteria, and she hasn't studied it thoroughly. She is so young yet, she is like 40 years old, and she just hasn't had the experience, the independent experience. She knows that bacteria is good, but there are still bad bacteria out there, and they are whatever the pharmaceutical industry says they are. She hasn't discovered it, but they are not bad. So, I would like a janitor in my body that eats 50 times its weight in 24 hours, and reduces the waste to 1-5%. Hey, give me a janitor like that any day. I'll take it. Parasites are even better. If your body collects too much waste at a time, let's say you had an injury, fell out of a tree, you were climbing up to get a coconut out of a palm, and you fell down and bruised your whole body. You are going to have a lot of dead cells from that. If you fell on something sharp or a stone or something, you are going to have some damage in the body. Now, removing that much waste quickly, bacteria can't always do it. So your body will incubate parasites from your own tissue. Parasites are a natural part of every animal cell. And to prove that, I spent $60,000 on this experiment, took a laboratory room, completely isolated. We built it, everything natural, no asbestos or anything. Built the room, had it divided with glass, and then I had a funnel going up from this, in this chamber, I was putting some lamb or sheep, it was a little older, sheep freshly butchered in a sterile environment right outside this room, nothing ever touched it and contaminated it, put it in that, closed the chamber over it, a chamber within a chamber, and this was all blown with glass, it went up, and then to the other side where I did the butchering, and then that went over and it was funneled over a corn dracaena, which produces a lot of oxygen, three HEPA filters to blow the oxygen through the three HEPA filters, so no parasites, nothing could get through it, so it was getting a natural oxygen. So everything would be as it is in nature. Now I had no parasites, it was a completely healthy animal until I butchered it. And then I ate the rest of it, made use of it. So in three days, we kept the room at body temperature, the natural body temperature of the sheep, which was about 102.2 degrees. So it kept it right at that temperature. In four days, it was full of parasites, various kinds of parasites, and loaded with bacteria. This was nature. Just remember, every animal cell you have, and you're full of animal cells, that's all you have is animal cells, has seeds for parasites. Something that comes out of hibernation only when you need them. So if you have parasites, you're supposed to have them. You are supposed to have them. So we talked about digestive bacteria and detoxifying bacteria. We had the same thing with parasites. Joel Weinstock, a gastroenterologist, full professor at the University of Iowa, 20 years ago, took a look at the pigs on the farm, very healthy pigs, in the slough, in the dirt, in the fecal matter, urine, lived it and breathed it every day. The animals that were in the university were kept in very clean stalls, concrete, and they were cleaned several times a day.

They were given sterile food. Everything was perfect and these animals were sick, sickly. So he said, well, you know, I'm a gastroenterologist and I'm going to take a look at the digestive tract. So he looked at the digestive tract. The animals, the pigs that were in the university had no trichinosis, they had no whipworm in their intestines. Yet the ones on the farm were full of these parasites and were thrivingly healthy and robust, [unintelligible] and everything. And these, those that were in the university were just dry slugs, literally slugs. So he said, I'm going to do an experiment here. He took the whipworm, the trichworm from the pigs on the farm and infused them into the intestines of the, the small intestines of the pigs at the university. In five days they were well and energetic. Guess what digestive tract we have most like, we are most like. All animals in the world. Even more so than primates, the pig. We have a digestive tract more like the pig than we do the apes and monkeys, other primates. Every tribe that I know on the planet has trichinosis in its intestines. In Thailand they tell them it's bad, they give them antibiotics, they tell them to sterilize the food and stop eating raw fish and raw meats and they get sick and they get old and their teeth rot early and they go on this 80% rice diet and they age and deteriorate and yet the older ones that eat the old way, lots of raw meats and very little if anything else thrive and are very healthy and are old. We are supposed to have trichinosis and I have somebody who has a history, an unruly history of constipation. I say go to my Amish farmers, get some pig's intestines, small intestines, eat it. Eat a half cup, a whole cup, just once. Your entire digestion will change, the constipation goes away, everything is because you are now digesting something properly. So nine out of ten cases were completely well after eating that and it lasted for five to six months. Now Joel Weinstock saw that and he said, I wonder if this will happen with humans because they are supposed to have trichinosis too. And yet we are told trichinosis is one of the worst diseases you can get. Cook your pig until you can't tell it was ever an animal before. It's charcoal. So he went to the FDA and the FDA told him, you can do the experiment on let's say, how many do you want, six to ten people? But they all have to have suffered for more than ten years and had no relief from medical therapy. And that's when I first learned, you mean it's the law that a licensed doctor cannot recommend any alternative to the pharmaceutical approach unless a person has suffered for ten years and failed? That's the law. That is the law. So no, I don't care how good intentioned your doctor is. If he is a licensed doctor, he will be under charges if he tells you anything alternative. And they will come after him. I know lots of doctors they went after for that. And I only know the one that won, Dr. Privatero, a good friend of mine. So parasites are a good thing.

So he said okay, he got six people who had suffered ten to thirty-two years with inflammatory bowel syndrome. They suffered from drinking water. They suffered from taking any kind of food into their body. So he put the, he filtered the whipped worms eggs in a certain way and then put them in Gatorade. Now Gatorade is highly alkalinizing. So he figured that will neutralize the hydrochloric acid and destroy the eggs and they would pass into the intestines and incubate. And he was right. I tried to do that many times but I never thought of putting it in Gatorade and I would never put it in Gatorade. Now I would put it in vegetable juice and do it that way. But now I just tell them to eat the whole intestine and don't worry about it. The eggs are already there, you don't have to worry about separating the eggs. So he gave the six people the whip worm and it all incubated and within five days, five of the six were asymptomatic, able to eat absolutely anything. Can you imagine the one who had suffered for 32 years, all of a sudden in five days able to eat anything without gas, any distress, no vomit, no diarrhea, no nausea, anything. Because the parasites were in there, they can eat 100 times their weight in 24 hours. So you know how they can digest that food for you, so all their waste product neutrifies the system incredibly. So you have detoxifying parasites and you have digestion parasites. In most tribes when they eat meat, they don't chew it, they don't grind it or chop it, they're eating big gobs of it. So of course the hydrochloric acid can never be enough to break it down so these larger parasites to break it down. Very simple, the body and nature works wonderfully with the human being, the human condition, the human needs. And if you don't trust it, if you think there's some attack, you're going to be attacking it, your very nature. Now, fungus is a little different. Fungus do the same things, they can be digestive aids and they can be detoxifiers. Gangrene is a way of breaking down dead cells, rotting cells, damaged cells, but it only usually works in a heavily, let's say, you fell off of a cliff and you kept landing on a particular leg and the leg had so much damage on it and it was bleeding all the time and the body really could not repair it and you don't know how to doctor it, to dress it. The body is not going to be able to keep up with that kind of injury. So, the fungus will come in and start helping the process of breaking the tissue down faster. Most people think that they're going to lose their leg. It stinks, it's rotten, you know, nobody wants to be around that and then everybody panics and instead of let's see what the gangrene does, let's watch its process. But nobody has that kind of patience, so they'll amputate them, something like that. There was a Dr. Walker that introduced me into the urine therapy type of arrangement. He showed me a horse that broke its leg and damaged it pretty badly on rocks and its leg was damaged severely and it turned gangrene and the owner was going to kill it. And he said, if I heal that animal, can I have it?

So, he said, yeah. So, he took the horse's urine in rags, wrapped it around the leg, every day he would refill them and re-wrap them, wring them out and put the new urine and wrap it. In ten days, the leg was completely healed. Completely healed. Your body is not supposed to be throwing off waste products, it's good nutrients. When I was giving a workshop in 1982 on Jekyll Island, Georgia, I was giving the same kind of seminar and I was talking about urine as a benefit and that the Hindus drink urine to supplement their protein loss because they don't eat meat. This man raised his hand and he said, I don't want to ask you a question, I just want to reinforce, because you just opened my eyes to something that we did. He said he was a retired Miami policeman and he started working way back in 1890 something as a policeman. He was like 89 years old at this time in the 80s. No, that was when he was born. He started working about the 1910s. He said in 1927 they outlawed us using urine as a medicine. Before that we were using urine as medicine. If anybody had a heavy bleed, you know, was in an accident bleeding to death, we'd urinate into a cup and we'd pour it on the wound and the bleeding would stop in minutes. He said when they outlawed that, we watched thousands of people bleed to death. Because you put pressure on, it doesn't really do it, they'll bleed internally. When you put the urine on it, it sealed the wound properly. Do not be afraid of anything that comes out of your body. Be afraid of what you put in it. Parasites are good. This fungus can be helpful. Fungus is how good cheeses are made. The good stinky German cheeses are full of smelly, foul, disgusting looking fungus. They put them in the caves that have particular fungus. Each cave has its particular fungus. That's why the cheeses are so different coming out of France and Germany because they grow them there. I got the farmers in Pennsylvania, the Amish farmers, to start making the cheeses that way. You'll notice if you get cheeses from any of my Amish farmers, they mold heavily in your refrigerator. It's not a bad thing. They're continuing their predigestibility so you can utilize those cheeses to build you strong. Now what was the difference between the Germans and their superior race in the 30s and 40s? They ate more steak tartare, raw meat and raw eggs, than any other nation. Something like 20 times that that they ate in Paris. Plus, they ate all of these raw, fungus cheeses, the raunchiest, stinkiest cheeses. They became an incredibly healthy race from those predigested foods and all that steak tartare. They let the tartare breathe and age a little bit, like 24 hours, so you're full of bacteria before they even mixed it with the egg. And they would down the egg white and put the yolk with the meat, to give it extra fat. So they ate the protein. Now you go into a restaurant, they just throw the egg white away and just put the yolk with your raw meat. I was in Finland two years ago, giving a workshop, almost two years ago, and I ordered at a Marriott hotel steak tartare. And I was telling the chef how I wanted it. And I said, I don't want you to separate, I want the egg white mixed in with the meat, just like the egg yolk. And he said, that's not steak tartare, that's an egg omelette. I mean, that's a meat omelette. I said, then give me a meat omelette. If that's what you want to call it.

Always eat your egg white, don't have, you know, if you go into a restaurant and they serve you steak tartare, ask for your egg white on the side in a cup, and they'll give it to you. So this fungus is very important for all kinds of things. Your athlete's foot, it is there to break down toxins. From what? From all the heavy metals, from medication that deposit in the feet, and most of them deposit in the feet. A lot of your byproducts from penicillin deposit in the feet. So this is a fungus that is helping break down the dead tissue in your feet from all the toxins from medication that's stored in the feet. No one has ever gotten an athlete's foot that didn't have medication. There's no such thing as a fungus in the Amish, Mennonite, or Quaker communities. People who take medication, who take antibiotics and penicillin get fungus of the feet that athletes have. Nobody else does. So, those are still corrective fungus. Those are still good fungus that help clean up the toxicity in your body. Fungus are good. Then what happens if you've had so much pollution, you've had so many additives, you've had so many antibiotics, that there's very little bacteria in the body, no way to get parasites out of hibernation, and the fungus won't grow either because it's too toxic of an environment for the fungus. What does your body do? It makes solvents, just like we make soaps and solvents. It makes them like enzymes, enzymes that fractionate your food, to be able to dissolve substances so that they can be eliminated from the body, or digested. So you've got this enzymatic activity, which, and the byproduct of that enzymatic activity is called virus. So anytime you look at the chemical structure that the pharmaceutical houses or anybody shows you is actually the byproduct of the body making solvents, enzymes, whatever you want to call them, digested enzymes, to break down particles of a cell or all of a cell that's completely damaged and dissolve it so that it can be eliminated. This is debris. It's not alive. Viruses are not alive. There's no nucleus. There's no respiratory digestive. There is no circulatory system. This is just protein waste with RNA and DNA structure because it dissolved animal tissue with the enzymes that were responsible for fragmenting or which they call fractionating particles. Not alive. Your body makes these to break down things that are so toxic that the bacteria, fungus and parasites cannot feed on it because it will kill them. You have to have some way to eliminate it. A hundred years ago, you rarely got a virus unless you were a blacksmith or a silversmith, something like that. If you were an average individual where you had burned coal in your house. Then you had colds. Colds were predominantly bacterial. Now everybody is getting flu because they can't have colds because the bacteria and fungus aren't working properly. They are too toxic. Now the problem with using virus, using solvents or fractionators, whatever you want to call them, to clean up waste and toxicity is that, like when you use a solvent, you will dilute it in water, then you clean up your mess and what do you have left?

You got a whole couple gallons of waste product, highly contaminated. Now when you have the fungus, the parasites and the bacteria, they take that toxic substance and reduce it from one to five percent. So you've got very little toxicity to deal with. When you're dealing with virus, it's spread out all throughout your fluids, everywhere in your body. Highly toxic. For example, take a look at the difference between meningitis. In the pharmaceutical community, in the medical community, they look at bacterial meningitis, whether it's spinal or cerebral, brain, as not so dangerous if it is bacterial. But if it's viral, very dangerous. Stroke, death, paralysis. Why? Because of all the swelling of the toxic fluid that remains. The bacteria are doing it, the product is waste, there's very little swelling. When the body's using virus to do it, the fractionators to do it, the enzymes to do it, you have all this massive waste that causes swelling in the nervous system, can cause paralysis, permanent damage in the spinal cord or the brain. So take a look at that. Virus we don't want, but they're the worst of the best there is, of cleansers. And they aren't alive, they're not contagious. If Tide soap's contagious, they're contagious, because they're found in every home. Everybody makes virus when things are too toxic, so it isn't spreading it. No more than a rooster crowing if the sunrise causes the sun to rise. Hello? Everybody, especially if you're in the same household, eats the same stuff. You're around the same toxins, everything is pretty much the same. So you're going to get the same things at the same time. You're going to have the same weaknesses genetically, and that doesn't mean you've got a genetic thing that predisposes you for this. No, you've got a breakdown in genes in your body because of your ancestral diet has been the same, and you haven't broken it, and it isn't a good one. Now, diabetes runs in my family. I've got eight cousins that were diabetic by the time they were ten. I was diabetic by the time I was fifteen and a half, but that was after the third polio vaccine that brought it on. Incurable. Diabetes is incurable, right? Juvenile diabetes. Forever. I haven't had any insulin since I was twenty-two years old. Forty-two. I had a medical workup for the first time since 1970. No, since I left the doctors in 1969 with my cancer therapies until about seven years ago. I was invited to Washington University Medical School in St. Louis because they were looking at people on raw diets. It was a cardiologist who was a, famous sport cardiologist, for famous football teams and basketball teams and all of that. It mainly was vegetarian, but when he heard that I was consuming massive amounts of butter and fat, he invited me and several of my patients who had been on the diet for at least five years. We ate massive amounts of fat. They were checking cholesterol levels and stuff like that. They did the diabetic test, the glucose tolerance test. I said, let's do it with honey.

They said, no, everything is geared toward that. The first time I had sugar was probably 1974. That was by mistake that I had it. Probably 1972 was the last intentional time that I had sugar. I took this and I was wired, just wired like I had a cup of coffee or something from the sugar. They found that my pancreas worked better than any pancreas they had ever seen. It was smaller than any pancreas they had ever seen. They had my history as a juvenile diabetic. My body took that toxic sugar and usually when it gets down to 104, it stops. My body took it down to 54, got rid of that sugar. Down to 54. They had never seen that in anybody. The lowest I think was 96. So they said they had the best working pancreas they had ever seen. Plus the massive amount of fats, they were putting the ultrasound, I wouldn't do any x-rays, and they used ultrasound to check the cholesterol buildup on the arteries. They were going all around the heart, they were spending like 20 minutes, usually it takes 10 minutes. They couldn't find any, so they were really working at finding it. So they kept me under this ultrasound for like 25, 30 minutes around the heart looking for something they weren't going to find and didn't find. They found some of my carotid artery right here, but that had been there since I was very young. It hadn't gotten worse, but it hadn't gotten better either, even though I'd been doing all this stuff. So I started taking vinegar in small amounts and I got rid of it within a year and a half. So I discover things along the way. I become more intelligent, more versed and wiser about everything every year. That's why I encourage people to come back and hear the new stuff in workshops, even though 99% of it or 96% of it is the same stuff you've heard already, but there's so much you never get it all in the workshop. I do have the DVDs now, and they have six hours of information there, so you can hear it over and over and over again. You can always catch up with the new stuff in my newsletters, and you don't have to come to the workshops and hear it every time, unless you just like my presence, which some people do, even though they have to sit for many hours and listen to it, and that flatters me. But it isn't necessary. I say if you subscribe to my newsletter for 85 bucks a year, I think it is, and buy the DVD for $260, my God, how many times can you listen to the workshop? Innumerable times. I've had students when I was teaching that came to my workshop 16 times, and they got as much out of it the last time as they did the first time, because it puts so much in there that you have to go through certain experiences to understand a lot that I'm talking about. And it will trigger realizations each time that you hear it as you live it. So, if you have the DVDs, you can live it any time you want to. I didn't say live it, I said livid. Each time that you want. So, you know, you can enjoy that information without having to wait for me to return once a year. 

Also, it saved me from having to do so many because now I'm starting to decline on doing workshops, unless there are at least 40-50 people there. So, you guys are very special here, having a small group like this. So, the parasites, the fungus, all of those are good guys. Never look at them as bad, no matter what you have. If you have fungus, you can help those fungus by using urine therapy on the area. If you have open wounds, like about two and a half years ago, I was in a motorcycle accident and I took all of the skin off. I was wearing a short-sleeved T-shirt and short pants and sandals on a big 350-370 pound Harley. And I hadn't been on a Harley probably since I was 20 years old. And I was in this little town in Thailand and these people, these foreigners looking the wrong way, you know, they drive like in Britain, you know, they are on the opposite sides. On the wrong way, they go the wrong way, they drive the wrong way. They stood right out in the street in front of me and it was either hit one and kill one or bury it on my leg. So stupidly I buried it on my leg. And it split the tibia all the way down to the ankle and the femur sits on top of the tibia joint and it broke off the top of the tibia, jammed the particles, bone splinters up in the femur joint. And the tendon, you have two tendons that go here to keep the knee in place and flexible and straight so that it doesn't move out of place easily. Ripped this one all down here so it was buckled there. This one ripped up here so it was buckled there. And the pain was excruciating. It was 40 minutes before I got off the street. And you know, I don't go to doctors. So I took a taxi and the taxi there was a pickup truck with an awning over it. So I got into the taxi, took me back to the hotel and it was like 10.30 at night by this time and I was in such excruciating pain and I looked at that leg and it was just gnarly and I thought, you know, it's out of place. Chiropractors at this hour, I'm going to have to go to the hospital and just ask them to put it back in place. So there was a woman who had been a nurse that retired and she saw the accident. She stayed with me the whole time and she spoke pretty good English and I speak just a little Thai. Now I speak a lot of Thai, but back then I didn't. And she stayed with me the whole time and stayed with me for 12 days. So I paid her to be my nurse and to help take care of me. So she called me. I said call a taxi and take me to the hospital. She called the paramedics. Paramedics came to get me. There were four paramedics and a driver. They had all this modern equipment in this little town because there are lots of foreigners who come to vacation here. So they had this great fancy wheelchair, wooden that moved down into a gurney. So when they needed a wheelchair, they could use it as a gurney or a wheelchair. 

So they put me in that and they put me into the vehicle. They put it as a gurney and I slid in. Got to the hospital and of course the interns work at hospitals at night. There is no regular seasoned doctor on. The intern went over. I mean there was skin gone everywhere. No bleeding. Relatively no bleeding at all. Because I eat cabbage juice, green cabbage juice, which has lots of vitamin K and U. It will stop clotting like that. So anyway when we got back to there, one thing that I did before, because I was there 45 minutes to an hour before I told them to call the cab to get me. I took lime juice, which is a natural antiseptic. It is such an antiseptic that will surround dirt and particles. I had asphalt all in this wound. I mean I was down to the muscle. Even some of the muscle was scraped away. I had a 350 pound bike carrying me 25 feet on the pavement. Just taking the skin off all the way down. It shaved my ankle bone flat. It shaved this bone flat. It shaved my elbow bone pretty close to flat. So that's how bad the damage was. So I put the lime juice on it first to surround those particles so I wouldn't lose all those white blood cells that would then have to come in a so-called infection. Those are the white blood cells that are coming to try to get rid of the poison so that you can get well. These are dead tissue or particles that don't belong in the human body, like the asphalt and sand that got into it. So I screamed of course, you know, a bit on towels and screamed as we put the lime juice on. I had the lime juice in the room. So I put that on. Then I put coconut cream and honey on top of that to make sure it didn't dry out. And then I took thin slivers, like 16-inch thick slivers of meat and put that on to act as skin. So when I got to the hospital, they freaked out because I had the raw meat on it and everything. And looking at this, and the intern looked, thought I was out of my fricking mind. I was going to use gangrene because I was using raw meat on my skin. I needed to be grafted from my butt and other thigh here to put the skin there. Of course, he wouldn't touch my leg. He said, that's mangled. He said, I'm not going to do a thing without an x-ray. And even then, I'm an intern. I'm not going to do something that's that badly damaged. So he called the osteosurgeon in and of course called him. I got him out of bed at 10 o'clock at night. So he came to the hospital and I said, I'm really sorry they got you out of bed. There's no way you're going to do surgery on me, but I just want you to put it back in place. It's out of its socket. I just need you to pull on it and put it back. I can't do it from my angle. I can't get enough grip on it to do it myself. And I need somebody who's experienced in putting bones and adjusting things back in place. He said, I'm not doing a thing with the looks of that leg. Who knows, you may have shattered the entire bone. I said, well feel it. This lump here is the tendon ripped here and here.

But if you feel it, it's painful to touch, but those pieces are there. It's a good solid bone. There's nothing shattered in there. And he said, I'm not touching it unless you get x-rays. I said, I don't want x-rays. You know, radiation stops healing. I said, okay. I'm in too much pain. I'm not going to argue with you. You get two shots. You got one from this angle and I want you to take from here to here and from here to here at this angle. That's all you get is two shots. So I told the radiologist the highest amount that he could turn on, the longest he could leave for exposure. I was telling him how to do his job, but it was on me. He was kind of, you know, he was amused. He thought it was a good idea to teach him some new things. So he was very nice. So I got the x-rays. Of course, it showed the bone broken right down the center. It was opened in the back a fraction and the particles jammed up in the femur joint. He said, you're never going to walk around without surgery. We need to reattach the tendons. We need to clean out the joint. Those very pointed bone fragments are going to jab the nerves in your joint. They're going to prevent you from even walking. So you may as well take the leg off. You need to be grafted. We need to go in and open this up and put pins in that tibia because it's opened in the back and it will never close up on its own. I said, well, I'm on a good diet. He almost went like that. He just tensed. My exaggeration a little bit. It's about like that. And I said, listen, if I can't walk in six weeks, I'll be back to use your services. Please give me your card. But we saw from the x-rays that my body had put the bones right back in place. Everything was in place. So I got the hell out of there. You know how much that life squad and all those people cost me? $18.50. Here it would have cost 10, 12 grand to do that. So I did not get any surgery. Five days later, I talked to the woman that I knew very well. She was from America, a Thai from America, who had built the hotel right next to her property, which is a block from the beach. Her property, her own home was on the beach. This was across the street from the beach, across the road. So I was like 300 feet away from the beach. I talked to her not to putting any chlorine into the swimming pool so I could exercise in it. So I got into that pool two times a day, and I'd leave the meat on and everything, all bandaged on there with an ace bandage. Of course, I put gauze, wet gauze, layers of wet gauze over that, and then wet hand towel over that, and then a piece of plastic over that to keep it from drying, and then an ace bandage over that. None of the plastic was touching my skin. So that kept it moist and kept it regenerating tissue underneath there. But I got into the pool, and I would walk, of course, at the deep end, so my body was pretty buoyant. So there was very little weight going on to that leg, and I was just kind of tiptoeing through the water, slowly, slow motion actually. It wasn't like that until much later, but it was just very slowly. 

And then when the algae grew five days later, she said, I've got to put chlorine in the water. I said, the algae is good. She said, it's going to destroy the sides, and then I have to have the paint ripped off, and then all this acid and stuff. And I said, okay. So then I went to the ocean, and I walked a mile morning and night, before it got too hot, in the ocean the same way. And it was a little bit more difficult because we had some wave activity, although it was in a bay, so there wasn't turbulent water, even if there were some rains and turbulence farther out. So within eight months of that happening, that was November, it was April 12th, something like that. No, it happened in March, end of March. And this was November, I did a sprint half-mile run down Antigua Bay Beach. Just that much later, never, you know, I was in a wheelchair for just a week, on crutches for six weeks, and that's it. I was running without it. And no scarring. The skin completely healed in 12 days. Barely pink. And I had two, my girlfriend was Thai, so she came to help me because she knew my food and my diet, and she did a lot of the diet. So I had two Thai women helping me 24 hours a day, because this thing was very painful, going in and out of the toilet and stuff like that, getting in and out of the tub, because I like the hot tub. Heat helps the body cleanse and heal very quickly. So I was using the hot bath. I was in it for hours a day, trying to get rid of pain, and it did. Always helped my pain within 20 minutes in a hot bath. So that was a lot to go back and forth, and they would prepare my food, feed me. I would be going in and out of that bath every four to six hours, and it took two of them to help me. And after 12 days, I think it was on the 11th day, I had to get a computer part because my computer stopped working, so they took me to a mall with an IT store, and they were stopping anybody they knew, and were saying manau, gata, gati, and what's the word for honey. They were telling them how to repair damage, because they had all been in motor, anybody who's in Asia has been in a motorcycle accident, because that's all they use, lots of motorbikes. So both of these women had big scars up here with mangle, because the doctors would put methylate or mercurochrome or iodine. Methylate and mercurochrome are liquid mercury, poisons. So they put them on so they would scar heavily. And they were telling these people, they put the lime juice on, the coconut and honey, and then the nuadip, which is raw meat over there. They were showing them, showing it was all the way down, lower than the muscle, torn off, and all the skin was healed and no scarring. This is poison that did the scarring. Poison that did the scarring. With an accident where I used those substances to heal myself, I had no scarring anywhere except for this little bit right here. It didn't heal as fast, this spot right here, because I kept using it and didn't keep it as wrapped as well.

So when I stopped using it after 12 days everywhere, I stopped using it here when I should have used it for another 5 days on my hand when I did it. So I do have a scar here. So, again, I just told you how to handle injuries. Lime, now lemon is a bacterial, it incites fermentation. So it helps bacterial growth. That's why it's good for marinating foods in. But you don't want to marinate foods with lime juice, because it destroys bacteria. It destroys good and bad bacteria. So you have to limit your use of lime juice. But it will surround particles and destroy them. I even used lime juice to handle some of the toxins that were coming out of here to limit the damage. And my skin was just dissolving, like it was melting at times. So I used lime juice on there to get in there and surround those particles so they'd stop doing it as much. And yeah, I was screaming, it's very painful, very painful. But it was a way to, you know, I could have lost my whole leg here. And I have my leg still. Still slightly painful in this big area right here. Okay, so you've had your education on bacteria. Don't be afraid of anything that goes on in your body. Get through it. There's always a detox. There's always your body getting better as long as you're feeding it properly. I'm sure if you're feeding it garbage and chemicals, you're going to have more skin acne and skin problems than you should expect skin problems. I expected something like this to happen. I didn't think it would be quite this bad, but I have to look at it. Who knows what they injected me with. Three whole four cc's of hypodermics. That's a lot of toxins they put in me at one time. Lucky I'm alive. But if you're just eating crappy processed foods, you're still going to get chemicals relieving the skin, damaging the skin internally in your organs and glands as well as your skin. So always expect rashes. Say, oh my god, just think look what they did to my skin here. Imagine what they would have done inside. So be thankful for that to happen. I'm thankful I have these here where I can see what the damage did and not on my inside. Of course it did do some heavy damage inside because I wouldn't have all these sparkles that I didn't have before if it didn't do some glandular damage to the pancreas, the gallbladder, spleen and liver. Those are the dark cells, glands and organs that push cells out that can't function anymore because they have been poisoned into the skin, an active skin. People call them liver spots. They are not only liver, they are spleen, pancreas and gallbladder cells. Sometimes warts, most of the time warts are tumors just like moles and they are from cartilage that can no longer be used properly as cartilage so bodies throw it out and make a wart out of it or a mole. Those are all toxins thrown out of the body. Happy they are on your skin no matter what you look like because then you can still live and be happy physically and emotionally and your brain will work.

Okay, we are going to get back into food. So fat, so important. 60 varieties of cholesterols. A third are to lubricate the body. A third are to cleanse the body to make those solvents I was talking about. A third of them make white blood cells. White blood cells clean the body. A third of them are for energy. Now when you eat a fat, the molecules, the calories of fat give you 2.5 times more energy than protein or carbohydrate. 2.5 times more. That's pretty phenomenal. Who the hell wants carbs and proteins anymore? You should just eat fat all day and be strong and healthy and happy, right? Oh, but you don't look good. You see what the people who run the world have done. Keep you skinny and unhealthy, not eating well and basically have you in complete control. Because you are too sick to be vitally healthy and take over the country. Take over their monopoly. And to them it's a monopoly game. You're just pieces on the board. It's just a fun thing. I've met some of them. I've been with some of them. These are not very nice people. I mean they've got great charm and all of that. They're so filthy rich to get everything they want. And they're completely happy. But when you look at their concepts about people, you know, here in your little hick town of Fairfield, you deserve to be treated like ants. So they will treat you like ants and they do. So, fat, very very important. Take for example, have you ever seen a skinny wrestler? Have you ever seen a skinny weight lifter? No, because you have to have fat, lots of fat. And take a look at those, even though all that stuff is pretty well choreographed, that wrestling business, these are acrobats that do brutal stunts. I mean they're flipping and slamming on each other. I mean that's better than an acrobat that you see at a circus. These guys were full force slamming each other. Take a look at that and they have plenty of fat as a buffer and keep them strong. They have plenty of fat in their muscles. They don't bruise like other people do. And a ton of them eat raw meat and raw eggs. Even Sylvester Stallone, I knew him back before Rocky. Tons of raw eggs, tons of raw meat and raw dairy. He stopped doing it about 15, 16 years ago when he believed the medical profession that he was going to get some disease. Arnold Schwarzenegger was the same way. He ended up having heart surgery 10 years ago. He outlawed high bacterial raw milk. We got it, I mean Sally Fallon and I and a bunch of us worked two years and I lobbied two months every day with five people to get raw milk accepted and in through the Senate and Assembly, even in Washington, D.C. We did it in California. We got the thing passed almost unanimously and in one stroke of the pen, Schwarzenegger vetoed the bill. So it destroyed our good milk. So now we have to so-so raw milk. They use all kinds of chemicals in the tanks and everything to keep them free of bacteria. That's the only way to keep it down and still sell the raw milk.

So anyway, fats for strength and vitality are your best nutrient, not carbohydrate. Absolute bull crap. What happens to all the athletes who hype up on carbohydrates? Take a look at your tennis players, McEnroe, Mary Jo King was her name, burned out in their late thirties. They were so dry. If they'd been on fats they'd still be playing today. Billy Jean King. Now Billy Jean King, if you notice now, I saw her in an interview last year. She's fat. None of that dryness that she had when she was playing because she was on a high carbohydrate diet. Bullshit. Also, if you've got a bruise in an area, if you've got a damaged joint, you don't put ice on it. What happens when you have a damaged area? The body brings more circulation into it, more lymph, more nutrients from the blood to clean and heal the area. You put ice on it and you restrict it. You actually solidify the blood in the lymph. You harden the fats. What happens when you put butter? Butter in your body stays fluid, very liquidy, very, very liquidy and lubricating. You put it in the refrigerator, it hardens. When you put an ice pack on an area, what happens? The fats in the lymphatic system hardens and freezes and stops moving. The blood slows down terribly to the area. So what happens is you cause massive scar tissue in that injured area. So what happens? Your athletes are burned out in their 30s because their joints never heal properly, full of scar tissue. They have one surgery after another, ripping out the scar tissue. But they keep making the same mistake. Ice on it, terrible. You put heat on it. They say, well wait, now it's, wait 48 hours. After 48 hours of the lymph system not flowing in that area, you've absolutely done no cleaning. You're going to scar, period. You put heat on it right away. If you're bleeding, you drink a cup of cabbage juice, green cabbage juice, not Chinese leaf cabbage, but the head cabbage, green. Some people call it white cabbage. But it's the head green cabbage. Drink a cup of that, you won't bleed. Put the heat on it right away. Okay, so I don't have to talk about fats anymore. They're pretty protective, pretty everything for the system. Now, the protein. Now, people say, oh, we can get our proteins from beans and grains and nuts. If we were herbivores, yes. Herbivore has a digestive tract two and a half times longer than ours. They have all of this enzyme in their mouth which breaks down cellulose. They swallow it, they regurgitate, they rechew, put more of that saliva in it, they swallow. They may regurgitate seven times for one mouthful or one stomachful. They'll keep regurgitating what's in the stomach and rechewing it and swallowing. It takes 48 hours for food to move through their system. All their bacteria and enzymes are oriented toward vegetation, all alkaline based. Everything in our system is acidic based. So, if we put alkalinizing vegetation into our system, it's going to neutralize our acid bacteria and our acid-acidic digestives. So, we're not going to digest as well our eggs, our milk, and our meats.

What happens when a cow has a bowel movement, any herbivore, and they've been eating dry food? About 40-45% of that fecal matter is undigested fiber. When they eat fresh grasses, 75-80% is digested, and they're only losing about 15% undigested matter. So, think about that. So, we say, oh, let's cook the vegetables so we can get the nutrients. But what happens with the vegetable oils? They'll harden in your system if you digest them and make them part of your body. So, you don't want to cook vegetables just to be able to absorb more of the nutrients, the proteins and fats in them, because they won't do good for your body. Protein from animal tissue, eggs, and milk, any form of milk are the best forms to get your protein. Now, the milk is very concentrated in protein like flesh foods are, and they won't help you grow tissue or divide cells rapidly unless it's straight from the cows. Once you've refrigerated, once the milk has dropped below 76 degrees, those hormones are no longer active. Now, Joe, when he gets my milk today, he will not refrigerate it. We'll leave it in the house because the temperature is probably not really, probably 73 degrees, so it's still too cold, but still a little bit, a little active, longer. And I won't refrigerate any of that milk the whole time that I'm here. And I'll use it for five days. Put a little bit of honey in it, in each one of the gallons that he gives me, that I buy from him, and that'll help it. And I find that it goes into a better kefir, and it's a lot richer, and it does nutrify me, protein-wise, more than milk that has been refrigerated. But the only way we humans on our, even a good primal diet, is to eat lots of flesh food. Now, it doesn't have to be red meat. It can be any kind of white meat. Now, when I talk about red and white, they are not colors, they are classes. So red are four-legged, large four-legged animals, and white are two legs, or no legs, like from the ocean. Crabs fall into the white meat, they have legs, but, you know, six legs. So it has to be four-legged, large four-legged animals, and even rabbits and gophers and all those are in the red meat category. Even the pork is, although it's very close to moving into the white side, it isn't. So, ocean wild-caught fish is the only fish I recommend, no freshwater fish, because our rivers and lakes are about 35 to 40 percent polluted. The ocean is only 4 to 8 percent polluted, depending upon where you look. The Gulf of Mexico is about 10 percent polluted. I don't eat anything from the Gulf of Mexico. So, it has to be from the East Coast or the Pacific Coast, and preferably halfway up above, let's say around the Carolinas and in California, above San Francisco. That's preferable, but I will eat any deep-sea ocean fish, even from areas all the way down to Florida, out of the Atlantic Coast of Florida. Not in the Gulf, I will never eat anything there. You've got several nuclear submarine bases, one out of Mobile, Alabama, and several in Florida that dump their nuclear waste, and the servicemen go around bragging about it all over town.

Because the military men tell them it's really non-toxic, neutral in the water, and the ocean takes care of it. And they believe it, because they have no science background. They're complete idiots when it comes to science. So they believe this pollution is fine, and that other people are screaming, the environmentalists, the green people are stupid. And that's the way the military trains them. So, don't eat anything from there. Oysters will help get rid of metals very quickly. I had a woman, they grew up, she came to me when she was about 34 years old. She grew up in London, rather wealthy family. The four airports in London, there are four airports in London if you don't know, and they fly over that same spot where her house is. All four of them have taking off and landing strips right over her home. So, she had so much metal poisoning from the jet fuel in her body, she looked like a lathe operator. So, and she was on and off the diet, a lot of emotional problems, all that metal in the brain, didn't function well. I said, listen Katrina, you need to either do the diet strictly and get through this, or let's try something unusual. Oysters, for my experimentation, my low level experimentation, get rid of heavy metals quickly. So, let's put you on a diet where you're having half to a whole cup of red meat with three oysters twice daily. So, I said, now you need to do this religiously. You're going to go through your whole life this way. And you were doing this for twelve years before you came to me, now for the year and a half, you've seen really good times and you keep going in and out of it. You get depressed, you abuse yourself. Let other people abuse you, don't abuse yourself. Treat yourself good if other people are abusing you. Doesn't that make sense? So, she got it. So, she started eating the oysters twice daily with meat, other meats. It could be with any. And the seventh day of the week, she ate whatever meat she wanted to. All raw, of course. And she did this religiously for a year. And when I photographed her eyes when she returned from London, she had removed as much metals as usually takes three to five years on this diet to remove. She removed it in one. She was a different person. Didn't have all those psychological problems. She was funny, she laughed, got a boyfriend right away. Took her off to Germany, didn't get the good food. She was back in the same situation two years later. So, she's now recovering again with the oysters. Those oysters are very special foods for helping clean metals out of the body. Toxic metallic minerals. One woman in Canada, she was so full of metals. She was a model, very skinny, six foot tall model, gorgeous. And she went on the diet because she was so sickly being a model, having to stay skinny. And she got up to 260, 270 pounds. Huge, huge woman. And I mean huge.

Fat, very fat. But man, she got happy and strong and healthy. And even at that weight, she became a tennis champion. We have never seen a fat tennis champion. Here, this Canadian tennis champion in her 30s was out there winning matches after match after match on the non-professional circuit. A fat woman. Everybody thought, oh, we're going to beat this woman easily. But she had all this good nutrients. She called me one time from a restaurant and said, my boyfriend's... And she had a wonderful boyfriend, very rich, wealthy man, kind, loving. And she said, I'm at a restaurant, what's the limit of oysters I can eat? I said, you can eat until you can't see. Fine. She had 128 oysters. 128 oysters. And they were about a dollar quarter a piece, so you knew that meal was a very expensive meal. But her boyfriend was very happy because she wanted lots of sex for a month after that. And it does increase your libido if you eat a tremendous amount like that. So, oysters can do fabulous things. Anyway, fat is so good in the body. Now, carbohydrate. We have a carbohydrate cycle which is called citric acid cycle. Where the body uses either pyruvate, a protein sugar to ignite that, or vitamin C or some other kind of sugar, carbohydrate, to do it. Could be from fruit, it could be anything. Could be from honey, although honey is very low in carbohydrates when it's completely cold packed, you know, from a hive. Let me explain that to you. When bees collect the nectar, they swallow it. They pre-digest it. They manufacture an insulin-like hormone that transforms most, 90% of the carbohydrate, into enzymes, digested enzymes, for fats and proteins. And then they get back to the hive and they vomit. There is honey. The longer nectar, that is honey. So it's bee vomit that's been pre-digested for us. Just like your kefir and yogurt is bacteria from the intestinal lining of a cow, so you're really eating regurgitated milk when you're using rennet, you know, as your starter for kefir or yogurt starter. So let's not be disgusted, you know. Bee vomit is honey. And it has an insulin-like substance in it. So it won't create a sugar high if it's never heated over 93 degrees. Once the temperature goes over 93 degrees, that insulin-like substance is neutralized. And it'll react to sugar. That's why every honey in the supermarket and most all health food stores is heated honey. You have to go to a beekeeper. I have special beekeepers to handle my patients. Really Raw Honey is one company that is true and does pack their honey cold. There are a few. I have a product list that you can go at wewant2live.com and get. Now that is not my website. Don't mistake that. I don't have time to have a website. But I made a contract with a couple that distribute or publish my information. It's not just in the books. They publish the newsletter, other things that I've written. You can buy my books there. The only place you can buy my DVD set is from them. Unless you get it from me directly.

So I made that pact with them. And it's wewant2live.com. So you get a lot more information there. That can make a lot of other things that I don't have time for. That you can have access to. And if you subscribe you get all the back issues all the way through 2006. When I first started doing the newsletter. So the carbohydrate. That was all about that product list. If you come to me for an individual consult, I give you that as a part of that, the product list. And it names the honeys which are good. And some of the apiaries where you can order honey from. And get it where it's completely cold packed. And you can use the honey as a nutrient. And not just as a sugar sweetener. That the other honeys do that are processed. So in the carbohydrate cycle we only use 5%. To utilize the fat as energy. And as nutrients to cause detoxification. Also with fat. Remember everything we utilize in the body. Is utilized predominantly with fat. Fat should be the main part of our diet. Calorically. Should be almost 60 to 80% of our diet calorically. Now in the citric acid cycle of utilizing fat as energy, the body uses 80% fat. 15% pyruvate which is protein sugar. Sugars made from proteins. And then 5% carbohydrates either as vitamin C. Or as sugar. So only 5% of our diet should be a carbohydrate. It should be fruits. And if you get the low carbohydrate fruits, you're going to be a lot better. We don't need grains. We don't need all of that garbage. That's keeping the king and queen of England fat and happy. The Windsor family owns by through their trust. General Foods, General Mills, Purina, all of the big ones. King and Queen of England. Windsor family owns all of the major food processing companies. In the world. In every country. They don't own Coca-Cola. They don't own Pepsi-Cola. Those were renegade people that started that. King and Queen of England said they would never make any money on it. Because nobody is going to be stupid enough to just drink chemicals. King and Queen of England were wrong there. People are plenty stupid. And I tell people, I said, you know there is absolutely no food value in there at all. And now that they've stopped using corn syrup, which was the nearest thing they got to anything food value in it. And it is so processed there is really no value in it. They use aspartame. Which is one of the most toxic substances on this planet. And Dick Cheney was the one to push that through the FDA. All the studies show that it caused terrible diseases. In everybody and every creature that ate it. Even insects. So anyway that is the major things. And there are eleven different names for it. So you don't know it's aspartame. And they call it friendly names. Like a sugar supplement. Or a maple syrup supplement. They don't say it's a chemical. It's strictly a chemical. It tastes sweet but it's a poison. So carbohydrates, just keep them down to a very minimal level.

Now let's talk about food as far as combining and how to eat them in a day. What gives you the best nutrients to be clear, concise and focused and energetic in every day? So I realized the only way I was going to know that is to study the body cycles, daily cycles in a lot of people. So I always found that in the morning the blood is very acidic, overly acidic. It should be about 5.5 but some people were getting down to 5.1 and 4.9. So I said how can I resolve that? Even in me it was happening back in the 80s after the poison mushroom. So I decided that okay we need the alkalinizing substance, alkalinizing minerals. And of course we don't need to use a mineral supplement because that's all rock. We don't eat rock, plants eat rock. And that would cause kidney stones, could cause stones in the body anywhere and imbalance our own mineral levels. So that wasn't the way. So I said okay, I can't abuse vegetation because we don't digest it and stop suggesting it as a good food. I said but how about if I take the juices from the vegetables, that's absorbed, doesn't get into the intestinal tract, unless you let some of the pulp get into the juice, and then it won't interfere with that, but it'll get into the blood and add the alkalinizing minerals to alkalize the blood. So that worked. So it works wonderfully. You have many poisons in your stomach lining. Almost everything that was ever injected into your body goes into the stomach lining. Because the body, the stomach makes, produces, synthesizes hydrochloric acid. Yes it will, yet it won't dissolve its own tissue. So the stomach, when you see in an autopsy, or a morgue, or even in a graveyard when they're unearthing bodies, exhuming them, either to transport them somewhere else, or just to investigate them, the stomach is the only tissue that's relatively unaffected. The stomach. So, we deliver main poisons into the stomach lining. Then the body gets rid of them by dumping a few microscopic amounts of it, trace amounts of it, into everything you eat. So you poison your food every time you eat or drink anything. So, with that in mind, I changed everything to say, eat a tablespoon of cheese when you get up in the morning to absorb all those poisons. Then, about ten minutes after that, if you have slow digestion, if you have bad digestion, if you have a chronic symptom, suck a raw egg. Ten minutes after that, you can suck another raw egg or have your vegetable juice at that time with an egg whipped in it. If you're skinny, absolutely, absolutely without equivocation, put an egg in every juice you eat, at least one egg. Now, eggs, I haven't talked about individually, but I'm going to talk about them now. They are an incredible food. They can reverse disease quicker than anything else. They won't heal you quicker than meat will, but they will certainly take you on your way there and out of the disease process quicker. The reason for that is your protein in the egg white is already liquid. Your fats and all the vitamins that are in the egg yolk are already liquid.

Requires absolutely no enzymatic activity from our intestines, only bacterial activity to get in there. They will digest in 27 minutes only using about 5 inches of your intestinal tract. That means your body doesn't have to spend its energy digesting complex food. If you only ate eggs you'd be very skinny and too much energy, way too much energy. I've eaten up to 50 eggs a day and been wired like I had dozens of coffee. And very clear of thinking though, extremely clear. I sued the city of Los Angeles and the police department in federal court and I was my own attorney. I wrote briefs this high and I was the only person that ever got a city as big as Los Angeles which has 7 million people. And this was just in 2000 to 2005, I took them to court. And I'm the only layperson who wasn't an attorney that had them shaking in their boots. I pretty much know the law, how to argue. And what I did was, and I had to prepare everything, I had 22 detectives and police officers and lieutenants and sergeants in that federal court building every day for three weeks. Cost them millions of dollars because they were hassling runaways on Venice Beach, driving them, they were out there doing hair wraps and singing and music. And they would ticket them and tell them they couldn't do it and the only thing left was prostitution and drugs. This is our police department causing this. So with the famous, a political activist Jerry Rubin and I worked on this for five years. They arrested and jingles the guitar singing chic you see on the roller skates in movies and stuff like that and go out to Venice Beach. He's still there. So we got attorneys to file suits against every officer who would ticket these people. And we'd go up and say, you know what, the tickets are being written to this teenager. We'd hand him a tape, here's a card, call this attorney, he'll file a suit against this officer. He's defying your rights and lying to you and that's assault against your rights. So he has assaulted you. So there is a crime here and it's not you. I would take time every day and go up and down the beach and spot the officers doing it. So they hated me. The other guys, Jerry Rubin and those, would just do it when they happened to see it. So I sued them. I didn't win. They changed one of the juries in deliberation, they changed one of the jurors to a 10-year police veteran. A lot of the jurors realized they had been hoodwinked right after it and came out and told me. Of course I filed suit again for that experience, but they buried it. They wanted me gone after that. But I did cost them a lot of money. It stopped them from hassling the teenagers for 10 years. Now they're back to doing it again. But I was able to be helpful for that time. But how I got through that, I was only able to sleep one and a half hours a day. So I ate either an egg every 30 to 45 minutes or about 4 tablespoons of meat or a half a cup of milk. Never enough to make me satisfied, to keep me hungry, but to keep my mind clear I ate the protein.

And if I ever start losing, you see me here, I'm going on and on, go off here, tangents there, tangents there, but I always keep it in line and back on track. If I find that going out any time, I'll go over and suck an egg and I have it right back in seconds. Most people it takes two or three minutes after sucking an egg to do that. And that's the importance of eggs. They will get to the brain very quickly and digest very easily, and your body doesn't have to labor itself in digestion. So I tell you these incidents, these stories, because they make an impression, you will remember how to use them and what they can do that way. If I just sit here and give you all the information, you're going to go away and say, okay, how does that work in real life? Well, if I give you these stories, I tell you how it works in real life, so you can utilize it for yourselves. If you've got a time where you can't sleep and you've got a lot of things you have to do, you eat small amounts at a time, no fruit, you stay away from fruit. Maybe a little bit of vegetable juice, but no more than a half a cup of vegetable juice, and no more than twice daily. I did that for 21 days, having an hour and a half sleep a day and only 10 minutes at a time. And a couple of times I fell asleep during the trial, and I'd be up there on the podium questioning the officers or the witnesses, and I'd absolutely just fall asleep there, standing up. They would be sitting there wondering if I'm thinking or what's going on. I was allowed to eat because I told them I had been diagnosed with diabetes and cancers, so of course you're never allowed to take in food, only water into the courtroom. I had my raw eggs and raw meat and my raw milk all right there on the table, all through the court. So I would fall asleep at times, 10 minutes at a time, and that's all I got to sleep was 5-10 minutes at a time, and I was able to do it. I'd be just so alert again, I could go 2-3 hours without having to nap again. And that's the way I lived for those 21 days. And when I got finished, the courts, the judge's clerk came up to me and said, I've never seen anybody, even good attorneys, handle this situation like you did, and you're not even an attorney. And he said, you know, he said, you should have won. And I said, I know, some of the jurors stopped me out there and told me that you would put somebody else in on the jury, who was a veteran who bamboozled the jury out of the guilty verdict until they realized, oh, it's wrong. So they came up to tell me and said that they would even be witnesses. You know how many of my witnesses lived over five years? Two out of eight. All of a sudden, six of them died, mysteriously died. Why didn't they just kill me? I don't know. But they surely made these other people sick, and none of them were sick. None of them were sick. Anyway, eggs are so important on the diet. So if you want to speed anything up that doesn't take a lot of digestive ability, and you need energy and pick up right away, get your digestion going, suck eggs before you get into your milk and dairy.

So you have your cheese to absorb the poisons out of the stomach. Ten minutes later, you start eating. Now the cycle is, I had a tube down several animals and people's stomachs for a day or two, and I took advantage that anybody who was in the hospital already had a tube in their stomach. I would go in and siphon out some of the fluid. And I would see that before they ate something, there would be relatively no toxins in the fluids in the stomach. As soon as they ate something, or something was put into the tube in their stomach, all these poisons were then a mix. So I realized that we needed something in there first of all to get it out. And I noticed that if they stopped eating, ten minutes later there was no more toxins dumping from the stomach lining. So I discovered that if I had people eat cheese, wait ten minutes, the body thinks, oh, I don't have any more food coming in. I'll dump it into the, you know, right now, ten minutes it stops. Then you start eating your other meal, the rest of the meal or the other food. And it won't dump for twenty-five more minutes. Now I'm thinking for the body, I'm thinking that the body is maybe not so stupid saying, I don't know, the body is probably very smart in saying, listen, he's putting cheese in there, I'm going to dump it just for the ten minutes, and then after that we're going to let the food be clean and clear. And those are the foods that will be the foods we're going to digest and not take out of the body. Now dairy is an incredible substance, because in all of its different forms it becomes a different substance. I won't call it medication, because if I call it medication, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry will turn around and say, see, milk is medicine, needs to be regulated. And then milk's gone. They've tried to do that several times. Milk is a nutrient that can do many things to help your body get well. In cheese form, as long as there's no salt in it and it's raw, I found that it passes through the body without digestion, collects the poisons, magnetizes them out of those three fluid systems, the blood, the lymphatic and the neurological fluids as they pass through the intestinal tract, even in the mouth, down the esophagus, you have all of those streams passing through, all of those tissues. The cheese magnetizes some of those toxins out of those circulatory systems, pulls on to it, and in the feces it completely comes out. Very little of the cheese is ever not, you know, the whole gram of cheese that's eaten comes out almost to the exact weight in the feces of poisons attached to it. When you eat cheese that is salted, that does not happen. You reabsorb the poisons so a lot of the cheese does not come out in the feces. If the cheese is from cooked cheese, the same thing happens. It will absorb the poisons but be reabsorbed into the body. So that's the same as everybody else is doing, just recycling their poisons that were in their stomach lining. So it has to be raw unsalted cheese to do that. But then, when you eat cheese with honey, it becomes a nutrient.

Anything that's dried and dehydrated has no active enzymes to digest it. The pancreas is responsible, just like in cooked food or any food, to get the nutrients to replace them to be able to utilize a dried food as food. I don't care if it's a fig, a raisin, or whatever. It's not going to digest it except as high sugar. And it's not going to digest well at all because it's enzyme deficient. Remember I said before, when honey, when you eat bee vomit, you have all this digestive enzyme supplementation. To give you an example, I might have to cut my examples out pretty soon and get on with it because it's getting late. But this is going to be my last example about that. I was in Thailand spearfishing in July, and my first time spearfishing in the [unintelligible] water. Let me tell you, spearfishing is not easy. So I didn't get anything because you have to know how fast your fish is going, how far ahead you have to shoot in front of them to actually hit them, and it's a science in itself. But the guy who's on my diet there that was weakling in fibromyalgia, chronically fatigued ten years ago, is here in that water six to eight hours spearfishing, many times, you know, two, three times a week. This is the kind of energy, you know, that you can get on this diet. And so he got a particular fish that had a special bone, you know, vertebrae, that were very edible. And his Thai girlfriend, she went on the diet. Now, she grew up as a raw fooder in her tribe in northern Thailand. Of course, they came in and told her that they were full of parasites and needed to cook their meats and not eat them raw, so they educated these people to be unhealthy. So she came to me when, you know, ten years ago with her boyfriend, and she was very skinny and only like, was she about 40 at the time, 42, and looked very old, wrinkled and dry and skinny. And she does the diet better than her boyfriend. She eats nothing cooked. He still eats cooked rice, and he's American. But he still eats the cooked rice because he gets too hungry. But she'll go out and she eats live beetles, Japanese beetles. That's her snack throughout the day. She'll collect them in a bottle and then pop them all day long as her food. And she's strong, like that tribe that I met in the Philippines. She looks like she's in her mid-30s now, and she's almost 50 years old. Or she is 50, 51, 52. And she's vital, she cuts all the fish, all of his catch. She'll prepare it. She makes all the food for a family that lives next to them, plus her boyfriend and her. She does all the gardening. That girl moves 18 hours a day without stop because of all this energy in her diet. And her boyfriend can't even keep up with her because he still eats the frickin' rice. But anyway, she's eating these bones, these vertebrae. God, I'd love to have teeth where I could eat bones. And she said, well, this is a special bone, so she gave me a piece. I couldn't even attempt to break it. And it was crumbling in her mouth.

And of course, she gave a little to her boyfriend, Scott, and he took an hour to eat it. I was still sucking on it two and a half hours later. And I put a teaspoon, I mean a quarter of a teaspoon of honey in my mouth because I was getting a little dry and I used it as a lip gloss. And it's a great mouth lip lubricator, honey. And as soon as I put that honey in my mouth, that bone just dissolved. Broke it down just like that. Just crumbled. Honey is an incredible nutrient, enzymatic, digestive help. Especially if you don't have hydrochloric acid like I do in my stomach because of the severing of the vagus nerve when I was 20. So, I use a lot of honey. Maybe you don't need as much, but most people do because they're so toxic. And the hydrochloric acid they produce is pretty neutralized by all the poisons that get mixed in the system. So, honey is a very good digestive aid. So, honey with a dried food can bring the enzyme activity back to it to be able to utilize it. So, when I have people eat honey and cheese together, guess what? It's a mineral supplement. All the minerals are increased. So, a lot of people will take mineral supplements, which is just rocks. You can't digest rock. Feed them to your plants, juice them, and you'll get the mineral supplement. Feed it to your animals and they make cheese and eat honey with the cheese. You'll get a mineral supplement. But you only want to do the mineral supplement a couple of times a day. And I usually say that's 30, 35 minutes after a meat meal, after you finish a meat meal. like 1 to 2 tablespoons of cheese with 1 sixth the amount of honey. So if you have 1 tablespoon of cheese you have 1 teaspoon to 1 half teaspoon of honey only. So let's say you have 2 tablespoons of cheese you could have 1 teaspoon of honey. 1 tablespoon of cheese, a half a teaspoon of honey. 6 to 1, 6 cheese to 1 honey. It's about right. Some people need a little bit more honey but not usually. Mainly use honey. I tell people to eat a little sugar cube sized amount which is a half a teaspoon of cheese every hour to absorb the poisons. You will get well faster, you'll have more energy, you'll feel better, you'll feel happier. Because those poisons aren't getting recirculating into the system. 10 minutes before you eat or drink anything you have a little cheese. Unless you're just sipping on milk in between or a sport drink that I've come up with, that I've invented. Butter digests and is utilized more in the system than any other fat. Butter is your savior. To get well, of course honey and butter is better because a lot of people don't maintain or have non-toxic bile. Because of all the toxins that get into the liver. So honey with the butter helps digest the butter a little bit better. Usually 3 to 4 butter to 1 honey is a good ratio there. Unless you're in a coma, like with my son, I fed him half and half. A lot of people say, well I'm doing half and half. I said, are you in a coma? Maybe.

So, no, if you're not in a coma, it's 3 to 4 butter to 1 honey ratio. Or unless you've had a vagotomy like I did, then of course you don't produce hydrochloric acid and the honey can be greater. The amount of honey can be greater. Now cream, raw cream is very difficult to digest. The liver works very hard to have 60 varieties of bile to make the 60 varieties of cholesterol that can be made from cream. Butter only needs about 40 varieties of cholesterol so the liver doesn't have to work hard and those are easier to make. The ones that will break down the cream for 20% or 1 third of those nutrients to help feed the brain and nervous system is a complex activity. If you eat lots of cream with your meat meal, your meat will pass without much digestion. Thorough digestion. And you're going to be eating meat for nothing. So you have small amounts of cheese unless it's sour cream. If it's sour cream, it's already pre-digested. So it's okay. It doesn't take that complex... It's about as hard to digest as butter and that's pretty easy. But the raw cream feeds the brain and nervous system. Most people only need about 2-3 tablespoons extra of cream a day that isn't in their milk. Very little. But you need lots of butter for the system. And to digest it better, lemon and honey with egg is the best way for the moisturizing lubrication formula that's in at least the recipe book. It's on page 146. And that is easily digestible and easily utilized very rapidly. Because you have both lemon and the honey helping to digest the butter and the fats. People recover faster. But like I said in the book, in the recipe book, one more story. A woman was dying of emphysema. Her MD called me from Maine. And on a Thursday night, it was about 9.30, 10 o'clock my time. So it had to be about 1 something at her time. And this is obviously a doctor who cared to some extent. And she said, I've got an emphysema patient. She was diagnosed 7 years ago. She's mainly been on machines in the bed, hospitalized for 2 years. Looks like she's going to die this weekend. What can I do? I said, well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And this is where that was reaffirmed. She cannot give any alternative except for medical therapies unless the patient has suffered for 10 years with failure from the medical therapies or until the person is on their deathbed. So then they can do it. And she said she's on her deathbed. I'm sure she's going to die this weekend if something doesn't happen. This is where you can show me that your way is better. So I said, okay, the only thing I can tell you at this point is you get 10, 15 dozen eggs, put them at her bed table and tell her to eat as many as she can and as often as she can. There's no limit. Now she's hooked up to machines to keep her breathing. And I said, don't let her lie down, sleep sitting up. So I get a call on Monday morning from this raspy voiced woman. She says, it works. I'm out of bed, I'm off the machines. What do I do? I said, well, who are you? I had forgotten about the conversation. And she said, well, my doctor called.

You told her that I should eat as many eggs as I can of raw eggs. I eat 33 on Saturday. And as soon as she got him here on Saturday morning, I had 33 on Saturday, 33 on Sunday. I'm out of bed. It's Monday morning. I'm out of bed. I'm off the machines. What else should I do? I said, just keep eating raw eggs for six months to two years. And then you can start adding some raw milk and raw meat. But stay to those eggs. They're your easiest, easily digestible nutrients. So that's what eggs can do. In a pinch, they are the quickest way out of anything. Only time that I caution you, if you have tooth pain. There, eggs can cause even more blood pressure in the mouth and cause more pain. Not all the time, but in a few cases. And then you have to have the pain formula, which is basically the best, my best pain formula is the moisturizing lubrication formula with bee pollen put in it and eat cheese while you're drinking it. Now, putting bee pollen in the moisturizing lubrication formula turns it into tasting like paint. Not delectable, not appetizing when the moisturizing lubrication formula by itself tastes like a lemon meringue drink and it's delicious to most people. But don't gulp it. You take it over time, spread it out over the day. Don't gulp anything that's high in fat like that. Take your time. So, that is the best. Your cream is very important, but your butter is ultimately important and your eggs will cause very little activity into digestion and help you quickest and best. Now, kefir and yogurt, for some people who have very poor digestion, they need to pre-digest their dairy first by having other bacteria work on it. Now, remember I told you that we have more bacteria in the mouth than dogs and cats. We have the bacteria that's very appropriate for each of us. So, spit into your milk. Just like I say in the recipe book, spit into your milk. Make your own kefir, your own yogurt with your own spit because that's the bacteria that's going to digest best. So, what I do to make an exquisite kefir is I'll put some of that honey in my mouth with a little bit of milk and I'll swish it around and get all that bacteria from my mouth into it. And when I can't hold anymore, I expectorate it into my milk and I've got kefir in 24 hours if I keep it in a fairly, you know, in a room temperature of 80 degrees or somewhere that's only 80 degrees. In 24 hours, I will have kefir. It takes much longer in other circumstances to make kefir or yogurt. And that kefir or yogurt is from a cow, it's been washed many times, it's mutated, it's not beneficial to your own intestinal environment. It will compete with your own bacteria. So that's why I say it's better to use your own spittle with your own bacteria in it. And boy, it works so much better. Never drink your milk cold.

When you do, the hydrochloric acid that normally helps dissolve some of those curds that will occur and breaks it down will not enter. Because cold fluids absorb right into the blood quickly, when you drink things cold it gets into the blood immediately. When you drink cold milk, the casein and lactate are not digested and they get into the blood and cause a little bit of irritation and problems. So always drink your milk at room temperature. Vegetable juices, that's fine. You can drink them cold, doesn't matter. Not much to digest in those. Because we're not a vegetarian animal, not an herbivore. We won't even break it down. But we still can use those minerals. Our body will still fractionate it and separate the minerals and some of the alkalinity so that we can't use it to soothe the body to an extent. And some people need a lot, some people need a little. In the recipe book I try to give people clues and in the other book in the remedy section of all the clues to how much they need. So you just need to go through both books and do that. With the information that you got today, you should be able to put it together pretty easily. So let's get back into the dietary pattern, the diet for the day. So you start with the cheese, egg or two, juice, egg in it. If you need it, if not, put the egg in the juice. And then 30 minutes. Now you sip everything. Do not ever drink any fluid gulp it. Why? Because the body will separate the H2O from the food and then you have all these nutrients that are supposed to carry the H2O to the cells to nutrify and hydrate the cells. It's not there. Like drinking water, it will just cause dehydration, rush to the kidneys. So you sip. Now I'm one of those people, I suck. I don't sip or drink anything, I suck. If you've watched me eat anything that's liquid, I literally suck. I put my tongue, roll it over my palate against my teeth. Then I suck it through my teeth, up over the tongue and up over my palate and I get all of this saliva into it when I do it, just like a baby sucking a nipple. I'd rather do it that way, but they don't have a girlfriend that's lactating. So, here's what I do. Now I only took about two tablespoons. Very satisfied already. That's all it took to satisfy me. If I had gulped, I would have been sitting there gulping and gulping, never being satisfied. Because you can't utilize it. It's going to rush to the kidneys and you're going to be urinating all day. Today, so far, I've urinated twice. Those people are urinating all day long, many times a day, because they're drinking water and eating foods with no good water in it, because when you cook foods, there's no water. They cook out of the food. And even if you're eating soups and leaving the water in it, all the ions are broken. You've fractionated them with cooking. So again, you can't absorb the H2O properly. So sip everything.

So, after about 30 minutes after you finish sipping your vegetable juice, just like coffee, sip it. Then have another tablespoon of cheese or a teaspoon of cheese, depending on what you think you might need. Egg after that if your digestion is slow again, you want to give it a kick start, you want energy before you eat, because a lot of times people will eat and they feel, oh, like just sitting down and not doing much, maybe watching TV instead of going to work. So, suck an egg. That'll make sure your brain and body get moving quickly, because there's not all that digestive process that goes on. And then after that, 10 minutes after that egg, eat a meat meal. Now, you want to eat meat in the morning rather than a high-carbohydrate food. Yes, there's high carbohydrate, you may have carrot in the juice, you get a 20% carrot, 25% carrot, 25% celery, about 10% parsley, maybe 5% cilantro, and like 30-35% cucumber puree. Now, I've changed that in the recipe book because I found better ways to do things. We are on this diet, we don't get much fruit, so we're not replacing the collagen in some people, and I found that moving toward MS or lupus after a long period of time. So, when I started adding cucumber puree instead of juicing the cucumber, you get this fiber in there, and that has changed the skin in so many people, so much better. So, now you puree, in other words, you make your juicing, everything but the cucumber, you peel the cucumber, whether it's organic or not, because you can't digest the peel, it is tough cellulose, you take a vegetarian animal to do it, and you don't want to juice it because it probably has 15% petroleum in it, in the wax that's on it, and the FDA lets them use 15% petroleum paraffin wax on an organic cucumber, and some other foods like apples. So, peel the cucumber, slice it, put it in a jar that you're going to blend this juice in, you put the juice in there, a little honey if you want, screw the little turn on top, put it on your osterizer juicer and blend it. Then you have the pulp blended in with your juice, separate it to the jars, like I explained in the recipe book, and you've got your juice made for about 3-4 days. Take one out and you sip it, if you have an egg in it, let's say you have an 8 oz or 12 oz, you pour it into the next size jar, you know, whether it's 12 or 16 oz, depending upon the jar, then you whip your egg in it. Do not blend an egg in it, you break the yolk and whip the egg in it. Don't blend the egg in it. Not enough fat from the vegetable juice to coat the egg to keep it from oxidizing. Now you can blend eggs with milk and with cream and fats, because it coats and prevents oxidization, but when you blend egg with vegetable juice, it isn't coated and will oxidize. So then it will be used mainly as fuel or a detoxifying substance. And we're already detoxifying enough, we don't need much pushing there.

So, with the meat, I always suggest that you have at least a tablespoon of butter, maybe a tablespoon and a half, two tablespoons, or you have the moisturizing lubrication formula, three, four tablespoons of that with each meat meal. If you don't, the body is going to turn most of that meat into a fat, or it's going to turn it into a pyruvate and use it as fuel. So if you eat fat with the meal, the body is going to use your meat to help regenerate cells, to help cellular division. That means you will heal faster, you'll get younger, stronger, faster. I know a lot of people who use the meat with no butter, and they'll use olive oil or they'll use coconut oil or use flax oil, those people stay thin, hyperactive and don't heal quickly. Always have butter, most of the time, have butter with every meat meal. Then 30-35 minutes after the meat meal, you have your cheese and honey that I talked about, your mineral supplement, great time to have it. Protein and the fats are digesting well, everything is good, you need some mineral supplement to handle toxicity in the body, that's where you can get and also replace bone tissue. I've had women in 32-40% osteoporosis reverse it in 2 years by eating the cheese and honey together, only twice daily, 2 tablespoons of cheese twice daily with a teaspoon of honey each time. All of those medications that are supposed to prevent osteoporosis, all of those, they don't show in the tests, they don't show any more than 1% increase. So relatively, they aren't even effective. And women are taking these things thinking they are helping their bones. Sally Fields is even doing it. Her bones aren't getting any better. There are quite a few actors on this diet. Mel Gibson, he goes off and on. Martin Sheen goes off and on. When they really get sick, they go back on to it. But you'll notice when Mel Gibson started it, after he had all that trouble on Patriot, and you saw him all bloated and puffy and pretty much an alcoholic and all crap food, so he got arrested and had to do something. So somebody recommended, I think it was Martin Sheen recommended that he go on the Primal Diet. So he got my book at the Erewhon Health Food Store. Didn't consult me personally, but he went with the book. And then started eating the raw meat. And you see the difference between him and that in What Women Want, that movie. And it's like night and day, you see all this puffy, big nose, all this thick skin. And then you see him a year and a half later in What Women Want, and he's stout, he's thin, he's radiant, his skin is plush, rich, different person entirely. People started calling him a pretty boy and they started making fun of him because he went public on the Letterman Show and said, you know, Letterman said, what the hell did you do between this film and that film? And he said, you know, I just changed my diet. And he said, what do you eat? And he said, you don't want to know. And he said, no, I want to know.

So he said, raw meat, even my kids eat it with me. Tabloids had him for a year, didn't leave him alone. So, you know, that worked on him, you know, for a while. All actors have egos, you know, so it worked on him for a while. So he goes off and on it when he needs it. My son does the same thing, goes off and on it as he needs, and a lot of people do that. And if that's how you're satisfied, that is fine. That's your life, that's your choice. I'm just here to give you the information that you can be better and better and better if you want it to be. But then better for you may be different than it is for me. You know, there's a lot of women who do the diet, but then when they cook for their husbands and family in the evening, you know, they'll have the cooked meat with the family. That's okay, that's their choice. They're not going to get well faster, it's not going to help them get better, but it's a choice and it's a way of living. And I have no judgment about it. Whatever you're satisfied with is fine. If you like disease, hey, I've heard people say, you know, I can't do this diet. I'd rather die of cancer. I said, I don't have a problem with that. It's your suffering, it's your body. I went through cancers. It sure taught me a lot. Maybe you need to go through it to teach you. What you need to learn. So I have no judgment about your being in disease and do what you want to do. Fine. I'm just here to show you there's an alternative to give you the information how to do it differently. So after your honey and cheese, you wait. Some people I say have a cheese every hour, you know, like a little sugar cube sized amount. 10 minutes after that suck an egg and then five minutes after that have a half to a level teaspoon of honey butter mixture. And you'll get well faster if you do that if you're robust and energetic already. And then two hours after your meat, after you have the honey and cheese, have a milkshake. A couple of hours after that have another vegetable juice. Egg in it if you need, but most often put an egg in is better. And then a couple of hours after that have a fruit meal. Pick fruits that are low in carbohydrate unless it's one that you need as a remedy, but then pick a green or get one green so it's not so high in carbohydrate. Always have fat with your fruit. Always. Slow it down. You'll get hypoglycemia. Also, I didn't finish telling you, the reason for no high carbohydrate before noon is because the body will make in the first six hours of the day, all of the glycogen will feed your brain and nervous system. If you make it out of high carbohydrate food, even carrot juice, the byproducts, the advanced glycation end products that are formed from it, will cause stickiness in the blood and in the neurological fluids. So the synapse won't fire completely. It's like a fizzling firecracker. The blood gets too thick and sticky. The oxygen is not transported well. 

So if you eat only dairy, mainly eggs and meat, in that first six hours, you're not getting enough carbohydrate to cause the body to make carbohydrate, the glycogen with carbohydrate. It will make it mainly with pyruvate from the eggs and the meat. And a little bit of the dairy. Now dairy can be high, so you notice we've only had a milkshake up to this point. And you sip on milk a little at a time, it doesn't have high carbohydrate in it. And usually in the milkshakes you're only having two to five ounces if you're a big person, five ounces of milk with eggs and some extra cream or butter and honey. So again, you're mitigating your ability to absorb a lot of sugars at one time to make all of the toxic sticky glycogen, the advanced glycation end products. So then in the afternoon when you're really safe, let's say eight hours after you've been up, you have your fruit meal. With fat to slow it down. Because even if you took let's say five tablespoons of sugar, guess what? Your body's going to get rid of it as glycogen. It's going to make it as a storable glycogen, a one that's going to be utilized. You're going to find yourself hyperactive. You're not going to be thinking as well. So it isn't that your body won't make glycogen at any time in the day. If you overfeed it carbohydrates, it will. But it won't with that fruit meal if you've done all of that up to that point. And then you eat fats with that fruit meal. Now the fruits that I talk about in the we want to live in the remedy section, if you have a particular ailment, and many of us have many ailments, those are your foods that you take for those ailments. And those are the fruits that you will eat for those ailments. Let's say you have three particular ailments that are annoying. So you'll take two to three of those fruits for that week. For two or three days, you'll have one of the fruits for two or three days, then the other two fruits for two days each. And have it with two to three tablespoons of coconut cream. Remember I said that's a very good water-soluble fat that'll make detoxification a lot more gentle. If you're eating pressed oils, those are very acidic and very concentrated and they'll cause very, very extreme detoxifications. So I recommend only any kind of pressed oil, like coconut oil or stone-pressed olive oil. Those are the only oils I know that you can get pure and still anymore at under 96 degrees Fahrenheit. Those will cause mass detoxification and imbalance your body, cause mineral imbalances and may cause more pain. So limit those to one tablespoon a day if you're going to utilize them. In my recipe book, some recipes for meat I say you have four tablespoons of olive oil. Well if you do that, then for the next three to four days, don't eat any olive oil or any pressed oils. You've had it for that delicious sauce that you made for that day's meat meals. Watch yourself. Watch the changes.

I know a lot of people that will suck a lot of oil and say, oh I'm detoxing heavily, and all of a sudden six, nine months later they can't move, cause they've gone overboard. Coconut cream, even though it has a lot of water and soluble fats, can do the same thing. But it takes a couple of years. Two to five to six years to come to that point. And then you can't get out of it. Your eyes are dripping out milk. It's cleaning the brain so quickly. That is an extreme. Don't do that. Two to three tablespoons of coconut cream with that fruit meal, always with a little animal fat. Either like a half to a whole tablespoon of dairy cream or like a half a teaspoon of butter mixed with it. Cause you always want to protect your cells. Remember your pressed oils that aren't animal fats do not protect the body at all if they're oils and a little bit of it's coconut cream. Coconut cream, for those of you wondering what it is, it's when you take the thick, mature coconut meat and you juice it. And I tell you I do that in both books. A lot of people, for some reason it got left out, you need the room to be 80 degrees whenever you juice coconuts. If the room is not 80 degrees, the fats will not leave the fiber, the cellulose. They're like magnetized together. Once the room gets up to 80 degrees, you can get almost a whole cup and a half of coconut cream out of one coconut. And most people who are juicing about 72 degrees in their house are getting like two to three ounces out of one whole coconut. That's a lot of work for little. So always make sure your room is, you know, the kitchen on that day, you know, once every six weeks. I used to juice every six weeks my coconuts. And it will keep if you follow the way I tell you to jar it in my recipe book and in the other book. I put it in both because it's so important. And it makes it very easy. So you don't have to do it a lot. Just take one full day and activity. I get to the point where I didn't have time. So I put up a three by five card at a high school gymnasium and said, I need somebody who likes to break things $8 an hour. I got 50 calls from athletes. I took this young thin African American boy, you know, was great as his hands and arms being an end on a football team. He was there cracking up through that stuff, plenty of energy to do it. And you know, I'd have him in every about five weeks, his average, he'd do like 10 to 15 coconuts, depending on the size of coconuts. And I would have my jars for the week. I consumed like 12 ounces in a week. So that was I was having about two tablespoons a day. I mean, four tablespoons a day. So that took me... or three tablespoons a day was 12 ounces a week, a cup and a half. So that's how I would handle it. You can do the same thing. If you get my product list, there are several... two places in the United States that I've imported the machines from Thailand, make five gallons an hour with these machines. And these people produce it, we'll sell it. It's expensive, but no more expensive than you would if you were to have to take your time and do it. So it's like $16 for two cups, a pint of it.

But you know, for all the time that it takes, and if you paid someone like I did to do it, it'd be about the same. So if your time is, you know, you have a lot of money, it's your time, it's your time. Just one day every five, six weeks and do it. It's important. Then two to three hours after that, you could have another vegetable juice or not. You could go right into another meat meal and then have the, you know, of course, have your butter with it. And then about, you know, 30 minutes after that, you have your cheese and honey again. You could keep doing the little bit of cheese, the egg, and the honey butter mixture every hour in between meals, all the way up till it's time to go to sleep. And then for most people who need to gain weight, need to gain fat, need to get stronger and healthier, I suggest making another milkshake. If you didn't have a milkshake earlier, this would definitely be a milkshake time. Have half of it before you go to sleep and then the other half during the middle of the night. What do you mean, I have to wake and eat during the middle of the night? Absolutely. Everybody's bloodstream gets deficient in proteins after five hours. What happens? The cells become cannibalistic and eat each other. What happens when you lose red blood cells? You become anemic. So people are sleeping eight to ten hours, not eating, and they're very toxic and they wake and they have no energy. You need to eat something to raise that because you have anemia when you're waking. You've lost one to four tablespoons of red blood cells. You've eaten, you've eaten yourself during the night. Have a little milkshake, have a raw egg, have a half a cup of milk, something in the night. If you're a person that's highly energetic, you wake after five hours, you eat, you're not going to go back to sleep. You're going to have too much energy and then you're going to be frustrated because you didn't sleep eight hours. Not that you need it. I get three to four hours a night and I'm fine and I go and I go and I go. It's taken me a lot of years to get here. When I was ill, I was sleeping 16, 20 hours a day and I needed it, but I woke up and ate. My body made sure that I woke up every three to four hours and I ate. That was just an instinct. That didn't have anything to do with my understanding of it at that time. Let me give you an example. I'm going to tell one more story. I had this fellow who was a vegetarian come to me and he was probably a vegetarian for 14 to 16 years. His wife had been vegetarian for almost 18 years and he was only like 47 or 48 years old and this is the way it ended up. He was an inventor and scientist, brilliant man, but not brilliant enough to take care of his health. So after two years on the diet, he's up straight, strong, vibrant, healthy. I saw him a couple of days ago and it's been about 12 years for him and he doesn't look like he's aged at all in 12 years. At all. He still looks the same and so does his wife. They haven't aged at all.

Of course they weren't injected like I am and screwed around with, but you know, they look great. The second year I went there to give a workshop and I was in their place and stayed with them and they said, John said, I have no energy until 10 o'clock or noon. I said, well, are you waking and eating during the middle of the night? No. I said, well, how many times have I said it and how many times have you done it? Well, I've never done it. I would say, okay, tonight do it. Set your alarm, awaken, maybe after five hours, eat and go back to sleep for three hours. Not a high energetic person. He's an inventor and scientist. Uses his brain and does work and make things, but he's a slower man. He's not a hyperactive individual. So he can wake after five hours, eat and go back to sleep. So he did and guess who was energetic in the morning? Guess who has never had that problem again? So it's a key for many people. Many, many, many people. So, and it is important for everybody because everybody eats their own blood cells after five hours just for the protein. You could be 700 pounds, it wouldn't make any difference. You'd have all the girth in the world. It's the bloodstream needs its proteins from the rest of the body. And if it has to start digesting itself, it will start in the bloodstream. When you're fasting, it will do in the bloodstream and the rest of your body. That's why you lose so much weight and you also deteriorate your health rapidly, as well as put yourself into heavy anemia, into a vegetarian type anemia that you may not recover from easily unless you suck a lot of eggs. So there's your diet, there's the whole system. Now I'm going to teach you how to suck an egg. So got some eggs here, everybody take an egg. Take one and pass it around that way. 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12. So one dozen should do it, except for mine I'll take more than those. One should I brought. Now you're going to learn how to suck an egg. Now you can do it Rocky style, break it into a glass and just gulp it down, that's fine. I'm a person because of all the treatments that I had as a child, my throat is very narrow. I will upchuck an egg if I try to drink it down. I will gag on it. So I have used to break an egg into a glass and sip it a little at a time until I got it down. But then I had to clean the glass and I'm lazy. So here's a hermetically sealed organically disposable case that I can get rid of and I have to dispose of it no matter what. Now you've got a fat end and you've got a narrower end. You girls want an egg to do it too? No? Mother do you want to do it?

Q: Are we supposed to get an egg?

A: Yeah. I have some over here. You have some? Okay. Janet, do you want to do it or do you already do it?

Q: I already got mine to do.

A: Have you done it like this out of a shell? I'm going to teach you how to do it out of a shell. Do you have an egg? I just want a little thing to have another one. Yes you do. Yeah. Okay now what I do is the fat end you want to break. You don't want to put a hole in it. You just want to fracture it because there are some membranes that's attached here and here. And if it doesn't collapse all the egg is not going to come out of it. So you take the you hit it on the flat end of the tooth.

Q: Do you want to make a hole in it?

A: No, no hole you just fracture it. If you hit it on your teeth a sharp tooth you're going to put a hole in it. You just need to fracture it. Fracture it like that. That's a fracture. Yeah you're trying to make it a little bit bigger because still it can be a too attached. A little bit larger would be better. A little larger. You see how large mine is fractured. Yeah and if yours isn't right on the center either.

Q: Oh you got to be up here?

A: Yeah on the center. Everybody see?

Q: No. No.

A: Did you see? That's perfect. Yours is excellent. Excellent. Yours is excellent. There you go Shirley. Now on the more pointed end you hit it on the sharp to make the hole. It's very easy now I have a little bitty hole.

Q: You must have a sharp tooth.

A: You've got a smiley face too. Mine's a tiny smile. Perfect. It's good. I mean you might want a little bit larger but that's good. Sometimes that'll happen and you can break it with your nail but you finally brush it through. Now we suck it out. Now if you don't... you'll jam it up if you try to suck it out of this little bitty hole all at once if you turn it upside down. Too small of a hole. If you hold it down like this and suck gently only the egg white will come out. Suck a little bit. It just tastes like salty slimy water. That's all it tastes like. Salty slime, it is pretty easy once you've tasted it for once. It's just like salty water. And you do that, until all the egg white's gone. She broke hers. Sucked too hard, I told you to suck gently. You broke the bottom too much. That'll happen. Make sure you don't break a hole in the bottom. Then after all that you'll hear you know when you start sucking the egg yolk will bob up and down. You say okay it's time to eat the egg yolk. You see nothing left. The membrane collapsed down to the hole.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You'll get used to it, let me tell you, after the 10th time it'll be easy, very easy. Isn't that great? Now you don't have to clean your glass. You can eat these all day long. Now you don't have to worry about cleaning your glass. You have just a little bag that we can, oh we don't need those. Rub it into your hands. Rub it into your face. You've heard of the egg masks? Rub it into your skin. I never waste anything. I eat with my fingers and I rub the butter into whatever food it is.

Q: Do you ever eat the shell?

A: No because they're pretty indigestible. Dogs can. If I feed a dog I give him the whole egg. Okay, Q&A. Anybody have any questions?

Q: I have a question. You just talked about the dog eating the whole egg. Will cats eat the inside of the egg?

A: No [unintelligible]. Cats are very finicky.

Q: Yeah.

Q: What do you think about sauerkraut?

A: Okay, fermented vegetables are fine if you're eating cooked food. They help rebalance, they help provide enzymes and lactate acids to help you digest the foods that are cooked. So if you're on a diet where you want to have a lot of cooked foods and a lot of raw cooked vegetable, I mean fermented vegetables are okay. They will help you digest better. But ultimately they will not give you good health. If you want an example it's Sally Fallon. She and I started on the health circuit at the same time and you see the look of her right now. I like fat, I don't have a problem with that, but she's very sallow looking. She has no vitamin D in her system and yet she takes cod liver oil. She is not a well person. 

Q: What kind of diet does she eat?

A: She eats a lot of cooked foods, you know, along with the raw raw milk. She eats cod liver oil supplements, stuff like that. But she's not a well person and she's not really somebody who was ever sick to be telling people, you know, to know anything. And she stands by it. She said the raw, the meats should be frozen to get rid of the parasites. No freaking parasites in the first place. She's talking out of information that's put into her head. No experience. She says freezing your butter doesn't harm it. I proved the experiments. I've shown her the experiment.

Q: That's what I wanted to ask.

A: Complete denial.

Q: Just about the parasites. I think, of course, my family's afraid I'm gonna, you know, the old parasites in my brain. Because you read that the parasites are on the outside of the meat. See, when I buy the meat, I just cut it up and I eat it.

A: Yeah.

Q: But I was thinking, I was second guessing the other day, thinking, oh, maybe I should take a knife and trim off the outside of whatever piece.

A: What I do is I always scrape anything I get out of the store. Because they put plastic, they put bleaches on the equipment. You go into one of these butcher markets now, all you can smell is ammonia or bleach. And that gets onto your food. And then the packaging, it's on the food. So I will scrape, no matter what it is, I will scrape the outer part of any meat that I get, fish, chicken, ground meat, doesn't matter what it is. I will always take a flat edge blade and scrape off the top, no matter what. But that's for the chemicals, not the bacteria. When I go to a foreign country, I refuse to buy in a regular supermarket for the westerners, because they use just as many chemicals. When I buy my food, I go out to the public markets where the flies and all the insects and the rats are running around. And you see the rats running around all those places. They're just running around, they don't do anything about it. That's where I buy my meat and I don't scrape. I want all that bacteria, I want all that everything. You have to realize that you have been completely brainwashed by Procter and Gamble here, who want you to buy soaps and antibacterial stuff. Again, that's all part of the thing to get you to buy products. To destroy yourself. Bacteria is your friend. Nature is your friend. Look how many animals eat their bugs, eat parasites, eat dirt with everything they eat. They slaughter an animal right off the dirt, eating all the dirt with it. Think about that. How many animals go around licking each other's butt? Do they get E.coli poisoning and die? You have been hoodwinked and completely bamboozled about that. It is not true. If you get a detoxification infection, it's because your own bacteria is working to clean your body, not because you got it from some other being. I have people who eat fecal matter to get rid of their cancer. There are tribes that eat fecal matter because they can't afford any animals. And if they eat the fecal matter from a buffalo or another animal that's a vegetarian, realize this, the vegetarian animal has digested predominantly everything that they're discarding. So, it will only take 24 hours through our system, so this is all matter that's pre-digested. Now there's beetles, there's flies, there's all kinds of creatures, worms, everything that will make food out of fecal matter. But if it rains, it washes it out, and of course it becomes fertilizer. But as long as it's fresh fecal matter, there are myriads of organisms that will feed off of it. Why? Because it's just food with bacteria that made it to digest. So, people who don't get rid of their cancers easily because they don't have the proper bacteria functioning in the body, so they eat fecal matter to help get rid of their cancer. Put it in the recipe book. All about that. The recipe for eating shit.

Q: You don't worry about the scary parasites like the brain things? And what about the candida? You hear about the candida and the yeast and everything, so you just don't...

A: Those are all beneficial. You've got to stop eating the things that cause your tissue damage to need the candida. That's the point.

Q: That's the whole point.

A: That's the whole point.

Q: You don't have to be worried about these brain flukes and all these other scary things.

A: Those are your friends. They're going to help you get well. You have to stop doing the stuff that damages the body that requires all of those to be active. And the only tribes that don't have any of them are the tribes that eat completely raw meat and dairy. Yes.

Q: If you're not eating a high-carb diet, your body's not going to overgrow candida. It's when you're eating too many sugars and too many carbohydrates, then it's going to go nuts.

A: Especially grain-based foods.

Q: If you're eating a low-carb diet, you're going to have the proper amount that you're supposed to have in your body.

A: And if you're eating grain-based foods, you're asking for fungus. Period. If you've ever had penicillin or any antibiotic, every time you eat a grain food, you're going to be feeding it. Feeding them. And those bacteria that they give you, I mean those fungus that they give you as an antibiotic, live in your body. Eat at your body. Those have been sterilized. So the RNA, like I said earlier about the penicillin, it does not turn off. It doesn't do its normal cycle. On for three to five months, off for three to five months. It works on you all the time. All the funguses, the black things that come out your nails, and the cracking all around it, it's all antibiotic funguses that cause that. Yes?

Q: I've got two questions. What do you think about kombucha?

A: Kombucha is made with cooked substances. Kombucha is, kombucha is supposed to be the mushroom from the mycelium. Mycelium is a fungus. It is a milky substance which eats away roots, dead roots in the ground. So it could be grass roots, it could be tree roots, it could be bush roots. That's something that is dead. Mycelium feeds on dead substances that are root based. Sometimes you'll see, if you see a tree fell, and you go by after the years and years, you'll see this milky substance eating under the bark. That's the mycelium eating on the tree under the bark. And then if you see a mushroom blossom, that's the reproductive cycle of the mycelium. In kombucha, sure, that mycelium is a good thing to have. It can help you, it can help eat the dry, dead nerve endings, capillary endings, any kind of those veins that distribute throughout the body, and have dried and died. Especially somebody like with MS. But you'd better be eating a diet that allows you to regenerate and to handle fungus, or else kombucha is going to knock you out, you're going to lose hair. The people that I studied from 1989 all the way from, no, 1988 all the way from 1993, most of the men lost their hair. They had so much bad digestion, they had gas with everything. So, you know, these people were drinking like a quart of it a day, and it was very bad for them. They were mainly vegetarians, so they ate very little meat. And boy, when they ate something like Brussels sprouts, all the gas would be hanging out in the drapes, and it'd be all over the houses and everything. I had to wear a mask when I'd go into those houses and see how they were doing. You know, they lived in it, you know. There are people who claim that you can make a raw kombucha. Kombucha lives on dead things. So you mainly cook the substance, but if you want to make a good raw kombucha, you have to say some kind of food that is dry. You could take honey that is crystallized and dried and make it with that. Yes, it will work. You can take a fruit that has been completely dry, put it in there, and yes, it will feed on it. Those would be a better kombucha for you. You could take dry meat, beef jerky, put it in there, and that would make a good kombucha for you. But again, kombucha can act as a mineral supplement for people who eat cooked food. So, it can help them to digest as we have funguses that help us digest cheese and dairy products. We do have fungus that are in our intestines that help us with dairy, and kombucha can act that way. But you better let your milk go dry if you are going to grow it dry and die, basically, if you want to have real kombucha activity in yourself. So, there's kombucha. Yes.

Q: My second question is, you just mentioned constipation, the cause, and what to do about it. What about loose stools?

A: Loose stools, it means that you're throwing off toxins very rapidly. Toxins that would like do this to your intestines, so they have to get out quickly, or else they'll make mincemeat of your intestines, so it flushes it out. I had one guy that had, when he went on the diet, had diarrhea. He had constipation for his whole life, and then when he went on the diet, he had diarrhea every day for two and a half years before it stopped. But he wouldn't eat all the freaking cheese I wanted to eat to absorb the poison, so he wouldn't have to have diarrhea. You know, he wanted to be skinny and thinner, you know, because he was the ladies man. So, he'd rather have diarrhea, and he accepted it for two and a half years, rather than having cheese, and having extra weight. Yes?

Q: In your DVD, you talk about the cats and dogs that you gave frozen meat to that developed scabies?

A: Well, all of them developed a skin disorder. One just developed scabies.

Q: So, did that come from within the dog?

A: No.

Q: Scabies?

A: Well, you have toxins in the body, but when you cook, I mean, when you freeze the meat, you are cooking it, basically. You're destroying the nutrients in it as cooking would, but not as bad. But every one of these animals got a skin disorder. They didn't eat the frozen meat. The group that had the same meat unfrozen had no skin disorders. They didn't eat anything else either. They only ate water and the meat. Very little water, too. Same meat, frozen and unfrozen. No skin disorders. All these were happy. They didn't scratch. They didn't have a problem. They slept. They played. They were happy. This group over here, after six weeks, they were ripping their skin out. They were biting their skin. Bleeding. One of them was even bleeding. And then when I put them on, as I said this earlier, I took that group, split them in two, and gave them frozen butter and non-frozen butter raw, whether it was frozen or non-frozen. That's how Sally Fallon thinks. There's no difference. And I said, there is a difference. I've got two groups of animals here, and I fed one raw butter and the other frozen raw butter, that's not raw anymore really, and it took five times longer for that group that had frozen to heal their skin disorders than the other group.

Q: So the butter healed them?

A: Pardon?

Q: The butter healed them, even though they had...

A: Even though the butter was frozen, that group healed, but it took five times longer than the group that had the non-frozen butter.

Q: At one point you talk about freezing butter, and you said for a short period of time. What's a short period of time?

A: No, I don't talk about butter, I talk about ice cream. Never butter. Never butter. Never ever said that. Only ice cream. And that's to get people to eat more and get more fat on them. Still not the best thing to do.

Q: Is there ever an amount of time, if you have to, I mean like if I can't get my butter unfrozen?

A: You can get it unfrozen, you just have to go to the right people. The people who don't follow Sally Fallons advice. So there's no amount of days, even if it's like frozen for three days, that's still not good? I only froze that butter for those animals when I first started feeding them that butter, and I got other supplies that I would freeze. So most, some of them were only frozen for three days. Most of them were frozen for six days. Yes?

Q: Along with Marcia's question about the frozen beef, okay, so we know grass-fed beef and grass-fed animals have a better composition, fatty acid composition and nutrients. So versus, you know, we have a quarter of a cow in our freezer right now from here, and it's frozen. But I would, I feel better eating that than eating, I mean, consciously, than going to Kroger. I don't want to eat their pesticide-laden, grain-fed beef.

A: I go to Kroger or Meyers and I get the Laura's beef, or I go to, you know, Jungle Gems.

Q: Okay.

A: And I can get, you know, organic meats there.

Q: But even organic isn't guaranteed to be healthier.

A: No, it isn't. It doesn't make any difference. I'd rather eat a little bit more butter with that than a little bit more butter with my frozen meats, even if it's a better quality.

Q: So it's better to eat...

A: Well, after I saw with the frozen good meats, I mean, this was good organic stuff. All, you know, grazed, no pesticides, no nothing in it. And that's what these animals were fed, and they all got skin diseases from the frozen. No, I'll take the less better with more butter.

Q: If you vacuum pack, your shelf life will increase dramatically in the refrigerator.

A: Absolutely.

Q: If you vacuum pack, like one of those food savers, your shelf life will increase dramatically in the refrigerator.

A: I can last six months to a year.

Q: Oh really?

A: Yeah, just the air, you know, of course, as soon as I cut it out of one of those, I scrape the outside, because your plastic will get into it.

Q: When we get it, it's already frozen from the butcher.

A: Well, you just say, when are you butchering? When are you going to make it? Don't freeze it. I'll come pick it up. I'm picking it up, yeah.

Q: Okay, and then can I ask one more question? Is this question time, by the way? I don't want to mess you up.

A: It's what?

Q: Is it question time now?

A: Yes, it is.

Q: How do you get out of a hormone imbalance? For example, I have to take progesterone cream to have a regular cycle. How do I, I don't want to be on that anymore. I want to be normal and just not take anything.

A: Suck a lot of eggs.

Q: That'll help my hormonal?

A: Yeah. And if you want to, you can eat some glandular tissue, you know, some buffalo testes. You know, it's estrogen-based. I mean, it's testosterone-based. There's still a lot of estrogen in testes. Mindome just produced estrogen. Testosterone. You produce testosterone.

Q: Right, right. Yeah, that's true.

A: You can get from North Star Bison. Check your farmers around here. When they butcher, get the bulls balls.

Q: A glandular product is not good because that's extracted.

A: Pardon?

Q: A glandular product, like a capsule. I've worked for Jim Levallot, you know him, for a long time.

A: It's a dessicated, it'll teach your body how to make it, but it won't help you supplement. I say in my book, one of my books, that yes, I've seen that raw, dessicated glands help the body make their own glands, but it doesn't really nutrify that particular substance in the body. So if you want to supplement, you have to have the fresh gland. Well, it can be old gland, but it has to be the gland. It can be a stinky, rotten gland. Work even faster.

Q: I have a question.

A: Yes.

Q: I don't know if you say it in your book or if you can say something briefly. Is your protocol the same for children and pregnant and lactating women? To just go by a hunger level, for example, for pregnant or lactating women?

A: Pregnant women need to eat cheese every half hour. Absorb the poisons so they don't go into the baby. You don't know how good the placenta is. The placenta is the baby's liver until it's born. And I had one girl who came to me, she was born with black eyes. Mother had blue, father had green. Two sisters, one had blue, one had green. She had black eyes when she was born. Now, her mother was in college at the time, 1969, doing drugs, smoking, alcohol. Norwegians drink worse than the Irish. And having a good time, she didn't know she was pregnant, kept having a period for the first five months of her pregnancy. So, she wouldn't have done that if she knew she was pregnant, of course, but she didn't. So, it completely destroyed the placenta. So, all those toxins went into the baby and the baby was born with black eyes. Eight years on the diet, her eyes were blue-orange. I've got the photographs to prove it.

Q: So, it's basically the same protocol for children as it would be for adults, maybe just reduced...

A: No, usually children are very easy. They like empty meat. That's what a lot of the children say. You just sit them down with a piece of meat. I had one baby, he wasn't even a year old. He would not eat the raw meat unless it was on the grass. You can get it anywhere, but if you put it on the grass, he would eat it. I've got pictures of it. He will only eat the meat that's on the grass. But children are very easy. Very easy to get to eat. They drink the milk and have milkshakes and eat the raw meat. No trouble. Younger, the better.

Q: What is your opinion of...

A: Teenagers are hard.

Q: ... cod liver oil. Friends have shared with me a brain, I believe, that's unpasteurized. I believe the brand is green pastures.

A: The green pastures, I worked for two years for them to make one that I would accept. That's the only one. But it's so nasty. It's nasty smelling. It's nasty tasting. It will burn your throat. It is a horrible substance. And that's the good stuff. That is the only good one. They didn't sell it very well because of the nasty taste and the odor. Everybody wants it pretty. You know, the whole concept of what is healthy is not pretty. So, they put this oil, this food oil in it, rosemary, thyme, different oils, licorice, different flavors in it. But the one you just want pure, no additives to it, it's okay. Now, in my experiments with it, I didn't find that it increased the health in anybody who ate it, who was on the diet, 95 to 100%.

Q: Because it's pricey, that's why I asked.

A: Yeah. So, I don't think, if you're on a good diet, it's something that's unnecessary. If you're eating cooked foods, it probably will be very helpful.

Q: The North Star brand that you mentioned, isn't that meat frozen or not?

A: No, all you have to do is tell them not to freeze it, yup.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: There's a lot of meat packers out there, if you say, do not freeze it, they'll send it to you unfrozen.

Q: Oh, they will?

A: Yeah.

Q: At any place, okay.

A: Yeah. Wellness meats. It took me three years to get them to not freeze it and to send it to you, and they're great, they're right in Kansas, so they're mid, you know, the country, and they'll sell it to anybody. And John, who's the owner and heads it, you know, he came to me for consult, he eats his meat raw now, he does the diet, he can't believe that I'm as healthy as I am, he's two years younger than I am, and he says, I don't have nearly the energy you do. So, he's doing very well with it, and he's, since he got on the diet, within three, four months of getting on the diet, he made the raw meats unfrozen available. All you have to tell him was, I'm one of Aajonus' people, followers, I'm on the primal diet, or do some of the primal diet, and I want unfrozen meats. You'll get them. And you'll vacuum pack them if you want, so you can refrigerate them for six months, a year. I've had meat last, even pork, and I love pork. But I don't eat it often, but I'll eat it maybe two, three times a week, that's not a lot compared to whatever other meats I eat, when I can get them, when I can get it healthy, like from the Amish. But I've had it keep six months, easily. Vacuum pack, you know. Of course, like I say, when I cut it out of the package, I take a straight edge knife and I just scrape everything off the top. So I lose probably about an ounce by weight or less of the meat. Throw it away. Or put it in my compost pile.

Q: What about washing? I mean, like when you talk about scraping fish. I mean, I wash all my meats and chickens and fish, but what about washing?

A: What is in your tap water?

Q: Well, I use filter. I use RO water to wash it.

A: Doesn't mean it's clean. I've seen all kinds of filter systems, and in, like in L.A., we have 197 chemicals in our water. It would take 12 filters to remove everything. How much would it cost for 12 filters in your house? We're talking about big house filters. Canisters are this big. And it has to be a succession of five different kinds. You have your paper filter, you have your charcoal filter from coconut, you have a sand filter. And a few others that take you through all those steps three times. All those steps three times to get your water. So, I have well water, so I don't have a problem with that. But I don't want water on my food, I'll just take the scrape off the outside. From packaging, not from bacteria.

Q: Yeah, well, what about fish?

A: I'm not sure sometimes, even though it's wild, I'm not sure that they don't put it in some sort of solution. Well, they usually spray something on it. So, I just scrape it off.

Q: What about your silver fillings, the dental fillings, should they be removed? 

A: Yeah, if you've been on the diet for two and a half years, absolutely. They don't cause all the mercury poisoning that, you know, injections do. When you have it in the filling, it will vaporize with certain acids from the food, and then it crystallizes into microscopic, ultra-microscopic grains, like sand. It's not like liquid, like that in an injection. That is ultra dangerous. When it's crystallized into a rock, a stone, it isn't as dangerous. Still dangerous, but not as dangerous as liquid mercury. And that's what they inject in you. Then you put methylate or mercurochrome, liquid mercury. Or if you use the eye drops, liquid mercury.

Q: Have you had any patients with Crohn's? Have you helped anybody with Crohn's disease?

A: Every case of Crohn's. Crohn's is pretty easy. You have eggs for a while. You just don't eat much meat. One meat meal a day, and you have cheese, eggs.

Q: What is Crohn's disease?

A: Crohn's disease is the inability of the body to manufacture mucus properly in your intestines. And that can come from a vaccine, antibiotics, or anything like that. And most people get Crohn's disease following a long period of antibiotics or injections of penicillin. So the body stops making mucus, or thick mucus. Thank you. And my lungs are exercising. I've been talking a lot. Not much fresh air. The mucus doesn't coat the intestinal lining well enough, and some of your own digestive acid will start eating away at your intestinal lining in spots where there's not enough mucus, or it's too thin. So then the intestines over the years get thinner and thinner, or right away, very quickly. You've got a lot of good digestive acids like hydrochloric acid, very thin mucus, you're going to eat your intestinal wall pretty thin, pretty quickly. So then when you eat too much, the gut will rip. Undigested food gets into the body. 80-85% of arthritis and rheumatism is caused by Crohn's disease. Leaky gut. The undigested food particles go to the knees first for digestion, and then other joints. So your knees start digesting food, it starts digesting its own cartilage. Then you have inflammation in the... because you've got bacteria working on the whole area. And not necessarily working on your own joints, it's working on the food in the joints, but it causes the swelling of the joints, it causes the pain, and the redness all around that area. It's all, like I said, 87% is caused by that, not because it's in your actual joints that are a problem. Let's say if you were a runner, and on a bad carb diet, and you kept bruising your cartilage, you could end up with Arthritis and Rheumatism, true Arthritis and Rheumatism, where your body has gotten bacteria into that, generate bacteria to dissolve the damaged cartilage. That's true in Arthritis and Rheumatism. But Arthritis and Rheumatism, most Arthritis and Rheumatism, are the symptoms of digesting leaky gut food rather than bruised or damaged cartilage.

Q: What would you say for somebody that's trying to, it's like working with some people that are struggling with addiction sort of things, sugar addiction or alcoholism, and then when the cravings come up, it's hard to switch over to maintain the flow of the healthier diet. And I don't know if you have, with people that have had addictions, what to do in those moments or to help with the craving part of it.

A: Each one's different. Kiwis, we have somebody, an alcoholic eating kiwis every day, will poison them to alcohol and they'll automatically stop. You don't have to tell them that's what it's going to do to them, because they'll literally stop eating the kiwi. If you do that, they will, you know, keep with the alcohol. So I found it's better, you know, kiwis are healthy for your system. Don't tell them it's going to turn them off to alcohol. It'll make the alcohol actually poison to the system. So, kiwis are great for that. They're great for any kind of addiction. But alcohol, it works with a little bit better. Most people go on the diet, once they get the honey and butter, no more. Carbohydrate, no more. Candy cravings, there it goes.

Q: That's what happened to me [unintelligible].

A: Once your body is satisfied and happy, 99% of the people who go on this diet for once say, Oh my God, I'm not thinking of food all day long. I'm calm. I can think of other things. I can be happy. It's the first time I've been satisfied in my life. You know, I mean, e-mails a day, I get like that. But I don't know. 

Q: Can you do like 70%?

A: You can do anything. You can do 1%. I like to say this to everybody. If you ate only one raw food in your entire life, you're adding enzymes and vitamins and good nutrients. The more the better. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It depends on how sick you are. People who are real sick will go in hard and heavy. People who aren't so sick will weigh into it. My athletes, you know, they'll go into it hard and heavy. I have one marathon runner that took 3 hours and 40 minutes off of his time in 3 months on the diet. They dream of taking off 3 to 5 minutes a year. This guy took 3 hours and 40 minutes in several months, 2 and a half months on the diet. Others that took off 20 and 40 minutes within a couple of months on the diet. He went from coming in 100th to 135th place down to 20th place, 15th place. 

Q: I'm just thinking for the kids, if they're kind of hard core, like if I [unintelligible] they wanted that cooked or something, but gave them raw butter mixed with honey on the side, would that help mitigate somehow?

A: Absolutely, absolutely.

Q: Because if I couldn't get them to eat...

A: Milkshakes are wonderful, smoothies are wonderful.

Q: Okay, as much as I can?

A: Yeah.

Q: Does the raw honey have a shelf life?

A: No. No, they found some in the Pyramid of Giza that was 10,000 years old, and it still had activity. ¨

Q: Little bee vomit.

A: Yep. Yes.

Q: I love the lubrication formula the first time I had it, I thought it was so delicious.

A: I know, people gulp it, don't gulp it.

Q: That's it, I think maybe I gulped, so I need like, I'm a detailed person, so I need like, how much time should it take?

A: Well, I suggest you break it up into fourths. You have a fourth of it with each meat meal, a fourth before you go to sleep, and a fourth in the middle of the night. So you have it with half of a milkshake, or half a cup of milk, drink that, or you can even mix them together and drink it. That way you've got the lubrication formula. Moisturize, for women it's moisturizing because they like moisturization, men like lubrication. It's the same thing. It's a lemon meringue tasting drink.

Q: And it's not just at one time?

A: No.

Q: Okay.

A: If you're a bodybuilder and you want to put on a massive amount of muscle tissue fast, yes, I tell those people to eat a whole pound of meat at a time, with one entire lubrication formula. And it works. You know, I've had bodybuilders put on four inches on their arms in about three months. Put six inches on their chest in four months, with that. And people are accusing them of taking steroids. No, I'm just eating raw eggs and raw butter and raw meat and honey. And they don't believe it. Yes.

Q: So, the lymphatic bath. You can almost not get out of the bathtub after that?

A: Some people.

Q: Is that typical?

A: Yeah, yeah. And if that's the case, you don't have to do the walk. Just get to bed. Make it to the bed and go to sleep. Usually, people who are over the age of 40 have that problem.

Q: Well, I found that if I do it in the afternoon, I'm done for the day. It's like you can't get your energy back. Is that typical?

A: Well, if you take a nap, you can.

Q: Okay.

A: And also, oh, I didn't give you the sport formula. Let me give you the sport formula. Anywhere from a half to a whole cup of tomato puree. Anywhere from one to two cups of cucumber puree. Now, if you can get whey, which is the liquid runoff from making cheese. From the milk, it looks like yellow urine. You can use that for anywhere from a half a cup to a whole cup. So that's your variance between the tomato, the cucumber, and the whey. If you don't have whey, then you use like two cups of cucumber and one cup of tomato puree. Two purees. Then you add a tablespoon of vinegar, a tablespoon of lemon juice, one teaspoon of lime juice, two to four tablespoons of coconut cream. If you're an athlete, use the high amount. If you're not an athlete, don't put four, only put two. And then two to four tablespoons of dairy cream. Again, the lower amount if you're not an athlete or exercise a lot. And about two to four tablespoons of honey. Again, the high amount if you're an athlete or a heavy exerciser. And about two to four ounces of sparkling mineral water. And you blend all of that together. It'll be a little thick. And you sip it all throughout the day. When you take a hot lymphatic bath, then you sip that through the whole time. Maybe drink a half a cup over a twenty minute period before you get into the hot bath, and drink a whole cup while you're in it. You'll have more energy.

Q: It makes your mouth very dry. Very dry. I mean, nothing you've ever experienced in your life. And it's not thirst. It's dry.

A: Yeah, it's fat gone. Melting those fats and moving them. They're going to be dumped because they're no good. Put the honey on your lips. When you're discarding that much acidity from a lymphatic bath, butter could cause your lip to become too acidic. And then blister. Not blister, but just get a little rash. So the honey prevents that. Yes?

Q: I have a question about mixing the acidic things like lemon juice and lime with the cream. Because I made a cleansing juice, got the celery and the cilantro and the parsley.

A: Did you hear when I talked about how I changed that?

Q: Oh no, I didn't hear that.

A: Catch it from somebody else. I don't want to repeat it.

Q: Okay, that's fine. Well, I was going to say, will this happen with the sports formula?

A: No.

Q: Because it's got lemon and lime and cream.

A: You see, there's so much in it. You've got such a volume of stuff.

Q: Not enough. Okay.

A: Yes?

Q: Do you have an opinion on [unintelligible]?

A: Yes, they're not good. When you have that lymphatic congestion in the body, you have to melt that lymphatic. Now, the body, remember, an herbivore has a body temperature of 102 to 105. Average is about 102.3 to 102.6. They have a much higher body temperature. So, when we have all those vegetable oils, especially if they're hydrogenated and they're plasticized in our body, they are hardened. You need to raise the body up to 102 degrees to get those to melt and flowing to get your lymph system working again. Most people won't get well unless that lymphatic system is moving. So, I tell everybody to have the lymphatic baths for an hour to an hour and a half, 102 to 105 degrees. Now, the lymphatic system will dump its toxins into the connective tissue. And the body perspires it out. If you're keeping up with the proper discard, you should see veins and very little meat underneath, I mean very little fat underneath the skin if you're a man. If you're a woman, you're going to have a little. You should have a little, you know, you should be able to get a quarter of an inch thickness under there. If it's more, you're storing a lot. And it can be different parts of the body. Here it can be very thin and good, and up here all of a sudden it's very thick. So these lymph glands, this skin is not working to discharge out the body. So it's a good idea to have what I call lymphatic waste baths. This is new, this is not in the books. It's something that's come up in the last few years. Lymphatic waste baths to perspire it out of the skin are 35 to 40 minute baths daily, 105 to 108 degrees, hotter. But that usually gets it perspiring out of the skin, so the lymphatic system, when they're moving, it will dump it into there and perspire it out again. So you do two hot lymphatic baths a week, and then you do the lymphatic waste baths 30, 40 minutes, 35, 40 minutes every day. And you have to put ingredients in the water if you don't want to have a well water to make sure you neutralize the poisons so they don't get absorbed into your skin. And that's stuff in the book. In we Want To Live under baths, under baths. I'll tell you what to put in the water. Milk, vinegar, clay. And I've come up with two, three tablespoons of coconut cream. And the top of the water, when you get out, coats the body with that liquid. I mean, that coconut cream. It's just so happy and moist, you know, with the fat. Because usually, you get out of the bath, you're going to be pretty dry, dry skin. 

Q: My son has eczema. I just took him to do kinesiology and stuff for food stuff. And she said magnesium, or epsom salts in the bath?

A: Epsom salts are fine, instead of sea salt, yeah.

Q: Okay.

A: Epsom salt is a mine salt. It's not a toxic salt.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Either sea salt, sundried sea salt, or epsom salt.

Q: Okay, that'll get rid of the chlorine. We do have chlorinated water in our town.

A: You still need vinegar and some milk in it.

Q: Okay.

A: Or coconut cream.

Q: Okay.

A: Either one.

Q: Okay.

A: To answer your question more thoroughly, he asked about infrared saunas. Sure, they'll help warm you. They'll get things moving, but they don't help the lymphatic system. You've got to be immersed in water. If you have air currents anywhere, your body will never reach a high temperature. I have people saying that I sweat like a pig when I run and exercise. I don't care. Your body's not getting hot enough to melt that lymphatic tissue. Imagine a stick of frozen butter in a glass that's about this big, and it's sitting in the center, and you've got heat that's only 98.6 outside. How long is it going to take to get in to even start melting that butter? Three hours. And that's in frozen butter. If it isn't frozen butter, just refrigerated butter, it takes about an hour to an hour and a half before it starts dripping. Slightly, barely. That same thing happens in the human body. And if you put it in a sauna, twice as long. It doesn't work. It doesn't work for steam either, and those get very hot, and they damage and dry out the mucous membranes. Then where are you? So, hot baths that are no hotter than 110 degrees, try to keep it about under 108 or right at 108, that's fine. I had a 74 year old man, came to me at 69, chronic fatigue, he was retired, pretty wealthy, so it didn't matter, he was just a couch potato, watched TV all the time, couldn't do much of anything, and he got on to the diet, but he went on to the diet because the doctor said, your thyroid's failing, you have to take thyroxine, and you have prostate cancer. So he came to me, somebody sent him a book, or gave him the book, and he sent it to a friend of his, for a Hanukkah, as a present, with an architectural book, because this friend of his, this younger friend of his, was an architect. And he called the architect, and when he got all this, he said, I've got cancer, who knows what's going to happen. He said, well, how are you doing on the diet? And he said, what are you talking about, what diet? He said, well, you sent me We Want to Live, that book. He said, it's the most incredible diet I've ever done. It's phenomenal, I have all this energy, all this everything now, it's wonderful. He said, send me my book. And he said, no, you gave it to me for Christmas. You have to buy your own book. It'd be a mistake, I've got it marked up for me. There's no way. So he went out and bought the book, he came for a consult. And after about two and a half years on the diet, within a month on the diet, his thyroid was completely working, didn't have to take thyroxine, didn't want to take it anyway. That's why he started looking in other places anyway and started searching. And then the prostate cancer disappeared within a year. It's the signs of prostate cancer, not the PSA. PSA is bullshit. PSA has nothing to do with prostate cancer. It's one of those techniques by the pharmaceutical to get you to take medication or get you to have surgery and be on medication for the rest of your life.

If PSA had anything to do with prostate, all of the people who have their prostate removed wouldn't have PSA. I've had people come to me with prostate removed with 80 to 100 PSA count. No prostates. Absolute bullshit. Makes me angry. These people are ripping out their prostates and never get to have sex again and their mates don't like it, their wives, you know, don't like it because then there's no more sex. If you don't have a prostate, you have no muscle to help you ejaculate and it also prevents the musculature in the penis from getting erect because the penis is nothing but a muscle that gets full of blood and that's what an erection is. And once the prostate is removed, some of those blood channels that go down to the penis are destroyed. So the flow of blood into the penis is reduced by at least 50%. How are you going to get an erection? The [unintelligible] can't keep the blood in. So that upsets me terribly, terribly, terribly. Anyway, after about two and a half years on the diet, he says, you know, I want more energy. You know, he was doing pretty good. Everything was better. And I said, well, if you want to progress really fast, then do the lymphatic baths as I instruct in the book, an hour to an hour and a half at a time, you know, a couple of times a week. He didn't hear the couple of times a week. And it's even in the book, I say only two times a week, three, four days apart. But there was a typo error. It said 110 instead of 101, because I was being cautious when the first book came out. 101 was cautious. I didn't want anybody cooking themselves at 110 degrees. So for three months every day, he did a 110 degrees bath, watched a movie while he was in his hot tub with his computer, and could stay in there and did it. And he said, but I get out of there, I can't do a thing, I'm a slug, I'm back on the couch potato. And I said, well, you know, that's okay. So that happens to you two days a week. He said, what do you mean? It's every day. And I said, wait a minute, you're taking the baths two days a week and it's causing that seven days a week? He says, no, I'm taking the baths every day. And I said, no, no, no, no, no. In the book it says two days a week. And, you know, what's the temperature, 110 degrees? I said, no, no, no. He said, no, it's in the book, 110 degrees. I had to go get the book, and there it was, 110 degrees. A typo, you know, so one typo I missed. So it worked for him, though. I said, then stop doing them. Everything is all melted and gone. You should be okay. Within ten days, he had so much energy, he started, 74 years old, started an international stem cell company where he works 14, 16 hours a day and does not stop. Getting that lymphatic system moving is a very vital function of the system.

Remember, it is supposed to feed every cell in the body, not the blood, but also to remove all the wastes in the body. So if that frees up the blood from doing all of those things, how much energy will you have? Pretty spectacular. But he was retired, he could do them every day. You know, for three and a half months and be a slug. Other people can't, so they could do two days a week. But anybody over the age of 42, 45, they're going to be a slug. If you're younger, you can get out and do the walking exercise, like I recommend, after the hot bath. But it's not imperative that you do the walking. Okay, we're going to have to wind this up and get into mini consults. How many people are doing minis? One, two.

Q: Am I signed up?

Q: No, you're doing the individual.

A: How many are signed up to do it?

Q: Well, I have eight signed up, but three of them are going to come after the workshop. Well, three, four, five are going to come after the workshop. I told them to be here by 6, 30, or 7, and they're not here, I guess.

A: And it is 7, so they should be here. So we're going to do the two that are here. Let's take a break. Each one will take about 6 to 10 minutes. So if we only have two or three, it's only going to be at least, at the most, 30 minutes or less. Okay? And you'll learn a lot more if you stick around and listen.

[break]

A: And you need to be completely relaxed and fall into my hand. Great. Okay. The left ovary is barely there. A lot of scar tissue around. The left adrenal gland is a little waterlogged, so you drink way too much water, too many fluids that aren't raw. The left side of the pancreas, it's not bad. It's about 55% functional, but also edemic. Left thyroid is good. Parathyroid is pretty good. Tonsil area is very poor. The right ovary is quite waterlogged and very protein deficient, but it's okay. Not much of it there, but it's okay. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. The right side of the pancreas is only about 20% alive, but you have lots over here. And on this diet, because there's hardly any carbohydrates, hardly any sugar, you only need 10% of your pancreas functional. You're not eating cooked foods that cause the pancreas to overwork, so we need very little pancreas on this diet. The liver, a lot of congestion in it. A lot of fatty tissue in it. So it looks like you have a little bit of circulation problem in the liver. Right thyroid is okay, parathyroid okay, tonsil area very poor. This white splotching that you have, that's lymphatic congestion. It's not severe. More of the lymphatic waste is what you have. You see this, how much I can get in there? It should only be, see you're just so thick under there. I should only get a quarter and I'm almost getting two thirds, two eighths, I mean three eighths of an inch of toxicity. So you need the short baths more than the long baths. You need the 30, 35 minute baths every day to melt that stuff out of the system. Out of your connective tissue. And you would lose probably a lot of that weight. And put some good fat on after that. Okay, a lot of bile in the system but that's usually with skinny people. Because skinny people don't have much fat so the bile is used in place of the fat. Some other reason you've got a lot of bile throughout the system that causes irritation throughout the system. Red blood cells are okay. White blood cells are pretty good. You have smoke tars all over the body. Did you smoke?

Q: I've never smoked.

A: How about your parents?

Q: Yes.

A: There you go, you were a smoker. If they smoked and you smoked and you were around them, you were a smoker. So you smoked for all of your childhood. That's what it looks like, it looks secondhand smoke because it isn't in particular spots like around the lungs and the kidneys like on most smokers who actually are smokers. Secondhand smokers have it patched all over in the system. Vinegar will help dissolve that a little bit. Meats, meat-wise, you could eat a balance. Let's say 50-50, 50 red, 50 white would be a good balance for you. I wouldn't eat too much red meat alone by itself. Sometimes if you eat red meat, you can eat egg with it and that will bring it to more of a balance. It won't be so acidic. If you're a hyperactive person and you eat red meat, it's going to make you more hyperactive. So you need to eat white meats, not red meats. I also need to tell you this. Everybody has activity rings except for a few people. I'm one of those few, very few people that has no activity rings. That means I don't produce any hormones for physical activity, so I don't have to exercise. Never go into anxiety unless I'm on a bad diet. So if you're a person who's in anxiety, it's because you're not exercising. Depression is a lack of bacteria in your colon, so you're not breaking down the nutrients enough to feed the brain and the nervous system. You use that suppository that I talked about, and that'll feed the E. coli from the back end and feed your brain and nervous system and get rid of the depression. Anxiety is not exercising enough. So every morning, if you're a person who has any kind of energy, you wake in the morning and you look at two doors, imaginary doors before you. One of them says anxiety and the other says exercise. It's your choice what day you want this to be. In the room of anxiety or the room of exercise. Every day, it's an issue. It's an issue for me, but it's an issue for other people. And if you can see in your eyes these little rings that go around, iridologists just call them stress rings. They're only stress if you don't exercise. That just means your body produces a lot of hormones for physical activity. We're meant to be physically active. As animals. Okay, fruits. Raspberries would be very good for you. Pears, especially slightly green pears. Peel them if you see any kind of other than a dull finish on them. So they have petroleum wax, paraffin in them. Bananas and coconut cream. You've got scar tissue several places in your body. And that will help remove scar tissue. Bananas and coconut cream together. But not too much. Bananas are highly starchy. And they are difficult to digest. So if you're an athlete, it's okay to eat a lot of bananas. So high potassium will help you get rid of the lactic acid that causes soreness. Pineapple will help you break down and perspire some of that lymphatic fluid. But watermelon is the best for perspiration. Okay, there you go. You're welcome. Oh, vegetable juice. I forgot to give you a vegetable juice. Let me see your hands again. Okay, I'm always going to give everybody a vegetable juice. If I miss it, remind me. I'm going to suggest, to help get rid of some of this bile, carrot juice is very good. So 25% carrot, 25% celery. Make it 20% celery. 25% carrot, 20% celery. 5% cilantro. 5% parsley. 10% zucchini. And the rest, cucumber puree. Next.

Q: Will somebody write for me? Anyone?

A: Somebody can write.

Q: I can write fast, but it won't be legible. I can try. I mean, I can come back and read it.

Q: Okay, thank you.

Q: Alright.

Q: Marta.

A: Let your hands go limp. Good. Okay. And are you a vegetarian?

Q: I've eaten very little meat in the past couple months because I've had stomach issues or whatever. I don't even know what they are anymore.

A: Have you tried raw meat?

Q: Just the past few days I've had a few bites here and there.

A: Is that okay? Feel okay, the raw meat?

Q: Well, I don't know because my stomach pain is still there. I don't know what's okay anymore.

A: Well, you're going to have to eat a lot of eggs to get through that. If you can get some pig's intestines, it would be very good, small intestines. That would help. Okay, relax your fingers. I just wanted to let me smooth them out. You just leave them relaxed.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay, the left ovary has a lot of scar tissue, but it's okay. Very cold though, so you've got a mineral imbalance. Also, you have a lot of metal poisoning there in that ovary. The left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape, also cold. The left side of the pancreas is about probably 45% functional. That's okay. Left thyroid is good, parathyroid fair, tonsil area atrocious. Relax.

Q: Is that because I'm [unintelligible]?

A: Do you have tonsils?

Q: Yeah, but I don't feel good.

A: Those don't even look like they're there. It looks like they've deteriorated. So you may have very little glands and a lot of fat deposit there. Yeah. The right ovary is very waterlogged, but okay, it's warm and it's functional. The right adrenal gland is okay. It's also very watery, edemic. The right side of the pancreas is very edemic, but very scarred. Probably the right side is only about 5% alive, functional. So you're getting toward diabetes. There's one of your problems right there. 

Q: Wow.

A: You've only got 45% here, so you've measured you have 5% here. So you're down to about 25% overall, only 25% of the pancreas. There's still enough on this diet, but any other diet it's not going to work. You're always going to have indigestion, never going to digest anything. So you're a person that's going to have no choice but to do a good diet. The right thyroid is excellent, parathyroid very good, tonsil area very poor. All this splotching, lymphatic congestion all over the body. All that splotching, white splotching. You have a lot of bile too, so a person wants to stay thin a long time in their life. And stay thin. So vegetable juice I'm going to recommend. 30% carrot juice for you. 20% celery. 10% parsley. 5% zucchini puree and 5% zucchini juiced. And the rest cucumber puree. I want you to always have an egg in your juice and about a half a teaspoon of cream. Only a half a teaspoon.

Q: Regular cream.

A: Yeah. Now that can be, you can have 8 ounces to 12 ounces, you know, once to twice a day.

Q: Of juice, okay.

A: Yeah, if you're very cold you have the smaller amount, 8 ounces not 12.

Q: I'm always cold.

A: Okay.

Q: Yeah.

A: Well you're going to warm.

Q: Okay.

A: And normally I say the cheese and the honey twice daily. I'm still going to say that for you, but usually when somebody's this cold they need more minerals.

Q: Okay.

A: So I'd like you to have, you know, either more cheese and honey at one time, which will cause more weight gain, or eating three cheese meals a day with honey. And probably during the middle of the night would be a better time to have it. To make sure you're getting minerals in the middle of the night. So you're going to have, let's say, some milk and then eat cheese and honey together. Or half a milkshake and then cheese and honey together. But have the cheese and honey after you have the milkshake or the milk. Otherwise you're going to get fat, very fat quickly. I don't mind that, but I can tell you wouldn't be this happy. Now you have smoke tars pretty badly in your esophagus and your bronchioles.

Q: My dad smoked outside the house. He never smoked in the house.

A: Around campfires, in a fire ever? 

Q: You know what, recently someone behind our house at the farm was burning a big fire.

A: Could be that because it's not in the lungs. Not in the lungs. It's in the esophagus and the bronchioles.

Q: Yeah, could be just the environment, yeah.

A: Very poor circulation in your intestines. They're turning into beef jerky. That's why you have your intestinal pain. You need to eat a lubrication formula. For lubrication formula for you, I'm going to suggest two eggs, four tablespoons of butter, half a tablespoon of coconut cream will help. Doesn't have to be, but it will help. And then one and a quarter tablespoons of lemon juice and one and a half teaspoons of honey only.

Q: Okay, just a little bit.

A: It'll still be, you know, a lemon meringue tasting drink, only it won't be quite as sweet.

Q: Okay. How many times a day?

A: I want you to eat, break it up into six. So you have like two tablespoons at a time. Depending upon the size of your eggs, it's going to be more or less. So break it into six. We'll average probably two tablespoons at a time.

Q: Okay.

A: Two tablespoons with your first meat meal, two tablespoons, let's say, around noon, two tablespoons with your evening meal, two tablespoons before you go to bed, and then during the night. That's only five. So break it up into five. Meat-wise, right now, fish would be much better for you. Red meats are going to probably make you more acidic. If you have red meat, make sure you have only half of your meal red meat and the other half oysters or swordfish or some kind of deep ocean fish, halibut, anything like that. Fruit-wise, raspberries and dark berries, you could have, let's say, a quarter, a third of a cup of raspberries, a third of a cup of dark berries, blueberries, blackberries, and boysenberries, two tablespoons of coconut cream, about a tablespoon of dairy cream, and just a pea-sized amount of butter with that. You can blend it all together or you can whip the fats together into a cream and then spoon it out like that. It is good. I'd like you to have two days a week a half a cup of pineapple, not too ripe.

Q: Oh, I have a major reaction.

A: It's very ripe pineapple.

Q: I'm in pain for days.

A: But you're going to have it with coconut cream and you're going to have it with butter. Two tablespoons of coconut cream, two tablespoons of dairy cream, and you blend it all together and you're not going to have that reaction.

Q: Like blend it in the blender?

A: Well, just take a small blender jar. You know, any regular canning jars with a regular mouth jar. Get an osterizer blender. You unscrew it out of its base and use the washer. It'll screw right on those little jars. Turn it upside down and there it is. I tell you how to do it in the recipe book.

Q: Oh, okay. So it's going to be more like a pineapple shake.

A: There it is.

Q: Okay, so it'll be pre-digested in a way.

A: Well, it'll be mixed so much with the fat, it's not going to irritate you. But it can help break down your lymphatic congestion and move some of these things that are crusted. You have a lot of mineral congestion in your system, plaquing. Like on your teeth and other areas of the body. And that keeps you cold. And, you know, I suggest you do almost exactly what I enumerated. Don't have an afternoon milkshake, though. Cheese, egg, butter, and honey. Every hour. Until you get to your fruit meal after your meat meal. So you get to the fruit meal, then you have your fruit meal. You've got the berries you can have four days a week. Well, let's do it this way. Have the berries three days a week. Have the pineapple two days a week. And have a custard two days a week for your intestines. Custard's in both books and recipe's in both books. Pick that. So every hour you're doing the cheese, egg, honey, butter. Have the fruit meal somewhere around three o'clock. Then the cheese, egg, and honey, butter mixture all the way up until about seven. Then you have your second meat meal. And I would skip a second vegetable juice. It's too cold right now. Do a second vegetable juice in the summer. Spring, when it's warmer, but not now. You just have another meat meal with your moisturizing formula again. And then, you know, before you go to sleep, have a half of a milkshake with a fifth of your moisturizing formula. In the night, same thing with a little bit of cheese. Have like one tablespoon of cheese with a half a teaspoon of honey after you have your moisturizing formula and your milkshake, half a milkshake and honey and cheese. Okay?

Q: I know you probably can't tell, but the pain that I have is right here when I push. And it didn't show up in that. Okay.

A: Not in the stomach, it's probably your bowel.

Q: My bowel. That high up?

A: Oh, the bowel crosses way up here.

Q: I feel like somebody's stabbing me all the time. It's been going on forever.

A: Probably not producing enough mucus in this diet.

Q: Okay.

A: Those eggs will help.

Q: All right. Thank you so much.

A: You're welcome.

[unintelligible]

A: Is there one more or is that it?

Q: I'm sorry, it's me.

A: Okay. Are you going to do it too?

Q: Okay, yeah. Just to figure out.

[unintelligible]

A: I can understand that.

[unintelligible]

A: The pressure.

Q: I need to exercise now. It's really exciting.

Q: Okay, now what do I do?

A: Put your hands limp into my hands. There you go. Good, falling in. All right. The right, I mean the left ovary is barely there too. Well, I can feel tissue on either side. Probably very protein deficient. Yeah, it's okay. You do have tissue still there. The left adrenal gland is in very good shape. A little cold though, so it's still a little mineral deficient. Not utilizing your minerals as well as you should. The right side, the left side of the pancreas. What kind of work do you do? Do you do work?

Q: A secretary.

A: Okay, as I was going to say, are you lifting weights or do you have this much scar tissue in your pancreas? You have that much scar tissue in your pancreas. The pancreas, the left side, is lucky if it's 20% alive. Remember, diabetes is 10% on this diet. Any other diet, you're a diabetic.

Q: Well, I do a lot of yard work.

A: Well, that could cause that muscle to be tight.

Q: I've always done a lot of yard work.

A: How much every day or once a week?

Q: Well, I can't say every day.

A: Okay.

Q: But I do pick up rocks.

A: Yeah, that does... No, flipping, which would cause that kind of tightness. So, yeah. Okay, the right thyroid is in very good shape. Parathyroid is in pretty good shape. Tonsil area is in poor shape. You have smoke tars all up in your lungs, all up in your chest cavity on both sides.

Q: Okay. I go to smoky environments with my husband.

A: Yeah. The right ovary is in very good shape. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. The right side of the pancreas is barely functional, 10%. So, your pancreas needs help. And if you actually, if you have a glandular problem, an organ problem, you eat that gland or organ and it really will regenerate the body faster than other meats. So, I suggest you get pancreas and eat it. Dan Kramer, I know he butchers once a week. Have that pancreas. Do you know Dan Kramer?

Q: I'm familiar with who he is.

A: Okay.

Q: I don't know that I've met him.

A: The right thyroid is very good. Parathyroid is okay. Tonsil area is very poor. That splotching is all lymphatic congestion. Most of the lymphatic congestion is in your intestines. Red blood cells and count are very high, look pretty good. White blood cells, okay. White blood cells on the left side of your body are a little bit better on the right. Red blood cells on the right side of the body are better than the left side. And your red and white blood cells breed in the bone marrow. Mature in the bone marrow, and then after 40-60 days, they enter the blood stream. It looks like you have very good recuperative abilities, you just need to eat the right foods. So I'm going to suggest meat, it doesn't matter, you're good with either of them, either red or white. Always both of them together creates a better balance of emotional being, I've found. No matter what you can eat, the individual can eat. Fruit, a little bit of pineapple, like a half a cup of pineapple with two tablespoons of coconut cream and about one tablespoon of dairy cream only. Add about a quarter teaspoon of butter, about the size of a bean. Raspberries would be helpful. Also what I'd like you to do is have about four ounces of carrot juice in place of a fruit meal or as a fruit meal with three tablespoons of coconut cream and two tablespoons of dairy cream and a tablespoon of honey and two teaspoons of lemon juice. Don't gulp it, I don't care how good it tastes. You take your time, you'll get indigestion if you drink that fast. With your diabetic type condition, you could be high and low on it, so you need to sip it. Take 30 minutes to sip it. It'll be nice to enjoy it over 30 minutes. It'll be a pretty good tasting drink. That's to help get rid of all that excess bile you have in the system. I think that bile is what hardens your pancreas. It's the sport drink that I gave earlier. Definitely something you should have every day. I suggest that you drink two to three cups of milk a day.

Q: I drink a lot of milk. It's been refrigerated.

A: Well, that's okay. It's just that you need to leave it out for a few hours before. I leave mine out 12 hours minimum before. If it's never been refrigerated. I never refrigerate it. Period. Okay, did I give you vegetable juice? No. Okay, I'd like you to have 20% carrot, 25% celery, 5% cilantro, 10% parsley, and the rest cucumber puree. Now, you have something, I don't normally talk about this because it has to do with personality, but you have a personality trait in your hands that shows that you're ultra critical.

Q: Of myself or?

A: Anything.

Q: Okay.

A: Anything and everything. You were born an artist, not a secretary. So you're a very creative mind. You like that creative mind because it keeps you interested every day. Yesterday's art is not to be criticized. It was yesterday. It was perfect for your imagination yesterday. If you expect people to keep up with your need for change, you're going to be sorely disappointed with them.

Q: I move the furniture all the time.

A: That's fine. That's good. That's wonderful. That's not hurting anybody. But if you expect somebody else to make you happy, you're going to be very disappointed with everybody. So just realize that you're a creative person. Change every day is important for you. Otherwise you're going to be crazy and unhappy. Okay? I would like you to have a one-and-a-half tablespoon with your first meat meal and one tablespoon with your second meat meal. Honey and butter throughout the day if you like. Lots of eggs.

Q: A one-and-a-half tablespoon of what with the first meal?

A: One-and-a-half tablespoons of butter with the first meat meal and one tablespoon of butter with the second meat meal. Honey and butter mixture, three butter to one honey for you. And you have like a half a teaspoon every hour, maybe a teaspoon every hour with your cheese and egg. Okay? You need lots of eggs. So I'd skip a milkshake in the day for you and I would only have, let's say, a fruit meal every other day. Two of them are going to be the carrot juice and two of them the pineapple. Pineapple with two tablespoons of coconut cream, one tablespoon of dairy cream. So those are your fruit meals. You've got four for the week. That'll be every other day you'll have one of them. So you have the carrot juice one day, next day you don't have anything. The next day you have the pineapple. Next day you're going to have the carrot. Next day nothing. You go in a cycle like that. And you need hot baths to get that lymphatic system moving.

Q: I normally take showers.

A: Showers don't do it. They poison you as a matter of fact. Chloroform vapors from the chlorine.

Q: Oh yeah, I've heard that.

A: Also it could be another thing that's affecting your lungs to hold onto people's smoke more. Ready?

Q: I'm ready. I think I'm relaxed now.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: As long as Joe doesn't mind us in his house. He likes the entertainment.

[laughter]

A: Okay, relax. Well, you're a cold person too. It shouldn't be with you. Good shape. You're perfect in body weight. Relax. If you were healthy, you're perfect in body weight. If you're not, you may need more weight.

Q: I gulp, so when I was gulping, I put on weight.

A: Don't gulp. We've learned today.

Q: I know.

A: Don't gulp. You see all these lines here?

Q: Yes.

A: Your body, especially your brain, everything from here up was turning into beef jerky. You had no fats from here up. So you're one of those fat conscious people?

Q: No, I ate a lot of fat.

A: Before?

Q: Yeah, and I was eating the raw. Maybe it's not digested.

A: No, this is before.

Q: Oh.

A: This is for a long time in your childhood and all through.

Q: Oh, in my childhood.

A: Very fat deficient.

Q: Maybe more like the low carb, high fat.

A: Good. 

Q: Probably about ten years ago.

A: It means you're not, oh.

Q: No, hell, let's see. Nineteen. My kids are ten, so probably eight, ten years ago.

A: Uh-huh. You were high carbohydrate or low carb back then?

Q: Low carb, high... Now I'm a lot of high fat.

A: Okay. But back then you weren't because all this dryness from here up, that's a long time in the making.

Q: Really?

A: From childhood up.

Q: Okay.

A: A long time ago.

Q: I didn't drink any milk when I was growing up. I didn't drink, I never liked milk.

A: Very little good fats.

Q: Okay. I used to eat fat and butter. I remember I used to eat butter.

A: Was it butter or margarine?

Q: Butter. And I used to eat the fat off the meat. That was probably my only kind I'd get.

A: Yeah, but that's good stuff. It shouldn't have done this to you. You must not have been creating good bile. There must have been something wrong with your liver. Probably a vaccine or two went to it and destroyed your liver. Damaged it from digesting your fats. Because you have bile everywhere as if you were a skinny person not eating fat. And all this dryness, which is very advanced, that I see in people who are athletes and don't eat fat.

Q: I did a couple marathons.

A: Yeah, but if you were eating fat, that's okay.

Q: Okay.

A: Because you're on a high-carbohydrate diet. No, and that's what you look like. It means your liver isn't working, there's something wrong with your liver. So you eat liver.

Q: I can start.

A: Eat liver. That's what I'm saying.

Q: Okay.

A: You need to eat liver. And a lot of it. You have almost no circulation in the right intestines, small intestines, and poor circulation in the left. But almost no good circulation into the right small intestines at all. Another reason, you may not be just digesting the fats.

Q: So that's what's happening, I'm not digesting the fats?

A: You also have lymphatic blockages everywhere, and that's unusual for somebody who ate animal fats. You didn't eat Crisco or any kind of fried foods like that?

Q: I mean fried foods, probably when I was in college, I didn't eat great in college.

A: Lots of fried foods with margarine, vegetable oils, that's all there is in this. Okay, let me go through your glands. Your right, left ovary, it's pretty weak. The left adrenal gland is okay, but cold, mineral deficient. The right, or lacking the ability to utilize the minerals. The left side of the pancreas, you have striations of scar tissue from it. Did you live near a farm? 

Q: I grew up across the street from a forest, not really a farm.

A: Some kind of chemical, could be from vaccines, but this is striations of poisons. Were you subjected to a lot of bug spray or anything like that? Mother used a lot of raid, ant spray or anything?

Q: My dad, we had diesel engines when we grew up, I don't know, that's kind of...

A: Yeah, did he work around the house on them?

Q: We just kind of drove them and, I don't know, we always had diesels.

A: And her would start them and let them run in the yard to warm up?

Q: Yeah, [unintelligible].

A: That could have done it, because there's a lot of scar tissue in this left side of your pancreas. So, you've got many problems, many problems.

Q: In my pancreas then? In the...

A: Pancreas, your liver, and your intestines, all in your digestive system. That's why you look like this.

Q: And this comes on monthly, this thing, this is new, this like striation, that's new.

A: It is new?

Q: Mm-hmm.

A: That is, that, if that is new...

Q: Don't tell me it's bad news, is it even worse if it's new?

A: Well, if it's new, that means you've had some very toxic poison stored inside. They've been doing this to the inner part of the body, and that's probably what's in your pancreas, your liver.

Q: Is it detoxing? I've gotten healthier lately.

A: Yeah, that's what I mean. If it's coming out now through your skin, wonderful.

Q: I started seeing a nutritionist about a year and a half ago, and ever since then, things have been weird happening to me. Just like this, I'm like, I call her up, I'm like, oh, and now I'm like, what the heck? I've got these weird things, and there's things happening.

A: Now, remember, 90% of the toxins is supposed to lead to the skin.

Q: Well, then that's good, because this happens cyclically, like, then it'll go away, and then as I get my period and stuff, like, I can see, I can tell when I'm like, changed, like there's things. Is that good, or...

A: Skin or scar tissue, it's a good thing.

Q: Is that a good thing that this is here?

A: Absolutely. You want it to leave. Otherwise, you're beef jerky inside.

Q: So, the fact that this is striating and coming out like this, is it healing the things in my pancreas and the liver scars or not?

A: Well, it should. Eventually, when they rebuild, you have to eat enough meat to do that, raw meats to do that.

Q: Okay.

A: The right thyroid gland is very poor, very weak. The parathyroids are okay, tonsil area is very poor, very dry. The right ovary is very cold, very thin, very small. The right adrenal gland is pretty good. The right side of the pancreas is pretty much striated, scar tissue too. Probably you're 15% of your pancreas is working. 

Q: That's not good.

A: No. You're 5% above being diabetic if you're doing this diet. Doing any other diet you're going to be diabetic. Now I haven't seen this kind of ratio of pancreatic problems in other cities. There are other cities that have a lot of problems, but this is the worst I've seen in pancreatic with this few people.

Q: I'm from upstate New York, up by Albany we had problems with thyroid and pancreatic.

A: The right thyroid is very poor, the parathyroid is okay, tonsil area very poor. Red blood cells are fair, white blood cells are okay. All this bile in your system irritates you everywhere inside. The whole body is irritated, dries everything out. Okay, whenever you have a vegetable juice you have to have egg and cream in it. So have a teaspoon of cream and one egg every eight ounces of vegetable juice. If you have twelve ounces of vegetable juice, I don't care, use two eggs, not one.

Q: I started juicing a lot, like I drink a lot of juice now, recently.

A: That will help you detoxify quickly. Not sure you want to do all that that quickly, without reinforcing, because your body is pretty weak.

Q: Could it be all the detoxing I'm doing and she's got me, I'm like I'm on some supplements and stuff.

A: You know I don't agree with supplements, they're toxic. Well, feed them to your lawn, feed them to your garden, go out and eat the grass or juice the grass. Don't eat those things, they're toxic. Vegetable juice, 20% carrot, 20% celery, 5% cilantro, 5% parsley, 5% zucchini puree, 5% zucchini juice, and the rest cucumber puree. Now you have signs of internal bleeding in places, so I would like you to have a half a cup of green cabbage juice, head cabbage.

Q: I just started eating sauerkraut and stuff.

A: I don't want you to eat sauerkraut, that's fermented, it destroys the K and U, it helps blood clotting and gets rid of ulcers. And so you need to eat fresh cabbage juice, only half a cup a week.

Q: So no more sauerkraut, I just made a whole bunch, I'm all into it now and I guess not.

A: Well you've got all this bile in your body that's going to cause you in a few weeks to be terribly irritable.

Q: Isn't it supposed to be good for the digestion and all that?

A: It depends upon the body's condition. If you're going to continue on cooked foods and if you didn't have a lot of bile in your system, I would say sure, good. But with all the bile in your system and you have that acidic stuff, you're asking for trouble.

Q: So you think I've made it worse by having, I mean I just started like in the last month or two and it's kind of gotten worse?

A: Well it could be causing a lot more dryness. Some of this may not just be detox, it may be that that's drying you out even more.

Q: And meat kebabs and all that, that's not good. Not for me. Alright.

A: Not with heavy bile. Also, so in your vegetable juice you have the egg and the cream. Two days a week, maybe three days a week, so every other day have three ounces of carrot juice with about a half a teaspoon of vinegar, two and a half tablespoons of coconut cream, one and a half tablespoons of dairy cream, and one teaspoon of honey.

Q: The first thing, three ounces of what?

A: Three ounces of carrot juice. And then, did I say a teaspoon of lemon juice?

Q: No.

A: Okay. Teaspoon of lemon juice. Blend all that together and sip that over about a ten, fifteen minute period, have that every other day. Other fruit for you right now would be custard, stick with custard, which is papaya, egg, butter and honey, and the recipes are in both books. Meat wise, you've got signs of a little bit of anemia, so you need some red meat, but I'm going to suggest about twenty-five percent, lots of white meat, lots of seafood or chicken, any kind of fowl. And you need both the lymphatic and the lymphatic waste bath, lymphatic congestion, lymphatic waste baths. Way too much, you're holding it in the tissues, not perspiring it out of the body. Get off of those fermented vegetables, absolutely, yes.

Q: Okay, I eat a lot of fermented foods now, I'm eating a lot of stuff that's fermented. I eat a lot of super green food like spirulina and chlorella and all that.

A: Chlorella is okay, if it's good raw and raised properly, it's the only one, but spirulina, indigestible. You have to be a fish to digest it, just like it takes a cow to digest vegetation or an herbivore to digest vegetation, chlorella is the only one that will digest. Also I'm going to suggest that if you want to have good soil bacteria and probiotics and it really helps everybody, get terramin clay, t-e-r-r-a-m-i-n.

Q: I just got some of those, not the terramin clay, but I was getting the primal, my nutrition said the primal defense, but you don't like all that then.

A: Primal defense is okay as long as it's not in capsules and it's not in pill form. If it's in the powder form, it's okay. Getting the clay, the terramin nutritional clay, grade clay, mixing that with enough good well water or rain water is the best, it's full of bacteria, and you just stir that in to wait for it to rain, you know, like an hour and then start collecting the rain after an hour. If there's chemtrails heavy that day, wait an hour and a half, two hours after it's rained. And then you mix a batch of it, I use like a two cup jar, and I'll put a little over a half, a whole, you know, a half of the jar, which is a little over a half, a whole cup of the clay, and then I'll put the water in and mix it until it's like plaster of Paris. And then you set it and let it sit for three or four days and all the bacteria starts moving and it's a bacteria that can shape, shape-shift into anything you want in your body. It's the only substance on the planet that does that, so. And it will provide good soil bacteria, I've even seen people glow from just having one tablespoon of that made with rainwater, not with any other water, start glowing from one tablespoon of it. And remember that all animals out there eat dirt with everything they eat. We don't get any soil bacteria, and we should get tons, being meat eaters, we have to slaughter an animal on the ground in the dirt, and we should be eating a lot of soil, so. The best one is the terramin clay.

Q: Okay. All right, and you said I should be eating liver then?

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay. She's also got me on like standard process, like glandulars, and so those aren't good?

A: For you, they're not going to help.

Q: Okay. So I got to just eat, like, raw liver?

A: You need bacteria, you need, you know, you need fats that you can digest, you need the soil bacteria to get the liver and the pancreas going again, and you need tons of eggs. So you don't have to have complicated digestion. 

Q: Okay.

A: Okay?

Q: That's not okay. That's not okay.

Q: Did you take her lymphatic waste baths and...

A: And lymphatic congestion baths.

Q: Okay. Okay.

Q: So when do you take that clay? At what point in the day do you take your tablespoon of it?

A: Well, it depends upon the person. If she were very skinny, I would tell her that she has to take the clay with milk. Milk has a lot of bacteria already in it and having clay with the milk is a good thing to do. So you mix it with, you know, I would take mine and I'd mix two table spoons and I have it like once a week. I have two table spoons with about three quarters of a cup of milk.

Q: Any time during the day?

A: No. It's better somewhere around, you know, a meat meal, like after a meat meal would be better. You know, you're going to have your cheese and honey and then after you have your cheese and honey, maybe 10, 15 minutes you can have your soil bacteria, you know, your clay and milk together. If you're very overweight, you could have the clay and juice, vegetable juice and not milk.

Q: I was drinking the fermented, sorry, I was moving more towards the kefir and the yogurts.

A: That's fine.

Q: Okay.

A: Those fermented products, but that's not vegetables fermented.

Q: So it's the vegetables fermented.

A: Yeah. That's the problem.

Q: That's too acidic.

A: Too acidic for you. Yes.

Q: Okay.

A: Cause severe drying, causes psoriasis in people.

Q: Yeah. It seems like things have gotten worse. Okay. 

Q: And Aajonus, when you said the two tablespoons of clay, that's the clay mixture?

A: That's the wet. The wet mixture. Yes. The wet mixture. What's your name?

Q: Janelle.

A: Janelle. Hi Janelle. Okay.

Q: Do I have pen marks?

A: Yes you do. You're like a little kid.

Q: I know. I'm a little kid.

A: You're imitating them. Okay. The left ovary is very scarred and very hard. The left adrenal gland is in okay shape, a little scar tissue there too. Left side of your pancreas is about 30% alive, very scarred too. Right thyroid is okay, parathyroid fair, tonsil area very poor.

Q: What makes a tonsil area poor?

A: The canned foods, vaccines, all that stuff, anything with metal, pollution in the air. I've only found maybe 10 people out of 5,000 with good tonsils, not very good. That doesn't count the natives that I've seen, they all have good tonsils. The right ovary is about 40% scarred, the right adrenal gland is okay. 

Q: What scars the ovaries?

A: It can be anything, any toxin that gets into them. And remember the ovaries and the testes are high in fat so your body may use that as a storage place. The right side of the pancreas is about 10-12% alive, right thyroid is fair, the right parathyroids are okay but weak, the tonsil area is very poor and very metal, you're metal poisoned all over. Did you grow up in a farm?

Q: I grew up in a farm community and I had the hair analysis and it was very high on all of them because there was the spray and the crop dusting.

A: Because that's what you look like, you look like you're either a farmer or somebody who grew up around all those pesticides and herbicides so your whole body is poisoned.

Q: So how do you get the...

A: You have the body of an 80 year old.

Q: How do you get the oil and all the heavy metals out?

A: The best way is like I said earlier, the oysters, eating three oysters twice daily, so six oysters is the quickest way to get there, six days a week with some other meat at the same time. Lubrication formulas are going to help protect you, eggs by themselves are not going to work for you although you need the help in digestion because you have very poor circulation in your intestines. So you need the eggs but you can't eat them completely alone. So you can eat the cheese every hour, you can eat like a teaspoon, maybe a little bit more than a half a teaspoon, almost a teaspoon, that's a teaspoon right there, every hour.

Q: The cheese?

A: No, just the cheese, then ten minutes after that you have an egg and then about two minutes after that you have a teaspoon of honey butter mixture, okay? I would suggest you do that and only eat one meat meal in the evening.

Q: I'm nursing as well so I get very hungry, so I don't know if that's going to satiate me and then I'll crave carbs.

A: Well then, well if you're having, let's say do it every 45 minutes, do the cheese, the egg and the honey butter mixture, okay? And you can sip on milk a little at a time, don't have more than two ounces every hour.

Q: Is kefir, okay, because milk...

A: Kefir is wonderful, okay, and that way the baby will certainly be getting its nutrients. But I suggest, if I see women like you, I say never breastfeed. You've got so many toxins that are going into that baby. You feed that baby cow's milk or goat's milk, that is, the animal's eaten raw all of its life. Your baby's going to be affected by the toxins in your body, and there's a massive amount in your system, you know, so you're transferring that to your baby, so think about that, okay?

Q: I understand.

A: And remember this, women, if you have, you know, offspring that wants to nurse their babies, I always tell, you women aren't strong enough, not healthy enough, to breastfeed your baby, but get naked on the breast when you feed them from a warm bottle. They're still going to get the warmth of you and they're going to bond to you. They're even going to be bonding better because they get the raw milk, the healthy milk, and not your milk. So I always find it's much better. Now I've got to, let me tell you the example of children that grow up on, rather than the mother's milk, they're having the cow's milk instead. I got one child that at two and a half years old could recite, without teaching him, he could recite the alphabet backwards and forwards. At five years old, he knew 184 countries, where are they on the map, what countries are next to them, who ruled the country, and what political system. The kid was never taught any of this, he just looks at things and absorbs it. All the children who are born and eating the raw dairy, and the parents are eating the raw foods along with them, and they continue on that diet, all of the children are genius. One child, a kid that went on it, remember I was talking about the woman producer, her one-year-old went on the diet at one-year-old, and he graduated from Yale at 18 years old. Almost 18, he wasn't quite 18. That's what this can do. Any mother who breastfeeds their babies have never had that kind of intelligence, because of the toxins. As far as meat goes, oysters, and just so you don't put the toxins into the baby that you're going to remove with the oysters, you're going to have to have lots of butter with that meal. So you can make a lemon butter sauce for your oysters, it's very tasty, but you have to get it all warm to mix it, like they do in a restaurant where they cook it and heat it. But you just put it in a jar with the lemon and honey, immerse it in a bowl of hot water, and let it warm up. And then keep it in that little warm, as you dip in or sip out of it, so it stays mixed. Because as it cools and gets thick, the lemon will separate from the butter. Also a moisturizing formula would be good for you to have, and you have like two tablespoons every two hours. 

Q: I know you mentioned having oyster with another meat, and one meat a day, so I'm having this one big six oysters and another kind of meat.

A: And I would say like a cup of red meat or a cup of fish, other fish, if you want.

Q: And that in the second half of the day.

A: Yeah. And the rest of the day off with your cheese, go to egg, egg, two eggs, and then go to a vegetable juice. But since you have so much toxicity, I'd like you to go cheese, egg, egg, that's ten minutes between each of them, and then I'd like you to wait ten minutes, have a half a teaspoon of cheese, which is a sugar cube sized amount, have that before you have your vegetable juice with an egg in it. 

Q: Okay, and earlier you mentioned the butter honey combination, two minutes after each of those eggs?

A: No, that will be when you're doing the every hour, every forty-five minutes to an hour. Of course, if you stop breastfeeding, you won't need it as often, then you do it every hour. The cheese, ten minutes after that, the egg, two minutes after that, your honey butter mixture.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay? And you need to do that mainly is what you need to do. All throughout the day, every day, and then in the evening you need your meat meal. And I like to eat that meat meal at seven o'clock.

Q: Okay.

A: I want those nutrients to help heal you, as well as clean some of that metallic minerals out of your nervous system, rather than in the other part of your system. Okay?

Q: And then for the juice, what's the recommendation for that?

A: Vegetable juice, I'm going to suggest 20% celery, 20% carrot, 10% zucchini juice, as long as you're breastfeeding no cilantro, just like 10% parsley, and then the rest cucumber puree. Once you stop breastfeeding, I would like you to add 5% cilantro and subtract 5% from the cucumber puree. Okay?

Q: And any fruit? How is that?

A: Not a good idea with as much toxins as you usually have.

Q: That's fine. I don't have as much. I don't enjoy it that much anyway.

A: I'd rather you have the honey, but it's certainly going to take care of your sweetness and give you enough carbs. Okay?

Q: Does it matter when she has her oyster meal?

A: Yes, 7 o'clock in the evening.

Q: Oh, did you write it down too? Oh, great. She did too.

Q: I'll make sure I get it all.

A: Okay. We did it. Another marathon. 

[audio cut]

A: Okay. You eat way too much fermented food. You see how you're cracking and drying out too? 

Q: I don't.

A: You're getting fermentation from somewhere.

Q: I don't eat fermented food.

A: You really don't? Oh, kombucha.

Q: Yes, I do.

A: Because it's really drying out the system, especially your brain. But it's drying out everything from here up.

Q: Oh, my Lord.

A: People don't understand, there needs to be somebody who's rational in observing people. That's why I worked with the kombucha with that whole group of people, with 12 people for four years. And I saw what it did, and I said, this is not a good thing. Not a good thing at all.

Q: Wow.

A: Okay. Relax your hands so they can go limp. Okay. The left ovary is a little waterlogged, but it's okay. The right, I mean the left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Relax. The left side of the pancreas, you have a lot of scar tissue there, so it's only about 10% functional on that side. The left thyroid is fair. Parathyroids are okay. The tonsil area is poor. The right ovary, quite a bit of scar tissue, but it's okay. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Relax. The right side of the pancreas, there's more there. So that's about probably 40% alive. 

Q: The pancreas?

A: Pancreas. Right thyroid is okay. Parathyroid is very good. The tonsil area is fair. Very poor circulation in both intestines. Your red blood cells are pretty good. White blood cells are okay, but there's some kind of solvent you have in the system. It's causing problems. And the amount of metal you have in the brain is tremendous, one of the highest I've seen. So all the vaccines that you've got in your life, mercury and aluminum went to your brain. Pardon?

Q: I got all penicillin shots. Penicillin shots.

A: They have aluminum and mercury too.

Q: Yeah, I was loaded. Seven years old. Loaded.

A: So good you have all this fat because you've been protected. You notice that your glands were pretty good all over. This fermentation, this kombucha juice is drying the hell out of you. And the dryness on top of the metals in the brain, you could be in trouble. Strokes, dementia, all kinds of problems. So to reverse that you need the moisturizing formula every day. Every hour you could take a tablespoon. All throughout the day until it's all gone. The lubrication, moisturizing formula for you would be one day two eggs in it, the next day three eggs. Six tablespoons of butter. Two tablespoons of lemon juice. And about two teaspoons of honey. 

Q: This is the formula?

A: This is the lubrication formula, the moisturizing formula. Now for her I just gave a quantity for you. It's on here. So that is the quantity I want you to have, that ratio. Of course if the eggs are larger it's going to be more volume of food because you have two to three eggs. Each day it's two or three. So the quantity could differ depending on the size of eggs, the amount of that fluid. But every hour you have a tablespoon. Then whatever is left, if there is any left by the end of the day, you have that sometime during the night. That should recover that, nine months. If you don't, it's going to take you probably 12 years to recover. If you hadn't had that, you'd have much better health. Again, you have all this fat on your body which has protected you. Here's the evidence again, these are the best hands I've seen tonight.

Q: I thought you'd probably bury me.

A: That's your concept, but your fat has protected you. Just think if you'd eaten all that kombucha and not had that fat. You probably had a stroke a few times already and be in dementia.

Q: I don't remember all these people's names. Oh gosh.

A: You still have a little bit of too much acidity in the body, so I'm going to suggest that you eat more fish and eat lots of eggs. I'm going to suggest that you eat 12 to 13 eggs a day.

Q: I've been doing that for the last four days.

A: Isn't that great?

Q: I made myself. I'm going to do it and not just do one day.

Q: We're going to call each other.

A: It'll work. You're going to start losing some weight doing that, of course. Remember, eggs by themselves will cause massive weight loss, so you better have your honey and butter a little bit after.

Q: And a little bit of cream. Does that go along with it?

A: No. I don't want you to do that because that'll cause more weight gain. You have honey and butter, and you can have cheese before to absorb the poisons, of course, before the egg. Vegetable juice, I'm going to suggest about 25% carrot, 25% celery, 10% zucchini, 5% cilantro, 5% parsley, and the rest cucumber puree. And you don't need an egg in your juice, but I'd like you to have a half of a teaspoon only of cream in the juice.

Q: In the juice.

A: Because you're going to start pulling a little bit of the metal out because of the cilantro, so I want that cream to be there to protect your nerves. And it's only a small amount, you only need a small amount of cream. So lots and lots and lots of eggs. And that's basically what you should be eating.

Q: Wow, great. This is very neat.

A: See, you've got the protection.

[audio cut]

A: Okay Joe, lean forward a little bit. Look at your dirty hands, wonderful. Good dirt. I like good dirt. Relax your hands completely. Do you milk by yourself or do you have milking machines?

Q: We have milking machines.

A: I just want to make sure that I'm not seeing scar tissue from somebody milking, because our milkers, when my grandparents had a farm, their hands were like steel from milking. Okay, the left testy is in pretty good shape. Left adrenal gland, a little scar tissue, but it's okay. Left side of the pancreas. About 55% alive, that's good. Left thyroid is poor, parathyroid is poor, tonsil area is very poor. The right testy is in very good shape. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape, a little edemic there. Water retention. The right side of the pancreas is about 50% alive. For your age, that's twice what I expect, so that's pretty good. And if you're doing a lot of the primal diet, you don't have to worry about having a lot of pancreas. The right thyroid is okay, parathyroid fair, the tonsillary very poor. So your glands from here on out aren't working very well, from your thymus up. Well, the thymus is okay, so let's say from here up, your thyroid up, it's not working very well. Red blood cells are very good, you still have growth hormones. White blood cells are pretty good. Were you a smoker?

Q: At one time, yeah.

A: I thought that was dirt and then I saw it again and it's tars. You have tars all through your lungs, all through your chest, your bronchioles. I've seen people with esophageal cancer with these kind of marks. So it's good you stopped and it's good you're doing raw. You drink your own raw milk?

Q: Oh yeah.

A: Good. Very poor circulation around the heart. So I'd like you to eat heart of an animal. Put a hot water bottle under your left side, you know, at night sometimes. If you're lying on your left side, you put a hot water bottle here and put a pillow against that. Tent the heat into your heart area. Got a lot of lymphatic congestion around your heart. So that is the only dangerous thing that I see. If you weren't eating a good diet, I would say the esophagus is likely to have cancer. But if you're doing well, do you eat any vinegar at all?

Q: No. I give it to my cows.

[laughter]

A: They don't need it, you do. Cow doesn't need vinegar. That over-acidifies them, they don't digest as well.

Q: Is that right?

A: Yeah, they're not supposed to have acidic foods like that.

Q: Apple cider vinegar?

A: Apple cider vinegar.

Q: For any livestock?

A: Any livestock. If you have dogs, that's okay. Cats, if they'd eat it, it'd be okay. But you're talking about herbivores. They have to have an alkaline system. If you throw an acid, even though it's from a fruit, you throw that acid in there, it's going to prevent them from digesting their fats as well. 

Q: Gosh, the horses love it.

A: Horses love sweet foods. You can get a horse to eat fermented apples. If you go on the Big Island of Hawaii and go down to Waipio Valley, you get to see all of these wild horses that live just the way they want, and they eat all of these guavas that are fermented, all this fermented fruit. Their stomachs are completely dropped, and their backs are dropped. They're not healthy animals because they eat that kind of fermented, high-fermented food. These are not wild, healthy horses. Very unhealthy from eating those fermented foods. It dissolves their spinal cord, and you'd see that it just dips, and their stomach is just huge, and it just bulges. It's Waipio Valley on the Big Island. Okay, meat-wise, you could have red or white. Of course, white's always a little bit better when you have this much acidity in your system. You need to drink at least three quarts of milk a day. 

Q: I've not been drinking that much.

A: If you had, let's say, about three ounces of cream a day, you could cut that milk down to two and a half quarts.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay. I'm going to suggest that you have vinegar in the sport drink that I gave earlier. Did you...

Q: I didn't hear that.

Q: I got it written down.

A: You got it? Okay. Give that formula to him. But I'd like you to have one and a half tablespoons of vinegar in yours instead of one tablespoon of vinegar. And I want you to have the high amount, the four tablespoons of coconut cream and the four tablespoons of dairy cream rather than just two of each. Everything else would be the same. No, I want you to put two eggs in your sport formula. For the protein. I just want to make sure that heart's going to be okay. Yeah. Okay? You need your milk. Not you. You need your milk, Joe. That's right. That's right. You still have good healing hormones. Just like Janet does. So, you know. Good. Vegetable juice. The same vegetable juice as Janet would be fine. But I want you to put an egg or two in yours. She has no egg in hers. She has enough weight. You don't quite have enough weight to defend yourself when you start moving the heavy metals out. You need that protein and fat from the egg there to bind with it. Food wise, pears, berries, cherries. All of those are low in carbs except for the pear if it's too ripe. Berries and cherries are very low in carbs.

Q: Like blueberries.

A: Blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries, cherries, raspberries. All low in carbs. A couple of apples a week during the winter definitely could help.

Q: I like them best in apple pie.

[laughter]

A: I've got a raw apple pie in the book.

Q: Do you?

A: Absolutely. Absolutely. So have your raw apple pie.

Q: I made one the other day.

Q: Did you?

Q: It was raw, yeah. I didn't bake it. I made a crust with a little bit of nuts and dates and a bit of butter and cream to it. It wasn't bad.

Q: Why not?

A: Okay. All right. Here you go.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Thank you.

[audio cut]

A: The left adrenal gland is waterlogged. You're drinking way too much water. The right, left side of the pancreas is also waterlogged. It's starting to get very weak because of it. It's dissolving everything. Pancreas, though, is pretty much alive. So it's probably, you know, if it didn't have all that water in there, it would probably be one of the better pancreases that I've experienced. So right now, it's about 70% active and about 80% alive. That's excellent. The left thyroid is good. Parathyroid is good. Tonsil area, poor. The right testes is in much better shape, but also waterlogged. The right adrenal gland is waterlogged, but okay. On the right side of the pancreas, here we have a lot of scar tissue. Probably only about 25% alive on that side. Right thyroid is good. Parathyroid is very good. Tonsil area, fair. You were a smoker? Around smokers?

Q: Yeah, I work at a place where, now they don't anymore.

A: You have smoke tars almost like you were a smoker yourself. Almost doesn't look like second hand.

Q: I never smoked.

A: Shoulders, everywhere.

Q: Tell them where you work.

A: I work as a mechanic.

Q: They used to be smoking in the shop.

Q: Yeah, they used to be smoking in the shop.

A: So you're smoking with them. If they're smoking, you're smoking. You have lots of bile over the body, so for you, even though you're not ultra skinny, you're too thin for what you're doing. Because you have a lot of toxins stored in the body and a tremendous amount of bile, which irritates the tissues everywhere. Do you know how brake fluid can irritate the skin?

Q: Yeah.

A: You've got that brake fluid kind of reaction internally. So you need to eat lots of milk for those minerals, the calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, to bind with it and neutralize it. Have carrot juice every other day in the afternoon, about five ounces, with four tablespoons of coconut cream, three tablespoons of dairy cream, two tablespoons of lemon juice, and two and a half tablespoons of honey. Now that will help get rid of the bile. Now you may turn very orange during this period. But when I've done skin scrapings, everybody thinks it's the carrot juice causing the orange. It's toxic bile that comes through the system. Because when I've done skin scrapings, it's predominantly bile rather than carotene.

Q: Normally my hands and feet get cold really easily.

A: Yeah, mineral deficiency there. And you could eat, let's say, about an inch by inch by inch section of cheese with about a tablespoon of honey. And that will help re-mineralize your body also. And sip on milk all day. You could be like one of those mechanics that have the cans of beers, and they have a tube coming down into their mouth, and you have milk doing that. Don't tell them it's milk. Get a different color tube so they can't see the color. They can't see it's milk. You have lots of lymphatic congestion. In areas, not in your groin area, in your legs.

Q: I get a lot of headaches.

A: And also, you've got a lot of lymphatic congestion in the left side of your brain. Most of your headaches are on the left side?

Q: Kind of more in the front of the head.

A: The center of the head?

Q: Yeah. More in the front of the head. Not really noticeable on the right or left.

A: Yeah, just swelling there. Shouldn't be getting headaches, must be salt. Salt causes 80% of all headaches. Do you eat salt?

Q: Not a lot. 

A: Doesn't take a lot.

Q: When we've been cooking, I use quite a bit of salt. Sea salt.

A: Doesn't make any difference. Salt is the worst thing you can do besides cooking your food.

Q: Okay, we're not going to be cooking.

[laughter]

A: I forgot to tell everybody about what salt does in the body. Salt is the worst explosive that we've ever had. They don't use it as an explosive because it's too volatile. It will explode with a four degrees temperature change. So it's four or five times more volatile than nitroglycerin. When you have isolated sodium, rock, the size of a softball is the equivalent of an atomic bomb. They've tried to use it and tried to use it. General Electric tried to use it. There were a lot of people who were very hurt by trying to use it. It caused a lot of damage. My father was responsible for rebuilding the rooms to do that. So salt is a very, very bad thing because even though it goes in a sodium iodide or a sodium potassium mixture, in table salt, the body fractionates and separates it. So you have all these little explosions going off in the bloodstream damaging red blood cells and white blood cells. White blood cells aren't as affected, but the red blood cells are.

Q: Because we've been gluten free for a while, he can act on like tortilla chips and potato chips and things like that.

A: Salt. They're your headaches. My father was just like you. I told him back in 19... well I was 27 years old, so he was 60, 65, no he wasn't that old. He was 57 years old. And I said, you know if you stop eating salt all your migraines will go away. And he suffered migraines his whole life that I knew him. Didn't pay any attention and then when he hit 67 he started having arrhythmia. And he went to one cardiologist that made sense and he said stop counting. That's how I told my father to deal with it. Don't worry about it. Don't worry about your erratic heartbeat. Just stop taking salt. My father stopped taking salt, he's never had a migraine since. And I told him 12 years before that. So he would have saved himself 12 years of headaches.

Q: So can you give livestock salt?

A: Not a good idea.

Q: What about...

A: Give them terramin clay. Let them lick terramin clay.

Q: Well I give my horse terramin clay.

A: There you go.

Q: I put some flaxseed oil with it so it's not... Is that not good? What's wrong with the flaxseed oil?

A: Do you want to demineralize an animal? That's the way to do it.

Q: What about pears? Can you have pears?

A: To a horse? Just remember that it over alkalinizes and gets high alcohol in their system. It starts demineralizing them.

Q: So apples either or carrots? 

A: If you give them one, carrots will be fine. It's a vegetable, it's not a fruit. But any horse that eats fruit will demineralize. Their knees will get weak, their backs will get weak. 

Q: So the cows should have terramin clay and not the... 

A: Not salt blocks.

Q: Because they smell these big chunks of the earth. The big crystal.

A: And your animals won't be as healthy. The milk won't be as healthy. They won't be as healthy.

Q: So no salt.

A: Clay. That's all they need. Clay. Well, the problem is you get people that intellectualize what's good for an animal instead of really... If you live with the animal and watch them and their behavior like... In Waipio Valley, I lived with those horses for several months. I watched their habits, I watched them eat. I watched their behavior change. Just for a minute. And they would go for the most fermented of the... of the fruits down there. And you'd watch them stumble around completely drunk. Drunk. Falling over. Stumbling on their feet. Collapsed stomachs. I mean huge. Bare belly stomachs. And just collapsed vertebrae. I mean, you know, the whole spinal cord was just sagging. Not a healthy animal. Try to ride one. You'd break its back. Meat-wise, like I said, more white meats, fish would be better. You have a lot of industrial solvents throughout your body that your bile has used to try to grasp it. You need lots of milk, you need lots of cream. Usually don't people tell me to eat of lots of cream. Even raw ice cream would be good for you to start absorbing it. Vegetable juice. You can just have the same thing as your wife. No problem. You could eat lots of cucumbers for your fruits for a while because the amount of damaged collagen that you have here from all this solvent reaction, even though your skin looks good and smooth, that's from the solvent reaction, but your skin is getting very thin in certain areas of your body, especially on the left side of your body, not as much on the right. So you must be letting some kind of brake fluid or some kind of solvents touch your left hand much more than your right.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It takes an herbivore, a vegetarian animal, to digest that hard cellulose. We don't need to complicate our digestion. If we were healthy, it wouldn't matter. So, I would say you need to eat some raw ice cream. So you get a Donvier, D-O-N-V-I-E-R, Donvier, it's French, ice cream maker. It's hand-cranked.

Q: How about vitamix?

A: Vitamixes are very toxic. Well sell it, because it goes at a very fast speed and oxidizes more than half of your nutrients.

Q: You know what, I had one of those, and I had been making all of my juices and everything in that, well, you know, putting the honey in with the juice. Then I got that osterizer, like you said to do, and I did it in that closed container. Totally different flavor to the food.

Q: I have an electric ice cream maker that just turns it.

A: The electromagnetic field damages, yeah. Electromagnetic field on those electric... Yeah, the Donvier hand-crank makes ice cream in half the time. Because you're not cranking it all the time. You crank it, let it sit for three minutes, crank it a few times again, both ways around, and then you do that for about a minute, and then you let it sit for three, four minutes again. And then that's all you have to do it. And then you've got ice cream in 20 minutes maximum.

Q: It's about 30 bucks.

A: Thirty-five. Thirty-five dollars.

Q: Yeah, so I'm ready to sell mine.

A: Yeah, sell it. Definitely, yeah, sell it. It'll go fast. Get something better. Cheap Osterizer blender, 40 bucks.

Q: I have one.

A: There you go. Just get a Cuisinart washer to work with. The washer with the Osterizer is too thin and too small, and it gets caught up in the blades too often and makes a mess. And also then you have rubber in your food. So don't tell them that you're going to use a Cuisinart washer on an Osterizer blender because it's illegal for them to sell it. It's like him selling a car part that belongs to one car and isn't fit for another car. That's what they think, but the Cuisinart washer is a perfect seal. The Cuisinart blender washer. So I would suggest that you eat a quart of ice cream two times a week. Raw ice cream.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, absolutely. I've got good recipes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: He has to have it.

Q: It will just take a while?

A: No. The mucus cleans the brain. He's a mechanic. He's around fumes all the time, starting cars. He's going to have that for his life.

Q: So that's normal.

A: That is a good thing. The mechanics who don't have that end up with throat cancer.

Q: Okay.

A: From breathing all of that exhaust. 

Q: Exhaust and dust.

A: And a mango-kiwi combination, or having a mango ice cream one time and a kiwi the next time, helps get rid of some of those industrial solvents.

Q: Kiwi and ice cream rather than just plain kiwi?

A: Kiwi by itself isn't going to do it, but kiwi with the cream. And also if you have the kiwi and mango together, it even works better.

Q: That sounds good.

A: Yeah, it is pretty good.

Q: Can I have that too?

[laughter]

A: You need to do a lot of eggs for a long time. A while. Just a while. Maybe once a month. Okay?

Q: You just sit there and eat your ice cream.

A: Go eat it in the garage.

[laughter]

A: Make everybody suffer. You'll get to the point where that egg is so delicious.

Q: I'll let you know when it happens.

A: Everybody does. I guarantee you after 15...

Q: You've got to do it.
