Location: Carlsbad, CA

A: So, as you can see, I've aged a lot in the last year and a half, for those who remember, because of those injections. Here are the scars from the injections. There's the holes, like these, that came out. It's like I got shot by bullets. Okay, and these. I'll put that down so you can see more of it. Okay. I've got two big ones here, right? Are those two here, or here?

Q: There's a big one there.

A: I don't know if you can see those. And this, I lost probably about three inches of arm that I never had to work out to have. And now, you can see that I've lost a lot of that muscle from this. When it first happened, this went down almost three and a half inches. So it got to be a real skinny arm. And a lot of the weight all around here trimmed off. Yeah, so I'm much smaller now. And I never want to work out, so I don't build it. I'm building up slowly. But I was much thinner. I was about probably 15 pounds lighter than I am right now. That process. And you can see, again, this side, too. All that muscle that's gone and the skin. But it was worse. Six months ago and seven months ago, it was four times this. So I'm building the muscle back again. And the skin is not as relaxed as it was.

Q: How much are you eating, Aajonus?

A: Well, I've got a problem. If I eat too much, I'll get diarrhea. And it's not from anything in particular. When I want to eat the things that I want to eat, like lots of butter, I don't digest them as well because there must be some liver damage from all of those injections. 

Q: He never looks skinny.

A: Yeah, I never looked skinny.

Q: When I first met you, you were like one of those guys.

A: Yeah, I was. This is a small shirt. And I used to wear mediums. Now they're huge. But I'll put it back on. I've already put on about 12 pounds of it already. It's just a slow process. And I feel it's getting near the end, almost all of it. The worst of it's over. I'm starting to gain more in the last probably six weeks. But then there was a problem with James supplying eggs that had mercury in it. Chickens that had arsenic in it. Because he was giving us eggs that were grown off commercial feed and commercial chickens. And the farmer, Sharon Palmer, actually went out and bought commercial chickens and commercial eggs. And sold them, or gave them to, or sold them to James, Rawesome Club as organic. No soy or anything in them. It was absolutely just commercial junk.

Q: How did you find that out?

A: Well, I just kept having problems with the change. One time it was salt in it. And another time the chicken was just really, really foul and not bad. You know, like very low-grade feed. So there was an inconsistency. And I know that doesn't happen on an organic farm. There's no inconsistency in quality. And the eggs were almost always uniformly sized and always chemically cleaned, washed. And our contract on the membership agreement with the farmer is that they have to be organic, no soy, and that the eggs are not to be washed. They may be wiped with a wet cloth, damp, but only water. And that's it. So none of this was like that. Every time I told James, James just said, Oh, you don't know what you're talking about, this is perfectly good. But you have to understand, he owns part of the farm. And he made $10,000 a month from it. And Sharon took another $10,000. So they were making a lot of money on taking this commercial stuff and selling it for a very high price. And then we were the consumers. So I got fed up with it. And in June, right after the raid, I said, Well, this is a good time to stir up everything, because everything's already stirred up. So I got a detective agency involved in it and had them watch the farm, interview certain old employees that they had, and the evidence was outstanding that the employees were actually fired. They were disgruntled because they kept telling her, wait a minute, you're selling this as organic at 12 Farmers Markets and to Rossum. And we know what you're buying. We know what you're doing. You have us cleaning the chickens and taking them out of the... and we've got pictures... taking them out of the companies, bagging and putting them into non-labeled bags and then giving them to us. Another reason we found out about that, I finally did something about it, was that when we started investigating, it started coming up about this one person who had written the district attorney up in that area saying that my little girl had lead poisoning. She's in a very serious state. And so we checked everything that goes into her. And everything we bought was from Rawesome for this period. And her mercury and arsenic levels started hitting the roof. 

So they tested the eggs and had the eggs tested and the chicken tested. The chicken came up high in arsenic and the eggs came up high in mercury. So we have that evidence too. So it's just outstanding and it's outrageous. James still denies it. He's in total denial about it. And we just have to go through legal means to settle it because there's a lot of angry people. I know that I've been working with people who are very chemically sensitive. And when you're eating chicken with arsenic in it and mercury, it made it very difficult. It's only been that difficult in the past two years that we've been getting those eggs and that chicken. And I was broken. Every time I came to L.A. and would eat those eggs, and I eat a lot of eggs. Anywhere from, let's say, 8 to 50 a day. And that's how much mercury I was consuming. And because they're commercial eggs, they're not good value. So I was getting these big sores all over my neck every time, a few days after I got here in L.A., every time. And I just thought, well, it's the better food that I'm here, I'm getting the best. And then when I found out from this report from the investigator, and then this one father with that little girl testing it, I realized what it was, so I stopped eating the eggs and the chicken, and all the breakout went away. Now I've returned to Los Angeles last Friday. I don't have that breakout. So it's a very, very bad thing that James Stewart did. Very bad thing. And he was told also, the ex-employees told him what she was doing. So he was told many times, and we have all this testimony in writing, signed. Yes?

Q: I'm kind of unfamiliar with this whole case. Like, you're [unintelligible].

A: Not anymore.

Q: Really?

A: They don't have it. Well, I tell everybody not to buy it. He's still carrying her eggs.

Q: Mothers?

A: No, no, I'm talking about Rawesome, I'm up in Venice. Mothers, you know, I don't trust any eggs from a store.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah. Because they only grow them in big houses. Maybe they're not in small cages.

Q: They look kind of clean. I'm going, yeah, these are raw, range-fed, you know, fertile eggs. I'm going, okay, these would be ones to buy, but apparently not.

A: Mostly they're grown with soy. And they'll say organic. Soy cannot be given to chickens raw. So they have to chemically treat it with a kerosene derivative and heat treat it. So any time a chicken is fed soy, it has to be processed. So all of the organic, now I've gone to, you know, like Rosie says, all organic. They feed their 75-80% soy. And I called them up and I said, you can't do that. Soy raw will kill a chicken, so you've had to have treated it. Yeah, but the soy was grown organically. I don't care, it's no longer organic when you're feeding it to the chickens. Well, the FDA lets us call it that way. That was their answer. This is Rosie, organic chicken. And let me tell you, I've been to about every chicken place around, and they all feed them the same garbage feeds. The only place I can find where they don't do that is in Amish and Mennonite farms. And where I get ours now, and I've been trying to get James to just get our Amish farmers, they supply everything else, give us their eggs and chickens too. Chickens are going to be tougher. They're eating organically, wild food. And what I do is I said, I don't want chickens to have a lot of grains, because chickens in the wild don't eat a lot of grains. They eat a lot of bugs, grasshoppers. They eat a lot of meat. They're scavengers. If they find a dead animal, they'll pick at the pieces and the bugs that are eating them. They love maggots. What I'd like you to do is get a pallet. After you butcher, throw all the remains on the pallet and let the chickens have whatever they want. And the chickens just feed on it every day. And these chickens, I don't know how many people have been around chickens. They peck each other. They're very annoyed with each other. They're not happy. Those chickens will walk around like cats and rub you up against the ankles and legs. When they feed them the way I want them to with the raw meats, the meat scraps and the maggots and stuff. And they also feed them some grains, some peas that are organically grown that they grow themselves. So they'll crush those up and then they take some grains that they grow and they'll soak it in whey. And the whey germinates it. So they're sprouted in whey.

So these chickens get these sprouted in whey grains, raw milk, and then all this meat. And they are the most beautiful chickens, lay the best eggs in the world. It's phenomenal. So you just can't get those. Your big markets, your big chicken houses, your people who make them and produce them for your big stores, they're all big marketing houses with very poor grade feed. None of it's organic.

Q: Even in the farmers market the guys that do have their local little farms.

A: They're feeding them regular feed. Pastured, but they're still getting regular garbage feed.

Q: Isn't that better?

A: It's probably a little better, yeah. But when you're feeding an animal soy that isn't supposed to eat soy, that has to be heat treated and chemically treated, how many of you would eat a peach that you've soaked in or even nuts that have been soaked in kerosene for 30 minutes, rinse it off, and eat it? Kerosene etches its way deep into the tissue in 30 minutes. It's like gasoline.

Q: So where are you buying the eggs from?

A: Right now, none. I'm making deals with the farmers in the Amish territory right now.

Q: What area? Texas or Ohio?

A: No, mainly Ohio, Pennsylvania.

Q: Amos or other people?

A: Amos and other people. He is already full. I've got him stretched.

Q: Are there other names you can give us that we can order?

A: Well, not right now. I'm still trying to set up. There's no big chicken farmer in the Amish right now, so I'm trying to establish one.

Q: What about the process of fodder feeding, doing the sprouts for the chickens?

A: Well, you can't feed just sprouts to a chicken. It'll kill the chicken. If you feed only sprouts to a bird, it will kill a bird in about 12 days. There are three enzymes that act like phytic acid. In any kind of grain and nut, you have phytic acid, which prevents mineral absorption, which prevents protein absorption, which prevents fat absorption. So it's a whole chain reaction. So they sprout or germinate grains to alter that phytic acid. However, when you alter that, you've got three other enzymes that are produced in vegetation state, which do exactly the same thing as phytic acid. So here you have three times the amount of that ingredient. However, if you germinate in milk, the lactic acids in the milk destroy those enzymes. Of course, the sprout will never mature into an adult plant, but it breaks it down so the chickens can eat it with no problem, and the pigs can eat it, any animal can eat it.

Q: So before sprouting it, you're just soaking it in milk?

A: You cause it to be sprouted in the milk. You take dry grain and you put it in milk.

Q: So with that being said, right now you don't want chicken, you don't want eggs?

A: I'm not eating any chicken or eggs. I'm just sticking with beef and fish.

Q: Do you eat the eggs? Does every egg have mercury?

A: No, it's a certain one. They're using mercury to feed the chickens for laying eggs as an antibiotic. And in adult chickens for meat, they're using arsenic instead of antibiotics.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh yeah, well that's mainly with the mercury.

Q: Can you say that all the other eggs are contaminated with the soy? And what does that do to us? [unintelligible]

A: Well, I don't know how much soy is in it. We have photographs of the feed packages, but there's been so much going on that I haven't been able to go to the store and see. But anyway, I will because I know we've got a photograph of the feed they were giving. So I have to investigate that. But with the mercury and the arsenic alone, that pulls a lot of our nutrients out of the system. Now, in my eyes, I had a great deal of changes from the injections. All this metal accumulated in my intestinal tract in iridology. So you could see the patterns all throughout the intestinal tract of the additional metal. And after eating all of these eggs, there's no way I can tell arsenic except as a green, radiant compound in the iris. Obviously, I didn't absorb a lot of that, but the mercury was coming out. And when I had the hair analysis done here and the hair analysis done on my head, after the injections, all of those were high. So on me, I can't tell how much is those injections and how much are the eggs. I have to look at my patients who had no other exposure like that little girl. All of a sudden, they're arsenic... They just started feeding her all Rawesome foods.

Q: For how long was she on the diet, the little girl?

A: The father didn't tell me, or he said it, but I don't remember.

Q: And is she better now?

A: She had severe lead poisoning and almost died from the school that she went to. So then they had to put her on a special diet, make sure it was as pure as possible, so her body could clean out the lead. And then all of a sudden, they always kept tabs on her, always checked her blood to see what the levels were. And then the arsenic and mercury started elevating considerably. And the only exposure she had was Rawesome food. So he checked the eggs and the meat first, because they'd, of course, be the highest in mercury, not the fruits and other, you know, not the dairy. So sure enough, that's where he found it, in the eggs and the chicken.

Q: Can you eat chicken from Rocky's?

A: Rocky Jr., there's still 25 to 30 percent soy, but, you know, the rest is corn. Now a lot of it's genetically modified, GMO corn. So the tests that are coming out now and the scientific reports on GMO products is terrifying, very terrifying. They'll kill animals in a very short period of time, give them all kinds of disease and deformity. 

Q: [unintelligible] right now?

A: Yeah, I'm not eating chicken and I'm not eating eggs right now.

Q: Fish and beef?

A: Fish and beef, yeah.

Q: What do you think about bison?

A: Bison's great, but if you get it from Northstar Bison, you have to make sure you're not buying a female, because she vaccinates the female.

Q: Green range?

A: I don't know green range.

Q: They're sold at Costco.

A: Pardon?

Q: You get it at Costco.

A: Oh, I don't know.

Q: They don't have any antibiotics.

A: No deworming? See, that's what you have to find out. You have to find all the stuff that's usually dewormed.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Fish and beef?

A: Fish and beef.

Q: Any eggs, really any eggs, from the Amish?

A: Right. Unless you can find a farmer that's just doing, you know, wild stuff and not feeding them a feed, giving them a commercial feed. And I don't know any that do that.

Q: They always put some kind of feed, even the ones that are [unintelligible].

A: Yep, and they won't produce eggs.

Q: But they have to be better than, sometimes.

A: Yeah, it has to be better than commercially, yeah.

Q: You mentioned the breakouts. My son, I give him raw milk, he sometimes breaks out little rashes on his face, sometimes he gets a rash.

A: Is he drinking it cold, or warm?

Q: Warm enough.

A: You always warm it?

Q: Usually, usually I put it under hot water and let it soak and warm it.

A: And what did you feed him before?

Q: You know, right when he wakes up.

A: No, when did you start feeding him the raw?

Q: Probably about 11 months now, probably about 11 or 12 months.

A: Okay, so 11 or 12 months you started feeding him. So what did you feed him when he was younger? Regular formula?

Q: Just organic milk or formula to start. Then he'll get off that and go to organic milk.

A: So pasteurized homogenized.

Q: Pretty much, yeah.

A: He's got an old lactate, toxic lactate. Cauterized lactate and probably cauterized casein. And that'll cause rashes. Now we're supposed to discard 90% of our toxins through the skin. So if it goes out through the bowels, it causes diarrhea. If it comes up vomit, of course, it's coming out the stomach. That's not a good place for it to go because it damages bacteria and it damages the environment in the intestine. 80% to 90% of digestion is supposed to be bacterial. Only 10% to 20% is enzymatic, digestive juices. And those digestive juices, like the hydrochloric acid, which is our main one, is to break down larger particles of food into smaller particles of food for the bacteria to infiltrate those molecules and eat them. Their waste is our food. So we basically live on a diet of shit and piss from bacteria. Now when you think about that, you look at the medical profession and you say, what is all this bacteriophobia? What is all that about? It's all about hiding the real culprits of disease, which is industrial pollution.

Q: Do you have an opinion on colostrum? [unintelligible]

A: Colostrum is the first three to five days after a calf is born. The cow produces a mainly buttery milk. Cream is very difficult to digest. So if you gave a calf that was only one to five days old, that calf would have constant diarrhea if you fed him whole milk with the cream. So the cow mother makes a butter milk, basically. So that's why colostrum is so yellow. The cream is already broken down into a buttery substance.

Q: I looked through your book and I didn't really see that mentioned as one of the [unintelligible].

A: It wasn't something that people could get. Now they can get it. When I wrote my book, it wasn't available.

Q: What do you think?

A: It's wonderful. I will buy it every time I get a chance. I will drink it every time I get a chance.

Q: Someone that doesn't have access to getting raw butter for the moisturizing/lubrication formula, if they had pasteurized butter from the supermarket, does that that hold any nutritional value?

A: It might be better than processed vegetable oil, but it certainly is not the equivalent of butter. Raw, unsalted butter. Even freezing butter is a problem. Sally Fallon and all those say, oh, freeze this, freeze that. But when I took a group of animals and divided them into two, I gave them frozen meat. It was the same carcass, the same animal, the same side of beef. I gave half of them unfrozen, the other frozen. All the ones that had the frozen meat all got a skin disorder within six weeks. One of them had it so bad it looked like he had the mange. And this is both cats and dogs. Every one of them had a skin disorder. Those that ate the unfrozen, same meat, unfrozen, calm, relaxed, no itching, happy, not a problem. And I didn't even feed them water in that time. All they got for that whole time was just the meat. The ones that got the frozen meat dehydrated. They had all these skin problems. And then I decided, well, I can test the butter now. So I took the ones with all the ill conditions, skin conditions. I knew the butter would reverse that. Raw butter would reverse any kind of skin condition. Because it would get in there and handle the poisons that were being passed through the skin. And protect the cells that were there and not get dried out. So I took the same batch of butter. And I froze half of it and didn't freeze the other half. And just refrigerated one half. Now, before I served it to them, of course, I would always let that out for about 12 hours to get room temperature. Because dogs and cats don't like cold things. They just don't like it. So I put it out for them. They ate it. And the ones who got the non-frozen butter healed five times quicker than the ones who got the frozen butter. So the frozen butter is five times less potent than non-frozen butter. 

Q: So a happy medium would be, say, a colostrum if you can't get the raw butter.

A: Raw colostrum would be very helpful, yes. Or you can just get the cream and make your own butter. I tell you how to do that in the recipe book. Make your own butter. It's easy, the way I suggested in the book.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: When you can make it that simply, it isn't.

Q: I got the book, I got the book.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Not in that way. When you have it in that formula, the liver, the bile that the liver produces is very easy to break that down because the lemon helps pre-digest it partially. And you have all the proteins in the egg white, which helps digest the fat, the butter. When you don't have that combination, you have to eat the butter with meat or something like that. However, digestion of meat takes 19 to 24 hours. Digestion of milk is 6 to 10 hours. Digestion of a raw egg by itself is only 27 to 30 minutes. That's why in my recipe book I mention the woman who had emphysema. And her doctor called me on a Thursday night and said, I've got a woman who was diagnosed with emphysema seven years ago. She's been bedridden for most of the past two years. And she's been on machines for most of that two years. And she's going to die this weekend. Is there anything I can do? I said, well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? She says, I'm an M.D., and there's no way... The law is that I cannot recommend anything to any alternative other than the standard medical procedures, which are written by the pharmaceutical industry, by the way. All medical procedure books are written by the pharmaceutical industry. Merck's is about this thick. And she said, without ten years of failure with medical therapies, I cannot suggest anything alternative, unless you're on a deathbed. She's on a deathbed, now I can. That is the law. So you know, any time you go to a doctor, a licensed M.D., the only thing he can suggest for you is what the pharmaceutical houses suggest for you. That's it. So I said, well, that's your conscience. All I can do is say, get as many dozen eggs as you can, 10 to 15, put them on her bed table, and have her eat as many as she can, and there's no limit. So this is a Thursday night. Now it was 9.30 my time, so she was in Maine or Massachusetts, so it must have been 1.30 in the morning. This is a woman who cared, was just stuck in the medical profession. So I got a call on Monday morning. If this doctor had it all together, probably wouldn't have gotten the eggs to her before late Friday night or early Saturday morning. So Monday morning I get a call from this raspy-voiced woman saying, it worked, I'm out of bed, what else should I do? I said, well, who are you? And she said, well, my doctor called and you told her that I should eat as many raw eggs as possible. So I did that and I'm out of bed and off the machines, what else do you want me to do?

I said, well, how many eggs did you have to eat to do that? She said, 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday. And I'm off the machines and out of bed. The point of that story is eggs digest so quickly, take very little of the body's energy and digestion. So the body has all that energy and all those wonderful nutrients, the liquid protein already, the liquefied fat, which only doesn't take any enzymes, only the bacteria has to invade it and eat it quickly. In 27 minutes, it's absorbed and into your body working. That is the only food that you can give people who are in that critical condition to pull them through. And it worked, 66 eggs. Only 66 eggs and she was out of bed and off the machine after two years of living that way. Isn't there something terribly wrong with the medical industry? Kept her suffering in bed and crippled for two years and suffering for seven years altogether? And I got a call from her six months later. I said, well, what you can do, you stay on the eggs, you eat as many, you eat 30 a day for a year and a half and you can add raw dairy a little bit at a time, maybe a quarter of a cup, three weeks later another ounce, so you have three ounces, four ounces. Every few months you can increase it and you can increase, eat some fish, some raw beef, some raw meats, and just increase your diet that way. I got a call from her a year later and I didn't even realize it was her voice. It's almost a normal voice, hardly any raspiness at all and very strong.

Q: You mentioned that there's a whole range of diseases people have, liver, cancer, multiple sclerosis. Are the eggs something you can actually apply to all these diseases?

A: Absolutely every one. Especially Crohn's for these people who have digestive problems. You have to give them a break in their digestion. I always tell people who eat lots of eggs that they have access to good eggs. You've got to go out there and make it happen.

Q: How do you do that?

A: Start a farm. There you go. You go talk to some farmers and say, hey, this is what we need. We've got a lot of people who are interested.

Q: Previously you mentioned Weston Price and his research. He only found five diseases among the native population. Can you go over quickly what those five diseases were and maybe what cooked foods were causing those five diseases?

A: Well, it wasn't just Weston Price. There were other researchers who went to those tribes. I don't think Western Price went to New Guinea, did he? Anyway, they studied the tribes in New Guinea because they were mainly meat eaters. They didn't eat anything but meat. They were mainly researchers of cardiology. There were archaeologists and anthropologists who also had an interest in cardiac problems. So they went to these tribes who ate only cooked meat. That was their whole diet. They didn't eat vegetables, nothing. Just cooked meat was all they ate. And they did even eat humans. And usually it was a tribe they didn't like. They would snatch one of their out hunting or something, grab them and cook them and eat them. So they found that there were only five diseases and they were gout, osteoporosis to an extent, arthritis and rheumatism. And... I forgot the other one. Anyway, there was no heart disease, no arteriosclerosis, nothing. So you get arteriosclerosis and liver hardening and hardening of the heart from vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetables which are plastic. They crystallize in the human body. So hardened cells that are made with that oil will crystallize and harden. So it is exactly the opposite. And like I tell everybody, whatever you hear from the media, whatever you hear from the pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry, 90 times out of 100, if you do the exact opposite, you'll be doing it correctly.

Q: So cirrhosis of the liver, a good friend of mine has cirrhosis of the liver from drinking, I think 20 or 30 years ago. He got cirrhosis of the liver and he said, well, it's because of his drinking. So what you'd say is that hydrogenated oils could have affected his liver that way?

A: Absolutely.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If we hadn't grown up in a polluted society, you have to understand, these people are in the jungle, their fire is the only pollution they have.

Q: We're starting with ten strikes against us.

A: A thousand strikes against us. Sixty thousand chemicals strikes against us.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They put MSG in. The FDA approved five or six viruses to spray on meats to destroy bacteria. That was just done two years ago, or a year and a half ago. And they allow you to put ammonia, Clorox, on any counter and not clean it off completely so your meats get cut on that. They put ammonia in the meat too.

Q: I don't think people are aware of that.

A: Most people are asleep about all that because your media doesn't cover it. The only way you're going to know is research it yourself. The FDA is owned by those pharmaceutical and the food industry. 

Q: So when you buy fish from the fish market, I can always smell the Clorox after. [unintelligible] Do you wash the fish, wash the meat?

A: No, what I tell them to do is get out a fresh cut. I want you to wash that board off completely, only with water. And I want to see you slice it with a clean water, clean knife only, and dry. I make them cut it all myself. I make them cut it right in front of me.

Q: Oh, you mean a fresh fish?

A: That's right.

Q: Oh, not one that's in the tray.

A: In the tray.

Q: Catalina Co-op down by Seaworld, you can go into their stock room, watch them take it right off the rack and cut it in front of you. Fresh, good fresh stuff. 

A: Comes right off the boat for them too.

Q: Scallops, scallops, 5-50 a pound.

A: Instead of 19 a pound?

Q: You can go there. A lot of local fish. Stock up. 

A: Because they get it directly from the boat, there's not 3 or 5 distributors in between.

Q: If you buy a bunch of tuna off the boat, how long could you keep it in the refrigerator? Do you have to eat it right away or how long would it hold up?

A: I've kept it up to a year and three months. You haven't seen Ripley's Believe It or Not?

Q: No, I have not. I missed that one. A year and three months?

A: I've had it up to a year and three months.

Q: I thought that was just the meat. Fish. 

Q: Oh, it's fish?

A: No, I had glands. I had jars all along my porch, remember, on that shot? I went by and I had everything. I had glands, I had organs.

Q: Was it refrigerated?

A: No. I wanted it to decay and rot, but that's a whole other subject.

Q: I've read about that.

A: It's all predigested. It's like your bacteria does inside your body. It's just like kefir and yogurt. You're letting the bacteria break it down before you eat it. So it's very easily absorbable.

Q: I understand, but in terms of baby steps, if I wanted to eat meat...

A: Look at this guy!

Q: In terms of baby steps, in terms of diet, how long can it stay in a refrigerator, almost indefinitely?

A: I've never let it go more than a year and three months, so I can't tell you indefinitely.

Q: But would it get slimy in its smell?

A: That's the best part. If you cut your gut open, that's how it would smell in your gut.

Q: [unintelligible] I can't breathe on anybody.

Q: No more roommates!

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They only eat meat. Except berries, really, some berries in the summer. Hold on, we can only have one person at a time. So, anyway, the normal process is I go around and ask each person a question. So now that we've finished my siloquy here, then we'll go around.

Q: Are there any ways to keep things like with olive oil?

A: Yes, right before 2000, a friend of mine hunted a deer. So I butchered it and cut up all the pieces and the glands and everything. And I got 38 pounds of it, and he got 40 pounds of it. And we downed the glands right away. I was high for three days. And really, I didn't sleep. I was very tired. I had given a workshop on Saturday and seen patients for two days in Nevada City. And then just as I was about to leave, I'd go pick my girlfriend up at Nevada Airport. So I had a good drive. I was going to take a nap. So he shoots this deer. So nobody knows how to butcher the thing, so I had to butcher it. So that took three hours to skin it and butcher the whole thing. Get it all into cuts to be able to package. So I spent that whole three hours doing that. Took the glands, threw it in a big blender with milk and blended it all together. We all drank it all right there. And I think they had a little bit left, and I took a cup of it. And they kept a couple of cups of it. And I went to pick up my girlfriend. I was not tired. I was wide awake. We had sex for five hours. The next day she was tired. I wasn't tired. So I gave her half a cup of the glands, and I had another half. And we basically didn't sleep for two days and had lots of sex. And we went out and visited, do you know what that salt lake was called? There's a bunch of lakes, and I thought they were freshwater lakes. Pyramid Lake. Go out to Pyramid Lake, and I'm expecting fresh water. I dive in, and it's salt water. I almost died. And this was winter, too. Anyway, I had him ship the meat for me back to Malibu. So I packed all the meat up. I dried it a little bit on either side for about three, four hours on either side.

Q: Sun-dried?

A: Slices.

Q: Sun-dried?

A: No, in the house. There was no sun those days that I was doing it. I would have just left that in the sun for maybe 20, 30 minutes on either side. The meat, yeah. And I cut it in slices about a half-inch thick, maybe three-quarters of an inch thick. And then I stuffed them in quart and half-gallon jars. And first I put either peanut oil. At that time, we could get a completely raw peanut oil, never heated over 104 degrees. But it's so expensive to make. They had such a demand for it that they just go for the cheap stuff now. So they don't produce it anymore. But I put about a cup in the bottom, three-quarters to a cup of the oil in the bottom, and then stuffed the meat around. And, of course, the oil would come up and coat the meat. And then I would put more in as I stuffed more of the meat in until it was not a lot of oil, but just so it covered the surface of all the meat. And then up to the top, about a half-inch above the meat level. And I didn't put anything. Usually, you'd put a beeswax sealer on the top of that. And that's normally how you do it to keep any gases or anything from any oxidation of it. But I just put the lids on it. I wanted to see what happened with just the oil, without beeswax. And I just opened the last one in December, last December, and it was 10 years old. And it was perfectly good.

Q: Do you think you can use olive oil?

A: Yeah, you can use olive oil, but it's still... You have to understand, olive oil is a very acidic compound. And when you eat it, it kind of like burns when it's that old. Kind of like burns. Well, when it's soaked in the meat, it even burns more. It's like cod liver oil. You know how potent and burned that is? It was like that, but it was... I didn't eat the olive oil, except as it was on the meat. And I took the meat and scraped off a bit of it, but I ate the meat. But it had the peanut oil, and it had the olive oil in it. But it didn't stink. I mean, it didn't stink badly.

Q: Did coconut oil work?

A: Coconut oil ferments. It doesn't work the same.

Q: And that was kept at room temperature?

A: Room temperature, yep.

Q: And you can't...

A: In a cupboard.

Q: So you're saying you can't get the peanut oil, so is there any other alternative oil than you would suggest?

A: Just the olive oil is it. But there was a scientist that... Vilhjalmur Stefansson talked about who put raw meat in buttermilk and kept it for ten years.

Q: Raw buttermilk.

A: Raw buttermilk, yeah. So...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Then you've got beef jerky. Then you have no active enzymes in it. So it's not really digestible. The Eskimos, when they would make their pemmican every year, which pemmican is they take meat, lay it out, dry it out until it's really hard, then they would pound it into a powder and then take whale or seal blubber or whatever fat they can get, get it in the sun until it melted, put it with the powdered meat, and then let it soak in and make hard blocks of it. And each one would make a 90-pound block every year to get them through the winter in case they didn't get a fish or an animal to eat. But if they didn't eat any of it or whatever they didn't eat by spring, they buried it when needed because it's an inferior food.Even though it's not cooked, it's dehydrated. If I dehydrate you to death, how much work are you going to do for me? You can't bring it back to life. So they just bury it. So anything that's completely dried is a survival food, but it's not a vibrant health-giving food. Do you have a question, Lisa? Oh, thank Lisa for being our host today.

[applause]

Q: I want to go back to the egg thing, because even like this lady that ate 33 eggs, or other eggs, I haven't been eating much eggs. I still feel better when I eat them. And if I eat.. I don't feel good, or I just can't eat, [unintelligible] it's like a survival food, so since I've already been eating them, and I've lost my stock, I don't feel good. So is the risk just going to continue?

A: Well, I would just get the best you can.

Q: And that's, how do you get people to call the person?

A: You have to call them and ask how much soy is in their feed.

Q: But it's pretty much going to be in there, it's already been eating that stuff.

A: Yeah, it's like Rocky Jr. is the best chicken. If I had to eat chicken, I would eat Rocky Jr. as I did before. It's only 25-35% soy. Rosie is 85% soy.

Q: Do you know what Henry's chicken is?

A: Not now, I knew back then. But who knows, you have to call them every year and see if they've changed.

Q: If you feel better on the eggs, what's been your side effect of soy and GMOs? What do GMOs cause? Cancer?

A: No, they cause deformities, they cause hormonal imbalances, they cause severe allergies. In some laboratory animals, they kill them within a third of their normal life.

Q: It's like I'm feeling better, but maybe I'm getting worse. At what point...

A: It's like vitamin supplements, they can make you feel better, but in the long run they're going to knock you down.

Q: So that's why you're just going to wait it out? [unintelligible]

A: You just have to use coconut cream and dairy cream until you get the eggs. Not the same, but we have to do the best we can.

Q: How long did you go without it?

A: I've gone as long as six weeks without eggs in the past. I've been already talking with the Amish farmers as recently as five days ago. They said they can get it together in two to three weeks.

Q: And then ship it to the rest of them?

A: Ship it to us.

Q: And they should get us an order on the phone?

A: I'm going to bring it into LA. I'm going to have it shipped to LA and then we can distribute it from there. You just have to have somebody come up and get it or somebody would have to bring it down here.

Q: And there's enough to supply?

A: We'll have chickens and we'll have eggs.

Q: And there's enough to supply?

A: There will be. Right now they can supply us only with about probably 30 dozen a week, eggs, and maybe 20 chickens a week. That's all they can supply. And I said, I need 200 dozen a week and I need 60 chickens a week. So he's going to go to his family of Amish farmers and get their chickens from them so they can have it all in one place and control the quality the way I want it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, you can. Yeah. You can throw your meat, your scrap meat out. Of course, you've got dogs to feed the same way.

Q: Yeah, so I don't know if they're on their own. The coyotes can be able to take them. At some point, you know.

A: Coyotes can't get over the wall.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Really? Oh, yeah.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, they can lay two each a day, except in very cold times, they'll only lay one.

Q: You need a rooster. [unintelligible] don't like roosters.

Q: Yeah, well, I don't want a rooster.

Q: You need a rooster.

A: Well, if you want them fertile, but you don't need them fertile. The reason I put fertilized in the book was because you knew that if they were getting screwed, they were all running around and not just in a cage this small.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I tried it up there in Malibu, but the first week, you know, the coyotes had eaten all but two.

Q: So you did put them in a cage?

A. Yeah, I had a cage, but they broke into the cage. One even went through my, I had a screen door like that. One came right through, had a chicken on the screen. And I was right there in the room.

Q: Instead of the coyotes, the raccoons would get it.

Q: Possums, we have possums too.

Q: Yeah, possums too. All three of them.

A: No, the small dogs are good.

Q: You need a Scottish Terrier.

A: Small dogs are real good, keep the coyotes away.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah, they make noise. Coyotes are annoyed by little dogs and their noise.

Q: I've heard that quail are more prolific layers.

A: Yeah, but you have to have so many quails.

Q: They're small.

A: Yeah, they're small.

Q: You only have to have five. There was a family that had 20 members in this family and they had five little quails.

A: Yeah, but they only had two per meal. Two eggs a day. How many can five produce? Ten eggs.

Q: Can you tell, like I've got three different egg cartons of Trader Joe's. And I wondered if you could, like if you cracked one of them, could you tell if there's soy in it or could you tell if there's [unintelligible]?

A: I can usually taste and smell it in the yolk and in the egg white. Well, those that are fed corn, of course, they're yellower naturally, almost orange. But if it's GMO corn, it leaves a bad aftertaste for me.

Q: So they can still be orangey, but they'll be fed, have you fed, GMO corn?

A: Yes.

Q: I always thought it was the color that really was a big deal, the more orange they are.

A: No, that just tells you whether they're given grain, straight grain or soy, or they're given good, rich corn.

Q: If they're eating grass and bugs, they get more of an orangey.

A: Yes, that too. Bugs especially and meat, and then they'll get very orange.

Q: How long can you go, how high can an egg get? How many months, how long can you...

A: The Chinese keep eggs for 25 years, called the century eggs.

Q: What would you suggest?

A: They really start to go black. That's when they sell them.

Q: What's the purpose of buying them?

A: No, it's completely predigested. That's what you get the most.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, the bacteria, their waste is our food. So there's nothing but waste left after 25 years. That's why octogenarians in China will pay $1,000 for one of those eggs. They can have sex for, you know, it's like Viagra. They'll be high for 28 days, 30 days. One egg.

Q: One egg is going to be like Viagra?

A: Yeah. When it's a very, it's a 25-year-old egg. It's either completely white inside or completely black inside. And it's all powdered.

Q: You know, with the commercial nature of our society and how Viagra is called, I can't imagine someone hasn't went with a 25-year-old egg.

A: You know, nobody's going to pay $1,000 for an egg except a Chinese man.

Q: Well, if you've got somebody who's 80 years old and all of a sudden he's got sexual prowess at that age, you know, I'm sure there's enough old wealthy guys walking around Palm Springs. I mean, they'd be paying $1,000 for thinking about it.

A: Yeah, they aren't appetizing either for the main regular palate.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, eat them!

Q: And if it gives you diarrhea, what does that mean?

A: They also refrigerate eggs because they lose their bacteria.

Q: So you should be taking eggs out all the time?

A: All the time, never refrigerate them.

Q: What are your thoughts? [unintelligible]

A: If you change the subject then I've got to go around and get to you. Joe, do you have a question?

Q: Can we still trust the bison from Rawesome that they're not vaccinated?

A: They definitely, Mary Gracie, who owns Northstar Bison, who we get the buffalo from, assures us that we never get a vaccinated female or a dewormed.

Q: So that would be our best source for beef, right?

A: I would suggest that you never eat any of the bison that's from the neck up. Because when they deworm them, they put those right along the spinal cord, which creates CJD. That's mad cow disease, disintegrates the spinal cord and brain.

Q: Well, the normal beef wouldn't be from the neck up.

A: No, correct.

Q: As long as you don't get brain or something like that, right?

A: I wouldn't get a brain from one of those. I get brains from Amos. It's usually pig's brain or calf's brain.

Q: Does any of the meat come from Amos? None of it does, right?

A: A lot of it comes from Amos.

Q: You can order meat from Amos.

A: The lamb, the pork.

Q: But not beef?

A: There may be some there. You just have to check by week and see what's available.

Q: Okay.

A: Because Amos freezes a lot of his meat once it's butchered. So we only accept meat from him when he just butchers it and it's non-frozen.

Q: So we could get lamb and pork? That would be good?

A: Lamb and pork. I eat it all the time.

Q: What cuts do you get on this?

A: Oh, did everybody know I got banned from, I'm not allowed to go to Rawesome? If James wasn't part owner of the lot, I could say, James, and I'd go to my notice. I said, you have no authority because I'm the one who runs Rawesome Clubs and all the other clubs under the right to choose healthy food. If you read the contract, I'm it. You cannot ban me from the member's club. I am the main member. I said, but it is your lot. You own it. You can ban me from the lot. But he tried to ban all the members who were involved in helping me get all the evidence. What does that tell you?

Q: He's guilty?

A: Yeah. So I told him he cannot ban these people if he wants to restrict them from going to the property and he can't revoke their membership because he's not in charge of the membership. I am. So he has to deliver the food for them to pick up from.

Q: Really? Wow.

A: So I told him that. We'll see how he honors it, but I sent it to his attorney too. This guy is way out to lunch, way out to lunch. Okay, so you have a question?

Q: US wellness meats?

A: Great. John [https://grasslandbeef.com/] is very good. It took me two years to get him to good quality and not freeze it. Yeah.

Q: So you still buy the cheese and everything else from Rawesome?

A: I get everything from Rawesome but the chicken and the eggs.

Q: Who gets it for you?

A: Well, I went there last Wednesday and just freaked everybody out. I mean, James, I walked in, James shot out, just walked out. So then I got the letter from his attorney.

[audio cut]

Q: Ibraham acted really strange the other day when he delivered to us. He was as quiet as can be and he's not normally like that.

A: Well, he doesn't want anybody attacking him about that.

Q: Yeah, his mouth was closed up.

A: He wasn't expecting people to talk about the issue.

Q: It was really funny.

A: He was apprehensive what he was going to tell people.

Q: Can anybody start another club?

A: We already have one already almost. They bought the refrigerators. We're just trying to line up the farmers to ship them stuff. And that one should be open in two weeks. That will be in Tujunga. And then there's another one that should open up in Echo Park within a month and a half. Ra healthy foods. R-A-R-A, like the sun god Ra. Ra healthy foods. [Note: Ra Healthy Foods turned out to be the one co-op serving southern California with its headquarters in Tujunga. rahealthyfoods.com informs that store is closed but says to go to https://farmmatch.com/rahealthyfoods/locations and provides a number if any difficulties – 626-644-6863] Yeah, there will be a website. They're working it out right now. Should be up in a week. I don't know. Depends upon how much. Tujunga is in the valley. That's on the other side of Los Angeles.

Q: Echo then?

A: Echo Park is closer. Just left of downtown. There will be two that open up. I really don't know... The building and safety, I don't think they're going to give James a permit for any of those buildings on there. He didn't do it ahead of time. He'll get closed down. He's got to move it somewhere else. That's what I told him. The attorney told him at first. A land developer. Move it. Get it into Santa Monica where we're not going to be hassled.

Q: Would we be able to have one here?

A: Sure, you could have one here.

Q: We already have one. Why not?

Q: What do you have here?

Q: Co-op.

A: They get it from Rawesome. Once every two weeks is it?

Q: Yeah, but once they close...

Q: Well, that's where we're ordering directly from Amos.

A: Well, what we can do is we just order...

Q: No, not from Amos.

A: We order... What you do is order what you need and come on the same truck. Then somebody has to go up to get it.

Q: Yeah, but I'm saying if I had that, couldn't we just have one house here somewhere?

A: I know. What I'm saying is the same truck.

Q: Oh.

A: The same truck.

Q: Stop off here.

A: No, not stop off here. You have to go to L.A. He won't come here.

Q: You just get the whole bulk order to send to L.A.?

A: Even for Rawesome. They have to go downtown and pick up all that food. It doesn't get delivered to Rawesome in Venice. They have to go downtown and at a certain distribution warehouse to unpack it, to unload it and put it on their trucks, and then take it from downtown to here. You would have to do the same thing with a van or something.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You have to work it out through whoever is working it there. It's James... John Reed. John Reed will be running that one. You just send him your order or fax it or whatever. He won't have to do much work. You'll just have to meet them when it comes in.

Q: Oh, wow.

A: That way you won't have that higher markup.

Q: You'd meet them up there?

A: Meet them up in Los Angeles downtown.

Q: Hire somebody to kind of organize that.

A: Yeah, right. So you're going to have to transfer it onto a truck to bring it down here, and that's going to cost you a bloody fortune. You're talking about food. It has to stay refrigerated. It's got to be handled in a certain way.

Q: There's not enough demand down here.

A: No.

Q: The demand is so small.

Q: Yeah, we only order maybe 1,000.

Q: We're lucky if we get $1200.

A: I spend $300, $350 a week just for my own food.

Q: Joe's half of that order. He orders $500, $600.

Q: I know, but that's how things get started. Rawesome didn't start out that way.

A: We're in a garage just selling the raw milk. That we bootlegged in.

Q: Tell them about it.

A: Do you have a question? No? Ray, do you have a question?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, as long as you're on a good diet. I've had many people do laser surgery. They heal three times faster than the average. They can go out in the sun in ten days. Their eyes are completely healed in ten days. So, it's not a problem. And they never use the antibiotics. I tell them not to tell the doctor they're not going to use the antibiotics. Accept the antibiotics, but do not put them in your eyes and do not take them. Because that destroys the bacteria that can lead to keloiding of the tissue. You have to understand that about 90% of the people who have Lasik surgery have difficulty. And that's because they're using antibiotics. The eye doesn't heal properly. So, I don't mind if you use Lasik surgery. It's going to take a long time to readjust. Because what happens is your cornea warps. Whether it flattens or extends. That depends whether you have nearsightedness or farsightedness. The cornea is warping. To be on this diet long enough and put enough egg white in your eye every day and sometimes a tiny bit of butter with a drop of pineapple juice in it to rework the cornea will take years. So, with laser surgery, you can go on that. If you're on a good diet, you're going to heal properly. The first people that I suggested to go out to school, I had a good idea. I don't foresee any harm in it. Nikki Ing, a Chinese lady, she did it when she was about 37. And that was in 1994. And Louis Cangemi did it in about 1992. Maybe it was earlier than that. Maybe he did it in 1989. This is 1989. And their eyes are still in great condition. Haven't had to wear glasses anymore. And that whole time, no wearing glasses anymore. No wearing contacts.

Q: How do you do the butter? I tried to put some in a very thin film.

A: You have to get the butter liquid. So it has to be warm enough. Either in your hand or in a jar that's immersed in a tiny bit of hot water. It has to get it completely wet. Then you just take a little piece of pineapple and you squeeze one drop into it. Into like a teaspoon of butter. And you mix that around while it's warm and then you just tap it. On your little finger, bottom, you hold your eye down, your eyelid down, your lower one. You look up and you rub it along the white of the eye. And then you just roll it around so it gets everywhere. And you wait two, three minutes. The cloud goes away and that nutrifies the eye. And with egg white, it only takes a minute to absorb the egg white. Protein.

Q: When I take my contacts out, I will just put in the egg white before bed. And then I noticed, I sleep throughout the night and my eyes are shut from...

A: From the drying of the egg white. Right.

Q: Actually, they feel better.

A: Oh, they're so much better, yeah.

Q: Is the contact lens solution toxic?

A: Yes, a lot of them have thimerosal in it, which is liquid mercury. But they make it without it with glycerin. But there's nothing you can put on the eye but aloe vera juice in place of... Real aloe vera juice. Right, so you can put that in your eye and contact over that. But the butter you can't do because it would create a film. Egg white you can't do because it creates a film. What I tell people to do is just take some distilled water and put a few grains of sea salt in it. So you have saline water, and it's pure. There's nothing else in it, no anything. If you're putting either aloe vera or egg white in your eye or butter in your eye, you're coating it and you're nurturing it. You don't need glycerin. Glycerin is a chemical compound. It isn't natural when they finish making glycerin. It may have come from cellulose, but by the time they chemically treat it and produce it, it's no longer anything but a chemical. It's a gelatinized chemical.

Q: How long did the gal use the butter and the pineapple to get her vision better?

A: Well, she used mainly butter, but once in a while she used pineapple. She went from about three-eighths of an inch thick glasses to an eighth of an inch thick in a year and a half.

Q: Did she do it every day?

A: She did it every day.

Q: Have you ever tried it?

A: I'm too lazy, you know.

Q: You?

A: I've got so many other things to do, I'm lazy for that.

Q: It's like one more thing on the list, right?

Q: You're not saying to put that in your eye until right after surgery, right?

A: No, you can put the egg white in your eye right after surgery and use the aloe vera right after surgery, but the butter, I would wait a day, 24 or 36 hours. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible] It won't have healed enough. 

A: Oh, none of those, even the butter won't rip it off. Butter adds healing. Let me give you an example. See this toe? See the bad shape it looks like it's in? Eight weeks ago, the foreman on my land in Thailand dropped a 90-pound pole, post, wooden post on the corner. It hit this toe. It took all of the skin from here all the way down to here off. So all was gone. This nail was up. I didn't do anything with this one because it was just bruised, but this one was ripped to pieces. And it was painful. And it split the bone from here to here right down the center. Well, it was a little thing.

Q: Oops.

Q: So that hurts, though.

A: Little to me. So what I did was I put lime juice on it right away because lime juice is an antiseptic. And it will coat any particle and neutralize it so your body doesn't have to utilize white blood cells and infections and remove it. So it had no pussing whatsoever from that. The skin was gone from here all the way to here. When it hit, it bounced. So it just like cut it, cut the skin off. So there was no saving. And I thought the nail was going to go, too, but I thought the nail was protected, so I didn't remove it. So I put the lime juice on it, put honey on it. I had coconut cream with me, but not the butter. But as soon as I got back to the hotel, I put butter on it and a meat slab. And then over the meat slab, I cut a piece of watermelon rind, the size of that to go around, to keep the meat from drying. So I wrapped that around. I don't like using plastic when I don't have to. So I used that and wrapped it around with a gauze elastic bandage, and then kept it. And the nail reattached. And after about, I guess it was five days, I just let it sit for five days. I didn't change the bandage or anything. And when I took it off, there was still quite a wedge around the bottom cuticle of the nail that was missing. So a lot of the Thai people that worked for me there said, oh, we've got an herb that'll really make this, you know. And I said, get it for me. So they got it and made it into a poultice to put it on. When I took it off the neck, it got so painful by morning. I took it off and it had caused all of the healing that happened in five days to completely reverse. It ripped all of my skin away. So I had to wrap it back up again. And then I went to the Philippines. And after five days, you know, it was the same way, just that little section out again. And they had a nerve. And I was not going to be close-minded because I wanted to test all herbs. They had their mixture, so they put it on. There was a green mixture, too. Put it on there. Same thing happened. Twenty-four hours later, all that healing is reversed. So I said, maybe it works for you guys who live on rice, but it does not work for me. So I just wrapped it around with the meat. Here it is eight weeks later. I have the nail. Of course, you know, this nail, this nail looks like this one as far as the shape of the toe. Now I've got a much longer nail. But it's there, it's attached. And you can see how it was bruised. See how this one's bruised? The red blood cells are still under the nail. This one was that way, too. But the meat pulled those red blood cells out and allowed the body to dissolve. It worked beautifully. Pardon?

Q: Meat, lime juice, butter?

A: Lime juice, honey, either butter or coconut cream, and then meat over that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, I told you, wrapped it in a bandage. I wear sandals there, it's too hot to wear shoes. And anyway, that toe would not like a shoe. Because that's where the bend is. So I had to wear sandals. I just kept it wrapped. But I continued working. Broken, split bone, excruciating, throbbing pain. I continued working.

Q: What did you do for the pain?

A: Nothing. I had some cheese and butter and honey. Do you have a questions?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Tinnitus? Tinnitus. Does it have a high pitch? Does it have a low pitch? High pitch. That's excessive fluid in your ears. What you do at night, you take a hot water bottle, and you put it on one ear one night, and let it evaporate. That will take care of the ringing in that ear for two or three days until it builds up again. Then you do it on that ear. You have to do that cycle. You can't do the same ear two days in a row, because then you'll be imbalanced, and you'll lose your equilibrium. You'll get dizzy. You sleep on a hot water bottle to let the excess fluid in the ear evaporate.

Q: Other times when using the hot water bottle, you said you put it on the top. Not to lay on it, is that the case?

A: Well, no, I say lay on the side, so you're not putting pressure on it, and you're not putting pressure on it this way. You lay beside it so the heat's moving upward. On your head.

Q: What about clicking?

A: That's dryness, and the wax is getting in. The wax is moving, and that creates a clicking sound. That's wax in the ear. 

Q: How warm should the hot water bottle be?

A: As warm as you can take it, probably 130 degrees, and then you wrap it with a flannel pillowcase or a towel. You don't want to put that hot of an object right up against your ear, but close. Once the towel or the wrapped flannel pillowcase is on it, you've got a barrier between it, so that prevents it from being too hot. But it takes at least probably 112 degrees to get it to perspire in one night enough to remove the ringing in one night. If it's a low-pitched sound, that means you've got some kind of nasty fluid in there. Usually when you have a lot of fluid, you've got a lot of heavy metals leaving the brain trying to dump out the ear, the earwax. So that will create a high-pitched sound. If you have things like iron or lower vibrational metals, that brings a low sound. That's a little harder to remove. You may have to do it every night instead of every three nights.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's a way to perspire it, but you'd need to leave it on a long time. It's so much easier. You can do it while you're asleep. You can't candle while you're asleep. Do you have a question, David? 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, because the intestines, when you have Crohn's, usually the physiological process of that is that you stop making proper mucus to line the intestines. Your own digestive acids start eating away your intestinal lining, so it becomes thinner and thinner. So what happens is the gut gets so thin that it will often cause tearing if you eat too much. That's called leaky gut. When food particles, undigested food particles, pass into your gut, out of the intestines, they usually travel to the knees first. Not always, but probably 80% of the time. So people start having knee problems, knee aches, knee swelling, because the body sends the particles down to the knee, and the knee forms acids to become a digestive tract to break it down. That causes 80% of all arthritis and rheumatism, is leaky gut. The knees and joints weren't supposed to be made to be a digestive organ. So eating the eggs allows the intestines to work very little, and yet they get all these nutrients to nutrify. And when you have the egg white and the egg yolk together, it builds a good mucus. So all of a sudden, within 24, 36 hours, a case of Crohn's disease can be in the process of reversal.

Q: Would that be the same for... I have a relative who has had Crohn's for many years, and it seems to have evolved into chronic fatigue syndrome. Would it be the same kind of thing?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Obviously, for someone like this who isn't used to eggs, how do you digest them?

A: Always by themselves. Otherwise, you mix them with milk, it's going to take 6 to 10 hours to digest them, and it's complicated. So they have to be just downed Rocky style, or the way I do, suck right out of an eggshell. Did she see Rocky?

Q: Yeah.

A: He brings the five eggs in, and then you've got to go like this. It doesn't work if you don't go like this. 

Q: So if you mix them with milk, it's really complicated.

A: It slows it down. It takes 6 to 10 hours to digest raw milk.

Q: Would you still get the benefit though over time?

A: It won't be the same. It's going to take you much longer, sometimes 5, 20 times longer.

Q: So how long is it?

A: Eggs are so pure and absorb so fast, there's no difficulty. Because let's say the milk finds a spot where you've already torn and you've got an ulceration there that's not healing and it tears every time and you have leaky gut in that spot every time. When it reaches that area, that area is not going to be able to heal because you're going to have digestive juices and acids and bacteria working on the food in that spot. If you have the egg, the egg is already absorbed within 5 inches of the intestine. So the intestines don't have to work anywhere for digestion except for that first 5 inches.

Q: So let's say for instance someone had colon cancer and their colon had been removed and they had an ileostomy done. The best route for their nutritious revitalization would be just raw eggs.

A: That's it. Yep. Raw eggs and milk.

Q: And milk.

A: The problem with your colon is where your last stage of digestion happens and the E. coli mainly are responsible for breaking the fats and proteins down to the finite molecule to feed your brain and nervous system. People who have psychological problems like depression and anxiety is different. Anxiety is not exercising. Depression is always a lack of bacteria. So if they don't have a colon, they're not going to be breaking their food down into the finite molecules to feed the brain and the nervous system. So they need to eat rotten eggs or rotten meat to supply it. Like in my episode of Ripley's Believe It or Not. I had two patients there. One had been on psychotropic drugs for 27 years. Seven different kinds a day she took, and about, I think, somewhere around 30 of those pills daily. Thirty of the seven daily. And she was a basket case. So finally I got her to eat. The conversation went like this. I said, well, you can't stay on the diet because you're mostly distraught. You're not feeding your brain a nervous system even though you're on this diet because you're not digesting the finite proteins and fats. So you've got to eat the high meat. I'm already on this diet that's antisocial and raw meat. Bam, hung up on me. So a few hours later, okay, how do I make this high meat? I said, it's in the book, but what you can do is just cut up the meat and you put it, you know, leave meat space and half air space in it and you open it every few days out of the refrigerator, two to three days to air it out to get the aerobic bacteria going well as well as the anaerobic bacteria. So you have all breeds. And it'll take about 14 days. I don't have 14 days. I said, okay, well, I have another patient who makes a lot of it and eats it every day because he had the same problem as you, he'll eat the high meat every day and he has plenty. Maybe he'll sell you some. So I called him, gave him her number. He called her. So I got a call. She called me like 2 o'clock in the afternoon the first time. So this is like 9 o'clock at night. Okay, I got the high meat from James, another James, not James Stewart. And I got this high meat. I am really worried. I ate some of it. And it's awful smelling and it's bad tasting. And I think I'm going to have a real problem. So I let the answering machine, I just listened. Okay. Because I knew I'd babysit her all night. So every 45 minutes to an hour she called. 

And every 45 minutes to an hour she got a little bit better. 5 o'clock, 5.15, 5.20 in the morning something like that came. I'm going to stay on this phone until you answer. And then she started whistling. I said, now's the time to answer. So I said, look at your mood. When's the last time you whistled in your life? When's the last time you played like that in your life? Oh, that's right. I said, now you got through the whole night on your own. You don't need me. You're strong. You got through the whole night on your own. And you ate this putrid, nasty stuff that the FDA thinks is going to kill you. And look what it's done. It's made you happy. It made you happy in 10 to 20 minutes compared to what you were before. And here now we're, what, 7 hours, 8 hours beyond when you ate it? And you are a different person. So she went on Ripley's believe it or not, after eating a year like that, rotten, stinky, high meat, and ate it right there on Ripley's with another patient and I. FDA wants you sick because they work for the medical institution, the pharmaceuticals, and they work for the food industry. They're going to back everything that they want. They believe, they want you to believe, that bacteria is responsible for all disease. Bacteria is not responsible for any disease. Your body is 99% bacteria. For every one gene that you have, a human gene, you have 100 bacterial genes in your body. You're 1% human. You're 99% bacterial. If you don't believe me, get online and go to TED and go for bacteria. [Note: Bonnie Bassler - How Bacteria Talk] There was a bacteriologist who talks about it. We're 90-99%. Microbiologists tell you you're 90-99% bacteria. She believes 99% because there's 101 genes. She says, I tell people they're 1% human. She's one of those microbiologists that believes that 99% bacterial. I go along with it. We are 99%. Why should we be afraid of bacteria? It's the dumbest thing in the world, yet people buy it all the time. That's the whole article in my next newsletter that will come out this week. It talks about that. It talks about all of the chemicals that are put in antibiotic soaps. There are two main chemicals that are hormone disruptors. I've listed all of the products. It is an incredible list. From toothpastes all the way down to shampoos, deodorants, you name it, it's in it.

Then I go into a section where your household, and it's in a slew of those, households. These are hormone disruptors that prevent fertility, that prevent proper sperm counts and sperm resilience. These are only two of the chemicals that are studied. All of these chemicals create disease, not bacteria. If bacteria were the cause of disease, I would be dead. A thousand times. And it isn't true. Okay, do you have a question? Oh, David, that was your question. Do you have a question?

Q: Sometimes I make sauerkraut.

A: Uh-huh.

Q: I use salt.

A: Do you like to be sour?

Q: No. I was going to ask that, [unintelligible]?

A: Fine, but no salt.

Q: I use, what, whey?

A: Whey or lemon juice or vinegar.

Q: Okay.

A: And if you're going to use vinegar, just use a small amount because it will just melt it.

Q: Right.

A: Unless you're going to eat it right away. It'll make it faster. You can do sauerkraut in like 24 hours if you use vinegar. But if you use whey, it's going to take three, four days, five days. If you use lemon juice, it's not going to taste as good, but it will break it down. Not quite as fast as vinegar, but close. The reason you don't want to use salt is because salt is an explosive. It's the most volatile explosive on the planet. If you isolate pure sodium, a block of sodium this big will take out New York City. GE, General Electric, was paid by the military over $2 trillion over the last 60 years to make sodium an explosive that you could use as a war toy. It is so volatile, they can't control it. It's more volatile than nitroglycerin. One and a half degree change can cause it to ignite. So it's been impossible to do, so they've given up, for now. $2 trillion is enough for you? So what happens is, when that goes in the body, and your body isolates the sodium molecule from either the iodine or chloride, depending upon what kind of salt you're using, even if it's a natural salt, it breaks those clusters up, those clusters of minerals, because it has to be in collodial form. Collodial means absorbable into a cell. Cell as a nutrient. So it has to be like a unimolecule of a mineral to be utilized properly. So when the body eats normally, the cell eats, there's a whole network, a whole smorgasbord of nutrients, anywhere from 97 to 117 nutrients. All your vitamins, all your minerals, your fats, all the 60 varieties of cholesterol that can be formed, all the different proteins, pyruvates, all the 22 amino acids, everything is in the smorgasbord. When a cell eats, it gets the whole dosing that's completely nutrified. When salt is eaten, it causes these explosions of the nutrients, so you may only get 27, 57 nutrients into a cell at once. So every cell becomes deficient anytime you use salt with a meal. Not only that, it dehydrates the cell. Sometimes the sodium molecules, isolated, will attach to each other, even though sodium molecule is the smallest of all the elements.

When they clump together, they create a very strong magnetism. So when a cell opens and one or two ions inside attracts the ions that are in that smorgasbord in there, if a cluster of sodium is passing, it can't go inside. And it causes the magnetism is so great it rips the ions out of the cell, and the cell will never eat again. So the cell shrivels like a grape to a raisin, and that's it. So one million blood cells are destroyed from one little bitty grain of salt.

Q: So the animals, they put the salt blocks up for them?

A: They don't really lick it that much. One little bitty grain of salt, normal table, not your big rock salt, will kill one million red blood cells. Of course that can fit on the head of a pin. But still, that's a lot of red blood cells.

Q: You don't just eat one grain, you eat more.

A: Yeah, you sprinkle it on.

Q: It comes in your food.

A: Okay, now there was a group of guys that said, I was full of shit, didn't know what I was talking about. I said, okay, take a freshly killed animal, skin them, salt them, and see what happens. So they did it, you go online and look up frogs salt video. You see these guys, they think they're just playing around. They have no idea what's going to happen. They're just following my instructions. So they put out these three frog legs, you know, they're cut from the waist down on the frogs, and they turn them over, they sprinkle the salt one side and then the other side. Now it isn't like they poured a whole bucket of salt on them. They're sprinkling each one as somebody would sprinkle their dinner. All of a sudden you see these frog legs. Now these are dead frogs. They've been dead for hours. These frog legs are going into spasms. They only let it on for two minutes, but it happened for 27 minutes. Those legs spasmed for 27 minutes. So they did it with pepper. So you can go on, there's also one on pepper, but they only use one frog leg because they only have four frogs. So they sprinkle this pepper, and they're laying the pepper on this poor frog leg, and they're laying this pepper on it, pepper and pepper, one spasm and that's it. Pepper is a highly caustic substance that burns, right, burns tissue. This is a dead organism. It doesn't feel that, but salt is an explosive. Dead or not, it starts mixing with certain bodily fluids, and it's going to start exploding. And that's what causes this to work. So you can go online and check it out. So salt is bad, bad, bad, bad. Just like I said in my book, salt is the next worst thing to cooking.

Q: Is this part of why the cells, when you look at them under microscope, there's blood cells that keep clustering and not bouncing around and stuff?

A: Well, no, usually that's from high advanced glycation end products and glucose made from carbohydrate. Very sticky, gumpy, yeah. If your body uses a protein to make the pyruvate to make glycogen, there's very little advanced glycation end product and no stickiness. So the mind stays very alert and accurate.

Q: That's why you say you do that early in the day.

A: And you don't eat any fruit until six hours, at least six hours after you've been awake. You don't eat any carbohydrate until you've been awake, I mean any concentrated carbohydrate, until you've been awake at least six hours. 

Q: That'll help reverse the stickiness of the cells.

A: You won't have it. Unless you overeat fruit. Then even if your body in the first six hours will make all the glycogen that will be used to feed the brain and the nervous system for the entire day that you're awake and up, and even while you sleep. If you go in the afternoon and you eat a tremendous amount of fruit with high carbs, the body's still going to make a lot of glycogen with it and store it in your body. And it's going to feed it once in a while to your system and that's going to make it sticky. Even though your body's mainly using non-sticky pyruvate glycogen. Non-sticky gluco-glycogen. Pyruvate made glycogen. Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, sure do.

A: Oh, wait a minute. Anybody that's a wimp of bad eggs, I don't answer the question.

Q: Can I ask you one other thing about this? I've been doing this yoga for a number of years now and I've been trying to get this pose down.

A: To get what down?

Q: Lotus pose.

A: Uh-huh.

Q: To get the legs...

A: Right.

Q: I seem to really get tight and I'm trying to get past, I don't know, something in the body, toxins, something being held in the body that is making me more inflexible.

A: Is it here? Is it here? Is it here? Where do you ache?

Q: On the knees.

A: The knees ache?

Q: The knees and then the quads. Both the quads and knees and hamstring area.

A: It sounds like your tendons are too tight. Pineapple with coconut cream and some butter and putting hot water bottles on it at night. Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, I do. Basically, one of the things I'm kind of interested in right now is prostate cancer. It's a disease that's wide spread. A lot of people are getting diagnosed with it.

A: Diagnosed but not true. PSA has nothing to do with prostate.

Q: Well, let's say you have a biopsy and it shows that there's some sort of cancer cells involved.

A: Okay, let me straighten that out. Okay, 50 years ago, no, I'm getting older. 60 years ago, 63, almost close to 64, the way it's going. 60 years ago, do you know what the analysis for treatable cancer was? 500 cancer cells per million. Do you know what it is now? 50 cancer cells per million. Why did they do that? More money. When they analyze somebody for cancer, everybody's got cancer cells in their body. What ratio is treatable? What ratio is causing a difficulty and a problem? None.

Q: Well, that's an interesting question. The issue that's interesting to me is that there are approaches that are, like, this fellow, what's his name, Ornish, up in San Francisco, there's a number of, like, legume-based diets. There are all kinds of diets. There's a medical diet. I have a friend who had prostate cancer. [unintelligible] And the cancer occurred for ten years. It's weird, because it seems like body types seem to have a different approach to this. I don't get it. I mean, it's everybody's protocols.

A: You have to understand all the false statistics out there. About 80% of all the cancers that are diagnosed as treatable and a problem are not. 85% of the diabetics that come to me that are taking insulin are not even diabetic. You have to understand that a blood test is a snapshot. If I take a Polaroid of you, that's like me judging your entire life from a Polaroid. It's the most absurd thing in the world. Your body is different. Chemistry is going to be different every 20 minutes, 20, 30 minutes. So if I really want to understand maybe how your body is working, not how it may change, but how it changes on a daily basis, I'd have to do your blood work every day. I mean, every, well, every 30 minutes. 30 minutes every day for about a year and a half so I'd have an idea of how your body works and in what pattern. Even seasonal, it's different. So when a doctor takes a test and shows you from either one or two tests because you've had a glucose issue, and they're feeding you corn syrup, garbage, for this test, of course you're going to be way off in balance. You're going to have very high sugar levels. And they tell you you're diabetic, there's no cure for it, and take this insulin the rest of your life. But you take a look at Hippocrates. Hippocrates would cure or had the cure. He didn't cure himself. He put people on a nothing but a raw milk diet for six to ten weeks. Diabetes was completely reversed. Of course, they were getting milk unrefrigerated. It was right out of the cow. They were drinking it fresh. Big difference now. If I put somebody on just a raw milk diet, it is impossible for our society. It's difficult to do that just on raw milk. It will take three months to six months to reverse that diabetes. But still, it's reversible. Usually in two months, if I put somebody on dairy and a meat diet with lots of raw eggs, their diabetes symptoms are gone in three weeks.

Q: I was diagnosed with diabetes, too, in February. I don't have it anymore. The doctor called me up last Thursday and said, Hey, I've done all the tests.

A: You don't have diabetes anymore, do you? You never had it. That's what I'm saying.

Q: Okay.

A: Fifteen percent of the people I have to...

Q: I changed my diet. I feel a hell of a lot better. I lost 30 pounds from working out and everything. It's like, this is kind of like...

A: Different life.

Q: Yeah, it's like, I'm trying to understand...

A: You're finally feeding your body something it wanted and needs and can utilize properly. And that's all the difference in the world. So 85% of the diabetics that come to me, all they do is go on a different diet, and they're asymptomatic. Those that are truly diabetic may take six weeks, three weeks, four months, six months, but after six months, they're not diabetic. I only have two patients who had been taking insulin for over 35 years. They still take three units a day just in case. Okay, who cares? Three units, big deal. That's a big change in them taking their 28 to 30 to 40 a day, 43 a day, down to three, and they just do it for insurance. That's how hard the medical profession has worked on their brain. 

Q: But doctor tells you you're diabetic saying your body can't produce insulin.

A: Yeah, saying it doesn't manufacture insulin, or you're producing a poor insulin quality that doesn't make the excess sugars into glycogen. 

Q: If somebody has diabetes and insulin dependence, if you just tell them to have four glasses of raw milk a day, would that...

A: No, not with our milk quality here, because they'd be getting organic pastures.

Q: We're getting raw milk from mothers and stuff like that.

Q: What did you say? Organic pastures?

A: Organic pastures nearly freezes their milk to keep the coliform bacteria down, because our jerk Terminator governor vetoed that bill we worked so hard to get through. But with the new governor coming in, I'm right off to Sacramento again.

Q: You mean the raw milk you buy right now in mothers in those places, like in bottles, that's no good either?

A: It's not so good. It isn't the best. Schwarzenegger made sure we didn't have the high quality we need. So I get our ship from our Amish farmers every week. It's expensive, you know, just as expensive as organic pastures. They have our ship in, but we have high quality.

Q: Do you get it in the glass?

A: I buy it in the glass, so it's frightfully expensive.

Q: How much per gallon?

A: If I buy it in the half gallon, I'm paying $12 something. If I buy it in the gallon glass, I pay $17, $18. Gallon's better.

Q: What's shipping?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Raw milk in glass.

Q: What about Claravale Farms?

A: Claravale Farms feeds their regular old feed. They called me, me and his wife called me and said, Why are you bad-mouthing our milk? I said, I'm not bad-mouthing your milk. It's just that you feed yours... We're organic. I said, send me the label of your feed. The last time I saw your feed label, it's a regular old. It has soy in it. It has processed soy in it. It has a lot of other processed substances. It has molasses. The molasses is boiled sugar cane till the slop boils down to the bottom at 475 to 700 degrees. I said, that's not raw. That's not an organic substance. I said, you send me your label. Never received it. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The Amish grow their own. The Amish grow their own.

Q: Are there any Amish out here?

A: Pardon?

Q: Are there any Amish in California?

A: Too expensive. Too expensive.

Q: The land prices are too high.

A: Oh yeah, exactly.

Q: How close are they to Arizona?

A: There's a lot in Kansas. Mennonites in Kansas. Utah. There's some in Arizona.

Q: I think there's some out there in California. I saw them when we went to Mexico.

A: Yeah? Well, I've never met any from here.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Must be around here then. And I was just in Sedona, and there were some there.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Pretty dry up there. I don't know if these guys are rolling.

Q: The ones in Pennsylvania are the real, you know, that's where you get the biggest ones.

A: Well, you've got them in Ohio. I have a slew of them in Ohio.

Q: And there's some in Wichita, Indiana.

A: All over the place. They're all over the place. But just not in the west coast, there's not a lot of rain. You know, there's not a lot of growth here. They stay where there is good farming.

Q: Are they protected from the government?

A: I've been protecting them. I've had six already I saved from the FDA closing down already this year.

Q: This year?

A: This year. So they signed contracts with me. So I own their animals. It's all private owned. It's no longer commercial. And I send letters to the HHS, Human Health Services in Washington, D.C., the FDA in Washington, D.C., then their local one. And I tell them you have no jurisdiction over here. If you trespass onto the property anymore, if you touch a gate to enter it when we told you not to, it's breaking and entering. And we will prosecute you. And if you come home with a false warrant, you will be... And arrest anybody for I don't care if it's for ten minutes, you've kidnapped. Kidnapping. We don't use this false arrest crap that lets people, that lets, you know, law enforcement off of the hook, because what it is is kidnapping. If I arrest you for ten minutes, it's kidnapping.

Q: And if the law enforcement agents have guns with them, armed assault.

A: Armed assault, yes. And that's what we're getting them for up here. When they came to us in Rawesome.

Q: Do you know anything about this organic certification board, which their license was pulled, especially the United States or something, the government?

A: I don't care whose license.

Q: California.

A: I don't care what the government does. The government has no say over anything.

Q: Well, I wonder what the repercussions of that would be if there's no more board for licensing or certifying organic.

A: They don't want it because Bush owns, through trust, Bush and the Bass family out of Texas own Whole Foods. Why do you think it's all marketing? Go, go, go organic, and they only carry 2% organic produce at any time. That's nothing. It's all bullshit. It's all more government-minded spin. And they don't produce anything better, and they just signed, what was it, five months ago, two vegetarians to run Whole Foods. What kind of mentality is that? Right away those two guys got rid of raw milk. And they said it was an insurance issue. Bullshit.

Q: So do you think this is related to your place you said in Thailand, your retreat center?

A: They're after me everywhere.

Q: They won't stop?

A: They're not going to stop, and I'm not going to stop. When I got back from the East after getting all those injections, I did three more radio shows on the swine flu. They're just not going to stop me.

Q: I'm saying how are they stopping you and you're in another freaking country?

A: They're trying to take my land away. That was going to make us a spa.

Q: But who is the culprit?

A: I don't know who the fuck they are. They have money and power.

Q: I mean they're following you around?

A: They're searching for me everywhere. That's part of what I am. I've been homeless before. I lived on the old, what was it, Earl Flynn Estate on a hammock for three days one time. I was homeless in Hollywood. So I've been there before. I lived on a bicycle for three years out in the wild. I slept in graveyards so I wouldn't be hassled. I'm not afraid of anything.

Q: No, I'm saying to help other people. You can never seem to get a clinic together or some kind of retreat center to help people.

A: And some of the people who do become bankrupt right after they've offered me. So people who offer me now, I say, don't tell me, build it, we'll work through another channel, we'll have phone calls that are clandestine, but don't tell me. If you want to invest in that, you go build it, build it up like a regular clinic is, but green, without all the pollution, without all the asbestos and linoleum and all that stuff, and no press board anywhere, you build that, I will help it go, but you cannot be directly connected with me because you'll become bankrupt.

Q: Is that what's happening with Morningland Dairy?

A: Morningland Dairy, they're closing them down because they've supplied us.

Q: What would your relationship be like in that manner? Would you be like an advisor to them?

A: We've got video conferencing now. I can look at the patient. We've got those small magnifying microscopes that are connected to USB. Put it right up against the eye, right there. I take a photo of it. I can do anything on that, but I'll just have to do it off of Skype or somewhere where there's a lot of traffic. Of course, we've got trouble with Skype. It's cut off and stuff like that, but it's hard to track a call.

Q: You get a pretty good accuracy with your iridology.

A: Those new microscopes, they're only like $400. They're pretty good. You just have to have somebody that has a good computer and good internet transmission quality.

Q: So where are you going to go now?

A: I don't know. I don't have a clue. I just take one at a time.

Q: Are you going to stay here on the West Coast for a while?

A: Well, yeah, definitely. This will still be my home until they kill me.

Q: I thought you had your place in Thailand. You built your house, right?

A: Yeah, but they're trying to take all that land. Even the land that the house is on, they're trying to take.

Q: The house that you just built?

A: The house that I just built. They said that's on forestry protected land, too. So I got real angry at them at the last meeting. There were judges. There were policemen. There was the land authority. There was the forestry department.  And there were attorneys and the city attorney all together. This I don't want printed because I promised them I wouldn't. And they all said, give us $200,000 and we'll go away. The whole issue will go away. I said, you're just trying to extort money from me? This is what this is all about? I'm bringing good wealth to your country and all that? I said, do you know something? You're trying to fuck the wrong man. And that's just what I said. I said, I will go online and I'll report this to all the people out there on this diet. And there are at least 40,000 people interested in this diet and what I'm doing. Take a look at Sunday's paper a few weeks ago. You've got the whole city attorney being embarrassed for coming into my Rawesome Club with guns raised and trying to extort and play with us. I said, do you want the same embarrassment? I said, you're screwing with the wrong man if you think you're going to do that to me. They all sat back and I left. I left the next morning, so I have no idea what's happened. And I won't know until I go back. I don't know if I will have land and a house or not.

Q: What about the building?

A: No, that's just now being built. When I left, just the piles were built to build the house. My houses were all nine feet tall, taller than this, because it rains so much there. Anything on the ground smells like mold. You go into a hotel and you're on the first floor, everything smells like mildew and mold. So I don't want that for my house. So everything is nine feet up, three meters. So then they have to build a deck and then the house on top of the deck.

Q: So who were the people that owned the land and you made their kids better?

A: That was the Philippines.

Q: So you're okay in the Philippines?

A: Yep. They stopped me from digging my lake. I dug a lake in Thailand and they came and took the backhoe and the machinery and impounded it.

Q: This is in the middle of nowhere, right?

A: This is in the middle of nowhere, right.

Q: And they got anything better to do?

A: Who else would be behind it? They don't know who I am. I'm way out in the toolies. My name isn't even on anything. I've got Thai partners and all of them show that they own it. I've got a patient here who's Thai and she's the main owner. So, my name, but they know, the word is around, they follow me. Now, I don't turn my cell phone on where I go. Only time I turn it on is when I absolutely have to use it for an emergency. I don't use credit cards. I will buy a ticket right before I get on the plane. Sometimes I will buy a ticket ahead of time on my credit card, but never get on that plane. I'll get on the next one or one the next day or the day previous to that. I pull all kinds of stuff. It's a lot more expensive and I don't have, I'm going down in my savings, but my safety is more important to me. So, I have to play games like that and I've got little bitty sensor devices that I have at the windows and the doors. You know, anybody comes in, makes a very hundred watts, sounds like a very loud bird, squelch. So, I mean, they just shock and bring me out of sleep or anybody, wake anybody up. And shock anybody that's trying to break in. So, I use those. I have a taser gun, which is one million watts. And if I hit somebody with that, just for one second, they won't move for five minutes. If I hit them for three seconds, they won't move for 15, 20 minutes. If I hit them for 30 minutes, their brain won't function. They'll be brain dead. And if I caught those two guys that had been injecting me and I had had my taser next to me and been able to do something about it, they would not be alive today, I guarantee you. Well, they would have been brain dead. I would have just put that taser on their neck or on their temple until the brain stopped working. That's it.

Q: You'd have to hit them for a couple seconds and then inject him.

A: No, they deserved to be dead. Deadly force for that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh yeah, they buried my hot tub and everything. So I have a little bitty bungalow cottage up on the same estate. But I have to leave by November 20th. They told me I had to leave by October 20th and I said, make me. Take me to court and make me. I'll be here until January if you do that. But I promise you I'll be out by November 20th.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, no, no. I'm going to find another place to live and move to another place.

Q: You ever go to Florida?

A: Yeah, I go every year.

Q: When?

A: This last year I went to, what was it, May? Fort Lauderdale area, the Boca Raton.

Q: I think they're just so afraid of, you know, people really getting the truth. And once it gets out, they're going to be blown up.

A: Well, like I said in my newsletter this week, I said, they are afraid of another revolution. 1776 happened because people were healthy. Eating off the farm, not eating chemicals in their food, not getting fluoride in their water. Fluoride causes docility in animals to the point where if you put it in their water, they will be killed by their peers. They won't fight back. Hitler used it to make his prisoners in the concentration camps docile. Why do they think you're trying to get it in everybody's water? San Diego has fought it off for 11 years now.
