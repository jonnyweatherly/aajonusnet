A: I'd say words that weren't even words because the sounds sometimes didn't repeat themselves properly. So I had to cheat in school, so I usually picked a smart girl. I could always tell a smart girl. She was always compassionate, so I'd sit next to her and copy all of her hieroglyphs. Sometimes the distance, the hieroglyphs didn't mean anything, you know, because they weren't the proper letters. And they weren't even letters sometimes. But I got through school, you know, with mostly D's. And then when I got into trade school in college, it was a little different because in the mid-60s, they were starting to realize there was, you know, things like dyslexia and developmental autism. So some of my professors realized this, so they would give me auditory tests. And like all autistic children, I had one particular ability, and that was the ability to look at a computer problem and just pop out the program without even knowing how I did it, so I made a lot of money doing it. So here I was an idiot making a lot of money. And, you know, it wasn't that I was ignorant or stupid, I just, my language center didn't work. By the time I was 12 years old, I developed a case of peritonitis that was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. The doctors went in there to cut out the appendix, found it in great shape, and said, well, we'll cut it out anyway just in case it causes problems in the future. So this is the way the medical profession thinks. If they can't find a reason for it, it doesn't belong. And most of the reasoning that they have is very incoherent. It doesn't have anything to do with what was happening in the body. They gave me massive amounts of injections because peritonitis is a perforated, sometimes profusely bleeding intestinal infection. It was very painful. And I was doubled up for about four or five days. And the other interns, because I had an appendectomy, believed that what I had was appendicitis, and as soon as your appendix is out, you're supposed to be okay. But I wasn't okay, so they would torture me and mistreat me because they thought I was being a sissy or a baby. And this is the way it just carried on for the whole time that I was in the hospital. And they were giving me injections every two to three hours in the arms and the buttocks, and most of them had thimerosal, more mercury poison. So by the time I was 15 from that, I had developed diabetes, and diabetes ran in my family anyway. I have eight cousins who were diabetics between the age of 8 and 13, and lots of aunts and uncles who were on my mother's side. My mother was one of 13 children, so half of them were diabetic. Then at 15 1⁄2, I developed angina pectoris. It's pretty young to get angina. Usually you get angina when you're an old person. It's painful spasms in the heart muscles or outside the heart. It caused me to pass out. I'd pass out in school. They'd just leave me lying on the floor because they didn't know what to do. Thank God, because if they treated me, I'd probably have died of cardiac arrest. So I had to deal with all of these things. Then I found a woman who was very psychic. She was a year older than I. She was one of the top students. For some reason, she fell in love with diabetes. I was raised with three brothers. My father was a very violent man. Everything was handled with violence, which means you didn't resolve anything.

You gave orders or scared somebody and neither left you alone or did what you said. That's all that I knew, so that's the way I treated her, and it wasn't good. I got married at 16, had a child at 17, barely 17. Then divorced when I was 19. I developed, by that time, a bleeding ulcer in the stomach because I was an alcoholic. I'd go through a fifth of alcohol at night just to get to sleep. I smoked two and a half packs of Lucky Strike non-filter a day. I was working for a trucking company in systems analysis. Those truck drivers had lots of Bennies, Benzedrine, so I was doing those in the day, drinking alcohol at night, cigarettes all day long, and 11 cups of coffee also per day. Of course, pardon?

Q: When did you die?

A: I died several times, let me tell you. I did die twice on an operating table, on operating tables, and they had to revive me, and then once I died on a heater. I got to die on a heater because I was dead for about 3 hours and 17 minutes. If I had died on that heater that was full blast, my blood would have thickened. So yeah, I died three times. Remember those death experiences? They're very beautiful because when you leave the body, there's no pain. It's quite euphoric and nice. So with that bleeding ulcer, they trained me, I went to the doctor, spitting up blood, and they gave me Maalox. They said the acids are eating away. They don't take the first step is if you're getting an ulcer, you don't have enough mucus to protect the stomach lining. So let's give you something, let's feed you to create some mucus on your stomach lining. No, they go right to Maalox to cut out the acid. So which means you're not going to digest anything properly. So I was taking all this Maalox and sometimes two bottles a week. And I thought for sure I was going to turn into a chalk factor. And after about six months of that, I started developing a tumor next to the ulcer. So then I had stomach cancer. So then they said, oh, we have to go in and cut that out. And they gave you a Vagotomy Pyloroplasty, which means that they sever all the vagus nerves to the stomach. So you never again, so I never again secrete hydrochloric acid. And that puts me in the category of octogenarians who no longer secrete hydrochloric acid. They said basically, the Pyloroplasty means that they took the duodenum and stretched it out three times its size. And when you do that in a matter of, you know, an hour of stretching and surgery, you basically rendered your duodenum a complete scar tissue. Because your cells can't expand with that kind of stretching without ripping and tearing. So I was rendered unable to eat any raw foods. They told me that if I ate raw foods, I would be in danger of death from parasitical and bacterial food invasion. Death. Be very painful and very severe. So I had this fear. But after the surgery anyway, I was unable to digest anything. If I ate cooked meat, it would sit in my stomach and putrefy. And then it would discharge through my skin. So within 24 hours, I looked like my whole skin all the way down to my thighs was raw hamburger. With all this pus coming everywhere. So I was terribly afraid to eat meat. So the incision from here to here became tumorous. It was this wide, about two and a half inches, two to two and a half inches wide. Anywhere from three quarters to an inch high. So he said, oh, we have to irradiate that to stop it. So I had 10 weeks of intense radiation there in 1968. And what that did was that cauterized my spine. You know, it's like taking clay and you put it into a kiln. And it solidifies the clay. Well, that's what they did with my spine. So this was my movement. I couldn't move my spine. They just solidified it. Plus they filled me with all this radiation. So I had radiation poisoning. I was burned all over the place. Burns coming out everywhere. Nausea, vomiting. Teeth, all the gum started recessing. And all the bone around the tooth dissolved. So I had all these teeth that were dangling. So they wanted to pull all the teeth and give me dentures. I'm 19 years old, 20 years old. So I said, no, if I'm going to die anyway, I'll die with my teeth.

So I had to drink things. Everything was liquid. Mostly through a straw because it was difficult. Because I could cause severe bleeding if I bumped my teeth. If I even bit down on my own teeth, I'd lose about a half a cup of blood at a time. So I was even getting transfusions at times. Even though I drank the blood, I couldn't digest it properly. Then the cauterization of the bone created blood and bone cancer, multiple myeloma. So every time I went to the medical profession, they made it worse, everything worse. So here I had multiple myeloma. Nobody survives multiple myeloma. That's it. Nobody lives. So here I went from stomach cancer to bone cancer. And they said, OK, we're going to have to give you chemotherapy to treat the multiple myeloma. Yet there was no case of anybody who survived multiple myeloma with any kind of a treatment. But they said it'll give you an opportunity to live longer. How they come to that conclusion with no statistics is absolute bull. But that's what they told me. So I went under chemo. I didn't know any better. My mom was a nurse. My father was an inventor and scientist. Eight aunts and uncles who were R.M.'s and three uncles who were doctors. I didn't know any better. Just followed like the sheep. So I took the chemotherapy. I was vomiting all the time. Lost my hair patches here and there. All came in gray when it came in patches. And I was basically a worm. Because I could no longer function from the chest down. So I dragged myself around the house with my elbows. And basically, you know, after three months of that, I said, that's it. I'm finished with you doctors. No more. That's it. I'm just going to go home to die. And I refused to go into a hospice because I was still autistic. I couldn't, you know, I still didn't have a massive sound vocabulary. I could communicate well enough, but it wasn't deeper, you know, intelligent to any extent. So I just stayed at a house, a small house in Beverly Hills, two bedroom house in Beverly Hills. And two volunteers from the hospice would come and visit me every three days. And they would shop for me, they would prepare my food, and they would clean my house. One of them was an 18-year-old boy who was making a lot of money. He was one of the Going Thing, which was a group like the Fifth Dimension. Only these were kids who were singing for the Ford Motor Company that traveled all over the United States. And so he was 18 making a lot of money and was volunteering. And he offered me this book that was about 82 pages. What the hell I was going to do? I didn't tell anybody, so I couldn't read. I just avoided as much as I could. He gave me this little book by this woman who supposedly cured herself of uterine cancer by drinking a gallon of carrot juice a day. So I got the idea, and he went around drinking carrot juice all the time. He didn't drink soda pop or anything like that. I only had cooked carrots, and I hated vegetables. They made me instantly projectile vomit, even as a kid. So I used to have to, you know, my father would beat me, and I had to sit at the table for two hours if I didn't eat my vegetables. So I learned to wash it down with milk.

So when he would offer me this carrot juice, all I could imagine was the juice of cooked carrots. Awful. So finally he got me to taste it, and it was delicious. So I began drinking it, began feeling better, and within about ten days, my autism went away. So all of a sudden I could understand. I could understand. There were such things as words, and there were letters, and how things were formed, and conjugation. It all made sense. It just, you know, the night before it wasn't that way. It was like somebody just flipped a switch. So I borrowed $110 from, I had been $83,000 in debt. I was in 1969 from the medical profession, you know, from my cancer surgeries. So I had had all of my finances drained, and plus my insurance, Teamsters insurance was not covering anything anymore. So I borrowed $110 from this man, or this boy, and he took me to the bookstore, and I bought $110 in 1969, that was a lot of books. $110 was books on nutrition, and one on, you know, self-healing through the mind. So, you know, I got into all these books, and everyone contradicted each other. Sort of like, what's reality and what isn't? So I didn't know, but I figured that the carrot juice is raw. That makes a difference in taste. It tastes alive. It's the only thing I like drinking. I was still smoking two packs of cigarettes a day. I had stopped the alcohol from the day I had surgery. I couldn't do that. I couldn't drink alcohol anymore. I still love my donuts and stuff like that. So that was basically my diet. It's carrot juice and donuts. Powdered donuts. Cigarettes. And sometimes, you know, RC Cola. And the more I read, you know, I had no vocabulary, so I was living with a dictionary as well as a book to learn. And then, you know, I was getting into self-help stuff and getting around all these people who had survived, or a few people who had survived cancer. They're talking about it's in the mind, you know, we did it through the mind. They don't know how they do it, but they do it. But I started believing it, okay, mind over matter. I like that. It's easier. It's a magic bullet. I'll go for that. So I stopped drinking the carrot juice, eating the regular garbage, and within about nine, ten days, I was back into autism again. And that was a blow, a serious blow. So it not only wounded me emotionally and mentally, psychologically, because here, I was even disempowered even more, because if mind over matter is true, I'm pretty weak. Now I've got myself back into autism, as well as being diseased and going to die. So it was quite a blow. So I began drinking carrot juice again. About nine or ten days, went away again. So I went through that a couple of times, saying, okay, I'm ready now. I've got mind over matter. I've got the self-will discipline going. And then I stopped drinking carrot juice and ended up autistic again. So I realized that the physiological was very important, and this mind over matter wasn't necessarily true. And to bear that out, I went looking for all these healers, these masters, Shivananda, Yogananda, all these masters, and every one of them had a health problem.

Every one of them. And I'm saying, wait a minute, a master of what? You're a master of maybe bullshit, but you're certainly not a master of the body. And every time I challenged one, they said, well, that's the role of the physical body, to suffer to learn. It doesn't make a lot of sense to me. I said, obviously, you don't have a master, if you have to come here to suffer. So I dumped all of that and went back into full raw food nutrition. So this was in February of 1972. I just had a girlfriend that went through peritonitis, and they said she was going to die if she didn't go and stay in the hospital and take all this medication. And I said, Lori, it's not going to work. You're going to end up dead. You know, because they'll destroy the bacteria in your intestines. You won't be able to eat anything. You won't be able to heal. So I mixed all of these raw food formulas that I'd devised and gave them to her, got her out of the hospital. They told her if she recovered, and 75% of the people back then died of peritonitis, they said if she recovered, it would be a year and a half before she could be normal again. It takes that long. Well, that's true if you take all those antibiotics, like penicillin and all that, to destroy the digestive ability. You're not going to digest anything and get well. But with the raw food formula, she was back to ballet classes in six weeks. Six weeks instead of 18 months. Big difference. So that was so dramatic for me. I went from 60% to 75% raw to 100% raw. That's February 1972. However, it was still vegetarian. Fruitarian because I was afraid of meat. It would break me out. That's cooked. And it didn't relate to raw meat because of bacteria and parasites and the vagotomy that I had and the fear that had been put into me that the bacteria in raw meat would kill me. So I completely ignored it. And at 27 years old, I had put my cancers in remission. I had been on a raw diet for about four years and was doing okay. So I set out on a bicycle and I decided that I was going to, you know, investigate tribes and live with animals to see how they lived and how they ate and if there was any magic herbs or anything like that that I could find that would heal me quickly. So I bicycled for two and a half years all the way from Yucatan to Alaska, crossed the United States five times with my bicycle. In that two and a half years. Sometimes I'd be very debilitated and throw my bicycle on a freight train and, you know, hang my hammock between the broken walls and swing there and watch the scenery go by. That was quite nice. And I was a hippie. I had, you know, the robes like Jesus wore and beard and long hair. I knew that people would leave me alone no matter what I did. They would always, they'd be, you know, they would be inspired to think of, you know, the better parts, the love part that Jesus is supposed to inspire in people. So, and it happened that way. I mean, I was on freight trains and they were mugging and beating people and they'd see me and they'd put their guns away, you know, I'd stay out of sight, it would be okay. It was very nice, so... And if I wanted to completely be left alone, I'd go sleep in a graveyard. Let me tell you, nobody touches you in a graveyard if you're Jesus, so. So I did that and I'd be left alone, completely alone for three or four days. When I was down in Mexico, it was difficult because they just saw me as a hippie.

You'd think it was a Catholic-oriented culture and they'd be more oriented toward Jesus' admiration, but they didn't, you know. They were pretty hostile down there. But still, I'd met many Indian tribes, including the Inuit in Alaska, that told me what you need is raw meat. Of course, I completely blocked it out and I ignored it. I said, no, I won't do that, do that. And the Eskimos said, well, we have one formula for you, and it was September. And in September, it was getting pretty cold there at night, and the temperature dropped down to 50, 48 degrees with my multiple myeloma, even though it seemed to be in remission. I was in excruciating pain. My bones were in so much pain, I was crippled. I could not move. And it was getting that cold at night, the day it was not, early September.

Q: What is that? Multiple myeloma?

A: Blood and bone cancer. Blood and bone cancer. So I was suffering with all this pain, and then they had this celebration. And all the kids were jumping around and dancing, and they dug up under the ground. They had between four and six inches buried under the ground. They had these hides, and inside the hides was this moldy stuff that was black and green and white and brown, all these molds on it. And it stunk like rotting flesh. It stunk terribly. So if it stunk downwind for a half a mile, it was ready. And this stunk that badly. I couldn't get within five feet of it without wanting to vomit. So they got some... And I thought it was herbs. I thought they had treated herbs in a certain way and let the mold grow. And the children were dancing around, waiting for this stuff. It smelled so horrible. I couldn't grasp that. Even if you're brought up in that culture, this stuff stunk so bad. It was like being in the back of an Italian restaurant that had let meat rot for weeks, meat and fish. But I thought it was some kind of herbal mixture because I didn't know meat molded. I had no idea that meat created molds. Molds would manifest on meat. So I had about a golf ball or a ping-pong ball-sized amount. And they had to get some cotton balls with musk oil in them, true musk oil, and stuff it up my nose so I could get it down. And after I ate that, I had no pain at night. I mean, no crippling pain. I had pain in my joints, but no crippling pain. And, you know, the next, you know, I stayed there almost another two weeks after that with relatively no pain. And just a ping-pong ball-sized amount. So I tried to get them to tell me what herbs were involved in it. They said, no, it's just raw meat. It was caribou beaten into a mince and then mixed with whale blubber or seal blubber and left in the sun to mash. And then we wrapped it and put it in the earth. And I didn't believe them. They were just trying to give me the raw meat. So it wasn't until almost 12 years later that I learned it really was raw meat, molded in the ground, rotted in the ground, basically, or decomposed in the ground. So I had come to the end of my trail at that particular time, two and a half years. The multiple myeloma was resurging by the next spring. And I knew that I was going to die. So I chose an old Indian burial ground in southern California and decided I was going to fast myself to death. And this den of coyotes lived up there. I mean, during this two and a half years, I lived with crocodiles. I lived with an old colony of chipmunks. Just watching all of these creatures in nature do their thing. They all ate shit. They all ate fecal matter. They ate all these disgusting things. They would let meat rot. They would eat it. And I was looking for this clean herb that would be the magic bullet. And it didn't happen. So I decided, well, I'm going to die anyway. I'm just suffering. Multiple myelomas resurging again. I'm having severe pain everywhere in every joint. And I'd wake up in my sleeping bag, and I'd have to wait until the sun beat on my back for two hours before the pain was mitigated enough to where I could move. So it was basically three hours from the time that the sun just started illuminating until the sun was on my sleeping bag for two hours. So it was three hours of severe suffering every morning. So I was ready to die. That was it.

And this den of coyotes that lived up in the canyon killed this rabbit and offered it to me. And then all of a sudden, all these sound bites started coming back from when my uncles and my father were teaching my brothers and my cousin how to hunt. Of course, they wouldn't trust me with anything because I was so sickly. I wasn't allowed to play. I couldn't play with the guys. I had to play with the girls or be with my mother or women. And that was fine with me because I hated the macho shitheads. Because they were all macho. In my family, they were all macho. And the women were even macho, but not that bad. So I stayed with the women, and that was better for me. So I remember these sound bites coming back. And of course, I broke the words down into the concept that meant that never eat a wild rabbit unless it's thoroughly, solidly cooked. There is a parasite or bacteria, I don't remember what it was, but the sound bites were there enough for me to decipher it, that it will kill you within 48 hours with very, very painful stomach cramps. 48 hours of pain, I can handle that. Easy. Easy. Easily. So I ate this rabbit. Of course, I hadn't eaten meat in six and a half years. This was the Easter bunny, the long-haired Easter bunny. And one of the reasons I also became vegetarian was because I loved animals. I loved animals more than I did human animals. All animals. So even snakes and scorpions and spiders, I loved them all, and none of them ever hurt me. Well, once some kids were stoning a snake, and I stopped them, and the snake bit me, not knowing that I was going to be nice at first. Then I picked it up, and it was okay. So I ate this rabbit. It first took a few bites, and then it came right back up. And it came right back up again. So I said, okay, I've got to psych myself out here. So I sat down for five minutes and said, okay, you've got to get beyond this nausea. You've got to get beyond this little warm, fleshy food, little creature here that you're eating. You've got to get beyond that, and you just have to eat it. So I forced myself to eat it. And after about 10, 20 bites, it started tasting good. And I started getting hungry for it. So I ate about 3 1⁄2 pounds of this jackrabbit. It was about a 7 1⁄2-pound jackrabbit, about a year old, so it wasn't too tough. And it was delicious, and then the coyote shared the rest of it. So I went back to my campsite to die. And I knew I was dying because I started having no pain. It was like my death experiences. So I went back, went to sleep, knew I was going to wake up in another reality in the morning, but here I woke up in the same place, but with very little pain. I said, well, I'm on my way to die. Three days went by, and I didn't die, and I felt stronger than I'd ever had in my life, and I realized raw rabbit, the Aztecs, the Mayans, the tribes that I'd been with, the Inuit in Alaska, the Sioux in North Dakota and South Dakota, all of them. Raw meat, they just kept telling me, and I refused to believe it. So at that point, I said, okay, then I'm going to try it. And at that moment, a sidewinder rattlesnake went by, and I had watched the Indians catch snakes, and I just go up and step behind his head here, pick it up right in front of the rattler, because if you grab it by the rattler, it'll come off, and the snake will get you. So they grab it right around the tail, and they'll swing it around, and then they snap it, and the head goes one direction. Pull back the skin, and you eat it. So I decided, not even thinking, instinctively, I did it.

I put my head up, barefooted. I'm just wearing a loincloth out in the desert. I step, put my foot on the head, pick it up by the tail, start swinging around, and then just realize, what the hell are you doing? You've never done this before. What if the head doesn't come off, and it comes back and bites you? So I'm swinging it around, changing hands. My joints are getting sore and sore, so I realize I have to do something pretty soon. So it was about five minutes I spun that thing around, more exercise than I had except on the bicycle. My legs, and I snapped it. Sure enough, the head came off just like that, and I ate it. And there was a mountain lion that shared it with me. And, you know, I got energy from it, and I got to start looking for scorpions and tarantulas, and I'd rip off their poisonous gland, and I would eat them. The fluid in the tarantula is, you know, white, and it's pretty delicious. You know, so the scorpion, I could take that or leave that. When you're that hungry, it's okay. But I realized that I wasn't going to be able to survive very much and get very well in a desert, so I bicycled about 20 miles away. There was a lot of farms, so I started shoveling manure, you know, to get goat's milk, and I milked the goats in exchange for chickens and eggs and everything. Within three months, I gained 50 pounds. And all of a sudden, barely any pain. I'm looking like a scaled-down Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I went back to L.A. to spread the word. And I got there, and they said, Are you out of your mind? You're all meat. You're going to get a parasite and be an idiot. I said, Well, I've already been there. This is the only thing that's working. And I feel good. And if I die feeling good, that's okay. It's fine with me. But I don't want to live feeling pain and uncomfortable and weak all the time. So I continued eating the meat, but with great fear after it's drummed into your head you've got to eat a brain parasite. No, no, no, no. So I spent 13 years eating it two, three times a week with this fear every time I ate it that I was going to get a brain parasite. After 13 years, it dawned on me, Wait a minute, are you stupid? You had a vagotomy pyloroplasty. You had no hydrochloric acid in your stomach. Certainly bacteria and parasites are going to take over your body. I never had the case of them. I never had the diarrhea from it. I never had vomiting from it. So where did this research come from that came to this conclusion? So I went to Duke, I went to Yale, I went to Harvard, every one of the main medical schools, Berkeley, Washington University in St. Louis, Mayo Clinic, nobody had done any experiments with people eating raw meat. Parasite-infested raw meat or bacterial-infested raw meat. No tests with humans doing raw meat at all. So how the hell could they come to this conclusion? Unscientifically based nonsense. But when the medical profession postulates, it all of a sudden comes in stone, written in stone. And it has nothing to do with fact or reality. So then I started setting up tests, and I was doing some acting at the time. I was on general hospital for five and a half years, and did commercials to make lots of money to be able to perform these tests. 

So I got a laboratory to perform some tests, and we fed, we got lots of animals who already had parasites, fed them raw meat, and they got well, parasites went away, and we took animals that were very ill, had no parasites, fed them parasite-infested meats. They never got any parasites. They never got well... They never got sick. They got well eating these foods full of bacteria and parasites. They got well. They got through their diseases. So all this opposite stuff. So I realized that we're all completely brainwashed, just the opposite. Fats are the most important thing that we need, and yet we've had 25, 30 years drummed into us, a fatless diet. It came out seven years ago from Harvard and Yale saying, oh, we made a mistake. We find that there's 38% more disease in people on a fat-free diet. Oh, we're sorry. But eat some fat in one meal every day. Still, no research based on that statement. Eat fat once a day. Hello? They just make these arbitrary statements. Just think, because it's logical, that's what you should do. When all the other tribes who eat raw meats, eat fat with every meat meal. Every meal they eat, they eat tons of fat. The Maasai, the Samburu, the Fulani, all of these tribes live on nothing but raw products. The Fulani, 90% milk, raw milk. That's all they live on is raw milk, basically. And there's a 10 year period in the adulthood of a man, that he's only allowed to drink milk. And there's one period where you have to go for, I think it's 90 days of drinking as much milk as possible. And the man who can drink the most milk for that period, and become the fattest, becomes the king. The leader. And what I've found is, yes, fats bind with your poisons. Any poisons you find are in the liver, gallbladder, spleen, pancreas, wherever there's lots of fat. Brain, that's where you find your poisons. Unless you have fat people, and you have fat in your tissue. So, you should be happy being very overweight. Let me give you an example. In North Carolina, there's a group that got onto my diet three years ago. The people of Earth Haven. Very environmentally conscious group. And they're building a whole community in the Black Mountains. And they have their farms. Of course, they were all vegetarians. Every one of them. They were all sick. Fifty percent of my cancer clients are long-term vegetarians. So, I went there. And, you know, every year I go there around September. And, see, between July and September. And this last time I went there. Oh, one guy got on the diet, was on it for a year. Had such dramatic changes that 90% went from vegetarian that year into the primal diet. That quickly. And all of a sudden, instead of all this farming, you know, this agriculture, they've gone to farming. You know, they have pigs, they have goats, they have cows. All this meat that they're now growing and dairy. And they're all so much happier. The children are happier. They're learning better. Everything is much better. Now, this is a group of very conscious-minded ex-vegetarians. And they all look terrible. And then this one guy comes in this last September. And he looks like he came right out of a motorcycle gang. He's got the thick adipose tissue in the skin. I can tell they've been doing drugs for probably 25 years and alcohol for probably 30 years, heavily.

But I read irises. So I photograph the eyes, blow it up, and all of a sudden, the insides are clean. His liver, his pancreas, clean, working wonderfully. Everything looks clean except his skin and connective tissue. And his lymph system is a little worn out. And I said, you know, he's like only 30, 35 pounds overweight. And I said, this doesn't make any sense. And so he admitted that he'd been a drug user for 27 years. I mean, we're talking about heavy stuff. Heroin, cocaine, lots of it. And alcohol, almost every day for 30 years. So he'd been sober for two. And he'd been on the diet for 4 months. I said, well, let me tell you a secret. Four months ago, before I went on your diet, I was 300 pounds. Okay, that makes sense to me, because he had the fat to bind with all those poisons and protect him. And I find that people who are overweight, unless they're so overweight that they inhibit circulation and block functioning of organs, are always healthier. So, get fat and happy. And I'm very serious about that. Right now I'm on the slender side because I'm down. I got mugged in Bangkok almost three months ago. I did something very stupid my last night in Bangkok. Sit down, there's some seats here.

Q: Is the air conditioning on? It's very cold.

A: Oh yeah?

Q: It's freezing.

Q: Let me turn it off.

Q: Yeah, turn it off.

A: Can you turn the air conditioning off? Is there a way? 

Q: Raise it a couple of degrees.

A: Yeah, just raise it a couple of degrees.

Q: Open the door.

A: We can open a door here. Is that possible? And the one back there. And then we can open and close it as it gets warmer.

Q: Yeah, let's have some fresh air.

Q: The air conditioning is the problem.

Q: Yeah, let's get some fresh air.

A: Until we get to the air conditioning situation, let's let some warmth in here. There's a little breeze.

Q: It's the blowing.

A: Well, does it have a lever?

Q: No, there is a lever.

A: There's no lever.

Q: Yeah.

A: No, they're locked. The inner ones, if you can move those upwards, that would be the one.

Q: That helped open it.

A: Yeah, it helped right away. Okay, I'll continue while we work on the ventilation system. All right. So I found that fat is very, very important to make everybody protected and well and happy. Get fat. I was in Bangkok. My last scheduled day there, I'm building a health center there with two partners. One of them is 72. He had aggressive cancer, went on the diet and stopped it immediately. So he's a very wealthy man, very happy about it. All of his family's on the diet. His 40 and 50-year-old children are now going on the diet. So building a health center there because they want to contribute there. And we're going to build 12 of them over the planet. But we're starting there. So my last scheduled night in Bangkok, I decided to do something stupid. I take my video movie camera. I was going to go out and film nightlife in Bangkok. So I've got these seedy characters over in this corner. I'm just going along. And all of a sudden, I see them over there. I come close. And one of them came at me with a beer bottle. And I realized that they didn't want to be filmed. So I just moved away. And one of his buddies stopped him. So I get about two blocks away, getting near the hotel. And these guys jump out between the cars and mug me. One of them hit me with a board here, split my head open from here down to here. My gut started falling out in front of my eye. And while my head was going back, the other one hit me. The forensic doctor said they hit me with either a hammer or a crowbar right here, split my entire lip open in pieces all the way through to the teeth, broke the bone from here all the way to here, back and shoved it with my teeth under my tongue. So when my head was back at this angle after having the two blows, time stopped. I was able to decide, measure the damage done to me, decide what to do. So in that less than a split second, I flipped my body around, hit the pavement. And as I did, I saw the third guy coming like this. So the two are now behind me and one guy's coming far enough away. So I reacted quickly, brought my left leg up and kicked one in the kneecaps. And shot off between the cars, ran out to the street yelling, help, help. And all these white people started showing up everywhere because they recognized the white boy. So there were lots of men and women that came out. And I ran into a restaurant, and these three guys stayed out there. And then I realized who they were. They were the three guys that I had filmed. And they obviously were after the camera, but I had strapped to my wrist. If I had known they wanted the camera, I would have just given it to them. But while I was down on the ground, as I hit the ground, they obviously were Thai boxers and pretty big guys. They had kicked me, and everywhere they kicked me, there were welts this big. And I mean, just now, one of them relieved. It was like a tumor, created a tumor, hardened area. And I had never received blows like that. And it's funny, on the way home from Bangkok to L.A., they had this documentary on kickboxing and martial arts. And they showed that a kickboxer hits at the rate of a 35-mile-an-hour, 2,000-pound car. So then I realized how badly I had been damaged in my legs and mouth and eye. But the eye healed up in three days. I went back to the doctor. I stayed there in Bangkok to go through surgery the next day because I needed to have the bone put back in place. But the dentist there said that you split. 

There's a major nerve that goes all the way across the bottom, and all the teeth are connected to that. And I had broken it in two in two places, and the bone had been stretched back under my tongue with the teeth. And they said, well, we may as well pull seven of your teeth. I said, I've been through this before. When I had cancer, I had no bone around my teeth. They wouldn't pull them. I still had my teeth, except for two of them. So I'm going to trust the bone's going to grow back, and the nerve's going to grow back. Snickered. So I said, all I want you to do is pull the bone back in place. So I went through two hours of surgery about 11 hours later, 10 hours later. And they pulled it back. It was very painful. I let them give me Novocaine. It was a big mistake. Because the Novocaine, I am so healthy, it threw out my gums. And, of course, it burned my gums away. It turned white, and the gums just receded, just fell away. And in a hole, all the way from my palate up to my sinuses, as if I 
had a cleft palate, and it burned a hole right there.

[audio cut]

A: ...it all removed, and a retainer put in. The night before the retainer was made, and I had all of this metal taken out, it was a month and a half after the date of the accident. From that night, like 3 o'clock in the afternoon, till 9 o'clock in the morning, my teeth started settling. So the braces, and the plastic that they had had, and the metal that they had had prevented it. And this was supposed to be stainless steel. It was preventing my mouth from healing.

Q: The frequency is wrong.

A: Pardon?

Q: The frequency is wrong. Positively charged.

A: Whatever it was, it was causing a problem and all of this bleeding. So then I used the retainer off and on. I don't use it all the time. And then that was just, you know, 4 weeks ago. And all the teeth here are solid. These 2 right here aren't completely solid. See the separation here with the bone? The bone had disintegrated all the way down deep. It was all white and pussing. And they said it was never going to heal. It's grown back 50% already in 3 weeks. Almost 4 weeks. So it's quite amazing what the body can do on good nutrition. You know, I'm going to be 57 in about a month and a half. So I'm a young man compared to a lot of people my age. But that's because of the diet. The diet works so wonderfully. So forget everything you've ever learned about diets and learn anew. Because this one has reversed 95% of all diseases, no matter what they are. Except in 3rd and 4th states of Alzheimer's, it stops the progression, but does not reverse it. First or second, it does. And also in balding, it only reverses about 60% of balding. Other than that, oh, and in lung cancer and esophageal cancer, those are about 50%. Other than that, everything averages about 95% reversal. And that means vitality, you use everything. Okay, that's the free lecture part. I'm going to have a workshop to tell you what the diet is, how it works, how to do it well. And that is supposed to be $70, but somebody got it mixed up. It's supposed to be $70. This lasts about 4 1⁄2 hours. And then, or 3 hours, 3 1⁄2 hours, and then I spend, depending upon how many people, I do mini consults. What I do is look at the palm, and I look at different areas that indicate glandular activity, and also coloring, which tells me, it's like the Chinese reading of palms, but it's a little different. They have doctors that read health through palms. Mine's a little different, because I derive mine from actual people. I set up a table for 5 1⁄2 years on Venice Beach, where there's about 10 million people a year that pass by there. So I put the sign out there, Psychic Palm Reader. Psychic Palm Reader Nutritionist. Some of you saw me on some of those funny talk shows. Pulled me on because I was pretty accurate. They like that. But anyway, what I did was, I found people that had diseases, and I saw what similarities the people who had the same diseases had. So over a 5 1⁄2 year period, I was able to get a pretty good map of the palm. So I'll spend about 6 to 10 minutes with each individual, and then give you a suggested diet to help, and foods to help do the diet a little bit easier, so you have better choices, or more educated choices. And that is $30 a piece for the readings. And we do that right after the consults, I mean, after the workshop. Anybody who wants to stay and learn by that can listen to everybody else's. If somebody doesn't want anybody else to hear, they have to wait last. Now also, Sunday and Monday, I will be doing individual consults, where I take my macro camera, photograph both irises, blow them up on the screen up to a thousand times, and I can show you what is going on in your body, and suggest a more pertinent diet for your condition that is a little bit more extensive. That takes about an hour and 15 minutes, an hour and 10 minutes, and that's $300. Then after that, it's $200 for follow-ups, and usually I suggest people do it every year, and that's it.

If you want to be on a good diet, the diet is expensive in itself because the few foods you already get, but as far as my services to help you, let's say it costs you $500 a year, that's less than the thousands of dollars you're spending on any doctor bill, and this gets you well, not just treat symptoms. So with that, we're going to take about a 10-minute break and decide. What time is it?

Q: If anybody wants books, we have them.

[audio cut]

A: It makes so much sense. If we have lots of interruptions, it's going to break up that train. So I've learned over the years it's better... If you have a question, write it down so you don't forget it. When we give the question and answer period, probably most of your questions will already be answered. But if they're not, then you just ask them at the end. Did we get the air conditioning corrected, or do we just open the doors occasionally? 

Q: I think it's nice now.

A: Yeah, it's perfect right now. Okay, first of all, to understand about the body, bacteria is a major part of life. All bacteria, even those considered bad. As I mentioned in the recipe book, the University of Toronto, in association with the Hospital for Sick Children of Toronto, has been using E. coli, the verotoxin, the toxin produced by E. coli, to completely dissolve human brain tumors in two to five days, including the vessels going into it. I've got a comedy book that will be coming out. It will be the detoxification book. We'll be right before that, but a comedy book on how everything is backwards and upside down. It will be called Eat Shit and Live.

Q: Say that again.

A: It will be called Eat Shit and Live. That will probably sell very well, because it will be a funny perspective on the absurdities of everything. Now, the way I got into how much bacteria can help you is I looked at the work of Edward Howell, who's considered the father of enzyme nutrition. He's the one who started cataloging enzymes and what they do in systems, especially the human body and in some creatures like rats. And there was a doctor, an M.D., named Francis Pottenger, who did experiments with 900 cats over a decade, 10 years. That's a lot of research if you pay for it all yourself. He fed some of the groups raw, some of the groups cooked. In the cooked version, he had those that had just regular cooked meals, some that processed and even condensed milks and stuff like that. Each one of them had more serious diseases. They all had the same diseases of the cooked variety, but they were more complex and more common and more the processing of the food. All those animals on raw foods had no diseases, were clean and healthy, even until death and autopsy. He didn't let them live a full life. As soon as they had offspring and they adjusted, he would commit autopsies. He would kill them in autopsies just so he could study that many cats in a 10-year period. But even the fecal matter from those animals that ate raw was good fertilizer. The fertilizer from the animals who ate cooked food was bad fertilizer. It did not grow as well as good food and did not produce as good as fruits. Their leaves were more sparse. They were less green and not as rich and vivid in color. They would grow more like vines and closer to the ground. Their stalks weren't sturdy and hard and firm as those from the raw variety. Howell decided to do this in the 60s with rats. Rats only live three years, healthy rats. He fed half of them raw, half of them cooked, the same that they're used to eating, which is mainly meats, rats and meat eaters, basically. He fed them mainly meats, some fats here and there, but they were animal fats. He found that the rats all lived the same age, three years. Now, that was unusual because the Pottenger's cats lived only two-thirds of their normal life, those that were cooked. And even at the fourth generation, they were completely sterile. They could no longer produce offspring when they were grown entirely on cooked foods. So Howell was confused. He said they lived three years. So he tried to figure out, you know, tried to analyze the rat, if they had a particular enzyme or some factor that altered that experience and made them live a normal three years, even though they were diseased, had all the diseases that man gets, the ones that ate cooked foods. Couldn't find anything, couldn't see anything different. Then he was going over the notes made every day, and he realized that the animal, the rats were in the cooked groups, ate their fecal matter. So he said, okay, I'm going to do this test all over again and put a screen under it. Now, the group that ate cooked lived only two years instead of three years, which he realized the importance of E. coli and bacteria. E. coli is so important. It's the last stage of digestion. E. coli is responsible for you synthesizing B vitamins and amino acids, proteins. It's a backup for your entire system, immune system. It is your immune system, the backup for it.

I consider the immune system basically the lymph system, because the lymph system has to feed every cell in the body except for the red and white blood cells. It feeds every cell in your body. Its network is just as complex, but even greater than the nervous system and the bloodstream. Not only does the lymph system feed every cell in the body, it has to take all the waste products and toxins. It has to dissolve it, neutralize it, and send it out in one of your passages of the body. The bowels is a normal place to excrete toxins and the byproducts of food. We may take 7 pounds of food and reduce it into a 3 quarters of a pound turd. It's pretty impressive that we can do that with a factory and reduce it like that. But anywhere from 55 to 90% of foods is water. And it's electrolyte bound, which it is, and enzymatically and nutrient bound, ionically bound nutrients. Then we can use the water 100%. Once you cook it, you destroy all of that connection. You can absorb maybe 10% of that water at best and utilize it. The lymph system will discharge the poisons mainly through the skin. So when you have acne, rashes, you know that something pretty poisonous is leaving out the skin. And the lymph system is sending it out that way. You also have the tear ducts, earwax, sinuses, the mucus discharge, the gums, the tongue, the salivary glands, the vaginal cavity, rectum, urinary tract, nails. We build poisons into the nails and into the hair. Anywhere the body can discharge it, it will because we are so toxic. We live in such a toxic environment and eat such toxic food because when you cook something, it alters the chemistry completely. It destroys your vitamins, destroys the enzymes. Some minerals are cauterized as low as 98 degrees. Phosphorus is altered at 98 degrees. So once you keep going up higher, everything is destroyed. All enzymes are destroyed by 118 degrees. They become crippled at 105 degrees. If you keep going higher and higher, by the time you hit 122 degrees, you destroy or neutralize all vitamins. Even your vitamin E is supposed to be able to tolerate 170 degrees. It is still altered at low temperatures as low as 122 degrees. Then you go higher and higher and cauterize your minerals. They become glass in the system. They cannot be absorbed properly and they will lacerate cells. They will create very acrid conditions in your body and cause caustic responses. Dry skin, eczema, psoriasis, sores that don't heal, rashes, molds, yeast, all kinds of infections will result. And the yeast, the mold, are all trying to help you. The bacteria are all your friends. They're trying to get rid of the toxicity. It's just like you find a dead carcass that crows and vultures and worms and other parasites are eating. Now, they didn't create the decaying flesh that they're eating. They're there as an ecological response to keep our atmosphere from becoming a toxic, gaseous waste dump. But the medical profession looks at the vultures and the crows and the worms and the parasites. They're the problem. They're the problem when they're not. What creates degenerative tissue in the body is the problem. And the proportion of live to degenerative tissue in the body is important. And when you eat cooked foods, you not only destroy the nutrients in it, you create a lot of byproducts. And in the recipe book, I listed out 40.

Four of the main ones are acrylamides, advanced glycation end products, lipid peroxides, and heterocyclic amines. Very toxic substances, which are all carcinogenic. Now, the advanced glycation end products can come from even raw foods, where the enzymes and vitamins are all active and healthy. We are an animal that does not do well with sugar products, even raw fruits. It will degenerate our system. I'll get more into that later. When I was doing research trying to figure out why women live 20% longer, the only factual basis I could come up with in analyzing the system was that women produce 20% more mucus than men do in the vaginal cavity. They have an extra place to dump toxins, and it equals proportionally to that 20% extra longer life. Mucus is very important. There's a lot of dieticians out there, you know, the hygienic, that say mucusless diet. Mucus is bad for you. Don't drink dairy. Don't do all that. It creates mucus. Have you ever tried to have sex without mucus? Have you ever tried to speak a long time without mucus because of your throat, your larynx, vocal cords? How dry your nose is without mucus, how bloody it gets? How many people would have ulcers if they don't have mucus lining their stomach? Mucus is one of the most important fluids of the body. The more you produce, the healthier you will be because your body builds toxins into the mucus. Mucus has nice protein fibers. It looks like a woven blanket. And the poisons get locked in that mesh. And when you discharge it, it can be green, it can be yellow, it can be clear, but all of those are toxins moving out of your system. And you want to discharge that. The lymph system is responsible for all that breakdown and discharge. And no matter what circumstance, even in cancer, if you have lymph glands that are swollen and not as hard as rock, be thankful that they're swelling because they are taking the poisons, mainly dead cells when you have cancer. Cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve and discard dead cells from the body. So the tumors are temporary stations to hold these dead cells until your liver recuperates and starts manufacturing or digesting and utilizing fats properly to make solvents to dissolve them or to utilize bacteria and parasites to eat these dead cells. If you have congestive lymphatic or swelling in those areas, you know that your lymph system is working. If they turn as hard as rock, you know it isn't working. It's collecting the dead cells. There's no exterior fluid or no extra lacteal in the lymph system to dissolve those dead cells, so they're just collecting there like a tumor. But as long as you have swelling in lymph glands, you should be happy. It's not a bad sign. If you have lumps in your breast, you'll be happy because it's cleaning out the toxins. Then following that, you may see a little rash or breakout that comes up around that area, whether it's in the crotch, because the main lymph glands are down here, here, under the arms, and in the neck. So if you have swelling in any of those places, your lymph system is working for you, and that's a wonderful thing to have them working for you.

Now, since we are so toxic and have so much degenerative tissue, if our bodies have to make a solvent, which are basically virus, this whole thing about viruses self-replicating, it's like science is looking, just like if, let me use an analogy, if they go into your home and they find soap in every laundry room, they say, oh, it's self-replicating. They can't tell where it's coming from, because they don't see you going out and manufacturing the soap and bringing it back in. A hundred years ago, we all made soap. We boiled lard, rendered it with lye, and there was the soap. Or we took coconut oil and just used pure coconut oil, or put it with a little bit of lye, and that was our soap. Everything was made of coconut oil, practically. When coconut oil became easily shipped all over the world, now it's all rare. Now everybody's using petroleum and [unintelligible] and all those other toxins to make soaps, which basically poisons your body, destroys bacteria. Now when your body uses a solvent to break down tissue, it's like you taking a pail of soapy water and going around and dissolving grease and grime, and all of this gets collected in this mass of fluid that gets discharged throughout the whole system. It's not an efficient way to clean up the body. If you have parasites and bacteria going in there and eating that toxicity and reducing it to 10 to 100 times the amount of waste product, that is lowering the amount of waste to be discharged from the body. It's like we take seven pounds of food a day and we'll discharge it in half to a third-course of a pound, sometimes a pound of fecal matter. Well, parasites can take 100 times their weight and reduce it to 1% discharge. Parasites are a lovely creature because they will get you well faster than any other method. I did a laboratory test with animals who had... We put an ad in the paper and we asked for animals who were elderly and had parasites already, had been diagnosed with parasites. We got about 32. And we fed some of the groups raw foods, cooked foods. Then one group got three other groups got raw food. One group got dewormers, pharmaceutical dewormers. The third group got raw foods with herbal or homeopathic dewormers. And the third group got no deworming, just the raw foods. The ones who just got the raw foods took longer to get rid of their symptoms of parasites. However, they got young. Their insides were immaculate when they finally died and we did autopsies. Clean, so the parasites went in there and ate up all the garbage. And as long as they got the raw foods, they were able to regenerate. So they worked with the parasites. Bacteria doesn't eat as much as parasites do. And it's large, so parasites are your best bet. However, I've never been able to induce them. And I've eaten lots of parasite-infected tissue. One time I had a piece of salmon that was undulating with the pen line, white. And I ate it, I had my feces, urine, blood checked for 10 weeks, no parasite. Now that could be because I had chemotherapy. And all of my tissues are saturated with this poison. And as soon as the parasite would eat it, it would die. It could be killed because we did some laboratory tests, infecting some tissue with the chemotherapy that I had.

Sure enough, that's what happened. If you can breed parasites in your body, you get well faster. I wasn't able to do it. I had to go the slow road of using fats and solvent like viruses, solvents to dissolve tissue, so it takes longer. All in all, though, we have to look to the cleansers. And the cleansers are your bacteria, parasites, virus, any other kind of solvent that the body can make. And the lymph system is responsible for most of the activity going on and the byproducts being reduced, neutralized, and sent out one of the passages in the body. So if you understand that, you'll understand how biological the body is. It is not a machine that reacts off of mechanics, like the medical profession and scientific community would like you to believe, because if they accept that premise, then they would have to be responsible for all the toxic byproducts that they produce. For instance, you know that every time you use food and plastic, that it gases a product called BPA, which is benzene. And last year, a test came out and showed that 82 to 86% of laboratory animals who are subjected to that got brain tumors. So the FDA says, OK, we're going to outlaw this in five years. Five years? Why not now? Well, all these companies have all this investment. They have to change over. They have to find something else. Oh, but they can bloat the shit out of us and cause, you know, our children to have brain tumors so that they can, you know, get rid of the war and take the billions of dollars and let's protect our children and each other. They don't think that way. This isn't what's happening. So the reality is you have to do the best you can. Stay away from plastic water and plastic bottles. Stay away from food and plastic. If it's refrigerated and plastic, it doesn't gas as much. So if you get it home and it's refrigerated product, put it in glass when you get home. Okay, we're going to go into nutrients now. Now, there are – I'm going to count bacteria as a nutrient, although they are independent organisms which are our best friends that help us. Let me give you one more analogy to that so it can help you realize how important bacteria and parasites are. Let's say you had a mansion and you had all of these employees and you started to cook them to death. Are they going to do any work for you? You're going to clean the house and the mansion yourself. Can you, one person, clean that whole mansion? Absolutely not. You're going to get depressed, very depressed, because you spend your whole life working very hard. That's what happens when you cook food, you destroy the nutrients. So the pancreas has to send out a hormone that leaches from every cell in the body, just a little bit at a time. So it's like two thugs going around and saying, coming to your door and saying, we need some money, we need some clothes, we need this, we need that from you. So every cell is getting robbed a little bit, every time you eat a cooked food. That weakens the system. Why do you think these elderly people get weaker and weaker and weaker and weaker? You see the person who takes five minutes to get across the street, how many cells are alive in that body? 22, 25%? It has to take the whole load of the entire body.

Most people drop dead when they reach 22% life. That means 22% cells are alive in their body and 78% of their body is dead, carrying around. So if you eat live foods, especially live meat, you're going to be regenerating the cells. You're going to be a lot healthier and happier. And you're not going to leach from every cell in the body. You're always going to add to the body. And this question always comes up, well, how about if I do the diet 50% or eat one raw meat meal a day? If you ate only one raw food in your life, you'd be doing a better service to your body. The more you do, the better. The more cooked you eat, you're taking away. But you're not going to ruin anything that you do good for it. Anytime you do anything good, it's a good thing for your body. It doesn't have to be all or nothing. I do it all or nothing because I don't want to ever go back to where I've been. And if the last time I ate something cooked was probably 19... Anyway, I had some popcorn with my butter and stuff. I mean, I lost energy for about six hours. I only need about four and a half hours sleep a day. And I don't have to have it all at one time. I can have it in 10 minute spurts or an hour and a half or something like that. I can go 24 hours a day or 19 and a half hours a day with full alertness and can accomplish everything I want. I have no fatigue, no drain, no upset, no depression. When, you know, 360 days of my life used to be spent on depression and illness. I don't want to even go there for an hour or two hours. That's why I'm 100%. I like life. I like life functioning properly, well, feeling good. I'm not into masochism where I'll live with a drain just so I can have something that used to taste good to me. Thank God now those things don't taste good to me. But the more you do for your body, the better. The more raw foods, the better it will be for your system. The result of your body not having bacteria in it to help you break down waste products in the system and discharge it out the lymph is depression. Recognized or unrecognized depression. So when I realized that, and I realized how happy the Eskimos were when they ate all of that decomposed, stinky, foul-smelling meat. I mean, these kids were jumping up and down for joy. Something smelled that bad, how can you be that excited about it? And really, you get happy, and I thought back and I said, yeah, I really felt good after, you know, about 20 minutes after eating that stuff. I felt really happy. So then I started using all my very difficult clients. Like one of them was a pretty well-known yoga instructor. Always been slim, looked pretty good, dry skin, never has had a relationship since she was ever in her life. She started getting depressed at about 11 or 12 years old. She'd been on five medications a day for 27 years by the time she came to me. And she was a basket taster. A good day for her was, I feel good today. That was a good day. And I'm not exaggerating, that's what it was like. And after a year and a half, I kept trying to get her to take some of the high meat. When I make the meat with lots of high bacteria, I call it high, high in bacteria. The Inuit word, the Eskimo word for that meat is high meat, because it makes you happy and high and it's high in bacteria.

It's high in life, it helps you. So, after a year and a half, I'm on the phone with her and I said, I was going to say her name but I won't. You've got to try the high meat. I'm not going to work with you anymore because it's like on a seesaw. Going up and down emotionally with you. You'll do the diet, you won't do the diet. The more you get into depression, the less you do the diet, the worse you get. I said, you can't control it, so you need some extra help. Treat this like medication. I'd just like you to have it once. Just try it. If it doesn't work, I'll keep plundering along with you. Until we get it right, until you get through it. I said, before I'm going to help you anymore, I need you to try the high meat. I'm already on this crazy diet. It's so antisocial. I eat raw meat. What else do you want? Boom. That would be going on for about a year or so. The next morning, I guess it was so bad for her, she said, okay, I'll try it. What do I do? I said, well, you have to cut up the meat into small, bite-sized pieces. You have to let it sit for four weeks, and you have to air it out every three days. She said, I don't have four weeks. I said, okay, well, there's one of my patients who is making the high meat. I'm sure he has more than he needs. I won't sell it to you because I don't want to get in trouble. You buy it from this guy, and you'll have your high meat. So she went and did it. I got a call that night about 7 o'clock in the evening. I just had an instinct not to answer the phone. It was her. I just took the high meat about 45 minutes. I'm very concerned. I need to talk with you. I'll be babysitting her all through the night. There's no need for that. Not anything to worry about. So every hour, she would call. And every hour, her voice got lighter. 5 o'clock in the morning, 5.30 in the morning, she was whistling, waiting for me to answer the phone. This is a completely different personality from eating it one time. The woman now eats it every day. A large, marble-sized amount every day. She likes feeling good every day. She has no longer dry skin. She is a good example of yoga. She's a yoga instructor now. Not only that, she has a boyfriend who's 10 years younger than she is, and an ex-Chippendale model, and she is no knockout. But now that she is so happy, she's been to hell. She knows what hell is like, so she's even happier than most people. So she's a sweetheart now. Here was a bitch that turned sweetheart on foul-smelling, what the medical profession will tell you will kill you. And they don't have a clue. They don't know. They just assume it. And you know the first three letters of assume. So don't be afraid of all that bacteria. They are your friends. They take all this massive amount of waste product and reduce it to a small amount of waste. So they are your best friends. Enjoy them. There are tribes... All animals in nature eat bagel matters, except for civilized humans. In Georgia, Russia, I saw a National Geographic film way back in the 70s. And the camera was pulling out on this beautiful black-haired woman with these amber eyes. You see something chewing. You see her hand like this. She's just happy and bright and shining. And then you see this pull back further. You see this buffalo tail waving behind her head. And then you see her reach down, pick something up, and they keep pulling out this big, huge water buffalo cow patty sitting there. And that's what she's eating.

Q: Wow.

A: That's what she's eating. Now, you have to understand that when I broke it down analytically, a cow, any herbivore, has a digestive tract two and a half times longer than ours. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the protein and fat from it. They have two to four stomachs. We have one. They have the ability to chew, regurgitate, rechew, swallow five to seven times per mouthful of food that they will chew on. And then it takes 48 hours for that food to pass through the digestive tract. And even at that, you still see pulp come out. But two-thirds of it is digested. We only digest one-third. So guess what if we eat the fecal matter? We only have one-third of that fecal matter to digest. And guess what concentrations we're going to get? Protein, and lots of B vitamins, and everything in perfect form. So you see dogs and cats will go for fecal matter like crazy. You see a cat eat a baby's, you know, diarrhea or discharge in a flash if you're not around. All animals do it, including uncivilized humans. So eat shit. Now Yale University has been using salmonella to shrink and dissolve human tumors, or tumors in general. Vion Products, a year and a half ago, marketed attenuated salmonella. And you know what they're charging? $8,000 per injection. Then they're going to, they attenuated it. It means they've altered the salmonella. So it now goes in and chokes off the oxygen to the tumor, but does not eat up the tumor. Now it just chokes off the oxygen. So now the pharmaceutical house sells you, per injection, a $20,000 solvent to dissolve that tumor. Let some rotten, let some eggs ripen and eat your salmonella. Let some chicken ripen, eat some salmonella. Don't spend $20,000 for a treatment to get rid of cancer. There are 18 universities using smallpox bacteria, all kinds of virus and bacteria now, to get rid of cancer. I just got one article yesterday on botulism. They're using botulism to stop excessive perspiration in some people. And there's no toxic effect. We're told that botulism is the problem. We're told that E. coli is the problem. It's not the problem. The chemicals which contaminate the body are the problem. People don't die of bacterial food poisoning. There was a little girl who was supposed to have gotten an E. coli. One E. coli from an apple juice? Give me a break. One E. coli they found in an apple juice. They blamed the apple juice for this girl's death. When that girl was treated, guess what antibiotic she was given? Cipro. And guess what cipro causes? Degeneration of the kidney. And what did that girl die of? Degeneration. Degeneration of the kidney. So what did they do?They pointed to the E. coli to have caused that. Now I got online with her husband. Her husband's a doctor too. The woman who treated that little girl. And I said, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. Prove in any experiment that E. coli, natural E. coli, made a degenerative condition in a human kidney, or any kidney. No test has ever been done on that. So you're assuming that's what caused it, the E. coli, because you're blaming her symptoms on E. coli. But you take a look at Cipro, which she was given. Her husband shut up. I didn't hear from him ever again. Because she knew. He knew if I kept going online, talking about it, that somebody was going to get back and start suing all these doctors. 

They're always going to blame the bacteria. They're not going to blame their drugs, because then there's a problem. And how about the law that was just passed? Guess what? Your vaccine companies, your chemical companies, your pharmaceutical houses, no longer have responsibility for any drug damage. Just last year.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh yes. Absolutely. Yep. So unless people wake up and fight this in the courts, this is it. We're in Nazi land. Basically. Pardon? Charcoal what? Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, a pathologist doesn't always tell you. He's trying to tell you there's a magic bullet, but there's no magic bullet. There's no magic bullet for it. Nothing, no charcoal can stop that kind of degeneration. Charcoal can attract certain elements and keep it from damaging tissue, but not like an antibiotic, like Cipro. And Cipro was never approved. So they used that little girl as a Guinea Pig as well, who died. And they blamed it on E. coli. Now, with that case, you're not allowed to buy a juice in any market unless it's pasteurized. The only place you can get a raw juice is they juice it for you right in a juice market. It's the only time they're allowed to give you raw juice. Any juice that's pre-made in a bottle has to be pasteurized. 

Q: You can't buy cider vinegar then. 

A: Cider vinegar is not considered a juice. It's got a high lactic acid. Yeah, you can buy raw apple cider vinegar, but not apple cider. Unless it's directly from somebody juicing it for you, making it for you. Okay, so, in the body, we have these elements that we have to feed the body. We know that vitamins and enzymes and minerals and all of these elements are your workers. While the minerals can sometimes be your activators, if the ions are proper, and the supplies are the proteins, the carbohydrates, and the fats. So, your enzymes are your workers, your vitamins are your supervisors, your DNA and RNA are the architects. All of them have to be active in a biological form. Once it's cooked, all of that is completely separated. The heavy metals in it, all foods have metals. They have arsenic, they have lead, they have cadmium. All foods contain all of those elements. They are only toxic when they are not enzymatically, nutrient, and ionically bound. And that's when you cook something, it's just like that, gone in a flash. That's it. It's like burning your arm and expecting it to work. It doesn't work anymore. Everything is separated. Muscles aren't going to work because they're burned away. Everything is burned. So you have all this burned flesh and nothing functions. That's what happens when you cook food. So all of those minerals, those metals that are in your system that could have been good for you, are now free radicals and are poison for your system. You have to leach nutrients just to handle those. Now, all animals live, all healthy animals live, seven times the time it takes for them to finish maturation. Maturing. For us, that's about 21 years old. So we should be living to 147 years minimum. So we're living about half of that. Why? Because we mainly eat cooked food. Before, a hundred years ago, it may be because stress was so difficult. You didn't have air conditioning, you didn't have heating. And, you know, to make a fire was not easy. And you had all the carbon monoxides going up in your house. If you had a stove in your house. So you had all these poisons working on. And a woman, a hundred years ago, if she wasn't fat, she was considered undesirable. Because if she had children, she's likely to die in the winter. Not likely to make it. And a family without a mother was considered a very unprosperous condition. So your women had to be fat. They had protection from the cold, and they had plenty of fat to fight off any kind of detoxification in the form of flu or cold or pneumonia. And especially, a lot of pneumonia happened because they were constantly burning the stoves in their houses without proper ventilation. So lots of toxicity there. But for us, it's pollution. Too much cooked food. Too easy to cook something, throw it in the microwave. Then you get radioactivity and you cook your food. So you'd be glowing.

[audio cut]

A: ...the nutrients. So they don't have the bacteria to help them clean the house. To manage in the body. Now, every element has its place. But we have to take a look at the human system. I talked about even fresh fruits being a problem in the human system. Why is that? Because in the human body, it can only handle a little bit, 5% carbohydrate. Once it goes over that 5% balance of the diet, too many advanced glycation end products are formed. And those, according to Columbia University, those advanced glycation end products, whether they come from a raw food or a cooked food, store at a rate of 70 to 90%. 70% in a healthy body. 90% in an unhealthy body. That's a tremendous amount of waste product. We can only handle 5% a day of that kind of waste production. Any more than that, we're in trouble. So what happens? It collects, causes deterioration of the bones. Of the tissues. Osteoporosis. Irritability. Irritates the nerves. Especially if it's a high vitamin C, citric acid complex, like pineapple. It'll rip the nervous system apart. It stores, and it is also carcinogenic, as it stores over a 40-50 year period. A lot of people say, well, we're like the apes and the monkeys. They eat lots of fruit. I mean, except for the killer monkeys. Killer monkeys eat everything fresh and raw. I mean, fresh and fruity. Lots of sugar in it. And they go around killing all other... For no reason. Don't eat them. They just kill them. Because of this high sugar irritating their nervous system. 

Q: Like kids. 

A: Yeah. Kids will react just like that. Exactly. If they're skinny, especially. John Goodall. He was editing a major motion picture. An independent major motion picture. In 1970. And 71. And he was in the editing room next to me. And John Goodall is the father of Jane Goodall. And he was off in Africa following monkeys and gorillas. Long before she was. Before she was in college. And he made a movie called The Beginning. He won an Academy Award, I think it was 1971. And he lived with an ape for 30 days. Waiting for her to give birth. And you know what that birth was like? On film. It's phenomenal. First hint that she was going into labor, she goes. Walks over to a corner. And she goes. That was it. That was the birth. Just like that. Licked it. Cleaned it. It was great. That was the birth. No screaming, no yelling, no crying. It was fine. But apes will eat, every 28 days, 14 pounds of meat at a time. They'll kill an antelope. So they're not vegetarians. And when they eat fruit, they eat it green. So John and his crew were over in Africa, following this tribe of gorillas. Couldn't figure out why they were eating it. You know, they'd eat the peel too. You know how alamine that is? You know, how could they get enough saliva to swallow it? So alamine. But that's the way they ate all bananas. So John and his crew were trying to figure out why. So they wanted to introduce a ripe banana to them. So they cut down this huge bunch that took up the whole back of a Jeep. And they followed the gorilla tribe for about a week or so. Ten days until almost all of the bananas on this bunch ripened. And then the three of them took it and put it out in the middle of the tribe of gorillas. And the gorillas were very curious. They'd come up, rip one off, try to bite and squeeze all over. You know, they weren't used to it. Couldn't figure out what was going on. So after about 40 minutes they figured, you know, one of them peeled it. And the other started peeling and started eating them. And they couldn't stop eating them. Then within 40 minutes they were all fighting over these. I mean, they had enough to last a couple of weeks. But they were fighting. Every one of them was jealous, possessive, of all these bananas. Each one of them. One of the little teenagers was killed. No, one of the adolescents was killed in this, trying to get some bananas. And one of the teenagers got a broken leg. The crew, John Goodall and the crew, couldn't get in there to get the bananas away from them. And it took that whole tribe almost two months to settle down. They never fought before. They had followed them for, I think, five and a half months up to that point. Never fought, they never argued, they never hit each other except in play. And in that 40 minutes after eating all those ripe bananas, they went bananas. And that's where that expression comes from, because the African knows it. Africans have seen this. The African, you know, humans go bananas. Because it will make them crazy, the high sugar content. So, all birds, you'll see them when they eat figs, they're green. Some birds will eat ripe, some ripe berries, but mostly it's all green. Almost all animals eat green fruit. High in enzymes, low in sugar.

What happens to the sugar when it gets into the digestive tract? It ferments and becomes alcohol. Alcohol searches for fat. It's useful in the citric acid cycle to help utilize fat as fuel, but it's only 5% of that cycle. 15% protein, 80% fat. We need lots of fat. We need a lot of protein and very little carbohydrate. So I may have fruit two days a week only. Those who need more cleansings may have one piece every day, and I do recommend it for most people, having it once a day in the afternoon. Protein. Now the sugars, like I say, they help build solvents to clean the body and also to utilize fat as energy. That is all that sugar is used for. So if you have too much, you're going to spend too much time dissolving stuff in your body and trying to use your fuel energy off of carbs. And how quickly do carbs burn? Gone. A lot of people say, well you can't put, you know, athletes need quick energy. Yeah, my marathon runners, when they went on it, one in New York, you know, running for 30 years. He went on the diet, and in three months, three and a half months, he took 40 minutes off of his time. Do you realize how many 40 minutes, how much time 40 minutes in a marathon is? It's a phenomenal amount of time. And the professional runner who had been running for 23 years out of Las Vegas, in two and a half months, took 20 minutes off of his time. So fat is a very good utilizing fuel for endurance or short term. You just have to have 5% fruit with it, carbohydrate with it, that's all it takes. And I have an athlete who is 56 years old. When he went on the diet, he's into martial arts, and he goes into the world championship every year. And at his age, the cutoff is I think is 57 years old, and then he goes into another category. But from 42, I think it is, 43 to 57, those people are in one category. So that's almost a 15 year spread there. That's a big ratio between youth and our day. So somebody at 43 is going to be much healthier and more active than somebody 57 years old. So he's been on the diet a year, and when he works out, he jump ropes. He jumps ropes three sessions a week. One of them, he will do 2,700 jumps with a heavy rope, and three pound shoes, and jump. Can you imagine, 2,700? Then another time of the week, he does 3,800 jumps. And the third time of the week, 12,200 jumps. And he does it in an hour. His heart rate, before he went on the diet, he had been watching it for, I think it was almost a year. And his heart rate averaged about 170 after the workout. After a year on the diet, it was averaging about 112. So he wasn't even out of breath after doing that. He went into the championships that year, and instead of coming in 30th or 40th place in his group, he came in 5th place. And everybody was 10 to 12 years younger than him. Very little carbs. Once a day. And all my athletes are like that. Fats are your key to strength. Take a look at your weightlifters. All fat. Your bodybuilders are all pumped up muscle, but they're not very strong. Schwarzenegger was, because he used to eat a lot of raw meat in Austria, they ate a lot of raw meat and a lot of raw eggs. So he was one bodybuilder that was strong. But most of your weightlifters are all fat. It takes fat to have strength.

So understand the importance of fat. It's to give you strength and energy. It's also to protect the body. If you don't have good fat in your tissues, protecting your skin, what happens? The sun will burn you, it'll cause you to dry out, you'll flake, you'll have a problem. Fats lubricate the skin, lubricate the entire body, protect the cells, any acid in the fluids of your body. You've got the fats there to keep it from eating into your cellular wall. If I throw citric acid on your skin and you have no good lubrication in your skin, what's it going to do? It's going to irritate, eat away at your skin and dry it out. If you've got a good layer of butter on your body, what happens? Beads off, no problem, won't hurt, won't damage you, there's no harm done. Also, your body stores poisons in the fats. That's why your glands have so many poisons in them. Because that's where it goes, to where fats are. And if you don't have any fats in the body, all your glands will be contaminated, including your brain. And then where does the poisons go? The poisons go into the nervous system, make lesions in the nervous system, pull the fat out of the myelin.
And leave you wired and hysterical and antsy and hyperactive. The ultimate bitch or bastard. And that's who it is, these hyperactive, skinny people. You wonder why they have so much energy. If they don't keep moving and burn off that carbohydrate, they won't have a nervous system. So they're hyperactive because they have to be. They're not nice because they have to do it that way. And you'll find that the people who don't exercise with that condition are worse. People who exercise with that condition are a little bit more mellow because they're burning it up with their exercise. They're still deteriorating and drying out and will probably have a cardiac arrest or some kind of cirrhosis of some gland. Drying up and hardening of the gland in their late 40s and through their 50s and usually drop dead in their 50s. So you have a lot of aneurysms, heart, brain aneurysms. People dropping dead at that age, people who are supposed to be very athletic and healthy, they drop dead because they dry out inside. Fats are ultra important for so many things. Fat in our society especially is so important. Then if you look at the Maasai, Sambulu, they're very skinny people. Tall, bright, intelligent, smartest, calmest of all tribes. The meat eaters and the dairy eaters, raw dairy eaters and raw meat eaters. But they're skinny because they don't need all that excess fat because they're not living in a toxic environment. When they realized white men, that actress who went over to Africa, the one who believes in reincarnation and all that, Shirley MacLaine, giving candy to the Maasai. And the Maasai realized they were going bananas, their whole tribe. So they went to the government and said, we don't want any more whiteys near our tribe. They ride every day 20 miles to do rituals for them, to entertain them, but they're not allowed near us again. And they're not allowed to bring and give us anything. Food, clothes and stuff like that, they accept no food, no food elements. And that's been going on for 22 years. Because they're smart to it. But they don't have to have all that excess fat on their body because they don't eat anything toxic. They're not exposed to pollution. We do. We need fat. 

And I gave that example earlier today about the guy who was 300 pounds. And his glands were clean, even though his connective tissue and his skin were damaged. His organs were still in great shape because he had all that fat to bind with poison. So I encourage everybody, like I said in the recipe book, to get fat. Now, a lot of my clients, you know, I'm in Hollywood and L.A. areas. But all these, you know, mad actors and actresses that, you know, I've got to be thin. I said, no you don't. Look at all your good funny actors who are out there making a lot of, look at Roseanne Barr. Look at, you know, Rosie O'Donnell. All these women who are fat that are funny and entertaining and wonderful. So you don't have to be that. One of the women who is on the diet is Kirstie Alley. You know, you saw how big she was getting. Then all of a sudden a year and a half ago she started trimming down. And she got all this color and looked bright and happy. And you see those Pier 1 import, you know, ads before she went on to the diet and then after. You see all this color in her and all this vibrance that she had never had before. And she cheers. She had the personality but the vibrance is there. And look at Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson is not my patient, but he found my book in a health food store. And he went on the raw meat. Went on David Letterman two years ago and said, you know, because he went from being an alcoholic and a junk food eater and a heavy smoker to being a clean person. And David Letterman says, God, you look so great. What are you doing? You look at the, what was that called, the war pictures, the Civil War pictures.

Q: Patriot.

A: He went from the Patriot to what women want. And it's like two different people. He's got all this adipose tissue, all this alcohol damage. And then you look at him a year later in this What Women Want. I think that was the name of it. And you see all this clean skin and he's fit and tight and all that. David Letterman says, what did you do? He says, well, I eat raw meat. He says, no. He says, you really want to know? Yeah. He says, I eat raw meat and so do my kids. We eat all raw food. Mainly raw food. And you see these people and you can see it can work. Martin Sheen, often when he goes on and off the diet. But you saw him a year and a half ago before he went on the diet a year ago. And you saw all fat and everything was getting whiter and everything was sagging more. Now you see him, he's only eating 50% of the diet. And you see that everything's bright and tighter and good. Charlie's the only one in that family that doesn't do anything on the diet. He looks the worst. And everything's falling on him quickly. But he's this intellectually into the medical profession. The others aren't. But you can see the problems that I have in Hollywood with this thinness attitude. So I've got several women directors, pretty famous women directors. You know, very skinny, but never had relationships because they weren't nice enough. They couldn't be calm enough to be nice enough. So they didn't have relationships. And they're complaining, well I have to be thin because I can have relationships. I said, what the hell are you talking about? You haven't had no relationships. So, since you don't have any, get fat. Nobody's looking at you. And see what, you know. Nobody's desiring you, so go ahead and do it. How long has it been since you've had a good relationship. Never had a good relationship. Well, get fat and see what happens. So, one of the women directors who just won an award two years ago for one of her films, all of a sudden put on all this weight. And I mean, it was massive. She went into peritonitis, I mean, meningitis. And it looked like she was near death. And she's only been on the diet for about eight or nine months. And everybody thought she was going to die. Even my patients that would go over. We have a group in L.A. which support each other. So, if you're bedridden, if you're going through heavy detoxification, which isn't normal, these volunteers will take your food, prepare your food, help feed you, take you to the beach, do anything for you. And it's a great, lovely group. So, that's what they were doing. All of these guys were calling me. All these people were calling me and saying, she looks like she's going to die. I said, I don't think so. I don't think so at all. She's not in that kind of a state. I've been around people who die. I know what takes place in that period. So, I went over to see her. I usually don't make house calls, but I did. And I went in there and I started laughing. Here she is. She looks like a pear. I mean, because of this thing, I said, you need a tremendous amount of fat. I want you to eat a minimum of a pound of butter a day. I want you to eat at least 18 raw eggs a day. And plus, I want you to eat a pound of meat, mainly chicken, raw chicken. So, she'd eat all that. And I hadn't seen her in a couple of months. So, she was just like the old Jewish pear. She was huge down here.

All this cellulite everywhere. And she was thinner up here. And I started laughing because I was so happy to see her with so much weight. And I could see it in her eyes. Her eyes were so clear. I knew that she wasn't even near death. She looked like she might. She might, you know, because of the way she distended and was so overweight. And she was so white looking. And she was so weak and could barely breathe. Yeah, most people might think she was going to die. And her ex-husband, who she never had a good relationship with, called this famous MD for the stars, got her over there, and she took one look at my client and said, you know, if you don't go to the hospital, you're going to die. You've at least got pneumonia. Very severe pneumonia. So, she called me and said, this woman said I'm going to die. And I said, don't listen to her. She doesn't know. She's never gone through this with anybody before. And I said, those people who go through meningitis or pneumonia are the people who progress fastest. Because they get well quicker with some intense detoxification like that. Two weeks later, strong as an ox. Now, she's got a boyfriend who looks like he could have been a Chippendale model. Fifteen years younger than she is. Banging her head off every day. Every day he has sex with her. And here she is still overweight. Looks pretty good now, you know, a year later. You know, she's trimmer. She still has much bigger hair. And she's three sizes larger than she was. But she has a relationship. And the guy adores her. She's so nice and happy. So all this bullshit about being skinny and never having a relationship, it's not working. Get fat and happy. Put on that weight, protect yourself. Enjoy it. More of you to love. And the men the same way. It works. Very helpful. So, I'm always pleased when I see people overweight. I say, they'll probably have some protection. They don't. The poisons go right into your cellulary. They go into the fat. They go into your cells searching for fat. First glands, where the fat is, the nervous system, and then just regular old cells. So you deteriorate and dry out quickly. Fat, the most important nutrient on this diet. Like I say in the first book, 60-75% of your diet should be fat. Calorically. 65-80% to 75% of your diet, calorically, should be fat. That doesn't mean, you know, balance-wise. When I'm eating meat, I'll eat, you know, volume-wise, I'm eating a pound of meat at one time, I'll have at least 8 ounces of fat with it. You know, a mixture of like 4-5 ounces of butter with 1-2 eggs. Lots of fat. Lots of fat. And, you know, I've been on this diet now, eating raw meat on a daily basis for 21 years as of December. I'm only halfway. It takes 40 years to clean the body. Took 21 years to build it, takes 21 years to disassemble it, and another 21 years to rebuild it. So it's about 40 years. I'm only halfway. I'm 57 in April, and I'm getting healthier every day. Less sleep is necessary. More energy. Feel better every day. And I've got so much more focus. Key to focus is your second food consumption in the day. Meat should be the second thing that you eat in the day. Now the protein, that's just a tease to keep you thinking. Focus and all that. But I want to finish going over the nutrients first. So we've covered sugars. We've covered fats. Now proteins. Proteins are your building blocks for every cell.

How do these get structured? Enzymes. Destroy your enzymes, your body has to leach them. Your workers get imported from some other area, so that body gets less, has less strength, has less energy, because your body has to take those enzymes and put them into the digestive area, and then to utilize for structure. We age so much because we don't eat live nutrients. If you eat raw meat, you can regenerate anything. Now three, four dentists all told me that there was no way that I could regenerate that nerve down here and rebuild that bone. Because of the severity of the damage at my age. Proved them wrong. Here it is, not even three months. The 5th of March, I mean the 1st of March, it will be three months since this damage. Still can't chew anything with the front teeth yet. That will probably be another month. But I didn't lose seven teeth, and those nerves are still alive, and the gum is growing back, and the bone is growing back fine. To them, that's a medical miracle. Absolute miracle. And when I went to the dentist two weeks ago to have him look at it, he said, I don't believe this. He says, your teeth are actually solidly, you know, firming in there. Because when I had the braces and the wiring on, there was very little healing. In fact, my mouth was always bloody, my tongue was always bloody. But three weeks, or two weeks, of having the braces and the wiring off, it was healing that rapid. He couldn't believe it. Raw meat is the only thing that can do that. Because when you cook meat, you have, from the proteins, you have heterocyclic amines formed, these toxins, and you have lipid peroxides formed from the fats. These are carcinogenic poisons as they collect and store in the body. Carcinogenic, that means they are cancer-producing toxins. So if you're eating this raw meat, you're getting the nutrients you need for cellular division. And that's how cells reproduce. They don't give off an egg or a little reproduction. They actually split in two and you have two of the same thing. Raw meat is the only thing that allows that after the age of 25 on a regular basis. Some people have human growth hormones that will reach them into 40 years old, but that's a rarity. Most people cease forming large amounts of human growth hormones when they're about 21. Some will go a little higher until they're 25, but that's usually the cutoff limit. And then it's nothing but you keep the cells you have alive, that's all you get. That's your bank account. You introduce raw meat, then you say, hey, I can keep adding to my bank account. My bank account can grow. Get rid of dead cells and put on new live cells. It takes many years, but on this diet, it's the only thing that does it. That's why people in the Samburu, the Fulani, the Maasai tribes, and several others, they eat raw meat. When they die, they're as healthy as they are when they were alive, as young children. And they just go to sleep, no disease. There's the time clock, and that's it.

Q: At what age?

A: Well, in Georgia, Russia, those particular people, the oldest one was 168, but averaged around, I think it was 132 was the average.

Q: Is that present time?

A: Pardon?

Q: That's present time, not 1970 statistics?

A: That was 1970 statistics. Oh, now they've got shit food, you know, given to them and that stuff. Everything's changed now. But the Maasai and the Samburu and Fulani don't eat anything else. They just keep eating their diet and their life expectancy... Nobody's lived in those tribes because they don't allow white men to live with them. There was one documentary person that lived with one division of the Fulani tribe, and they started cooking their meats a lot and started doing a lot from his exposure. They had fights, quarrels. They got into acquisition of properties and just went from the whole tribe to anglicized. But those that don't, don't have any disease and their life expectancy is assumed to be about 140, 137. Can you imagine? In the National Geographic article, I think it was in 1978 or 68, 73, 76, somewhere around there, a couple was married and together, I think it was 102 years? And they still loved each other. When you're healthy, you can be happy. It's easy to be happy. When you're unhealthy, it's very difficult to be happy. There's always something irritating you on the inside. And you're going to take it out on the people around you if you don't exercise. Sometimes even if you exercise, but most people who exercise don't have a tendency, unless you're really skinny, don't have a tendency to take it out on your loved ones and other people. But those who don't exercise and have high hormones, even if you're overweight, you will be a nasty person.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, in fact, we're getting very close. I'm getting to the last nutrient. This is the last nutrient because the protein, that's the last one to cover and then we'll take a break. You need to go, obviously. So, protein to rebuild the body, to keep cells alive and to keep your cellular life growing instead of degenerating. So you don't end up like this at 90 years old. You end up like this. You're crossing the street the same way you did as a child. That's just cells alive in your body, the number of cells alive and the health of those cells. Only raw meats can provide that. Only raw meats can provide this kind of healing or the healing that my son did. And they said, we've had nobody ever come out of a coma without much brain damage. I had him out of a coma in 22 hours. On raw foods and raw meat, he became a normal person and went to college. This is a person who was never supposed to come out of a coma and die.

Q: Does he still eat raw meat?

A: Only when he gets very sick. He lives in Ohio around a lot of truckers. His stepfather was a trucker. He just grew up in that element and he's inclined to stay with it. I don't know why. Also, he was put on Ritalin when he was six years old and a psychiatrist because he was at ADD, hyperactivity. But a scientist showed me a report about a year ago that 76 percent, 78 percent of the people who are diagnosed as addicted to crack cocaine had been put on Ritalin as children. He's one of those. If he doesn't stay on the diet and he goes off for a period of six months to nine months, he's back on crack. So he hasn't been able to visit me in six years because he keeps going in and out of jail and on parole. So I get to go back and visit him. He can't come up to get away from that element because he's stuck in it. The penal system works in that way. And he's into that. As long as he follows the diet and raw meat, he has no addiction. None. I only have one woman who's been on the diet 100% for three years and has a cigarette addiction. She's just now deciding to kick it. But most other people who are on any kind of addiction when they go on the diet, easily, naturally, the addiction goes away. But for her, only one person. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I have several, and it works. But Christopher's unavailable. Yeah, I've had three. In fact, I've got one in New Jersey. The kid was born paraplegic. And he has Down syndrome, I think it is. Anyway, when they brought him to me, he was like this. His toes like this, his feet crunched up his hand, and like this. Looked like a skinny little chicken. I think he was 16 years old. And he was 60 pounds. That's the way he'd been. He'd stopped growing for, I think it was seven years. He hadn't grown. So he went on the diet. He's only been on the diet two years. His hands are straight. His feet are straight. He has complete use of his left hand. He can turn on his recorder. He can talk now. He still is going like this. He still doesn't have full control, but now his hands are open. He can use them. The right hand isn't as operable. I've had him up to 130, 160 pounds. Now grows a beard. The doctors, the M.D.'s, are even writing raw meat prescriptions so the mother doesn't get in trouble. They saw, they see the progression in this child that they've never seen before, and they are bedazzled. So it works even for congenital. You just have to have the patience. And this stepmother, this is a stepmother. She spends her whole life working on this child. What a devotion. It's amazing. And the child eats fecal matter. And loves it. Yeah. All that bacteria, they help him grow. Although he was deficient in it for all those years. But the fecal matter just tastes like overcooked vegetables if you like to cook the vegetables. It's the smell. I hated cooked vegetables, so neither way do I like it. But I still eat it occasionally. To help introduce more bacteria into my system. Okay, we're going to take a break.

[break]

A: Let's get started. I can't whistle since... My whistler was destroyed in Bangkok.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I just had a Tennessee accident.

Q: No, accident.

A: Accident, I got mugged in Bangkok. You weren't here for that. I'm not going to go through it again. Okay, try to keep it way down back there. Okay, because I'm going to get started. Alright, so we left off on meat regenerates, helps regenerate cells in the body, helps cells divide. Cell division means more cells alive in the body. The way that happens is, for some reason, the body cannot generate human growth hormones, usually after the age of 21, without raw meat. It just stops. With the raw meat, it allows your body to continue to regenerate and to produce human growth hormones for cellular division and reproduction. And it only happens with raw meat, in most cases, with most people. There are probably 8 people out of 6,000 that seem to be able to regenerate tissue without eating raw meat. But then in their later years, one of them in his 70s now, started getting osteoporosis last year, so now he's eating raw meat. I guess it just catches up with you at some point, at some age. Even if you're one of those that seems to be an exception. Okay, now we have to talk about foods and how to eat and how to do the diet. This kind of gave you a tease earlier on how to stay clear-minded and thoughtful. But we're going to go on. The way to take the body through a pattern of eating daily so that you can stick to an optimal experience that doesn't mean you won't go through detoxifications, because you will. Poisons have collected in your body for a lifetime. They have to be removed. It's just like tearing down a house. You can't use the house very easily, and there's a lot of garbage that will come out, and you'll get a little, you know, let's say you flap the house and the dust, you breathe it in, and there's some respiratory problems here and there. The same kind of thing happens in the body. You start tearing the body apart to get rid of the garbage. There are symptoms, but those symptoms should never be feared, and never fear that you're going to die. I've never had anybody die during one of those experiences. They've all died in a nice, calm way if they've been on the diet, but it's been of cancer. Nobody's died on this diet who hasn't had cancer so far. Nice. Some of these people are very old. They have people in their 90s on the diet. They got in on their 90s, and they're still living healthfully and better. The only people I've lost so far are people in cancer. I've only lost 16 people, and about 65% of those have lung cancer or esophageal cancer. The others have cancer, the basal cell cancers have just melted their body away. They came to me way too late. Such as Deloria. Okay. So know that when you're going through something difficult, even though you feel you can't breathe, prop yourself up a little bit. When you sleep, don't sleep completely flat. That puts too much weight on the lungs. Collapses them. Keep it in elevation. Eat lots of eggs. Eat lots of butter and honey. And follow what I say is the detoxification regime in the recipe book. That is the diet to follow when you're detoxifying. That doesn't mean weight loss. I mean the detoxification regime is somewhere around 140 something. Around 145, 148, somewhere around there. That is the diet to follow. But to understand what we need, when you first wake up in the morning, well, awaken in the morning, you've had a long period of not eating. Now, after five hours, I don't care who you are, the body starts eating itself.

It needs protein and it needs fat, so it will start eating its own cells, unless you are an incredibly healthy organic animal, you're not going to be eating good food when your body goes into cannibalism. So you're going to have a lot more acids and waste products. I recommend that if people want to get well faster, they set an alarm clock for four and a half to five hours after they go to sleep. Pop down a few eggs, you know, some meat, milk, whatever it is, eat something that is not fruit, and that is not juice, and go back to sleep for a few more hours. Then when you awaken, your blood won't be as acidic, you won't be anorexic from the nausea of eating yourself and all the toxicity. When you drink the green juice, you're going to supply lots of vitamins and enzymes and minerals to get digestion going. It will also act like coffee. It will perk you up without the toxicity, irritating your nervous system and the rest of the body. Vegetable juices should be green vegetable juices, not carrot juice, beet juice, or anything that's high in fruits, cane, sugar juice, or any of that by juicing cane, sugar cane. It should be mainly celery and parsley. Those don't cause any kind of a rapid detoxification, and they help balance the body, the nutrients in a juiced, the fluid of a juiced celery has almost the exact mineral content of the blood. So it helps give you, it's like an IV. It will help regulate the blood. It will help alkalinize it. The parsley, and that should be anywhere from 10 to 20% parsley. The celery can be from 80 to 90% celery, the juice. So, the parsley has lots of chlorophyll, vitamin E and vitamin D, and a lot of other substances in it. It helps alkalinize the blood, and vitalize the entire system. Helps you absorb oxygen, chlorophyll. If you have a respiratory problem, have a higher ratio of parsley to the celery. If you have congestion at a particular time, more parsley. And that will help. If you want to use another herb, or vegetable in it, usually never more than 7%. Keep it around 5%. If you're using kale, no more than 5%. If you're using carrot juice, usually no more than 5%. But some people with bile problems can have up to 10%. But celery and parsley should be your main juice. Your main blood. Now the reason you don't want whole vegetables, is because, like I said earlier, we are not herbivores. We cannot digest the pulp from vegetation. And vegetation is root, stalk, and leaf. Root, stalk, and leaf, that's what vegetable is. Not a cucumber, not a zucchini, not a tomato. Those are fruits, bland fruits. Low in carbohydrates. If you eat a raw, whole salad, it's going to over alkalinize your intestines. And if you over alkalinize the stomach and intestines, you don't digest any of your other foods. You don't digest the milk, the eggs, the meats. You have to have an acid environment in the stomach and intestines for proper digestion on this diet. For proper digestion for the human body. So if you eat a whole salad, you're going to interfere with that. Because all the alkaline juices are going to keep secreting as you slightly digest the vegetable matter as it goes through your intestines. And if it happens in the bowel, it completely neutralizes the E. coli. The place where you synthesize B vitamins and amino acids. So it's a defeat.

Some people have such an acrid small intestinal tract that I will suggest that they have whole vegetable salads occasionally, but not very often. It has to be the last meal of the day. So no acid food comes behind it for at least 5 hours. It's best to have juice. Because then it's absorbed by the time it leaves the duodenum. So it doesn't get into the intestinal tract to alkalinize it, so it stays acid. What we're after is the blood alkalizing. If you have an acid blood, there are many different symptoms for that. Nausea, anorexia, repulsion toward meat. Because you won't be able to digest the meat. So when you take it into your mouth, your body goes, oh, I can't handle this. I'm too alkaline. I won't digest it. I'll get nauseous. Same thing happens with eating too many carbohydrates. Fruit eaters have a very difficult time having an appetite for meat because they get too alkaline in their digestion tract. It damages the intestinal flora and the ability to manifest acid flora. Spoils digestion. So the juice, 8-12 ounces. Sometimes if you're a real big guy, 16 ounces of juice the first thing in the morning. That'll elevate the enzyme level, the vitamin level, the mineral level in the body, so you'll be ready to digest food. It'll also wake you up. Get you moving. Get your system going. Especially if you haven't gotten up after... 

[audio cut]

A: Now the importance of this is this is the meal, this is the time when the body is going to determine how your system is going to function. Will it function off of pyruvate, which is from protein, or is it going to function off of carbohydrate, which is sugar? So if you were to eat, let's say, milk, let's say a smoothie with eggs and milk and a fruit, your body would take the sugar out of the milk, which is high, and it would take the sugar out of the fruit, which is high, and all of a sudden it will make glycogen, which is utilized by the brain, nervous system, lymph, and blood. Sticky. Cells start sticking together. Impulses in the brain stick together, clump. The advanced glycation end products, remember, is 70 to 90 percent stores in the body. That means it doesn't get into the urinary tract or the bowels or the mucous membranes. It stays active in the blood until the body can bind with it and turn it into something, a waste product, that stores in the system. Sticky. Nervous system sticky. Lymph system sticky. Bloodstream sticky. Clumping together. Nothing's functioning right. Slow mentality. Slow focus. Depression, nausea, anorexia, irritability. All of those are symptoms of high carbohydrate waste in those three systems. Lymph. Neurological system. Blood. The best protein to make a sugar is pyruvate. And we use glucagon to make that. To form that substance. And the byproduct of advanced glycation end product from using pyruvate is only 7-8% instead of 70 to 90. So you can eat three pounds of meat a day and never get to the point of ever creating enough pyruvate to cause a stickiness in your system. So if your next meal, your first solid meal is meat that sets the tone for the whole body for the whole day. Clean, easy working, fluid, focused, happy, content on the average, on the whole. If you're toxic and have your system screwed up, you know, it's going to be a while until you're in and out of that. But you will always be better if you eat that cycle. To digest meats properly, you always need a raw fat. Otherwise, you're going to turn all of that fat, all of that meat into either an acetate, a fat, or a pyruvate, a sugar, instead of using it to rebuild the body. So your body needs fat for energy. So rather than use the meat to turn it into fat, and carbohydrates, when they're turned into an acetone, that's very difficult to burn and use. To utilize as energy. Whereas made from fat, it's easier. Well, why not just eat fat? Instead of going through all that exhaustive conversion in the liver. Eat fat with your meat. Butter, cream, eggs. Some kind of fat with meat. That way, every bit of that expensive meat that you buy is going to go about 15% toward making the pyruvate, and the other 85% to regenerate cells in your body. To help you divide cells. So you can become more alive and healthier. Also, it will be used to rebuild and restructure cells that are already alive. Unless your body is making it all into a sugar or all into a fat. To utilize as energy. If you eat a fat meal, you won't have to worry about that.

Q: How much fat?

A: I say a minimum of 3 ounces of fat with a half a pound of meat. If you're a high active person, a high energy person with no sugar problem, then it's good to eat two meat meals a day. The first thing after the juice in the morning, and somewhere between 6-7.30 at night. 5-7.30 at night.

Q: Can you use flax oil for the fat?

A: I'll get into that. Remember, save your questions. But write them down. Just in case I don't get it. So, animal fat is the most important. That will help soothe your body and stabilize it. Those two. Now, the cream is best to soothe the nervous system. If you're hyperactive, you're feeling burning, you're irritable, go for the cream. If you've got sore joints, dry skin, bone problems, osteoporosis, you go for butter.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you have dry skin, achy bones, joints, you go for the butter. Dryness anywhere. Signs of MS, butter, is the most important. If you have what I call the lubrication moisturizing formula, that gets the lubrication into the body the best, whether it's skin or any other part of the body. I give two names for that. Lubrication moisturizing because men like, macho, lubrication. Women like moisturizing. So I give it two names. Because it has to be appealing. And that is a combination of mainly butter with a little bit of lemon juice and a little bit of honey and eggs. That is an incredible lubrication moisturizing formula. It gets into where you normally can't. If you eat butter alone or if you eat cream alone, it mainly goes to the glands and organs and the skin and bones, joints, skin, never see it. Connective tissue will never see any of it. When you take a moisturizing lubrication formula, it is almost pre-digested fat. So the liver takes it, throw it out to the system quicker than it can be absorbed by all the glands and organs. So it reaches those outer areas of the body. And that's the only one that will do it. I needed eight years to figure that one out. Because people still, they're eating all this fat, they still have dry skin and achy joints and bones and problems. Until I figured out how to get it past so quickly into the body that bypassed the, not bypassed it, but it didn't allow the glands and organs to absorb it before it was all gone. It's like having an orphanage, you know. The bigger kids take it all, the ones closest to the food, the other kids don't. The weak ones on the outer side. So basically, that's a good analogy so you'll understand it. So the moisturizing lubrication formula, lubrication formula, moisturizing formula, is an important element in the diet. So starting off, I usually will recommend that people have, make a lubrication, moisturizing formula, big batch of it, and then have half of it with each meat meal. And then you will get healthier faster. If you are a person who is a diabetic or has hypoglycemia, it's best to eat three meat meals a day. So I recommend a minimum of a pound of meat a day if you are anywhere from 4'11 up. If you are 5'8 or more, then you should be having more than a pound. If you are up to 6'2, you should be having two pounds a day. 6'5, you should be having three pounds a day. Three cups of meat, three eight ounces containers of meat equal a pound. So it's easy to regulate. So if you are eating three meat meals a day, then you can have one cup in each meal. If you are eating two meat meals a day, and you are only going to consume a pound of meat, then have a cup and a half twice a day.

Q: How much of the moisturizing formula per cup?

A: It's in the recipe book. There are some things I'm not going to have time to get into detail about. And some of that stuff is in the recipe book. In the books. Okay. Now, another oil is a fatty substance. However, olive oil, flax oil, any of your pressed oils are mainly solvent reactive. They don't protect the body. They do very little lubrication of the body. Your body mainly makes virus and soaps out of them. Remember, virus is not alive. Virus is merely a protein construction with acetone fats that disassembles waste products in the body. So the idea that they self-replicate and they're not alive and they're just mechanically put together, it's like does soap reproduce? Does soap replicate itself? No. Your cells make soap. And that gets into the system and dissolves either itself or surrounding garbage. So that's why antibiotics don't work with virus. They're not alive to kill. So any doctor that gives or recommends antibiotics or penicillin for a virus or a vaccine is absolutely irrational and doesn't know a thing. Most of them don't know anything anyway. But those are solvents. They are soaps. They are degreasers. They are compounds. They are there to disassemble toxic compounds. This is mainly made from pressed oils. So they will not lubricate you. So they will turn your system acid. It may make burning stomach. So I always recommend that when you have olive oil or flax oil, that you have either cream or butter with it. Because as they start dissolving compounds in your body, you want the other protective fats there to protect the cells and to chelate with those toxins that are released and dissolved so you can eliminate them easier so they don't do damage. So if you make a mayonnaise with olive oil, make sure you use lots of butter in it. A lot more butter and just a little olive oil. And I've got recipes in the book for that. Recipe book. Now we're going to get, you know, we've heard all the stories about congestive heart failure. A lot of people say cholesterol. I get, you know, I get plaquing on my arteries and all of that. Well, none of the tribes eat raw meats. And lots of raw fat, the eskimos, have any hardening of the arteries and no congestion or plaquing in the heart. Even the tribes who eat mainly cooked meats don't have any heart disease or any clogging. All of this clogging came when vegetable oils were put on the market. Safflower oil, margarines. Because they turn into plastic once they're hydrogenated and heating at high temperature. In fact, plastic was discovered because somebody went to sleep during hydrogenation and heating process with some margarine and they ended up with a plastic. And that's how it was created in the late 40s. And then they just kept experimenting until the 50s. They'd find that they'd make even harder materials once they added other chemicals. But if you take even raw vegetable oils and you put them with dirt and let them sit for a year, guess what you have? Rock. If you take animal fats and you put them with dirt, it molds and turns into earth and feeds the earth again. So don't be afraid of hardening of the arteries and congestive heart failure if you're eating raw animal fats. It doesn't happen. It's a myth.

And there's a scientist who wrote a book called The Cholesterol Myth, and I give him reference in the recipe book if you're interested in that. So, the animal fats are the most important, and if you have a problem, you negotiate it as per what you need. If you have glandular problems, neurological problems, the cream is most soothing. Acid burning, anything like that, cream. Everything else, mostly butter. Because the liver, when it takes in cream, it has a hard time digesting it. It has to take it and make it into butter. And it uses lots of enzymes to extract that whey. Now the whey is good for the nerves. It helps carry the fat molecule to the nerves. Once the whey is gone, the liver can even handle it quicker. Because it doesn't need all those enzymes to do that. So it can spill it out into the system. But then your organs will take it all. Before it gets to the outer tissue. And that's why I say the lubrication formula is necessary. Moisturizing lubrication formula is necessary to do that. Minimum of three ounces. Now when I have my meat, and I'll have a half a pound at a time minimum, I will use up to a cup of fat at a time. Say I have five ounces of butter. One or two eggs. Maybe a tablespoon of olive oil. A touch of garlic. And then I've got mayonnaise. And I mix that with one meat meal. I usually make a 16 ounce container. So I have about three meat meals. Divide it up into that. So you can make big batches of sauces as you like. Remember that if you use egg in that sauce, do not refrigerate it. Because that lowers enzyme activity and digestibility. You can refrigerate other products, other mixtures and sauces, keep them longer as long as there's no egg in it. If it has egg in it, you leave it out. It can be out for days. If it has egg in it, like garlic sauce, it's lasted for a couple of weeks outside the refrigerator. Yeah, I eat it sooner than that. But just to experiment, I let the sauces out to see how long they will last with egg in them outside of the refrigerator.

Q: What about salmonella?

A: We talked about that. We talked about that. Those are friendly. Those are your friends. You want them as much as possible. If you've forgotten, those are your good guys. They'll help you prevent getting cancer and reverse cancer. All of those. Okay, so then after you have that meat meal... Let me go over this a little bit further. If I am in a sleepy period, normally I eat sleep about four and a half hours a day. Three to four hours at a time and then a nap anywhere from ten minutes to an hour and a half at a time. At a day. Now before when I was so ill, especially after the poison mushroom when I ate that. I used to sleep anywhere from ten to twenty hours a day. Ninety percent of sleep, ninety percent of regeneration of cells, cellular division and healing happens in the sleep state or in the alpha state. So sleep is very important as you're getting healthier. I'm in a point where I don't need as much unless I go into a healing state. Then I may sleep up to six hours a couple of days in a row and maybe even one day of eight hours or ten hours in that day. Not all at one time, but I'll feel sleepy and I'll take advantage and do it. But when I do that, I say, aha, I'm going through a healing state, I need more proteins. I'll eat up to three pounds of meat on those days. And I find that the healing is much more acute. During that time, the more meat I eat, I get stronger, healthier, more vibrant. So I take full advantage of it. I am a health opportunist. So when the body gets sleepy, I will stuff it with meat and eat less of other foods. Eat less milk. Milk does not help you regenerate cells. Eggs do not help you regenerate cells. Raw meat does. So I lower my intake of milk and I lower my intake of eggs during that time, and I eat lots of meat. Sometimes I've eaten as much as five pounds in a day. And I take full advantage. You do that too. If you get sleepy, and you're sleeping more, cut down on those other foods and eat more meat. You will heal faster. You will be stronger quicker. Okay, after that first meat meal, for you hyperactive people, or people who are pretty stable in energy, and everybody, and all those who aren't, those who are sugar type, overweight, and have more alkaline systems, next, have a cream shake. Now realize, when you get the meat into your system, you're going to start replacing cells. That means some toxic cells are going to create an acid condition in your body. You want enough fats in there to soothe your tissues, to make sure that the nerves don't get irritated. So a cream shake is either equal amount of cream to milk, or more cream than milk. An egg and a little honey. So a normal average for everybody would be two eggs, three ounces of cream, two to three ounces of milk, and a tablespoon of honey. You're a big guy, five, six eggs, five ounces of cream, four ounces of milk, one to two tablespoons of honey. But nothing lower than what I gave. Maybe one egg for some people is a very small amount. But the same ratio of cream to milk and honey. Unless it's too sweet for you, then cut it down to a teaspoon of honey, if it's too sweet. That will help calm the system and keep you balanced and focused and strong. Then let an hour, an hour and a half pass, two hours, have your second juice.

Now for some people, the juice causes so many minerals to dump into the system, enzymes at one time, that that juice makes them sleepy. If you have to work and can't take a 10 minute nap, then cut it down, the juice down from 8 ounces or more, down to half of what you normally have. If you have 12, 16 ounces if you're a big guy, then you cut it down to 8 ounces. If you normally have 8 ounces, cut it down to 4 ounces. So a smaller amount, and put a tablespoon of cream in, if you have it, or eat a half a tablespoon of butter before you drink it. Then let a couple of hours go by. If you're a high energy person that's eating only two meat meals a day, your next meat meal will be a fruit meal. To help cleanse the system. Now we're only talking about a half cup if you're a small person, half a cup of fruit, only at a time. Larger person, 6 foot tall, whole piece of fruit, cup of fruit, at a time. But always with lots of fat. Now, let's say you have heavy metal poisons in the body and you want to clean it out. A system like yours, heavy metals will interfere with nerve functions. So to help lure those heavy metals out of the system, you have something like dark berries. It's important that the berries be organic, they don't have to be fresh, they can be frozen. Fruit can be frozen, we're not after the sugar in fruit, we're not going to have enough to cause a problem. But we want the minerals to attract the heavy minerals out of the body. Dark berries are good for that, except if it's iodine, toxic iodine. If you've ever had iodine treatment, your mother put iodine on your wounds, that's a poison. Methylate and mercurochrome are liquid mercury. They're poisons, they are there to poison bacteria. They also cause scarring and a lot of other toxic problems in the system. And if it gets into the blood, gets into the brain and nervous system, it will cause more damage. Lots of problems. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh yes. Mercurochrome, methylate, and iodine. Iodine from surgery, and they'll swab it heavily. And then if you get an x-ray, you're radioactive. You've got radioactive iodine that lives 528 years minimum. Why do they always say, well it has a 248 year half-life? Who gives a fuck if it [unintelligible] 248 years? Why do you call it half-life? It's talking about the life. So you've got to get it out of the body. So for iodine, getting iodine out of the body, raspberries are better. Now, let me give you an example. If you take a, I don't have any plain canning jars. You know the regular metal canning jars? Yeah, you see that they're metal, kind of bronze-y, gold-ish color? If you take coconut cream, which means that you take the meat of the coconut and you juice it. You separate the cream from the pulp. That cream, you put it on those metals and you'll see it turn black within 20 minutes to an hour. Just rips the metal right out. Only coconut cream can do that. Other fats will do it over a very long period of time. But coconut cream will rip it out quickly. So you have the berries with about 2, 2 1⁄2 ounces. If you're a big guy, up to 3 ounces of coconut cream. Remember, you have to have a good, healing, solid animal fat with it. Because the coconut cream's going to go in, rip out the metals, start dissolving them. The minerals in the berries are going to bind and attach to those, magnetize them. Then the cream or butter, or cream and butter, will chelate with that and prevent it from being absorbed into your body. And it'll discharge through the bowels. And that's what you want. So that combination is important. I mean, you can have the berries with just, you know, cow's cream, whipped cow's cream, a little butter, a little honey, that's fine. But it won't rip the metals out as quickly and as much as if you had coconut cream with it. After that meal, if you're a meat, if you're a carbohydrate problem person, or a diabetic, you can have a meat meal after that, an hour, an hour and a half. Or, if you have problems with depression, or anxiety, or irritability, then you have the meat before that fruit meal. So you only wait an hour after your vegetable juice to have your second meat meal. Then you wait an hour and a half after that before you have that fruit meal. Then after your fruit meal, no matter who you are, which system you're on, two or three meat meals a day, you go back to a juice again. The juice should be anywhere from eight to sixteen ounces. Then about an hour and a half after that, two hours after that, for the people who are having sugar problems and diabetics, this will be their third meat meal. For all others, this will be their second meat meal. Equal amounts of fat all the time. High fat with it. Always. So it's easier to make one sauce... If you like a different sauce every day, make a sauce that's enough for all three meals or all two meat meals, whichever you're eating. Then after that, again, we've had the protein get into the blood. We want to soothe the system of any toxins from broken down proteins and old dead cells in your body are dissolving because now you can replace them.

Because you have the meat, you soothe it with the cream. So another cream shake is a good thing to have. Or down three to six eggs, Rocky style. How many people saw Rocky? Well, a lot of people didn't see Rocky. Well, Rocky [unintelligible] workout Sylvester Stallone. He did this and does this in real life. Breaks five raw eggs into a glass without whipping it and drinks it down. And then he wipes his mouth with his arm. And if you don't wipe your mouth with your arm, it doesn't work. You're not macho enough. Anyway, that's very helpful to do that. And for each egg, I recommend about 10 to 15 minutes later or no later than 15 minutes, have a tablespoon of cream for each egg that you down. What that does is, the egg will help pull out certain substances and help you utilize certain substances. If the cream follows it, the cream will be there to arrest or help any activity that's going on, especially in the nervous system. If you have them together, it doesn't quite work the same. But it's still okay to have that cream shake. If you want to detox more, get a little bit stronger in the muscles, have the eggs and then the cream afterwards. Like I said, no more than 15 minutes, no less than 10 minutes. After your eggs. And then a juice before you go to sleep. Unless that juice charges you enough to keep you from being tired and you can't sleep. Then just don't have anything or have like a warm glass of milk and go to sleep.

Q: Is that the same juice?

A: Always the same juice. Celery and parsley mainly, there are other things you can put in as long as it's small amounts. If you use cilantro, it pulls heavy metals out like a coconut cream. But there's no fat with it or very little fat with it, so it's a dangerous thing to do. If I recommend cilantro for anybody, I tell them to have 1-1.5 tablespoons of coconut cream right before they drink the juice, each juice. Then to put 1-1.5 tablespoons of cow's cream in the juice right before they drink it. So again, you have the coconut cream to rip the metals and minerals from the cilantro to bind with that. And then the cow's cream to bind with that. Always play it safe. You are not infallible. And don't let time say, oh, I can get away with it this time. Maybe you can't. You can cause nerve damage. You can cause yourself to be down for a few days or irritable or cause some scar tissue. Nobody, not even me, is that infallible. We are just not infallible. If it did, everybody would be happy, healthy and rich in here. Okay, that's basically the routine. Now, there's one thing that comes up. People crave starches. It took me a long time to figure out why people still crave starches. Usually they're very satisfied with everything on this diet, but all of a sudden this raging monster that wants pasta or breads or something will come up and make you crazy. Bananas. And I've always wondered what it was. A patient named Elnora Van Winkle, who was almost a 50-year researcher, about 47, 48 years of research for Millhauser Labs at New York City Medical Center. She cataloged for all those years what nutrients and what compounds and what chemicals made up the nervous system, including brain. Every one of them. Can you imagine deciphering all those and naming them and cataloging all the properties of the nervous system? That was her job for 40-something years. That when you have an emotional upset, when it has nothing to do with anything related to experience in your life, that she found these waste products that happen during trauma. Your body builds certain hormones during trauma. Neurological hormones. And there are waste products that are part of that. And they store in the body like any other waste products, unless you're incredibly healthy. And you're on an incredible diet. They won't store. But in everybody, they do. So when she found people going through these emotional upsets where there's nothing directly causing that in their life experience, she found these waste products in their blood. So let's say you get upset at your husband because of no reason. You may have had this traumatic experience with your father when you were a kid, and those hormones, byproducts, are stored in the body. Starches are the only things that can attach with those. Just like coconut cream has an affinity toward metals. Starch has an affinity toward these hormonal byproducts. So in the first book, those who've read it and those who haven't, I mentioned breads, pasta, simple breads, French bread, stuff like that with lots of raw fat on it to handle that problem. 

And only when you have that problem, just a little, with lots of fat. However, over those years, I kept seeing people collecting those advanced glycation end products. And eating too much bread and getting a cycle of eating too much pasta with too much bread. So it was causing imbalances. So I finally figured out a formula that was with raw food. And that's the nut formula. It's taking soft nuts, walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds, hazelnuts, which are also called filberts, and pumpkin seeds. Almonds are too hard to digest, forget those, all the other nuts. If you could get completely raw macadamias, that's fine. Pine nuts is okay, but remember if you have low energy, you have tiredness, and your thyroid isn't working, do not eat pine nuts. Because they cause a suppression of T3 and T4, thyroid activity, hormonal reaction. So, you can take those nuts, you can blend them until they are a powder, a flour. Add egg, butter, and honey. Makes a nice, rich, delicious nut butter paste. And eat that one day a week. If you're a basket case, two days a week, but never closer than three days apart. And that is your balanced diet, and it will work for everybody. Now, if I do a reading for you, I'll be able to choose fruit for you that's a little bit better. I'll be able to direct you toward what you need to detoxify. Also, other practices like bathing and certain kinds of massages that will help your particular system clean out better. And I want to say this about massage. Whether it's reflexology, or whether it's Swiss or any of them, most of them cause damage. Just think, you've got a dry connection. Something solid, hardened, cracked, and brittle, and you go in like this, and you're breaking it up. You're breaking that tissue. You're causing a lot of bruised area, and you're causing a lot more toxicity. Now I want you to do this. Do this with the person next to you. I want you to barely touch the person. Barely touch it, as if you're just trying to touch the hairs on their arm. Doesn't that tingle and excite the whole system? That's what you want. You want to stimulate the nervous system. That is what acupuncture is supposed to do, and it doesn't, but it causes neurological damage. So if you have somebody give you that kind of massage, you're going to get the stimulation that is correct and proper without damage. Let your exercise be the thing that gets your blood going. Get out and take a walk, a hot bath. That will move things. But a hard massage is not the way to go. And acupressure, you can tickle those spots, and they'll work even better. No bruising, no damage. Then you don't have to worry about the resulting toxicity. Drink a lot of water after a massage. You don't want to have so many poisons ripped out of the system. Sure, you don't want to dilute them and dissolve them. But then we have a problem with water. This is not a nutrient. You're not supposed to have eight glasses a day minimum. This is a solvent. And if you take a biochemical course, do you know what water is classified under? Solvent. It's not classified under a nutrient. It's a solvent. It dissolves matter. When it rains, what does it do? It dissolves rock and earth so the plants can eat. So when it goes into your body, it leaches vitamins and enzymes and starts ripping stuff apart. You need some of that because you're full of garbage. You need some help to make solvents and water is important for that.

But you don't want much because it is not a nutrient. It will leach nutrients out of your system, out of your blood to do the job, out of your digestive tract, wherever it goes. Remember I said earlier that meat is 55% water. Milk, 86%, 90% water. Everything is mostly water. Every food. You're getting tremendous amounts of H2O. And because it is bound with enzymes, proper electrolytes, ionic attraction, other nutrients, your body can absorb it and utilize it 100%, especially in tomatoes. Tomatoes is your best juice if you're thirsty a lot. If your body is thirsty. But don't let this determine thirst for you. This is the only main network for discharge of poisons and toxic cauterized minerals from cooked food from the brain. They come out the teeth, causing plaquing on the teeth. Those are minerals from your brain from cooked food. Plaquing on there. From your brain. Your eyes, your ears. Coming down here, out your mouth. The coating on your tongue, very important to have. Don't go with the Chinese Ayurvedic system. A coated tongue is a happy tongue if you're discharging those poisons. I'd rather them come out through the tongue than I would out the teeth and the gums. Also the salivary glands will discharge. Those are good symptoms, not bad. So you want to discharge. So as those poisons are dumping, you need to have nutrients to deal with it. Water will help wash some of it out, but it's going to rip nutrients with it. If you're eating raw foods, you've got lots of H2O, 100% utilizable intracellularly. If you're having water, I don't care if it's the best water in the world, including rainwater, it will be only utilized 8-10% intracellularly. The rest will be used to dissolve. And what's it going to dissolve? Whatever it gets into. The good and the bad. So you can regulate it by eating food in water that is properly connected with nutrients in food. Let me give you a clear picture, a very clear picture of how this works. Here you've got a cell. They're mostly triangular-shaped, they always make them round for some reason. But here's your cell. It has one or two ions inside of it. And when it wants food, it will open. And when it opens, it attracts magnetically minerals that are in the blood, in the serum. And let's say you have a potassium ion, it could be carrying a sugar molecule. A glycogen. Or a pyruvate. Or some other nutrient. Sodium often carries H2O. But it also carries other nutrients. So when that cell decides, oh, there's a nutrient I want, opens up. These one or two ions inside will attract that ion and bring the nutrient with it. It eats. The cell's happy. It's got what it wants. When you concentrate, say you have one bitty little grain of salt. It magnifies the sodium in the blood and then it starts clumping. Two, three, four, five clumps of sodium ions. So when the cell opens to attract some H2O, and the magnetism is greater outside than it is inside the cell, what happens? Pulls the guts, right, those ions right out of the cell. The cell can never eat anything. It shrivels and dies.

Q: And salt does that?

A: Salt does that, yes. I don't care if it's Celtic salt, no matter what it is. Salt is the worst thing next to cooking. If you need high sodium, you eat tomatoes. Tomatoes are very high in sodium that will not clump unless you cook it. And if you want to make, you know, like a Bloody Mary, put egg and tomato in, you know, with a little honey.

Q: Vodka?

A: Skip that. Then make that, and it will satisfy your need for fluid. But nobody gets dehydrated on this. There's one guy who's had, he had Crohn's disease. He has, he's had diarrhea for 11 months now, every day. That doesn't mean he goes every time, lots of times a day. He did that for the first 6 weeks. You know, 4 or 5 times a day, sometimes 10 times a day. But now when he goes, he only goes once a day, but it's still diarrhea. No dehydration, and he doesn't drink water. He has tomato juice. He blends the tomato with a little cream, a little lemon juice, you know, an egg. And has a Bloody Mary. Without the vodka. It's great.

Q: Celery?

A: Celery is very high in sodium. It doesn't quite work as well because of the high vitamin A content in the tomato. It goes to nerve cells better. So it has more affinity to relax the nervous system. Especially if it's creamy. So it's better. But this being dry is mainly because of all of the drying minerals that are coming from the brain out the mouth. The thing to do is have a honey and butter mixture. Let's say 10 tablespoons of butter to 1 tablespoon of honey. Take a teaspoon at a time. Keep it around in the mouth. Because you're dilipidated here. This dryness here does not mean thirst. Does not mean an H2O deficiency. It is a fat deficiency. A lipid deficiency. Because the brain is the most toxic element on anybody's body. It has more metals than any other part of the body. Toxic, toxic, toxic. That's why I think the brain is so big in the humans. Because it's a garbage pit. It has to be big to handle all those heavy metals from cooking food. And that brain probably developed... The more we started cooking food, the bigger the brain got. To handle all the garbage. Because, you know, 60,000 years ago, in the skull, the brain wasn't much bigger than an ape's or a monkey's. And they did very well. Here we've got this great genius brain, but it's all full of garbage. And we're not using it very well because we certainly aren't in tune. And not, you know, taking care of pollution. We're creating. We're not ecologically running our system. And take a look at the body itself. You've got bacteria and parasites that help you break down toxicity. Like vultures and droves. Everything's geared toward recycling except the human brain. Probably because it's too toxic with heavy, free radical metals running around in it and an unhealthy body. The tribes who eat raw all their lives are completely in harmony with nature. So is the American Indians. Completely in harmony. And we aren't. But we can take care of all that pollution by eating properly. In ourselves. I lived in Los Angeles. I live in Malibu. It's a pit as far as air pollution goes. And I was rarely harmed by it. Permanently. I could feel it. It bothered my lungs. But I was eating to be able to handle that toxicity. So you can deal with the toxicity on a good diet. This diet handles it pretty well. Depending upon your present state of health. I mean if you're completely debilitated and pretty much near your end then pollution will affect you more. You'd be better to get off into a better environment. Until you get well enough to do, you know, doing this diet and then you're in a polluted area it won't bother you as much. To be able to handle it. Okay, now we're going to get...

[audio cut]

[unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible] I never met a calm goat. Many herds of goats. They will eat everything, they'll eat their own fence, they'll eat each other, they will eat anything because they are these insatiable creatures that are neurotic, erotically, you know, basket cases. I love them, but, you know, I can't get around, if I [unintelligible] he'll kill me if I go milk her. You know, I had to take a board one day, fight this one off because he kept coming at me. And the females are just as hyperactive. They were all that way, and I found that when I was giving children the goat milk, they were much more hyperactive, much more unsatisfied, dissatisfied. I've never been able to use that in experiments, but I've eaten it, it's fine. But it is calming, because it has a lot of [unintelligible]. It's a different kind of soothing kind of fat. And the cow's milk is much more relaxing. So if you're overweight and you're a diabetic, goat's milk is fine, and low in nutrients. I'm going to go around this side of the room.


Q: Okay, I have two quick ones. Can you use a Vitamix and then [unintelligible].

A: There's no such thing as a quick one. One at a time.

Q: Okay, can you use the Vitamix juicer?

A: I'm so glad you asked that question. Vitamix is a dangerous machine for nutrients. It will heat up quickly, and it also pulls more oxygen down faster than anything else. What happens if you oxidize your nutrients? They're gone. Gone.

Q: Do you use an ordinary blender?

A: You use an ordinary blender because you pull oxygen down in it. So you get little jars, canning jars, like this. And you take an osterizer blender. It comes with a bowl. You unscrew the bottom, and you have the base. You have the blades, and you have a washer. Most of the time, the washer is too thin and too small. Don't get another osterizer washer. Go to a small appliance store and get a washer that's a little wider in diameter and thicker. You know, three-sixteenths minimum. Then you put the washer on the rim of the glass first. Put the blades inside and on top of that, kind of line it up a little bit. Take the base, screw it on, turn it upside down, and guess what little oxygen you have in there? And you blend it. You've got four-ounce jars, you've got eight-ounce, you've got twelve-ounce, you've got sixteen-ounce, you've got quart jars, same size. All the canning jars will fit the oxidizer blenders. And there you have it, blending without all the oxygen getting in.

Q: Do you get that rubber attachment at a hardware store?

A: No. Well, some hardware stores, but small appliance stores, you get more variety.

Q: The schedule.

A: You know what I like to do? I like to hit one person with a question, and then we'll come back.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay? Thank you for that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Right for your type. No. It is a myth. I've had about 50 A blood types come to me with severe anemia. Several of them with leukemia. And every one of them went on D'Adamo's diet. I've got a lot more than that, but about 50 of them, 46 I think it was, that came off of D'Adamo's diet to me. Every one of them needs red meat. Everything he said. I've got another girl that came in with A. And she was supposed to not eat chicken. And was it A, what was it, B? I guess it was B. She was supposed to eat chicken and some other things. And that she did best with on a raw diet. Now, they ate a cooked diet on that and it still didn't work for them, so I can't say it's just because my diet is different. But they ate that diet cooked and it didn't work for them. So, I'd have to say the D'Adamo diet may work because it gets people to change their diets and because it's cooked, they're not collecting the same poisons in the same quantity. So, they're having less allergic reactions, so feeling better, because they're eating foods that they're not normally collecting toxins from, specific for that food.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Red meat doesn't make any difference. Nope. I mean, they all need the same, I found. The only thing I found different, like I said in my first book, people who have a very high acidic blood stream need more white meat than red. That's the only difference. And that's only in the toxic... It's only people who are even more toxic with heavy metals. The American Indians were very rich with red blood and acidic blood. That's mainly what they ate. Ninety percent of the time, it was red meat. The Samburus and Maasai, the Fulani, the Fulani [unintelligible]. But even they mainly ate red meat. So, it's not a problem. But in our society, in our environment, I find that there are some people that have to have white meat every time they eat red meat. And I'm one of those who likes that. I like my balance. If I start having red meat without white meat, I get a little bit more excitable. I may become short-tempered a little bit, or over-anxious, or way too sexual. So, I can keep it at a nice level if I have white and red together. Fish or chicken. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Stop counting.

Q: Stop counting. [unintelligible]

A: No, when you've got a [unintelligible] like that, or an inconsistent heartbeat, you just got a jazzy heart. It's got a different beat to it. Don't even worry about it.

Q: Yeah, but they say it's skipping, and the blood's only going to get clogged up, and you're going to have a stroke.

A: That's their theory. It's got nothing to do with reality. It's got nothing to do with reality. They're trying to sell you a drug. They want you to take Coumadin.

Q: Right, right.

A: Okay. My father's been living like that for 23 years. He took the drug Coumadin. I kept telling him, don't take it. You just got a different beat of a heart. Yours is reggae. I don't like reggae. I don't care. That's what you got. Live with it. And it'd be cool. So he got very sick and was having all kinds of problems for three years. Two or three years he took the Coumadin. And he said, okay, I won't. And he kept bugging the doctor. And the doctor finally said, you know, he said, well, if you're not going to do what I say, then just stop counting. And that was the best advice the doctor gave him, because he stopped worrying about his heartbeat. And he counted when it beat, when it didn't. And he's now 88 years old. So, you know, he's doing fine with this irregular heart. 

Q: Sometimes the heart does not...

A: I'm going to go around with people who had their hands open. Yes.

Q: As far as eating meat from the supermarket, what's the status on that now? [unintelligible]

A: Well, it's always better to get cleaner. The cleaner the meat, the better. However, remember, animals store the poisons in the glands first. Those are the things you don't want to eat, unless you know the animal is organic. But I ate mad cow meat for three and a half years when I was living in Paris. And I didn't know I was eating that, but that was all that was available. At that time, you know, in the early 90s, early and mid 90s, in Paris there was no health consciousness. None. And I brought it there. I got on every health food store's case, from one end of Paris to the other. Got them to carry raw milk, raw butter, raw cream, you know, by the time I stopped. But I could never find a frickin' butcher in town that, you know, would supply good meat. So I went to Carrefour Supermarkets. Carrefour Supermarkets is this huge safeway that's all over the world. I mean, you can find Carrefour all over the world. Even in Thailand, you know, Europe to Thailand, they've got Carrefour Supermarkets. So I was eating at Carrefour Supermarkets, and then when my girlfriend there broke up with me because I wouldn't marry her, on the plane home I'm reading this article that says Carrefour Supermarkets, this is after all the Mad Cow stuff, has been carrying the Mad Cow for all these years. So I've been eating Mad Cow, and I don't have a problem. And, you know, I didn't eat the glands, I didn't eat the brain, the nervous system, and that's mainly where you get your prions.

Q: So you're saying that organic, has to be organic?

A: I'm saying it's better. Better. You know, you're going to get less nutrients from a food that is less balanced. But you can get nutrients from it.

Q: Now, this is just for, what about, I think it was when you said organic, chicken has to be organic too? [unintelligible]

A: In the chickens?

Q: Chickens have to be organic.

A: Well, the chickens don't have to be organic because now there's a misnomer with it. They're starting to call chickens raised on soy, organic soybeans, organic.

Q: Oh, no.

A: It's a misnomer because you cannot, a human nor a fowl, any bird can eat soy without danger of death.

Q: Oh, no.

A: So they have to solvent treat it. So once you enter a solvent into that, that is no longer an organic food. You're eating a highly processed protein from soy, which is also highly hormonal reactive and can cause cancer to go bananas. Okay? So we've got a company called Rosie Chickens in L.A. which feeds their chickens 75% soy and they call it organic.

Q: Oh, no.

A: And I called them and I said, you can't do this because chickens can't eat this. Only cows can eat raw soy and not have a problem, but humans and chickens have to be processed. He said, that's right, but it's organic soy. So I said, wait a minute, wait a minute, wait a minute. It's got to be solvent treated and reacted and purified with an inorganic substance that's no longer organic. Yeah, but we're allowed to call it that. I said, you have no moral conscience then. That's basically, it's a marketing thing. They're going to hold on to it. So organic does not necessarily mean anything when it comes to chicken.

Q: So where does that leave us when it comes to eating chicken?

A: You have to call around and find out. Now I've got lots of Amish and Joe right there.

Q: We have a special, we do feed them soy free custom feed.

A: Right, okay. So we've got sources now and Joe brings it into this area. The eggs and the milk and all the products. So you've got all of my networks, no matter where you are in the world now, I've got people to supply you food. Okay, good food. But if you have to go, and I'm traveling sometimes, there won't be a health food store. I've even gone to a place, I've even gone to In-N-Out Burger. Because they don't freeze their hamburger. And I've eaten there. I went up to them and said, I want just a hamburger patty. We can't serve it without the bun. Give me the freaking bun then. I'd throw away the bun and eat the hamburger, you know. But I didn't want to waste the bun. I didn't want another bun produced because of me. But I couldn't talk them into giving me the hamburger alone. I do what I have to do. I always make the best choice I have. But I have to eat. Okay, yes.

Q: This talk about being careful consuming raw, un-homogenized, un-pasteurized milk. Our health food store has a label that says, for animal consumption only. I know they're just coming out.

A: You're an animal.

Q: So I've had people say to me, are you out of your mind? There's all kinds of garbage in there when you croak. You know, blah, blah, blah.

A: It's a myth. And I have it in the back of the recipe book. I have all about milk and wood. It's the pasteurized milk that has created all the epidemics. One incident involved 196,000 people. You think if it involved that many people, raw, I mean, pasteurized milk would have been outlawed. But it hasn't. Other 19,000, 34,000 people. Raw milk has never been attributed to any epidemic. None. And yet the myth is that it does. It creates epidemics. Yeah, it's...

Q: Shelf life.

A: There's no shelf life. Raw milk never goes bad. It just turns into cheese. Raw cream never goes bad. It just turns into cream cheese. It goes to sour cream. At any time, I've consumed milk up to two years old. There is no harm in it. None. Yes.

Q: I've heard you say the digestion system has to have the acidic. You said that a doctor cuts your vagus nerve, depriving you of hydrochloric acid.

A: In the stomach, but not in the rest of the intestines. He cut all the vagus nerves to the stomach, but not to the whole of the intestines. So I don't have the hydrochloric acid here, so I'm a person who has to grind my meat or chew it thoroughly. Nobody else has to chew their food unless you've got a vagotomy. No hunter tribe chews their meat. They'll take these big, huge bites off. Three times crush it so they can swallow it. But the hydrochloric acid dissolves it. Nothing here, only ptyalin enzyme in the mouth. No digestion happens here with meat. I can't do that because I don't have the hydrochloric acid here. So I have to break it into small amounts, so when it gets into the small intestines, the acid that hits it works on it right away. Yes?

Q: I have a family member who's been suffering terribly from depression, anxiety, nervousness, anger fits. He's getting very desperate. He's been appointed to see a doctor. He's thinking about using medication for depression. Now, if I can persuade him to start using these foods, the medication that he might take, would that be...

A: It'll keep you counterproductive to it.

Q: It'll keep you counterproductive.

A: Yeah. But usually, if you can get him to eat the high meat, or the fecal matter, which is probably unrealistic. It's mainly having lots of raw cream. Lots of raw cream and as much raw meat as he can. 90% of psychological problems are a protein deficiency. You can eat lots of cooked meat and have all the protein in the world, but once it's in a heterocyclic amine form, the poison, the toxic substance, it reacts just the opposite of what it does when it's raw.

Q: One of the things you were talking about, which is like getting up after 4 1⁄2 to 5 hours and having that drink, I'm going to suggest this to him, because he gets up and he's nauseous. He gets very nauseous and cold, and then he gets in the bathtub and warm. So this might help.

A: Definitely. Yes.

Q: Yes. So what about soy milk?

A: Soy milk is the worst thing in the world.

Q: It's still... This is just a...

A: Same thing.

Q: It's made from rice.

A: It's one of the worst things in the world because they have to use solvents to extract it and treat it. It's a high precursor to our hormones that have a tendency to lead to cancer or increase cancer. Yes.

Q: How do you know your blood is acidic or not acidic?

A: Like I say in the book, if you have dark skin, you have a tendency toward acidity. If you're very light skin, pale, alkaline. I'm going to go a little down the line. Okay, yes.

Q: I heard what you said about the diet, the sequence, and so on and so forth. I've been doing milk, raw eggs, and honey in the morning, and that lasts me until lunch usually. I find it works very well. Then one day I didn't have the milk, and I tried the vegetable juice thing in the morning, and it was very hard to digest. I found it very uncomfortable in the stomach. Is that because I'm just used to the other, or...

A: No, you probably waited way too long.

Q: Right.

A: And then when you had, you know, all the acids, all the poisons in the blood dumped into the stomach. So the body had to deal with that dumping of the poisons into the stomach with that juice that wasn't digested. So I say five hours, wake up if possible. That juice will go right through you easily. So healthy, helpful. It gets you ready to digest. But the longer you wait, the more acidic you're going to be, and the less focus and energy you will have. You will notice that if you follow that plan, it will be very different. Sure, milk will satiate you, it will satisfy you, but it's not going to help you rebuild and regenerate cells. You're not going to get younger by drinking the milk. It will help you and get you stronger, but it's not going to make you younger and stronger, you know, as far as regenerating more cells. It will clean you up and rebuild cells that are already alive. But too much milk will cause you to lack hunger for meat. In fact, meat can be repulsive. That's what I said, repulsive, so that's what I said. You need to watch your milk intake. If you start off with milk in the morning, you're going to have a high sugar intake.

Q: See, by lunch, I'm ready for the meat though.

A: Yeah.

Q: And meat is good.

A: But try it the other way and see what happens.

Q: Is it with the juice first? Then the meat.

A: Yeah, but the juice is the first thing getting out of bed. Don't wait an hour or two.

Q: Okay, well, thank you very much.

A: You're welcome.

Q: I already have a high cholesterol, and I'm on Lipitor. So, in all good conscience, how can I eat cream and...

[laughter]

Q: You know, I've been listening, but I can't get over it. I mean, I can't get over the...

A: I said there's a cholesterol myth, and you are the myth. If somebody's cholesterol goes up to 700, I will throw a party for you. I would like everybody's cholesterol level to be sky high.

Q: What if it's bad cholesterol?

A: Pardon?

Q: What if it's bad cholesterol?

A: There's no such thing on this diet as bad cholesterol. See, the thing is that when we took... When I did the laboratory tests, you can take a fat that is floating in the blood, and you can see whether it's presently digested and fresh to the system or it's cauterized from old cooked fats. But that's a $6,000 lab test each time it's done. It's not the $30, $40 lab test that's done with blood. It's a very expensive lab test. But when I found the people on this diet, half of the cholesterol was old toxic stuff leaving the body, floating into the blood and dumping out in the urinary tract or into the bowels, sometimes out the skin. So half of that cholesterol, if you're on this good diet, is garbage stuff leaving the body. So I would like your cholesterol to double, triple, because that means you're getting more of the old toxic cholesterol. So wipe that out. The higher, the better. The higher, the better the party. Cholesterol myth, it is a myth. Cholesterol is not the problem. It's the hardened vegetable oil fats that cause hardening in the body in the problem. Not animal fats and not cholesterol. Yes. 

Q: Types of cheese.

A: Types of cheese, every type of cheese as long as it's raw and no salt added to it. Any type.

Q: When cheese is made, don't they have to heat it up sometimes to make it solidify?

A: No, they don't. They just do it to make it quicker. Let's say they don't like molds to grow on the cheese unless they're intended to show up. So sometimes they will heat it to retard those bacteria so they won't have mold on the cheese. The mold on your cheese is the whole point of cheese. The molds are breaking down the cheese. I'll take my butter and take about a third of it out and swirl it out and let it sit for three months. I've got all this green mold growing in it, blue-green mold growing in it. I've got blue cheese. I love blue cheese. I'll take a little bit of that and blend it with some raw cream and butter or just butter and that. It's a delicious sauce. Roquefort dressing. It's delicious.

Q: Gourmet.

A: Yes, absolutely. So there is no bad mold on a cheese unless it's pasteurized. Just remember that your molds and bacteria that feed on a cooked food are also mutants and diseased. So they will have more toxic byproducts. That's why people who get food poisoning get it on pasteurized dairy, not raw. They get it on cooked meats that have been sitting around because the bacteria that feeds on them gets diseased and the byproducts are very potent. But the only people who get really sick are the people who are treated for it. Otherwise, they just have diarrhea and vomiting. That would be it. But when the medical profession gets a hold of you and gives you antibiotics and other treatments, you are in danger of anaphylaxis, death, kidney damage. All kinds of problems. Yes.

Q: What do you think about [unintelligible]?

A: I put that in my book. Again, it's just like the chemistry of the pharmaceutical industry. It's just that they use smaller amounts, diluted more than the pharmaceutical industry. It's still a chemical. Yes.

Q: If you eat [unintelligible], how much?

A: 75% of the protein is lost. All the enzymes are destroyed.

Q: So it's as bad as cooking?

A: No. Cooking causes toxic byproducts. The freezing just reduces the nutrient level by 75%.

Q: Besides berries, is there anything else that you could...

A: You can freeze dairy if you're going to make ice cream, but you don't want it solid. You want to get to a point with a few hours of freezing. After that, it has to be eaten in 24 hours. But the longer it's frozen, the less nutrients it will have.

Q: So cream is the only thing that you can possibly eat?

A: Well, like I say, if you're making ice cream with eggs and cream and honey and fruit, once in a while, do it. It creates a great lung detoxification for some people. So it's okay. But it's not the best.

Q: So you shouldn't eat frozen?

A: I'm saying it's not good to eat frozen anything. Except for fruits. Okay, I already answered a question of yours. I'll come back to this side. Okay. Yes?

Q: What about things like root canals, which supposedly accumulate...

A: Okay, let's take this into account. A lot of dentists and a lot of practitioners are talking about decay under the tooth after a root canal. The body's trying to reject the tooth. There's no nerve to it now. You've got a root canal. There's about probably that much space. You can barely see it of still root that they haven't been able to clean. And the body decides to clean that out and disengage the tissue from that tooth, there's going to be an abscess. On this diet, I've never found that the case. The body has enough nutrients to handle any kind of a decay and a degeneration of tissue anywhere to keep up with the toxic byproducts. I've had people have lots of abscesses, but it comes out in pus out the side and not around the tooth. And none of them have lost a tooth. Even people with severe damage, that do not have the fillings taken care of. So that usually takes about six months on the diet to stabilize that. If you're in really bad shape and toxic all over in the system, that is not the case in some circumstances. It would be better just to have your teeth pulled in a circumstance like that. But I don't recommend it until that's the last resort. And I've only seen that resort in some people who had advanced cancer. And it was just something that didn't want to rob the nutrients from their body taking care of cancer to deal with the tooth issue. Yes?

Q: On the raw meat question. Would you recommend organic raw meat, fresh organic raw meat, fresh regular raw meat, and then frozen meat? Or is organic frozen meat better than fresh non-frozen meat?

A: I know exactly what you're saying. I will go for the fresh before I will go for frozen organic. Because I know I'm going to regenerate cells. I may have some garbage to throw off but I can handle that. But I'm not going to lose 75% of my ability to regenerate cells. I only eat frozen meat when there's no choice. Like when I was in Thailand, everybody, every restaurant freezes. They will serve it to me raw anywhere. But they always freeze it. So what I had to do was I had to stop going to restaurants and I go to the outdoor markets. And they are great outdoor markets. I mean, you know the coconut cream that I talked about? They have a thing, it's called Kathi there. And they'll take the coconut half and they'll grind it on the machine in an instant. They pack that into a burlap bag, put it in a presser. And it's 50 cents a half a kilo for all this coconut cream. You know, we pay fortunes for your time to do it. And there they've got the meat, and they've got these little instruments that go around knocking the flies away. Of course the flies are all over it, you know. And I'll go up there and say, cut me off a piece of that. And they go, sure. So I just eat it, and the flies have been on it, and I buy it. And it's fresh butchered the day before. And it's from these farmers that don't have any money to use any fertilizers or any chemicals. And it's fabulous. So, you know, you can go around and you can search. But for – for five days I had to eat frozen meat, you know, two times a day at the restaurants until I found out how to get the meat fresh. But that's what you have to do sometimes. So I spent five days of not regenerating any cells.

Q: How'd you feel?

A: I had too much sexual energy. My girlfriend didn't like it at all. Aren't you going to finish? No. Yes?

Q: What about the fact that the fresh meat from the supermarkets is irradiated?

A: Well, that hasn't gone into every place yet. That's only in certain markets that do that. Your smaller markets don't do it at all.

Q: Do what?

A: Irradiating the meats. Mainly it's your pork in those regular markets. Mainly it's your specialty meats which are almost all irradiated now. But your main, when you've got your big cart, your big hats that come into the market, most of those are not irradiated. It's specialty foods, specialty meats. They're gearing up to do more and they will in the next 10 years. But right now that's a fact. If they do, I couldn't eat it. I couldn't eat it out of a regular market because I had the radiation therapy. I can't even eat the, you know, if something goes through the airport radiation, I can't eat it. I have to throw it out because I'll get nauseous. So I won't do it. 

Q: You mentioned that bacteria and viruses are all our friends. What about viruses like HIV?

A: That is a man-made. It's very different. And it doesn't affect most people unless they're treated for the problem. Treated for HIV. If you start getting chemotherapy, you're in trouble. But any virus will call you to go into a, you know, symptomatic detoxification. It's just the doctors have you so worried that they want you to take the medication, and by the time you've taken enough, you die. Let me give you an example. Alan Peterson was one of the first people tested and found with HIV in the late 60s. He was my patient. He lived on my diet only 50% for 14 years with not ever a symptom. Then he went into a heavy detox. There was a pneumonia. And his friends got him panicked. He went to the doctor, started receiving chemotherapy. He was dead in nine weeks. Nine weeks, just because he panicked. He went to the doctors, and the doctors poisoned him. If he'd been on the diet 100%, he probably would have lived through that. But he wasn't. And he loved his alcohol. That was the problem. Wait a minute, I've already answered your question. Let me get back to you after I finish over here. The cycle. I'm going to start again. The wave.

Q: There are two questions, but they're the same subject. High meat. According to what you're saying, even...

A: It's not my name. It's hi Aajonus.

Q: According to what you're saying, even meat that's gone bad is healthy to eat.

A: That's right. It's even better. Yeah. If you take high meat, the higher it is, the better. You will get animals to fight that won't normally fight. Ducks. If you've ever been on a farm and had ducks and you feed them grains, they are the meanest, nastiest little creatures in the world. They'll chase you around the barnyard. I remember getting chased all the time and pecked and everything. If you feed these animals high meat, they will follow you all around. They will follow you everywhere. They will be the sweetest, kindest creatures in the world. Chickens. All of them will all fight over high meat. High meat. I feed the coyotes where I live all the time. The only time that they have fought over the food is when it's been high.

Q: So then, that would answer the question that most of us have about how to get enough organic food to last or meat to last enough time. It doesn't matter if it smells bad. Just kept in the refrigerator.

A: Yeah, great. How many people saw me on Ripley's Believe It or Not a year and a half ago?

Q: I saw it.

A: You saw it. Okay. And Joe. Anybody else? Well, a whole team of photographers came to film this. And I had probably 60 jars of all kinds of endocrine glands, all kinds of tissue in these jars. They were black, they were green, they were blue, they were white. They were all these kinds of molds and melted down. All of them stunk horrendously. And they had a food inspector there. And the food inspector was saying, you eat this, you're going to die. And he said, I'm getting a headache. Yeah, they smell pretty bad. You know, I'm 60, I'm opening them all. We're on the back porch. I don't do this in the house. And all these jars, and they're filming everything. Look at my plate, it's got all this mold. They're even photographing the flies all over it. And I'm eating it all this way. And I probably ate about a half a pound that day. I get no diarrhea, nothing. I just got high for a week. Like I took some drugs.

Q: Does it taste good?

A: Well, the smell is terrible. It tastes like braised in brandy lamb. It's very soft.

Q: No, what I mean is the effect that you have from eating it.

A: When you eat that much, there's enough alcohol to create that kind of an alcoholish high. So for about two hours, I have a little bit of an overalcohol high.

Q: But you could function eating high meat.

A: Absolutely. Yeah, definitely. But normally, you don't eat that much. You call it an golfball-size amount.

Q: How do you get over the smell?

A: We'll get into that in a minute.

Q: How do you get over the smell, do you?

A: You know, funny, once you've had it several times, you start smelling the same. It's like, oh, it smells good. At first, it doesn't. And I suggest you use a swimmer's nose clip.

Q: But this is great. We can get rid of our refrigerators now.

A: No, no, you still want the refrigerator. It'll go too fast. It'll melt too fast.

Q: I tell you, I watched that with my family. And I was eating some of the raw stuff. And I said, hey, that's the guy. That's the guy. They saw what you were doing on there, and they were like, oh. That's crazy.

A: And you know, I've got a vagotomy, you know. So they're saying, oh, my God, this guy is going to die from it. So it's funny. You know, that went worldwide. This is a German company called. We want to do that for here. Can we come to your place and do it? I said, yeah. I said, but get ready for your stuff. You know, the last cameraman puked all over the place. You better get your cameraman ready. He said he had a strong stomach. He didn't have a strong stomach either. Both of them puked. Because they had to get right down in there. You know, these things. It was too much. Yeah, it was too much because they had to get close to it. All the directors and everybody else were standing away.

Q: I understand that wild Alaskan salmon from non [unintelligible] is a good food. It's really only available to the general public frozen. Does that have the same negative effect as frozen meat? So it doesn't pay either.

A: No, it does because in fish you have a high concentration of minerals that you can't get from other foods. And it doesn't completely cause it. It doesn't cause it to become a free radical because it isn't polluted, it isn't cauterized. So it does supply some good nutrients for the nervous system. So if you have to eat frozen fish once in a while, that's okay.

Q: But you wouldn't see it as a steady diet?

A: No, no way. The Eskimos live a shorter life. Eskimos who eat the highest amount of fat and meat of any other tribe in the world because they have to deal with that extreme temperature. They have to heat the body. They live as long as we do because of that tremendous stress and all the frozen foods they eat. I mean, it's January and they've got a hole cut out in the water and they pull the fish out. It's already an icicle. It's a popsicle by the time they get it. And you can hear it. You can see it. It breaks like a popsicle. Chewing into it when they eat it. So a lot of their food six, seven months of the year is frozen. So that's a lot of nutrient loss. So their average lifespan is from 80 to 105 years old. And if they had it fresh, they wouldn't have that problem. Yes.

Q: On your green drink, partially in celery, but can't we vary it somewhat and put in some kale and collards?

A: I didn't say so. I said no more than 5%.

Q: That's it? 

A: Of each one. Yes.

Q: I have a question about the bowels. What I've read, like, to eat our food and everything, if you're really doing it correctly, you should have a bowel movement, let's say, 20 to 30 minutes after you have a meal. Is that hogwash, or what do you think about that?

A: Complete hogwash. On this diet, you shouldn't have much, you know, discharge, much waste product. You're going to absorb most everything when you first get on the diet. Some people have a lot of toxicity they need to release, and they'll go into diarrhea sometimes. But it's really not related to the diet. It's just a cleansing of the toxicity of their systems. There's less vomit and diarrhea and sickness on this diet than any other diet. However, if somebody goes into a vomit and diarrhea, it's all of a sudden, oh, that's the raw meat. Oh, my God. But if they're not eating the raw meat, the raw diet, and they have that kind of symptom, they don't go panic and say, oh, that's the toxic food I've been eating. Yeah, they go on that. They have more symptoms when they're off the diet than on the diet. So that is not an issue. You've got to learn to be rational about this. 

Q: In reference to that question, do you believe in colonics or are those bad ideas?

A: They're all bad ideas. If your E. coli is washed out of the intestines, you lose your most important digestive ability for proteins and amino acids and fats and B vitamins. It's the final stage of digestion. You flush them out, they're gone. People who have very small turds, that's an indication you have a very low E. coli level. 60-80% of fecal matter should be E. coli and E. coli byproducts. So if they're small, you don't have much E. coli. Eat shit. Or take your buffalo rancher who cuts the bowel in the section, ties off like a sausage, and will send it to me or to one of my clients, and she sells it to other people. So we have a tight little quiet network where we do that. So then you cut off like two ounces at a time, and eat the two ounces with the bowel itself. And that will help you regenerate. I mean, the difference is, if I got somebody with Crohn's, does everybody know what Crohn's is?

Q: No.

A: Crohn's is a disease that can get so bad in the intestines that all the poisons leak into the joints. The joints will swell up and become massive. And the toxicity is so bad, it's horrendous and extremely painful, and usually these people die or live a very tortured life. It usually means that a person who's very allergic to any cooked starch, any kind of grain product, should stay away from it like the plague. Well, usually that takes maybe six years on the diet for somebody to completely calm to where they're not having symptoms. If they're eating two ounces of that fecal matter a week, it'll disappear in about six months. Big difference. Huge difference. I'll eat shit if it's going to do that for me. Tell me. Do you know how painful it is if you have advanced stages of it? They can't function. It's impossible. If you ate that for each week, if you ate some, you'd be completely fine.

Q: I would [unintelligible].

A: Yeah, that's what I mean. That's what I said, the book's going to be very comedically titled, but truthfully, eat shit. Just joking.

Q: When you consume fish or chicken, should you still wash it, even though it's organic, have it in the refrigerator when it's fresh?

A: I will only wash it if it's been sitting in plastic. Otherwise, I do not. I want all that bacteria, all of it. What I do is when I get my food, I go to Whole Foods who supplies New Zealand all-grazed beef. In California, they supply it. All the way to New Mexico, I know that Whole Foods supplies it. Here, I don't know when these come. But I have them put it in a plastic bag, a produce bag. When I get home, I cut it up. You mostly get sirloin or top round or bottom round. I cut it up and I put it in glass jars, quart glass jars for the whole week. I shop one day a week. Whether it's fish or chicken, I stuff it into these jars. It keeps very nicely. I went hunting with a fellow, a friend of mine who's a client. We bagged a deer. I skinned it and butchered it in three hours. And I stuffed that meat into jars. I didn't know, I put those jars, some of those jars in the refrigerator, opened them up a year later, and I still had a little air space in them. They were as fresh as when I put them in there.

[audio cut]

A: They are a nutrient. Once you cook it, and it's dangerous, it becomes a free radical. So it doesn't matter what the hell he eats. If he eats herbs, Chinese medicinal herbs, he's going to get metal poisoning if he steeps it and cooks it. Because it completely frees the cadmium, mercury, lead, whatever's in it to become a free radical and a poison. [unintelligible] thimerosal.

Q: So any fish is okay as long as it's...

A: No, farmed fish are terrible. Wild caught fish. Except for the things that you can eat that are farmed, because you can't feed them pellets. There's oysters and there's shellfish. Bottom feeders eat shit. That's their job, and that's good. It's okay. But what they do with the shellfish is when they farm them, all they're doing is putting a fence around that part of the ocean and saying, this belongs to this company. They can't feed them anything other than what they naturally eat. Sometimes they'll cut off the gross and help plant them and spread them around, but that's the only unnatural thing that they do in farming. They don't feed it garbage like the fish they put in these big ponds and feed them cooked, pressed, toxic garbage. The waste products from processing. Yes.

Q: Now, raw meat, if you go out to a restaurant and you say very, very rare, just like...

A: I don't say that. I say cold steak on a cold plate.

Q: Can't you say very, very rare, or does it have to be all the time?

A: That's up to you.

Q: I mean, but is it as good if you just sear the outside a little?

A: Let me sear your body. Just a little. Three seconds on each side. Do you think this is good? Yes.

Q: Is oatmeal any good?

A: What?

Q: Oatmeal.

A: Oatmeal's a high-carbohydrate food. High-carbohydrate food means acrylamides, advanced glycation end products, and a number of other toxic waste products that the human body doesn't handle well. Pardon?

Q: Oatmeal cooked.

A: Oatmeal is dangerous. Toxic.

Q: All that stuff's bad.

A: Yeah, all that stuff's bad. Definitely.

Q: Yeah, with regards to this diet for children, I mean, it's difficult enough for an adult to kind of get...

A: Easier.

Q: It's easier.

A: Easier. In fact, I can't find a child that likes sauces. They just like meat plain. They love it just plain.

Q: The concept of raw. It drives them crazy. It makes them mad. I can't get my kids to have it.

A: Well, you did... They're pretty brainwashed.

Q: Raw milk, you know, it's gross.

A: Yeah. Well, how old are your children?

Q: They're 14. They're teenagers.

A: Yeah, they're already brainwashed. That's not really children. Those are teenagers. They've already reached a certain age where they know everything. And whatever they feel, because of the high hormonal level at that point, because the hormones jack up at that point. So whatever they're believing at that time is true. It's absolutely true. Unless you have great power over them. But that takes a strong hand or a very incredible heart.

Q: Well, I would have to count the data that they've been receiving, you know, where they know that bacteria is bad and all these [unintelligible]. So I have to actually force them. Take away the data and put it away.

A: It takes time with a teenager.

Q: Right.

A: But a child usually doesn't take that.

Q: Yeah, because you're giving this like a clean slate. You're giving them the data now. So they don't have anything to think with in comparison.

A: Yeah, teenagers don't take in the new concepts too easily. They're too toxic. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I've never found anybody allergic to raw eggs. I found that 2% of the people who are allergic to pasteurized milk have tendencies to have these symptoms of allergies to a raw milk. But that's only because the raw casein is binding with the toxic old cauterized casein in my lab tests. So they still have the symptoms of the allergy to the dairy. But if they consume half a cup of milk every day for three months, it'll be gone. So actually, there's no allergy to raw milk or eggs. Or any raw food. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible] You talk about the animal, and you talk about the tribal cultures. But I don't know any tribal cultures or animals that have juicers.

A: They have what?

Q: Juicers.

A: Well, they do. You see a dog or a cat go out and chew the grass and spit out the pulp. They're juicing here. But you're also looking at these animals not as toxic as humans are. So they don't need that juice. But even the gorillas will chew on leaves and then spit out the pulp. Throw away the pulp. They're using their mouths as a juicer. We don't have time to sit around and chew the juice. Gorillas can sit around and pick and choose.

Q: So it's just not time.

A: We don't have time. We have to work, take care of our kids.

Q: This is more [unintelligible] time process because I can't see the benefit of celery juice as opposed to celery itself.

A: Didn't I say that if you eat the pulp, it goes through and alkalinizes the entire intestine? If it turns it alkaline, it'll damage the bacteria in your intestines to digest the meat, the eggs, and the dairy. You won't digest properly. If you have the juice, it's gone and into the blood by the time it leaves the duodenum. So it doesn't have to ever affect the alkalinity, acidity level in the intestine.

Q: Oh, but then we've been eating raw vegetables for centuries. I mean, I'm serious.

A: If you're eating cooked meats, whole raw vegetables is an acid. If you're eating raw meat, it's not an acid. It's a detriment. Okay? Yes?

Q: You brought up about the shellfish earlier. What causes the poisoning of oysters periodically?

A: There is no poisoning in oysters. That's another myth.

Q: Well, I had oysters not that long ago, and I got very violently ill.

A: Well, that's not violent at all. Throwing up just means that you went through a detoxification.

Q: Okay, I accept that, but it still was something that reacted to me.

A: Well, it's probably a metal detoxification from your gallbladder or your liver. The metals that are in, the high metals that are in an oyster or a clam often attract metals out of one of your organs or one of your glands. That'll cause a vomiting or a diarrhea, but you should be glad you got rid of them. I'll give you an example. I see some people who are lathe operators. Have you ever seen a lathe operator? They use oil on these lathes as they're cutting metal, and the whole atmosphere is thick with oil, and all this metal going everywhere. So they have all this metal from head to toe. They do not relax well. They cannot be in good relationships. They're highly sexual. You can have a good sexual relationship with one of these people, but you don't want to have a good loving relationship with them because they can't calm down. And I've known five of them in that kind of a situation, highly toxic. Also, people who grew up under an airport, the same kind of metal poisoning. Full in their bodies, eyes just gray with this metal poisoning, irises. So I got an idea, you know, I would use the berries and the creams, the coconut cream and all that. But I got an idea. I said, wait a minute, if I get somebody to have oysters and clams every day with each red meat meal, have two to three clams or oysters with their red meat, so a cup of red meat and two to three oysters with each meat meal, six days a week, I bet that I can help the body clean out the metals quicker. Because usually over a, you know, that kind of metal poisoning could take about 26 years, 30 years to clean out completely. So I had this one girl who grew up under an airport who was riddled with it all over. And she grew up near a London airport in Europe, in Britain. So just full of it. So she ate three oysters with each meat meal twice a day, so she had six a day, three dozen a week. In one year she cleaned out what I've seen other people take six years to clean, she did it in one year, using the oysters. And she went through several times of heavy vomiting and diarrhea, and that was highly metallic, she said, stunk like metal. Diarrhea and vomit. And before, when I used to spend a lot of money on laboratory tests, I had that measured many times. There was always heavy metals or some kind of poison in the vomit and diarrhea, and that's why you have vomit and diarrhea. Vomit is the best way out of the system for any toxins. If you vomit, you can get rid of more poisons in a day of vomiting than you can in three months of slow detoxification. The second best is diarrhea. However, you're going to lose a lot of nutrients and be weaker if you have diarrhea, but it's still a quick way out for some very toxic poisons. And some of them are too toxic to come up through the throat, because they'll burn and rip the throat apart. So they have to go out through diarrhea in the bowels. So you should be happy about all of that. I spent over a million dollars on my research, and I'm not doing any more. If anybody wants to do it, they can do it. Here, let me finish over here.

Q: I'm quite allergic to tomatoes, but it's raw, cooked, or in ketchup. I get osteoarthritic fingers really bad every time I say, Oh, it's just a one or two bottles of tomato [unintelligible]. And I'll pay for the price for osteoarthritic fingers the next week.

A: That usually means that you have a hormone toxicity. The bursa hasn't been manufacturing the proper fluid for your joints, and it's highly toxic. It usually means you've got radioactive mercury or iodine in the bursas, and they're sitting out. Pardon?

Q: There you go. So what's my solution?

A: Take coconut cream and raw cream with the tomato juice, then it'll pull it out.

Q: And so I just suffer through this?

A: You won't have it if you have coconut cream and raw cream, cow's cream with the juice. Very little of that will you experience while you detoxify. Yes?

Q: The other day I had to throw out some eggs because they smelled real bad. I didn't keep them in the refrigerator. I know, I didn't know, but now it's okay to eat them, right?

A: Anytime I hear that, I say, well, bring them over to me. The Chinese have what they call the century egg. And it's anywhere from up to 25 years old. So when you open it, it's nothing but black, you know, bacteria, white bacteria. And these old octogenarians will pay $1,000 for one of those eggs because they can have sex three or four times a day. They can ejaculate twice a day for a month. It's worth $1,000 for these old conchers, you know? So why not? So, hell, just make your own. It won't cost you, but, you know, maybe 50 cents an egg. 

Q: You've got to wait 25 years.

A: No, you don't have to wait that long. That's just to have it, you know, all that powder molding it like that and the powdered kind of bacteria. Please, please, please. When they age it in clays like that, the Chinese, it's a very cultured way of doing it so it's not messy, it doesn't stink, okay? So it's very socially oriented and okay. But let me tell you, the stinkier, the higher, the more so-called rotten it is, the better. Those eggs, all they taste like is hard-boiled eggs with a bottle of salt poured over them. They taste way too salty. It's just the odor again that is horrendous. 

Q: How do you get them down?

A: Oh, just take them. Put a swimmer's nose clip on your nose.

Q: So you're saying the thousand-year eggs are good to eat then?

A: Yeah, but it's better to make your own. And it's funny, none of the stinky food will create a body odor. Sometimes cheeses will, but it's rare. But none of the high meat or high eggs, no matter how badly they smell, never cause the body to smell. Sometimes if it causes a detoxification of toxic metals into the bowels, then you'll have that horrendous metallic smell. But it never smells like when it went in. The body uses all that bacteria wonderfully. 

Q: I've been eating raw meat for 60 years.

Q: How long?

Q: 60 years.

Q: Are you 104?

Q: Where is the guy?

A: There are, you know, the Romanians, they eat kibbeh. They eat it from the day of their children, all the way up. Steak tartare in Germany, they consume more steak tartare than raw eggs and raw meat. More than any other country, a mass amount.

Q: Yeah, I heard lately where...

A: This is the last time I'm going to, and then we've got to stop.

Q: I heard that soybean and corn and wheatgrass now is genetically engineered by Monsanto Company. I didn't know about the corn and the wheatgrass. I know the soybean has been genetically engineered for a long time.

A: Corn has too. Grasses have, but not necessarily wheatgrass.

Q: So it's ancient origin. I mean, it's just poison that they're giving us.

A: Yep. Well, you're only going to get that stuff if you go to a regular market.

Q: Why do they help them sell so much soy? They've got wall-to-wall soy.

A: Because they're sold that it's good. They've got the biggest marketing industry on soy. But the information is out there that proves that it's bad stuff, very bad stuff. Yes?

Q: Have you heard of the Russian technique for detoxing? [unintelligible]

A: It will help draw it out of your gums. Like I said, it does come out of your gums. He said that there's a Russian method of detoxing metals from your brain and your head. And that's to take oil and put it in your mouth, swish it around for a while. It will attract the metals out of your brain, out of your head, out of the gums. It's, you know, when you're doing an oil like that, you know, it tends to take all the mucus away. It makes the gums sensitive and nerve, and your tongue opens up and starts blistering. So it's not, I don't say it's a comfortable way to do it. I prefer the coconut cream with the cream and butter.

Q: What kind of oil do you use?

A: Olive oil, flax oil, any of those oils.

Q: On this diet, are there any vitamins or supplements?

A: Any vitamin supplement is not food. It is then a chemical. Once you dry it, once you use either heat or a solvent to separate any kind of item, it is no longer raw. Would you soak your, let's say, apples or bananas or anything in kerosene before you ate them and say it was good food? It penetrates the cell walls and goes into that food, into those cells. So those nutrients are no longer nutrients anymore. They are chemically irritated and they are chemicals. 

Q: So under this diet, one can give up all those? 

A: Your vegetable juice are your vitamin enzymes and mineral supplementation. That's why I want you to have them three or four times a day.

Q: Right.

A: And they're all alive and active. You'll be able to utilize every one of them. When you're taking a supplement, you may utilize the best two to twelve percent. That means all the rest is toxic. Eighty-eight percent toxicity minimum. So you're not going to gain much. And most of the reactions to, well, I feel better, sure. So you can do cocaine, you know, coffee, you're going to have the same reaction. And it's not a good one. It's a toxic high. It's an adrenaline rush when you put poisons in the body. 

Q: What about sea vegetables?

A: Sea vegetables are absolutely indigestible for a human. You don't have any enzymes near the digestion of a fish to be able to disassemble that complex cellulose molecule. Even if it's in a, you know, unicellular form, you don't have it. It takes a fish. Yes.

Q: When you're talking about root canals, what about those people who have lots of root canals, all root canals?

A: I have seven, and I don't have a problem. Yes.

Q: My family member, he still smokes his Lucky Strikes like he used to smoke.

A: Weren't they good? Let me tell you, I would still smoke... I love smoking. I would still smoke today if they were healthy.

Q: He fills his mucus up in his body, and then periodically he has to be seven days off. He's dealing with nonstop vomiting and nausea.

A: Great, he's cleaning out.

Q: Does the body deal with cigarettes like it's another poison or something?

A: Oh, absolutely. That smoke is, you know, you're carrying some heavy metals, as well as the carbon monoxide. The tars are very heavy. Marijuana smokers are even worse at risk because marijuana has 16 to 20 times more tars than regular cigarettes. More fats, so more dangerous.

Q: Herbal teas.

A: Herbal teas, did I mention earlier? You can take good herbs, Chinese herbs. Once you steep them, it releases all the heavy metals, the arsenic, the lead, the mercury. It becomes a free radical, and it's toxic. That's why they work. They poison the system, cause an adrenaline rush, so you think you're healthy. But you're slowly, slowly poisoning the body. YOuäre going to move toward more disease. Yes?

Q: You're not going to do the entire diet that you laid out. Are there certain pieces of it that you'd recommend are more important?

A: It depends upon the individual. I couldn't make a general statement about that.

Q: All right.

A: Yes?

Q: Genetically engineered corn fed to cows with milk. If that's raw milk, is that still okay, or is that a problem?

A: It's less likely to cause you damage, but it's still a risk. Yes?

Q: What about wheat germ oil?

A: Wheat germ oil is all solvent-extracted. It's like soaking the oil in kerosene. So is all cod liver oil. It's all purified. It has to meet FDA regulations. I don't care if it came from Iceland or wherever it is. It is a law. They have to clean it and purify it according to certain standards. So it is always treated chemically. In the 70s, it was fine. There were not those laws, but now the laws are in place.

Q: What about flax oil?

A: Flax oil is pretty good. But again, it is solvent reactive, so you don't want to have it by itself and you don't want to have too much of it.

Q: Do you have it with meat?

A: Yes, you can have it with meat or fish. Because it tastes like fish, you may as well have it with fish.

Q: I heard you mentioned that. What do you use for cleansing?

A: I use an egg or a combination of two ounces of vegetable juice and one egg. Vegetable juice and egg. And if your hair is very dry, then use milk. If it's oily, don't use milk. It will condition the hair. I just blend them, put a little honey in it, and I'll put it on dry.

Q: That's good. Makes you delicious, too.

A: Yes, Joe. 

Q: Detoxification question. You were talking earlier about this lady who detoxified and was throwing up and...

A: Diarrhea.

Q: Diarrhea. Had she had a tremendous amount of fat on her body, would she still have created that same type of detox, or would it have been a different detox that she wouldn't even know that it had?

A: She was about 25 pounds overweight. I wouldn't have done that test on her had she not had that much weight. Over.

Q: And she's still vomiting and diarrhea.

A: Yeah.

Q: So even with a massive amount of fat, those things can happen in your detoxification.

A: If you're putting out some heavy, concentrated poisons, they're not going to store in your body in the tissue. It needs to dump it quickly.

Q: And how does it dump it other than vomit and just through our urine and our...

A: There is no other way except building into the hair and out the system. But if it's highly concentrated, caustic, you know, chemical reaction, it's going to be vomited or diarrhea. If you get a sore and it's coming out the skin and you get an abrasion, you know that that's a heavy, toxic substance coming out through your skin. And sometimes that's the way it has to go because it's just too radical to take out through the throat or the bowels because it could cause ulcers and peritonitis. I've seen some massive sores. Cancer is one. If you have basal cell cancer and it's rotting your breast away, all the poisons are coming out here. Just remember, the cancer is better than a benign tumor. If somebody says, I've got a tumor, I say, is it malignant or benign? They'll say malignant. I'll say, oh, good. They say, are you crazy? I'll say, no, if you have a benign tumor, it may take 20 years, 30 years to get rid of a benign tumor. Cancer cells have a serum in it, which is a solvent. Cancer cells are surrounded by 50 dead cells. So if the cancer cell dies, it will dissolve all the surrounding cells, dead cells that make up the tumor. So you can get rid of it in weeks, months. It won't take 20, 30 years like a benign will, because your body has to go in with the lymph system, disassemble the benign tumor, little by cell by cell, and work it down. It depends on how well you eat and how healthy you are to break it down. But a tumor, a carcinogenic tumor, can dissolve like that and be gone. And you have to handle the waste products, or else you'll just dissolve your whole body away as it comes out. And that's usually what happens. Nobody has enough fat to deal with that. It burns the entire flesh of it. And I've seen enough of that. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible] human growth hormones?

A: There's no such thing. That is such a marketing bullshit thing, you know. Human growth hormones. You know where to get those human growth hormones? From vegetables. From grasses. And they get this growth hormone in a grass like wheatgrass and call it human growth hormones. I beg your pardon? It's not human growth hormones. Human growth hormones are only formed in the human body. And they can only do it with high amounts of raw meat. Yes?

Q: So, as far as eating shit.

A: What?

Q: I didn't say that. It's just slipped out. 

Q: I mean, how does...

Q: Spit it out.

A: What are you trying to say?

Q: How do you... If you wanted to try this...

A: I would go kick a bull's ass. No, like I say, I have an outlet. I, you know, I get it and I cut it up and eat it. As easy as that.

Q: Okay, so I mean... I mean, isn't there like a certain quantities or so much times a week or where do you get it? You don't...

A: Like I say, I have an outlet for it, you know. Email me and I'll give it to you. I don't have it here. optimal@earthlink.net. Email me and... Now, if you email me for questions, I will charge you. Emails are very expensive. It's better to call me. So, I charge $120 an hour, $2 a minute with a 10-minute minimum and it goes in 5-minute increments. Half the price of the psychic's off of TV, so... Anyway, I will answer questions from 7 to 9 Pacific time any morning that I'm in town. If I don't answer, that means I'm not in town and I'll get back to you. If it's an emergency, tell me that it's an emergency. Always leave your number two times. If you're on the cell phone or I'm on the cell phone and it cuts out with that number, I'm not going to call you back because I won't know the number. So, say it twice and say it slowly. You know, people will say the whole message suddenly and then it gets to the numbers. And if I have to go back and listen to it 5 times to get the number, you won't get called back because I won't do it. I don't have the time. So, leave a slow message, especially when it comes to the phone number. And if I'm not in town, you leave your symptoms on the message because I'm not going to play phone tag with you. So, I can leave the answers if I call you and don't catch you in. Okay?

Q: And what's your phone number?

A: 310-589-0589.

Q: What makes [unintelligible]?

A: Poop in the woods has been oxidized and the bacteria deteriorates with oxidization. That's why I like to keep it in a glass jar. It's still inside the bowel.

Q: How long will you keep it in the jar?

A: A year or two. Don't put it in the refrigerator. Keep it outside in a box. You don't want it smelling up your house because it will. So will high meat if you don't open it every day. It will gas out and smell up your refrigerator. But the fecal matter, do not put it in the refrigerator. Put it in a box outside. And it will even gas out so it might be a good idea to open it if you keep it in the garage so it doesn't freeze.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They won't smell it.

Q: No?

A: No. Yes?

Q: Is sushi part of the raw food diet?

A: Yes. Well, sashimi is. Not the rice. This is it. Oh, one more over here.

Q: We have a friend who had very bad arthritis for a number of years. And she took a chemotherapy agent called methotrexate, which is a folic acid inhibitor. And now all the neurons are dying in her body.

A: She creates MS.

Q: Well, it's a type of MS. She's paralyzed. She can't urinate. Now she can't get out of the chair. What can she do?

A: Go back and sue the doctor first. It's very difficult to reverse that. I usually send people like that to a tropical climate like, you know, Oaxaca, somewhere down in Mexico, or some tropical place, and they have to eat this diet to the tee, coconut cream, everything, and make sure that they have those foods. And usually people have to wait on them. I had one woman who was so advanced, fourth stage in MS, you couldn't get this close to her without screaming. She could actually feel the pain if you got that close to her. So what they had to do to get her to see me was she had to buy four first-class seats on an airplane. They had to bolt her gurney down because she couldn't be moved, except on her gurney. Bolted her down onto that, then took her in a, you know, one of those life squads, what do they call them? Yeah, what do they call them? Life squad.

Q: Paramedic.

A: Paramedic vans. Brought them up to my house. Sent her down to Mexico, and it's four years later and she's walking, functioning normally. She's not pain-free, but she's functioning normally. Before she had to be weighted on for everything. She could prepare her own food now. She couldn't do anything before. So in only four years. They said, irreversible, she's definitely going to die painfully within about six months. The doctors don't know. They are only taught drugs and surgery. That's all they're taught. And that's because the pharmaceutical houses took over the universities in the early 1900s. Carnegie and Rockefeller. High subsidies. You do this and test this way. You look for this chemical and we'll give you lots of money. Chemical treatment. You look for chemical treatment, we'll give you lots of money. That's the name of the game. Yes. Last question.

Q: We've been led to believe that wheatgrass is sort of a miracle drink. I have an impression just from reading a little sentence in your book here that you don't think so. Am I misreading you? What do you think about that?

A: No, I think wheatgrass juice is the worst vegetable you can eat.

Q: Wheatgrass is the worst?

A: Yep. Wheatgrass juice is the worst because it turns the blood acid and turns the intestines alkaline, exactly the opposite of all the other vegetables in the world.

Q: Wow.

A: And all these people that claim to be getting better by going to the health institute and drinking all these juices and carrying, I mean, wheatgrass juice and doing coffee enemas and all this, let me tell you, most of them walk out of there, basket cases near death. I get sent a lot of them, and I have to help them recover from that. Not good. You know, if you're, you know, 100 pounds overweight, three weeks there, it could be fine. But if you're, you know, only 30, 40 pounds underweight or less, you should not ever go to that place. That's not a healing method. That's a decomposing method. It's going to deteriorate your body. High fruits, high sugar, high carrots, all that sugar is just going to melt away the system. Okay, now...

Q: [unintelligible] they don't have a fixed food there at all. It's junk. And we've been there. It's junk food.

A: I agree. It's not worth eating. Okay, now I'm going to do... How many people do we have doing the mini readings? We got 14?

Q: Four.

A: Four? Look at all these people.

Q: So you're talking about the mini readings?

[audio cut]

A: Yes. So oils, pressed oils, are very difficult to digest unless they're full of bacteria. So that that tastes like fish is the kind you want. If you get the fresh, just let it age.

Q: Okay, can everybody kind of keep quiet now?

A: All right, your name please.

Q: Gita.

A: Okay, what I need you to do is when you come here, I need you to let your hands rest in my hand and go limp, okay? Your name?

Q: Gita Whitfield. Gita.

A: Okay, Gita. All right, you have lots of metal poisoning throughout the body. Your lower glands on the left side seem to be good and stable, even your pancreas. The right side looks like about 60% protein deficiency, except in the right side of the pancreas. That's stable. Thyroid's good. Parathyroid's excellent. All the lymph glands around the tonsils are good, but it looks like there's some scar tissue in the tonsils. Do you have your tonsils removed?

Q: Yes.

A: Yeah, so the lymph glands are good, but you have lots of scarring at the tonsils. Left side of the thyroid is good. The parathyroids are great. The thymus is heavily scarred on both sides. It looks like you almost have a tumor in the thymus. The liver is okay. The kidneys are okay. A little edema there. You have heavy metals everywhere, though, especially in the brain, chest, shoulders, small intestines. Tissue along the spine is good. You mainly need to eat red meat. There's a lot of signs of anemia. However, with all that glandular activity, and you do have a lot, most people your age do not have that kind of glandular activity. So it's very good. So I suggest that you either eat egg or white meat. Anytime you eat red meat. How old are you?

Q: 69.

A: I recommend about 12 weight ounces of meat a day minimum, up to a pound. Coconut cream is going to be very vital in getting rid of those metals, so the berries mainly. You have iodine. Did you take an iodine supplement, a vitamin supplement with iodine in it?

Q: Well, I don't know. I take some vitamins, Q10, and what's the other? [unintelligible]. I had that two years ago. But I didn't know then what to do, but I know now.

A: So you had heart failure?

Q: Yeah, congestive heart failure, yes, two years ago. And I think they gave me too much coumadine, and so I had to be there the second time in one year. And the blood started coming through the mouth.

A: It looks like it was misdiagnosed. Do you have a problem with your thymus? Your heart doesn't look like it had a problem.

Q: Yeah, but my heart muscles don't close all the way.

A: But that's from the toxicity in your thymus. It's poisoning your heart. It's right here, and it's just poisoning the heart. 

Q: So what happened to this, so that I all of a sudden couldn't breathe anymore, and I had to sit up a certain hour in the morning, and that's when they diagnosed congestive heart failure.

A: They misdiagnosed it. Because the thymus was poisoning the heart, and all you had to do was eat lots of eggs. A lot of them and just keep propped up, you know, like 10, 15, 20 eggs a day, even 30 eggs a day. But there was no congestive heart failure. There was no congestive heart failure. You don't have any symptoms of that. Now you have a heart problem. But it's still not that bad. Your problem is in your thymus. And I can't tell it was. It almost looks like you have cancer there. That's not a bad thing. You just need to reverse it. Cream is most important. Yes. And the juice, I'm going to recommend 65% celery, 20% parsley, 5% cilantro, and the rest cucumber. And I suggest that you have a tablespoon of coconut cream before each juice, and a tablespoon of cow's cream in the juice right before you drink it, or half a tablespoon of butter before you drink it. You have the coconut cream, then the butter, and then the juice. Okay?

Q: Thank you so much. Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: I cannot thank you enough.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, Harry wants to keep a copy. Do you have another recorder?

Q: What machine does it go in? 

A: Stop, eject. There we go. Okay. A-side up. There we go. And play. Thank you. Take that up. Are we ready?

Q: Wait a second.

Q: Thank you very much.
