Q: If you're doing a little consult and stuff, I first got introduced to Aajonus about five years ago and I was quite sick with a kind of an arthritic chronic fatigue type thing. My hands, that was about as close as they could go, I was miserable, depressed and I started searching and I went for raw food and I got introduced to raw food. I went to the Southport Public Library and googled raw food books and Aajonus' book came up and so I got it and I started reading it and it was like, you've got to be kidding! So for any of you who are here and are just kind of wondering why you would even do this kind of a diet, well I was in the same boat. So I kind of started, it took me a long time before I could eat raw chicken and stuff and then Deb, my friend, got into it and we kind of supported each other and the changes in me were really just quite miraculous. My fingers just cleared up, I could move my hands now. I can't say that I've been on this diet the whole time, I certainly haven't. I fluctuate in and out but it really, it was a turning point in my life as far as nutrition and I knew that what you put in has a huge effect on your body, I didn't realise what you put in had a huge effect on your body. I thought as long as I was eating healthily, I didn't understand the difference between eating healthily and eating the way Aajonus eats. I wasn't clear on that at all and even now, like he's staying with us, the things that I have learnt in having him in my house for two days is just phenomenal. Just little things, it's like, and I can just ask him and it's like the light goes on. You know when you know the truth? The light goes on and you just feel like this kind of little freedom thing happen, because it's like of course. And that's what's happened to me since knowing this man, it's like, even I was making yesterday, Chris and I were making the cat scratching thingy. And someone had given me some carpet, their parents had just re-carpeted it and I'd finished the whole thing and I'm so stoked. And he comes out and he says, is that cotton? It's like, are you kidding me? And I was like, of course. I didn't even think of that. So now the whole thing's going to get re-covered in different material so that we have, and he said, and I said, how do I know? And he said, go and burn it. So I snuck around the back and burn it and sure enough it turned into little molten blobules. And so it's made out of all toxic material and just little things like that I hadn't even considered. So it's just wonderful for you all to be here and to maybe this could be the day that your life starts turning around and you know, so, it's just wonderful. And the people that you meet, they come to my house, I don't need them to go anywhere. Cool. So anyway, here's me old mate, Aajonus.

A: The whole idea of that carpet was that it's plastic fibers and all material lints. So you'd be breathing, her cats, she, Chris, everybody will be breathing plastic lint. The body, when it breaks it down, guess what it releases? It releases the bisphenol phosphates, the phthalates, all the plastic resins that are in that will be released in your lungs. Can you utilize that? No. It will usually cause burning in your lungs and you, which is from one fiber, you could lose five pores of your lungs. One fiber. People don't realize that when they wear synthetic clothes it's the same way. So you got to go for a cotton, something will break down and not become toxic in your body, silk, wool, those kind of things can do well with you. If you're allergic to wool, that just means you're not producing enough mucus to protect the mucus lining. And some fibers can be carried out of the body with the mucus, you know, bring it up, puff it out, or take it to the intestinal tract without digestion, but plastic does not transfer that way, it would be highly toxic. Anyway, I got into health because I was a very sickly individual. I was born in a violent household, I had a brother who was 18 months older than I and still in diapers. He was very jealous of me taking mother's attention away as soon as I got home from the hospital, so he did everything he could to torture me every day, until I was 15 and a half and he went off to the Vietnam War. So he would start off pulling my hair, pinching me, causing me bruises all over, then he found that if he pushed me on a rake one time, my mother would freak out because my mother was a nurse, and worries about lockjaw. I don't think I've ever seen her panic about anything other than lockjaw, and I don't think she's ever, ever seen a patient die of lockjaw, but it's just some phobia she had in her mind. So of course at six months old I was taken to the doctor and given a tetanus shot. Six months later another tetanus shot because my brother pushed me on a rusty nail. My brother learned that if I came in contact with something rusty, I would get an injection and I would be sick for weeks afterwards. 

So on the 18th month he pushed me on a lawnmower blade that was rusty and slashed my arm here, and my mother took me for my third tetanus shot. Now tetanus shots were supposed to be good for at least a year, but up to five years. So why was my mother giving me tetanus shots every six months? Paranoia. And if you look at what's in any kind of vaccine, including tetanus, there's nothing safe in it. In fact everything in a vaccine is highly toxic. Five basic ingredients in every vaccine produced liquid mercury, liquid aluminum, formaldehyde, ether and detergent. There was a Saturday Night Live type group in Canada that did a skit on it. It was coming around for the flu season and they said, went around interviewing people about getting a flu shot, whether it was a good thing and you know the government pays for it, but who really pays for it. So they just played with all these things and he said, we'll make your flu shot. Takes a blender, takes a thermometer, dumps some mercury in it, aluminum, detergent, ether, rotten egg and offers it to people to drink. If you won't even drink it, why would you inject it into your body? Every vaccine. Why would you ever inject it into your child? They have up to 53 toxic ingredients in every vaccine, especially the flu shots. But every shot that you give your child or yourself is full of those toxic ingredients. Now one vaccine is 1,700 times the toxic dose that the FDA, America's FDA and your FDA is the same thing. It's the same thing with everything the United States government says for some reason, which is crazy. So you have 1,200 to 1,700 times the lethal, toxic dose of mercury in every vaccine. Why in the world would anybody inject themselves with a whole soup of toxicity? Not a good thing. So if you go to "Alberta University YouTube mercury neurons", search that on the net and you come up with a video which shows what mercury does to neurons, it actually disintegrates them without even coming in contact with them. They show a Petri dish with neurons from snail brains, which are identical to all brains on the planet, and they put the mercury at a distance, let's say this is the Petri dish, and here are the neurons.

They dump the mercury way over here on the side. All of a sudden within seconds, the neurons just start disintegrating, evaporating. So that's what mercury does. So the mercury went into my communication center and made me autistic. I was one of the earliest talkers in the family. I said the first word at five and a half months. After that third tetanus shot went to my brain, I was no longer able to relate language, whether it was spoken or written, to any kind of communication device at all. So when I got into school, I had to cheat, I always picked the smartest, most intelligent, sensitive girl in the class to sit next to, and I would copy her hieroglyphs. So that's how I got through school. And by the time I was eight years old, I learned to parrot language. It took me until I was eight years old to hear sound patterns enough so that I could take them and tell other people. So of course, whatever I heard in my household is what I gave to the kids at school and the priests and the nuns. And it was, shut up, sit down, you're an idiot. Those are the things I would say to other kids and the priests and nuns. So I was always getting beat up, always getting disciplined. So it was not an easy life. Then when I hit twelve years old, I developed a case of peritonitis. Now before that, I would keep a cold for three to four months at a time, I'd be bedridden for at least a month a year. And home from school, probably three months out of the year, but bedridden a full month out of the year at least. So I just kept getting sicker because my mother was a nurse, administered medication. It was an ironic thing because my mother would say, you take the least medication necessary. But she was always shoving medication down me or injecting it in me. So it didn't make a lot of sense at all. And I found that the whole pattern of the adult is to lie about everything. Lie, lie, lie. Everything was for your own good and it was ok to lie because they were taking care of your well-being.

And you have to get over that because your kids know that you lie to them all the time. And then when they hit about six, seven years old, they've adapted. They say lying is a part of being a human. So they adopt it. And then you're stuck with that for the rest of your lives with that child. So remember that. And an autistic child is even more perceptive because they don't get to choose to communicate in the same way. They can't do it. And every time I go off into my stare, my mother, father would slap me on the back or back of the head, say stop that, you look like an idiot. Well, I was an idiot. But when a child does that, when a child goes off, they've built up so much stress and anxiety that they just need to leave all of that space. It's like just separating yourself from pain and anxiety. So it's not a bad thing, just let them do it. It's like a rest, but it's a vacation. But they didn't let me do it. So I learned that I had to emulate the coolest people of the time and that was Paul Newman, James Dean, Elvis Presley. So I learned to strike those pose so I wouldn't look like an autistic kid. So I got beat up less doing that. I said less. Priests were very difficult. You needed to answer them. You had to say something. Of course, the only thing I could say was the same things that I heard in my household. So I was constantly getting disciplined and beat up. So when I hit 8 years old, I learned to parrot language, throw it back, also realized that I was going to get beat every morning of my life because I couldn't get out of bed. I had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. Every bone, every joint in my body ached. Every muscle ached. Every time I got a shot it was almost a year before I could lift the arm above this level. And they were doing it on both sides and then the buttocks and then the legs. So I was pretty much a mess. So I saw my parents drinking coffee and getting a buzz and I don't know why it didn't register before, but it registered that morning. So I went and poured myself a cup of coffee. Parents freaked out.

Again, hypocrisy. They are doing it, why can't I? They are getting a buzz off of it. They wouldn't let me do it. So I would sneak in at night and nobody ever drank the bottom of the pot. There was always three quarters to a cup at the bottom of the pot. So I'd go there in the middle of the night, dump it all out, put it in the sink. My mother thought, oh my husband got up earlier and rinsed it or put it in the sink. And then he would think the same thing if he found it in the sink. So I put my cup of coffee under the bed and when they came and knocked on the door, rise and shine, you know, I got under the bed and drank the coffee and stuffed the jar back under and I left it there the whole day until the night before and then I'd keep filling it up. I never cleaned it. I didn't have that kind of consciousness of fear because I couldn't communicate in the first place. I didn't understand and on a pure, instinctual level, there was no fear that I was going to get some bacteria from that jar, repeatedly using it, never rinsing it. But it gave me a good buzz. And it only worked for about three or four hours. So then I would find myself getting sleepy in class again. I was always getting disciplined because I was falling asleep in class. I didn't sleep at night because I was afraid my brother would come and hit me in the stomach and knock the wind out of me and then I would black out because I couldn't breathe. My heart would stop. And also there was always the boogeyman under the bed. When you live in a house... My father put me in the hospital several times. He was embarrassed. He invented the first Bering computer, a genius, but not emotionally developed. So he was very embarrassed by me. So he put me in the hospital several times, broke both my eardrums once, he said, I told you to listen to me, popped both eardrums, I lost 80% hearing in this one, 60% in the other. Now it's just reversed. I have 80% hearing in this one and 60% hearing in this one. So I reversed it over many, many years, reversing it still. So the violence that was thrust upon me was difficult. I was unable to sleep at night and then I would sleep during classes. 

So then the discipline started getting worse so I'd have to stay after school, detention, things that I didn't understand, I'd have to write out a hundred times a sentence, something I did or didn't do, and that was easy because it was just copying something. But understanding it, I had no understanding of it at all. So to stay awake in class, I started smoking. I'd go out into the woods on the side of the school and take a cigarette, take a few hits off of it, put it in a little tin box and put it in the ground, rocks over it. So I was smoking and at 8 years old I was smoking and drinking coffee to be able to function. So this went on. By the time I was 16 years old, well when I was 12 years old, I got peritonitis, there was misdiagnosis and appendicitis. So I was rushed to the hospital because I was writhing in pain, screaming and writhing in pain for hours and that started at school. So they got me home, took me to the hospital, the doctor diagnosed it as appendicitis, went in to take it out, found it in good condition, took it out anyway, just in case. That's doctor's thinking, you have to understand that they don't consider the body smart or intelligent. If you talked about them about a higher being, in their deepest soul, there is no such thing. Because everything in nature is out to do you in and that's the bacteria theory. Well how can the bacteria theory be right? We have 260 bacterial genes to every one human gene. We're not even 0.1% human. We're 99.9% bacterial. If you grasp that, you can say, how can a few little microbes take over the whole body? It's an insanity, it's stupidity. But our whole educational system and our society is geared to hold doctors up to the highest ilk and it's terrible because now it's a religion. If you don't take your children to a doctor, you can have them taken away from you, which is as bad as the inquisition. Take your children away from you because you feed them raw milk or you don't want to take them and put them in a school. You want to homeschool them. It's a terrible law.

But who makes these laws? People who support the medical system who get into politics. It's a done deal. And the money in it is grandiose. You can wager that nine out of ten of all your politicians have stock in pharmaceuticals. Nine out of ten. In America it's 49 out of 50 and you only have 535 people. So that means how many do we have that are not corrupt? We have nine, nine congress persons who do not have stock in pharmaceuticals. So that's the way the whole system works. So after that peritonitis episode, they were injecting me because my fever was going up to 106 and 107, thought there'd be brain damage, there was already brain damage, but they were expecting more, so they were packing me in ice, in a tub of ice, and freezing to death. It was brutal. Injecting me every few hours, and I'm not talking about four or five hours, I'm talking about every two to three hours, sometimes less, around the clock. So I was swollen, I was puffy, I was black and blue, I was yellow, and pale white, so pale it looked like I was going to die. And then I refused. I refused to take any more medications when the nurse came in with a tray, that tray went sailing across the room. Of course it broke and you couldn't use it anymore. So then they snuck in at night, and after they did that, I tore up the place. I tore everything to pieces. So they stopped injecting me, I was out of there in 24 hours, never recovered from it. I was so sick from it. And then the polio vaccines started, got my third polio at 15 and a half years old, polio vaccine at 15 and a half years old. It turned me juvenile diabetic 1, juvenile diabetes 1, injections of insulin every day, several times a day for the rest of my life. That's what they told me, that's what I was instructed to do. Plus it gave me angina pectoris. Now angina are muscle spasms in or around the heart that cause the heart to stop functioning, heart attacks. 

So the mercury and the formaldehyde from the tetanus shot went to my brain at 18 months old, that particular shot of polio vaccine went to my heart and stored in the muscles in and around my heart. So I had 300 heart attacks from the age of 15 and a half to the age of 22. 50 of them put me unconscious. But because I was autistic, I didn't die from them. Most people, how many people have had charley horses? A few people. Well charley horses, when you get a cramp in a muscle, lactic acid builds up and it goes into a knot, because the acids are eating away at the muscle. And the more you try to work it out, the worse it gets. The harder you push on it, the worse it gets. So I had so much pain in my life, I knew that you just let the pain go, you ignore it as much as possible. You scream, cry, do all that stuff, but you don't try to stop the pain, you just release it. So every time I had a heart attack, I didn't fight it. I just breathed very shallowly, slowly, until I passed out, and then I revived. Every time. So if you ever have a heart attack, you ever have pain in your chest, remember that. Breathe slowly, not deeply, and just let it go, cry, whatever you want to do, but don't tense. Don't tense your arms, don't tense your chest. Let your fingers drop or go like this some way to make sure that you're going to relax through it, and you won't die. Very few people would ever die of a heart attack if they didn't, unless it was a blood clot, then there's no way to, you know, you can relax all you want, and you're gone. But if it's a cramping, if it's from a cramp, a muscle spasm, you won't die, if you know what to do. So that was at 15, so by 16, I was smoking two packs of non-filtered Lucky Strikes daily. I was drinking about nine cups of coffee a day, and then I started drinking alcohol because I needed to sleep at night. I got married when I was 16 years old, and I found a girl who we did not have to communicate. She was a year older than I, she was the second smartest girl in the world, I mean in that school, and it seemed like the world to me. We didn't have to communicate, but then when we started living together, she realized that I was an idiot, and of course it didn't work.

So I was divorced, my son was born the first week of my senior year in high school. It was a mess, I didn't know myself, I wasn't able to communicate still, I was autistic, I was still parroting everything, I learned the cool words that Elvis Presley and Paul Newman said to the women on the screen, those were the things that I said, and it worked. It worked, but when you're living with somebody, you can't give that bullshit and get away with it. I wasn't, I believed it, I believed the sincerity of what I thought I was saying, and I had my own language. When I heard a word, the sound of it, the way it made me feel was how I interpreted the meaning. So I had mouth props galore when I finally began to understand language. So I was under a lot of stress, by the time I graduated from high school, again it was all cheating, I had an idiot savant part of me where, I don't know if anybody has seen Rain Man, I could do a formula, just write down the answer. How that happened, I don't know, but I didn't have to sit down and analyze and work out the problem, just write the answer. So I was constantly getting accused of cheating in math, and that's the only thing I never cheated in, and I was put in a room one time, and given a test that had been made up the day before, and I just went down and wrote all the answers, and I went out and gave it to them in ten minutes, and it should have taken me 45 minutes to take the test and finish it. So they said, he broke into the school, he got that test, so they sat down and wrote the test out right there, it took them 30 minutes to write out the test, gave it to me and I did it in five minutes, and gave it back to them. Then they realized that I had a special talent, and then they thought I was pretending not to be able to communicate. So then it got worse, because they expected everything from me.

And then when I graduated, my mother took me to a special school that had just opened up, which was computer programming and unit record wiring equipment, which you put in a little computer like this, it used to fit in a whole room that size, and we used to write the programs on unit record card equipment, so all the programs, each address, like in a sentence in a program, you have a sentence and they'll multiply and you just go through. Well you have to put each sentence, each address on a punch card, then all the information on a punch card, so that's how computers worked in those times. So my mother took me to that school, and the brother who always tortured me, and I got absolutely everything right, only person who had ever done that. There was no language, there was no communication, there was no comprehension test, it was just math and geometry and systems. So they came to interview me after that test, and I couldn't communicate, they couldn't communicate with me, however they realized what they had. So they got a special education person, 25 years old, came in and worked with me. I'd write the programs and he'd identify what I did, and I'd make all the systems. I loved making 80 grand a year as an idiot, 19 years old. So I moved out to California because my uncle, my mother's one of 13 children, can you imagine being from a family of 13 children and everybody getting along? There were four boys in my family and all of us, we each of us hated each other. Why does that happen? You have to think about that. Why is that? Big families used to get along all the time. Now we have two in a family, three in a family, four in a family and everybody fights. Has everything to do with the industrial chemicals that are in the food and everything. They cause misfiring, they cause irritation in the system, cause building up of bile, plastic. Do you know that 90% of all the oils that people consume today are hydrogenated oils? Not even vegetable oils anymore, they're hydrogenating mineral oils. Do you know what hydrogenation does to an oil? Turns in trans fatty acid. Do you know what trans fatty acid is? Plastic. You buy a food that's been fried or cooked in an oil, it's trans fatty acid, it's plastic oil.

Can you digest that? No. Why? Because 99% of digestion is bacterial. There's no way that bacteria can feed on plastic oil. So when it gets into your body, what does it do? It has these little plastic molecules that form as you dehydrate, dehydrate those molecules. Then they clump together, not like magnets, but like stickies. And then they'll block all pore. Then they block another pore, and another pore, and another pore, and all of a sudden we have people who can't perspire. And those who can perspire are still not perspiring out those large plastic molecules, so you've got an entire lymphatic system blocked in the body. So what happens in some people? They just keep getting bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger, and bigger as they get older. Some people, it builds it into their bones. So their bone structure starts off small, and the older they get, the bigger they get. For example, look at John Travolta. Anybody remember how thin he was? I mean that guy was skinny. Thin bone and everything. You look at him now, huge bones. Kevin Costner is the same way. There are three ways that the body can handle that kind of toxicity, and no way will it ever not produce a disease. So all that oil, the only way you can be safe to know what you're eating is to be right from the garden, and you make it yourself. It's like the old days. When I was ten years old, I remember, because now that I have communication skills, I have an incredible memory. I remember the day I was born. My mother says, oh, stop telling things like that. And I said, Mom, when I came out, there was Venetian blinds right at the bottom of the bed. And her mouth dropped. I said, the sun was coming right over the horizon, right through. And that warmth from the sun felt good. And then the freaking doctor spanked me on the butt. It was a cold room. It was Denver, Colorado, April 17th. It was cold. That's a mile high in the mountains, still snow all over everywhere. And hospitals notoriously keep everything cold because they don't want to deal with the smell of rotting tissue.

Most people have rotting tissue in a hospital. So it stops that odor. So I was freezing. My mother dropped, her jaw dropped, because that's exactly what happened when I was born. So I've got an incredible memory, and I can remember. I remember, well, I'll tell you about that when we get to that part of the story. So I was trying to get through all of this stuff going, my youngest, my mother's youngest brother was 17 years younger than she is. All of those brothers and sisters got a college degree, every one of them, all got along. So he said he was matriculating for his doctorate at UCLA in psychology. So he was going to fix me. So he was going to make that autism go away. So I transferred my job. I worked for Time DC, the third largest trucking company in the world. The first and the biggest credit card company, which was Car Blanche at the time, as a systems analyst, and then for IBM. So I was a freelancer, one of those, under the auspices of these professors from that technical school that I was in. So they farmed me out, and then they had that fellow with me all the time, Jeff, who wrote out the manuals and everything and the processes, the language to understand what I had done, written in the program in systems. So moved out to California. I went through shock therapy, I went through LSD therapy, I went through marijuana therapy, I went through every therapy of the 60s that UCLA could come up with. They gave me 732 micrograms of LSD, didn't even take off, didn't do a thing to me, I was immune to it. So they kicked me out of that experiment. So I went one experiment after another for about a year and three months, no help. By that time, I was drinking a tremendous amount of alcohol. I was smoking two to three packs of Lucky Strikes non-filter a day, I was drinking eleven cups of coffee a day, minimum, and drinking a fifth of either gin or bourbon to get to sleep at night, and that was my routine every day. Well, it ate a hole in my stomach, so I had an ulcer, I started vomiting blood.

So my uncle, you know, I'm still not comprehending anything that the medical profession is saying, I'm just doing what I'm told, and taken to the hospital, and then I just let them do whatever they wanted to do to me. And that's what everybody does, even though they're not autistic. Doesn't make any sense to me. I mean, I have a reason, I was autistic. What about everybody else? You go to a doctor and you get a drug, now the body has been around for at least five million years, we know. The youngest, the earliest Homo sapiens is at least five million years old. The remains that we found. So we've adapted to natural things, plants, animals, all of that, for over five million years. What makes you think that you can handle the 80,000 new chemicals that are produced by the industrial revolution? You can't. You isolate those things, there's no unity to it. Every time you eat something that's from a food store, it's been cooked, all the bacteria is destroyed. Well, wait a minute, if we're 99% bacteria, we need to be introducing bacteria, not just proteins and carbohydrates and fats. We need the bacteria that causes everything to function. So every time you eat anything cooked, every time you get something that's been manufactured, it's not alive. You have to do everything to try to get what you can out of that. So what is the result of that? Just cooking your food is an industrial process. What is the process of cooking your food? What does it do? Well we know that animals who eat all raw in their natural diet live seven times the time it takes them to finish maturation. For us that's seven and a half years. I mean 21 years when we finish maturation. And seven times that is what? 147 years. So we should all be living to 147 years. We're not even living half that on the average. The average death rate for the human is 61 years old. Of course they'll point out those people who are living longer to say, see we're doing good. But how many children are born with cancer and die every day? How many children get a vaccine and go into Guillain-Barré disease or death? Hundreds of thousands every day.

Far beyond any death rate you could ever imagine. So our death rate, in the cities it's even worse. If we take the rural areas, it's about 61. If we count the megalopolitan cities, what's the average life expectancy, 51 years old. Yet they're propping it up as they're maintaining life that they've got all these great new discoveries. And it's all hype. It's all hype to make money. So you have to take a look at that. When I was ten years old, I heard my mother talking with another nurse and she said, we just got the report in, one person out of a thousand dies of cancer now. And my mother was horrified. One out of a thousand. Do you know what it is today, according to five of the top oncologists today? One out of three women, one out of two men. From one in a thousand to that ratio, who's lying to us? The pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry, they are in business. They don't make money unless you're sick. The manual for doctors, all the manuals are written by the pharmaceutical industries. Merck's is this thick. The word heal appears in it 93 times. Always in relationship to a cut, surgery afterwards, or an abrasion, it will heal. Nothing about disease healing. The word cure does not exist. No disease is curable. They don't want it to be curable. They want you on medication and one medication to counteract the effects of that medication and on and on and on. So you're taking all of these medications and you're paying thousands of dollars a month just on medication. I was shooting up insulin from 15.5 to 22. I was spending 650 some dollars a month for insulin. That was back in the 60s and 70s, I mean 60s, I stopped, 60, 70 I stopped. When I discovered raw milk, I'll get into that. After I developed the ulcer, they gave me Maalox. Maalox is mined rock, high in calcium. So do we eat rock? Are humans built to eat rock? No, plants are. They gave me this rock to absorb the hydrochloric acid. Well, what if I don't have hydrochloric acid? Am I going to digest my proteins? Of course not.

So I stopped digesting protein, I stopped all my steaks that I ate, and I loved burned steak, crispy. I loved burned broiled chicken, those burnt crispy wings, I used to love them like that. So I stopped digesting entirely and developed a tumor right next to the ulcer. So I said, oh, we've got to go in and do a vagotomy pyloroplasty, got to go in and cut out the tumor, we have to stretch your intestines, we have to, the vagotomy means that they cut all the vagus nerves to the stomach, so I'd never again screen hydrochloric acid. So then I'd have to take hydrochloric acid the rest of my life. That's what, 80 bucks a month, 90 bucks a month, plus all the other things that I'd have to take, I'd have to take vitamin D, because I couldn't digest the proteins, couldn't digest the milk, I couldn't digest anything properly, so I'd have to take all these supplements. So that surgery at 20 years old, I was 20 years old, was supposed to lock me into a pharmaceutical bill of about $1200 a month. Good money, good business, right, didn't help me. So after they sewed me up, the incision turned tumorous, so the tumor grew up to 3 quarters of an inch high and up to 1 1⁄2 inches wide, pretty big, and it went all the way through to my stomach, so I had this huge elongated tumor and they said we have to irradiate that. So I went in for radiation therapy, two months, not even two months, let's say I went in November 27th, 1967 for the surgery and I started radiation therapy February 12th of 1968, so it wasn't even two months, no it was two months, just about two months. So what they did was, they had a radiation gun and they would pivot like this, then would cock back again and they would broadcast again the entire movement this way. Now an x-ray is done with one thousandth of a second, they were running this thing on me for at least 15-20 seconds at very high doses, so it was worth over a hundred thousand, each pass was over a hundred thousand doses of that x-ray.

It was so much radiation they cauterized my spine, it was like taking malleable clay and putting it in a kiln and firing it in a tin, cone tin, turned it brittle, just like a rock and it was like rock, it started getting gritty and granular and it was like granite, so anytime I churned at all, anywhere, the grinding would be on the nerves and I was in excruciating pain day and night. I didn't sleep ten minutes without waking up in excruciating pain. So not only did it do that, and that didn't happen overnight, that happened, the cauterization occurred over about a four month period, not only that, it caused me to develop blood and bone cancer. Well what does radiation therapy cause? Blood and bone cancer. These doctors are administering treatment, and it's not therapy that causes more disease, insanity, stupidity, for the person, for the victim, but of course they make tons of money. I had, because I had worked through Time DC, a trucking company, I had to join the Teamsters Union, even though I was in executive status, I was still a farmed out individual when I did systems analysis for them. So at least Teamsters paid for the first half of the treatments, which was about 120 grand. Then I had to pay for the rest, and I only had 80 grand, so that was pretty good for a 20 year old boy having 80 grand, but that went in a flash, for the treatments. So the doctors are making money, they weren't suffering with me, they just run around with a chart, look at these figures, and that's it, they don't see who you are as a patient, they look at numbers, that's all they do is look at numbers, you're numbers to them, you are statistics, you are an analysis of blood components, of neurological components, you're not a human being, you're not even considered, you're considered a machine that has specific details about it, that they can address with medication, surgery, and other very toxic treatments.

So they made me frightfully horrifying to look at, they started chemotherapy, oh another thing the radiation did, started within a month of the radiation, is all the bone around my teeth disintegrated, why? Because my body needed minerals, I wasn't digesting, so it started taking my own bones apart, that's normal in cancer anyway. The body eats itself to get the nutrients, because nobody's getting nutrients, everybody's getting poisoned, and they start eating their own bodies, so my teeth dangled in my gums, and when I bit down on my own teeth, I bled. I was getting two, three, one time I got three transfusions in one week, and then they decided that because I got blood and bone cancer I needed chemotherapy. When I think back to that conversation that the doctors had with my uncle, they said it would give me a one percent chance of surviving another six weeks, and here they poisoned me to the point where I was vomiting, defecating, urinating all over myself, in excruciating pain, no hair, scabs falling all over my face, I had rashes all over, and I was in frightful pain, luckily I had a two bedroom house, all one level in Beverly Hills, in a nice area, so it was an okay living place, and I had a living room that was about from there to here, with a dining area, it was all wood floors, it was probably half the width of this room, so I had to live on the floor because I couldn't sit on a chair, or a couch, or I couldn't sleep on a bed, I had to be completely flat, so the very least movement would happen in my spine. If I wanted to sit down in a chair it took five minutes, because I would get so far, and then I would be in pain and jump right back up again, sometimes it would take five minutes, at least five minutes to sit. So I lived on the floor, I pulled myself around with my elbows, vomiting, defecating, urinating all over myself, moved to the next spot on the floor, and it went like that day after day week after week.

They had taken me, my uncle had taken me to a hospice to die, because they said I was going to die, and I refused to be there, I was still autistic, these people were dying at the hospice, like I was, and I wasn't going to say wrong things to them and be in that kind of environment, so I refused to go, and I lost all the money to the medical profession, UCLA hospital, and the bank was coming after the house, my uncle said you'll be dead in a few weeks, so they agreed. So two volunteers from the hospice volunteered to come to my house, two or three days a week, clean me up, clean the floor, prepare food for me, put it in cases around the floor, so I'd have food to eat as I moved around the room until I died. I never thought it was going to be days when I died, or days when I died, but I hung on, because one of the volunteers was a wonderful African American boy, only 18 years old, he was making 80 grand too like I was as a young kid, but he was a phenomenal singer, he worked for the Ford motor company in the going thing, which was sponsored by the fifth dimension, that group, I don't know if anybody is old enough to know that one. Anyway, it was a great group at the time, they sang Aquarius, and all that, anyway he was marvelous, he grew up in Watts, how did he know about nutrition, but he turned me on to raw milk and raw carrot juice, and he brought them to me. Now the only reason, I didn't know what the hell he was talking about, carrot juice, I heard the word carrots and I nearly vomited, I hated cooked vegetables, and that's the only way my mother prepared them, vegetables was cooked, so when I heard the word carrot I thought oh, but this was a juice that was different, he mixed it with the raw milk, and if anybody has ever had radiation in chemotherapy, everything you eat tastes like cardboard and postage stamp glue, everything that's cooked. So he gave me raw milk and raw carrot juice, it was rich and delicious, I loved it, so I just drank it just because it was the only thing I enjoyed.

After that, what they were preparing for me was what I ate, I loved powdered doughnuts, I loved rice krispies with extra sugar in it, and I used Sprite or Dr. Pepper, and I put them together when all the bone went away, so I'd blend those together in a blender and suck it out of a big straw, that was my diet. So this guy turns me on to carrot juice and the raw milk, and they were tasty and delicious. About 10 days later I woke and I thought wow, I understand communication, I know what a verb is, I know what an adjective, preposition, article, I understood all of it. I thought oh my god, my brain switched. So I called my uncle, the psychologist, and I had this conversation with him and after about 25 minutes he said, ok Robert, the joke's up, I know it's you, and he had a comedian friend of his that did voices excellently, he was on the circuit in LA, I think he was on Johnny Carson a few times. So I said no, this is me, Aajonus, and so I told him something that happened that was insignificant but something we never talked about to anybody else on my arrival to Los Angeles from Cincinnati, Ohio, and he said, God, it's really you? And I said yeah, and I think it's this milk and carrot juice that Steve brought to me. He said, Aajonus, all that therapy we did for you probably finally worked, it kicked in. I said, that was over a year and four months ago. He said sometimes it just takes time to work. So that's their thinking again. They only understand what they're programmed to believe. So my uncle thought there was the shock therapy, the LSD therapy, all those therapies that finally brought my mind around. So I continued the carrot juice and raw milk, I didn't give a shit, it tasted good, that's what I drank, it felt good. About six months later I did an experiment. I stopped drinking the carrot juice and went back to my donuts and RC Cola and Sprite. Within 12 days I was back into autism. I awoke and it was like, where was that switch?

How do I put that back on? And that's what it's like because it's a switch, you can never, it's like that word on the end of your tongue, where did it go? You don't know where it went. So I immediately started the raw milk and raw carrot juice again and raw cottage cheese and within about five, ten days each time it was a little different, come and go for a few days, but it came back after about ten days, my autism was shut down again, my comprehension returned. So I did that three times over a two year period, experimentation, and every time it was my diet that changed it, going off and on raw foods. So I said, you know, three times, I may have been ignorant, but now if I don't accept what is concrete and experience, I'm stupid. So I'm not going to be stupid. So I started transferring everything I ate into raw, no more cooked foods, ever. And that was about February of 1972. And I was getting a little bit better every year, and finally when I hit 27 in 1973, the fact it was December 31st, 1973, I set off on an Italian Ligi touring bike with saddlebags and little lazaps, a Hungarian Puli dog on the back and a crate, and we went and lived off the land. I ate off the land, I lived off of the land, I lived on the land, I lived under the stars, the clouds, the rain, the snow, everything, for three years. Because I knew that I wasn't going to find the answer in society because everything I read, everything I read contradicted everything else. And everybody was getting information and nobody had wisdom. And the colleges were pumping out these nutritionists and dieticians who were programmed, by whom? By medically oriented people on how everything functions. Everything you learn about nutrition is chemistry. It isn't about food, it's chemistry. What's in a food that causes this? Is what they say. They don't say, this food works, what's in the food that causes this? That's what they used to ask, way back a hundred years ago, but now they don't do that.

Now they say, the chemistry is the ideal, we can manufacture the chemistry, supplements, drugs, everything, and then that's the perfect thing. Food is not perfect because it has bacteria in it. So anything that has bacteria in it is our enemy. And that's the way it goes. So I was traveling around on the bicycle, living off the land, got more into vegetarianism, I got away from the milk, all the dairy, I still didn't eat raw meats at the time. And I followed the fruit picking trails through the farms all the way down to Mexico, in Yucatan, all the way up to Alaska and Canada, I mean in the United States above Canada. And that was a lot of bicycling, a lot of bicycling, that was probably about 22,000 miles in that few years on a bicycle. And I just kept getting more skinnier and skinnier. One time I was down to 96 pounds. I'm 185 right now, so you can imagine what I was at 96 pounds. I lived with different Indian tribes, I mostly lived with animals, alligators, chipmunks, everything to observe wild animals because I knew I was going to learn how to get well from them. And I lived with the Mayan Indians for a little over a month in the Yucatan in the south of Mexico and they taught me. I didn't know the language, I could speak Spanish pretty well, but most of them didn't speak Spanish. So it was because I was autistic there was a way to communicate without language. But what they told me was, the chief told me was, eat raw meat. But you know, you get brain parasites and you'll be an idiot. I'd been there, I'd done that. So I wasn't going to eat raw meat. I thought trying to kill the white boy who took over and killed all the Indians. So I'm going to kill the white boy. So I went up to another Indian tribe, the Yaquis in northern Mexico and they said the same thing. Eat raw meat and that will reverse your condition. It will take a little time, but it will happen. I said, boy that smoke signal is really long, kill the white boy. Give him brain parasites.

So then I went to the tribe which my mother is one-eighth Sioux Indian. So I got into that tribe in the Dakotas in the States and I lived with them for a little over a month and they told me to eat raw meat. That will reverse your condition. I said, boy that signal is really going up there. You can get all the white boys that you can. Then I went up to Alaska, the Inuits, and they eat nothing but raw, the ones who live out. They don't cook a thing, the primitive ones. They eat only meat, no dairy. They'll eat some blueberries and that's about it. In that few months of the year when they can get away from the grizzly bears because the grizzly bears actually dominate all the wild blueberry fields. I know that for a fact because I came on a bus, put my bicycle up in a tree, went over this hillside. Whole field, there must have been about eight acres of wild blueberry bushes. I said, oh this is a dream come true. So I'm in there picking these blueberries, eating them for about 15 minutes. All of a sudden there's this little hairy brown thing about 20 feet away and then another one and another one and another one. Then I sneezed and all these grizzly bears stood up and I backed out very gently out of that field. I got a good stuffed tummy of the blueberries before I got out of there. But they dominate the blueberries, the fruit. So the Eskimos, they live on fish, meat, that's it. They only eat fish and meat. They don't eat vegetables, they don't eat anything else. Vibrantly healthy, can stand cold weather that's minus 15 degrees centigrade. They live in it, they thrive in it. I watched a baby crawl around that was three months old, naked on an igloo floor. How many of you would let your baby do that? Gonna get a cold, gonna get a flu, gonna get pneumonia. We're taught to freak out about this stuff. This baby is crawling around on an igloo floor, wet igloo floor. Why can't we live like that? So anyway, they told me to eat raw meat too. I said, that's for you guys, you guys have done it for all these centuries, not for me.

So I was down to about 96 pounds at that point and my multiple myeloma, my cancer of the blood and bone resurged. I was aching at every joint in my body. Temperature dropped below 50 degrees. I was in excruciating pain. I would go an hour to two hours before the sun set into my sleeping bag just so I could make it through the night, not freeze to death and not be in such excruciating pain. Then the sun would have to beat on my sleeping bag for an hour to two hours before I'd be warm enough and in pain the least amount so I could get out and function. Then I'd have to lie in the sun for 15 to 30, 45 minutes naked to really get to the point where I could move with pain but withstand it. I said, well I'm not going to find the answer here at all, so I'm down to the point where I'm in so much pain I don't want to live again. So I was going to go back down to the California desert where it was warmer. This was in August, the warmest time in Alaska and you'd think I'd be able to stand that. No I couldn't. I mean the sun was up almost 24 hours, not directly, but the light just didn't get dark at that time of year, maybe an hour or two. So I just decided it's not worth living. I'm in too much pain and I'm not going to be able to reverse it. I've looked, I've searched and I've done all this in the last three years, living with animals and everything and I was so stupid to not believe that the Indian tribes each knew about the raw meat. So I hopped on some freight trains, threw my bicycle up and bungee corded up against the side and took the freight trains back to California. But as I was leaving the Inuit tribe, this guy was digging a hole, brought out a wrapped hide, leather hide and unwrapped it and had this black, moldy, green, white, patinaed mold all over it and it stunk like an abandoned, two weeks old, abandoned slaughterhouse that had never been cleaned. It's horrible and all the kids are jumping up, they're smelling it and they think it's like cotton candy. This is great. There was an owl call or a bird call that came from downwind and the guy wrapped it up and buried it again.

Everybody was a little unhappy about that and I said, what's going on? He said, well it didn't smell, it was stinking a mile downwind, it wasn't ready. So I said, I got to wait for this. So I stayed a few more days, they dug it up and sure enough it was so rank that if I got within five feet of it, I was dry heaving just from the odor. They're like, oh this is incredible stuff. So they had about a good acre and a half of all this stuff buried. I didn't know that meat molded like that except for gangrene. I didn't know it got white and black molds on it and all of that. I thought gangrene is green, it's a dirty green. So I was very ignorant about it. I'd seen those colors in compost piles with broken down vegetables and fruit peels and leaves and stalks and roots, but not with meat. So I was just completely ignorant about it. I thought that they were eating some kind of herbal mixture that they had decayed in the ground and of course the mold pre-digested it for them and then they ate it and it gave them some benefit. So the chief talked me into eating a ping pong ball-sized amount and in order to do that, they had to give me musk oil to put in my nostrils so I wouldn't vomit. So I ate this and it was really, it was like melting candy. It was like brazen brandy lamb. Just so soft. Easy to get down. I went back to my sleeping bag. Now they celebrated for almost 36 hours eating all this. Babies were eating a pound of it. Five and seven year olds were eating a pound and a half. Adults were eating like three pounds of it. And they do this every year to fill themselves with mold and bacteria to get through the winter and cold months. And they don't sleep for 36 hours. They have too much energy. So they dance and celebrate and play music and sing for 36 hours. They can't sleep. They have too much energy.

So I had eaten that ping pong ball-sized amount, went back to my sleeping bag to sleep. I couldn't sleep. All I used to do was listen to them and get through the whole night. I'm feeling better through the night. I get up in the morning. I'm out of the sleeping bag within about 30 minutes of the sun beating directly on it. I was off of the ground naked with the sun beating only for 10 minutes. I thought, wow, what is that herbal stuff? So I went to the chief that day and I said, you got to tell me the herbal solution. He says, it was caribou beat with a whale or seal blubber, I forgot which one it was, the Indian term, Inuit term. And it was mixed together and wrapped. And that aged, the microbes age it pre-digested under the ground, just like we do yogurt and kefir. We just pre-digest milk. So I thought he was lying to me, again, trying to kill the white boy, taking over their land. So I hopped on the freight train back to California, desert in California, began fasting, dinner coyotes, lived up in the foot of hills where I was. I was in an old Indian burial ground where I knew everybody would leave me alone to die. I was fasting myself to death, just drinking two gallons of water a day, doing enemas, dealing with the headaches and pissing all the time. Drinking two gallons of water a day, pissing constantly and just kept diluting everything. So the coyotes would come down every night about midnight, almost exactly at midnight, wake me, play this game and then go on to their hunt or whatever they did. So on about the eleventh night, I got to the point where I was, I knew I was starting to get to a point where my body was going to die. And I was able to sense where the coyotes were coming down the wash beyond my campsite. So at that point, they caught a jackrabbit and ripped it open, brought it to me, put it on my feet and that was their offering. And it was kill the white boy again, taking over the dog's territory, they didn't know of anywhere to go.

And all of a sudden this dialogue from my uncle went through my mind. My uncle was talking to his sons and my brothers were going rabbit hunting. I couldn't do anything like that because I was so sickly, so I learned to cook and to sew and things like that because I couldn't play sports, I was too sickly. So my uncle was telling my brothers and my cousins that if they killed a wild rabbit, they had to cook it through until it was brown inside or they had to cut it in half and skewer it and cook it that way because there's a microbe in wild rabbits that will take over your digestive tract and in excruciating pain you will die within 48 hours. That was the crap that they were told. So I believed it and I thought, oh, the coyotes are going to help me die quickly. Two days of suffering, severe pain, that's easy. I can do two days, no problem. So I picked up the rabbit and started eating it. Of course I was vomiting, couldn't get it down, it was raw, it was pink. I also became a vegetarian because I loved animals and didn't want to eat them or hurt them or cook them or anything. It was a difficult thing for me to eat was this rabbit. So I had to sit down and psych myself into it. I remember all the vegetables that I had had. Like if I had cooked Brussels sprouts, I could hit that wall with a vomit. If it were peas, I could hit you. If it were carrots, I could hit you. Actually, I had no control over it. Those vegetables would hit my stomach and come right back up. Nothing psychological. I was autistic. I had no judgments. So just come back up. So I got back into that place where my parents would make me sit at the dining table for up to two hours. And I would mash the vegetables, put a teaspoon of milk in my mouth, and wash it down. The hard part came keeping it from coming back up. Sometimes it took three to four minutes to brace to stop it. So I got into that state and started eating the rabbit. After about 12 to 15 bites, it started tasting really good. So I ate about three and a half pounds of that jackrabbit. There were about seven pounds. And the coyotes ate the rest. I said I'm going to die. I'm going to die fast. I ate a third of this rabbit. I'm going to die fast. I mean half of the rabbit. I'm going to die fast.

So I went back to my campsite and I knew I was dying because I felt good. I felt peace. The only time I had felt peace in my entire life was in my near-death experiences twice on an operating table where they had to revive me. And I had left my body. Of course, they brought me back into it. But when I was away, there was no pain. And that's what I felt like as I was going back to my campsite. No pain. It was like a miracle. I thought, I'm dying. This is wonderful. So I get back to my sleeping bag. I go to sleep. I wake up the next morning. I'm still in my sleeping bag. I'm not dead. No pain. I felt pretty good. I was able to get out of the sleeping bag very quickly. And then only spend a few minutes in the sun naked. So I was just waiting. Two days went by. No pain. Felt good. Stronger than I've ever had in my life. Then three days went by. The 48-hour limit had been gone 24 hours ago, and I felt good. And then I realized, I said, every one of those natives, the Indians, told me right. Raw meat was what I needed. So I got on my bicycle at 93 pounds and went around to the farmers and made deals to shovel manure, milk goats, milk cows, shovel hay, whatever I needed to do to earn food. And I was eating probably two pounds of meat a day, probably two quarts of milk a day, and probably a stick of butter and a cup of raw cream. In two months, I gained over 55 pounds. For the first time in my life, I could actually do physical labor with my arms and hands. I was 30 years old. 30 years old. First time in my life. So I went back to Los Angeles to spread the word. Raw meat's the answer. And everybody said, you'll get a brain parasite and be an idiot. And I said, I've been there and done that. This is working. I'm going to continue doing this. So I was supposed to be dead at 21. Here I was at 31 years old, vibrant health, Los Angeles, helping people get through their illnesses. And here I am today, 46 years later. I just started my 67th year last week. And I'm still here. And I've eaten rotten meat with worms and parasites. And I've eaten it all.

You can see my YouTube experience on my Ripley's Believe It or Not. If you go on there and get put in the rotten meat eater, YouTube, Ripley's Believe It or Not, you'll see me there eating up to a year and three months old meat, gangrene, parasites, everything. To prove a point. It's exactly what we need. I was just in South Africa. And there was a documentary food, I mean a documentary tribal filmmaker who had filmed a tribe and a movie called The Last Dance. And it was up for quite a few awards. And it shows this tribe, three hunters, the tribe is no longer able to hunt on their own land. Their government has turned it into a wildlife refuge where very rich people get to spend $10,000 a day to kill these animals. And they don't get to eat anything from their land. Now they have to grow grain and eat things like that when they were raised all their lives on meat. So this is, The Last Dance is really the last hunt. These guys outrun antelope. And they watch it. And what they do on the third day is they're tracking down this antelope. They run into a water buffalo. I think it was a water buffalo. I couldn't tell. It was probably a couple of weeks rotten and old. Now this tribe cooks all their meat unless they find it rotten. And they came upon this rotten carcass. And they shooed the vultures away and all the other creatures and sat there and ate for hours this rotten meat. And they said this is the jewel of everything. We will catch that antelope tomorrow easily. They ran that antelope down just like that the next morning. They said because it's pre-digested. All the bacteria in it pre-digests it. So they didn't have to do anything and it gave them all this vitality. So there are lots of tribes, there are Turks that take gangrene and they have the side of beef hanging and they actually coat it, the gangrene on there and they let it eat into it for about 12 to 21 days. Then they scrape off the outer layer and eat this meat raw, all this gangrene through it. Because what has the gangrene done? The gangrene has pre-digested the meat. It's fractionated all of the nutrients in that meat and freed it up for absorption and realignment into nutrients and structure for us. Just like we do milk with yogurt and kefir.

So you have to get over the squeamish. You have to understand that your digestion is 99%, once you get beyond the stomach, is 99% bacterial. The bacteria eats the food we eat. Guess what we eat? We eat their urine, their feces and their sweat. That's what we eat. Their discards are our food. Think about that. We live on shit and piss and sweat. When you think about that, you're not going to be squeamish anymore are you? And the stuff that we defecate and urinate is supposed to be non-toxic. Urine, when we take nitrogen from urea, we grow plants with it. But when it's sterilized by a chemical company like Monsanto and Dow, it reduces the quality of it. Let me give you an example. I moved into a new house about a year ago and there were five palms on it and two of them were dying. The leaves were all brown, the fronds were all brown and leaning down. So the owner of the house, I live in half the house, he lives in the other house, he was going to cut those down. So I said, take your time, maybe I can do something with them. I wasn't going to tell him what. So I put 12 gallons of my pee that I collected around those two palms that were dying. I put it around one at first, green and as full and as healthy as the other three. I just did it for the last six months on the other one. It is now full and green and high. That's my urine. At my other house in Malibu, I used to put it all down on my ferns. My ferns doubled in size the first year. Normally your ferns are about this big, doubled in size. My ferns were here to here from the urine. Now if you take a person that eats a cooked diet and you use that, what it does, it burns and acidifies the roots and destroys the roots. So when they process urea it will work for a short period of time but it will break down the roots of plants and the soil and kill the microbes in the soil. So the urea that is processed from these caffer lots where they are making all this milk and feed lots for meat where they collect all the urine, that's what they use as fertilizer. But it's not good quality because they treat it, they pasteurize it, they heat treat it, they chemically treat it because they want you to keep buying every year. You don't have to do that. You can apply that once every five years. Those two palms with that six gallons each of my urine will thrive for the next ten years off of that urine. But Dow and Monsanto treat urea so that you have to use it every year and you deplete your soil and your microorganisms at the same time. So I've gone way beyond the freebie hour so we're going to stop here. Anyway, I'm alive. 

Q: You certainly are.

A: And I eat all kinds of meat. Of course I get as organic as possible and sometimes. I lived in Paris off and on for three years from 93 to 96 and I eat the mad cow meat for supermarkets. You know I didn't eat the brain or nervous system of course but I don't have any mad cow. So you have to take a look at the truth of things. You have to look at what really works and what doesn't. So in the workshop that's coming up I'm going to teach you how your body works. I'm going to teach you how to eat and then I'm going to teach you so that you'll never be afraid of your body again. You will know what's happening and then you'll also know how to detox. I'm going to show you pictures of how the body detoxes so you won't panic if it comes upon you. So this workshop which will be about five hours is going to teach you everything you need to know to be introduced to anyway so that you can take care of yourself and not have to worry about disease and going to doctors and being afraid of your body. You'll trust it and you'll know almost what to do. My books will help you if you need direct specific information. So let's take a break and those people who want to stay for the workshop and haven't paid see Barbara or Kate and Debra. We'll get started again in about twenty minutes, thirty minutes.

A: That's for her to do. If she doesn't do it and she does a hack news job and it comes across as bad that's her conscience and that's her sad affair. All I can do is just share what I've had and what other people have had. So let's get on with it. The human body is very different than the medical profession wants you to believe and because they're observing what it does on the standard diets and on medication they're partially right. They're saying the liver is a filter, the kidneys are a toxic filter. If you're not eating toxins you won't have any toxins to filter. Well if you don't have any toxins to filter and every other animal out there that's eating natural and raw is not filtering toxins then why do they have a liver? Why do they have a kidney? Well I'm going to explain how those functions work. So let's start with the digestive tract. Now in the mouth we have bacteria. We have more bacteria than cats and dogs, so don't bite anybody. They are digestive bacteria so our digestion begins in the mouth and it carries through to the stomach. Now what happens in the stomach? Mainly hydrochloric acid is manufactured, is synthesized in the stomach walls. The stomach lining actually manufactures hydrochloric acid, a solution that can dissolve large food particles, like meat, into smaller particles or even a fluid so that bacteria can infiltrate it. Remember what I said earlier? 99% of digestion after it leaves the stomach is bacterial. The bacteria eats the food we've eaten, their excrement, their secretions are our food. It's that simple. So if you, let's say you take your meats and you grind them into a pate, you're going to have to produce very little hydrochloric acid because the bacteria can infiltrate it very easily. Just make sure in your mouth you're mixing enough saliva with it. You've already made it into a soup so your body is not going to have to work hard at digestion. You're not going to have to produce a lot of digestive juices and acids to digest that meat and that food because it's liquid. The bacteria easily gets into it, multiplies, eats and eats and eats and their waste is our food. It's that easy.

Now, when I was investigating what foods a human should be eating, I had the opportunity, I had a friend, I did a TV show with him and he happened to be on it. I was the nutritionist that maybe wasn't a nutritionist, he was an individual that maybe wasn't something else, but he was a forensic specialist. It was one of those game shows. Anyway, he allowed me to have access to 30 autopsies. I only chose 8 of them because there were 8 that didn't die of disease. They died in their sleep. So I chose those 8 people, those 8 bodies. And I took their saliva from their saliva glands. I took their hydrochloric acid from their stomachs. I also took the bile from the gallbladder and that was dumped from the bile duct into the stomach. And then I took the intestines and I wrang the digestive juices out of the intestine walls and what I found was more hydrochloric acid than bile. It may be varieties, they were all varieties of the same thing, but it was either hydrochloric or bile. Those were the only two elements that were ever manufactured in the body. And they have different, if a person ate more vegetables, it would be different from somebody who was just a meat eater and a cereal eater. And all of these different bodies had had different diets. We did have backgrounds on them because these were all bodies that were given to science at a university. So I took 20 foods, nuts, grains, vegetables, leaf stalks and roots, meat, 3 kinds of meats and fish, poultry and lamb and I took dairy, different products of dairy. And I applied all of these secretions from these 8 corpses on these different foods, examined them 3 hours later, 5 hours later, 8 hours later, 20 hours later, 24 hours later. And what I found was that only the animal products were properly etched and digested. Vegetation was barely etched, to 8% at most. How can you live on 2-8%? Vegetation you can't. So people cook it to release the elements in it, but when they cook it they destroy all the bacteria, they destroy all the vitamins, they alter everything in it. And you produce 32 toxins from cooking food and I name them in my recipe book in the last 50 pages. 

The 3 most known ones are called carcinogens and those are acrylamides from cooking high carbohydrate foods. We have heterocyclic amines from cooking beets and other high protein foods. And we have lipid peroxides which form from cooking fatty foods. Those are all carcinogenic and each one of them is produced in a cooked food. Plus you have the other 29. So if your body has to eat cooked foods and deal with 32 toxins plus absence of good nutrients and you have all these altered substances which you can no longer use as vitamins and enzymes and everything properly, what do you have? You have a body that's working on using a tremendous amount of energy, a tremendous amount of resources to do what? To get a little bit. It's like going into a junkyard. Let's say you've got a Rolls Royce in your house and you go into a junkyard with burned and old and used and damaged parts to pick out, to put in this Rolls Royce. It doesn't really make a lot of sense but that's what's happening. Is there anybody in this room that is part of that news thing? No? Would you tell me if you were? Well I know the person who brought that person to me last night with her at her workshop left because I knew who it was. So I went up to her and I said, Amelia, that woman you brought last night, she was the cause of this thing today. And so she left. She's not here. That's a shame because she needs help. She needs heavy help. She's got an M.D. telling her to eat iodine, eat a massive amount of iodine. So when I shot her irises, all of this iodine coated her entire autonomic nerve belt and her intestines going into her brain. And I said, you're taking iodine? And she said, yeah, doctor, how are you doing? And I said, why? She said, he said that I needed it because of this and this. And I said, okay, now you've gained all this weight and when did you start gaining the weight? I said, when you have toxins like cysts in the body, you need a lot of fats to bind with them. So the more toxins you get in the body, the more fat you need. So, when did you start getting fat? Same time she started taking the iodine. Hello?

Now hopefully she'll stop taking the iodine and stop having to gain weight to deal with those toxins. So we will see. Well, she's not here now, so who knows if we'll see or not. Anyway, so as the food moves down the stomach, it receives hydrochloric acid if it's needed. Now we don't use hydrochloric acid just for digesting proteins. It neutralizes poisons. If you get an insect bite, a venom, the body can take it to the stomach and dump it in there. And hydrochloric acid will actually neutralize venom. You can take hydrochloric acid and put it on a snake bite. And it will neutralize that venom. But doctors don't want that. They want you to take the venom from a snake and go through this whole medical process to make them look like they're big saviors. It's very easy. I've died several times taking hydrochloric acid and injected it into my own leg one time as an experiment. The venom was gone instantly. I had a leg swelled up as big as elephantiasis. And I took a hypodermic, put that hydrochloric acid in it, I vomited, vomited, got the hydrochloric acid, and then put it in the hypodermic and injected it. That swelling from that leg was gone in five hours. So the medical profession is out to make themselves look glorified only through a scientific process. They don't tell you the simple basics of the body. If you get a snake bite, if you get a venom bite of any kind, you can vomit and use your own hydrochloric acid. If the body naturally takes it to the stomach and dumps it there, you'll start getting nauseous. A lot of people, oh, you're getting nauseous, that's a bad sign. No, that's a good sign. Nausea forces the stomach to manufacture hydrochloric acid. So you can dissolve your own poison that way. The American Indians knew that, and they did it all the time. If they had a lactating animal around, they would first drink the milk from it, and that draws poisons to the stomach even more. Milk, raw milk, will draw poisons to the stomach. And then the hydrochloric acid will neutralize those poisons. Then they wouldn't have to vomit and put the hydrochloric acid serum from vomit directly on the wound.

It still doesn't mean some didn't get into the blood and you're not going to have a little dizzy spell and some diarrhea or vomit, or some small side effect from it, you probably will. You'd have to work very fast to vomit and get it on there without absorbing some. You can always put, like they say, put a tourniquet on the area so it doesn't travel into the body, until maybe you have some milk in your stomach, and then it will draw it to the stomach. If you don't have milk in the stomach, where's it going to go? Probably still to the stomach. It depends upon your body and how it works. Not everybody works the same, but relying upon the natural state of the body and how it reacts naturally, you're going to have a much better odds of getting healthy. If you go the method like she was talking about, you're telling people to go off their insulin. I said, I didn't tell anybody to go off their insulin. I said, if you have diabetic symptoms, which means you can't get off the bed, you can't get out of bed, you can't get off the couch, you can't breathe, you've got true diabetic symptoms, you're not making insulin, you need to take insulin. I said, don't judge insulin intake on your sugar level, because that's a false signal. I have high blood sugar all the time, but I'm not diabetic. Most people here have high sugar all the time. Let a doctor take a glucose tolerance test and say, you're diabetic, here take this medication. Probably every half the people in this room would be on medication if they took the glucose tolerance test. If you listen to your doctor. That's not a wise thing to do. You're just letting a doctor take over your life. So, as the food moves down to the stomach, to the lower part of the stomach, what dumps in there? Bile. What does bile digest? It breaks down fat molecules, it fractionates fat molecules, so that we can reassemble fat molecules into cholesterol. Doctors say, oh, cholesterol is bad. Cholesterol is bad. And then they stop saying that because people say, wait a minute. Cholesterol isn't bad. Then they say, well, we have HDL and LDL. Cholesterol. They've always got something to jump on to say, well, here's the bad stuff and here's the good stuff.

Well, everybody's going to have bad stuff. Like your exhaust from your car. You're going to have a waste product that is not utilizable and not good in your body. So, you're going to throw it off. That's not bad cholesterol that's attacking you. That's bad cholesterol on its way out of the body. If your body's functioning properly. So, all of this stuff, don't eat this because, you know, high cholesterol, don't eat this because it's the wrong cholesterol. Your body makes the cholesterol and the fat that you eat. Only place, only food you're going to find some cholesterol are eggs, egg yolk. And what is the food that I've found that cures the body the quickest and the fastest reverses disease? Raw eggs. In my recipe book, I talk about the MD who called me about her emphysemic patient. Called me, it was like 9.30 my time, so I had the 12.30 her time. She was on the east coast and she says, I have an emphysemic patient who was diagnosed seven years ago. She's been bedridden for most of the last two years and on machines. She's going to die this weekend, this is Thursday night. I said, well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she said, well, I'm an MD. We've got laws, we've got rules. We can only treat a person with medical treatments that are approved medical treatments for ten years. If we fail that person, if the medication fails to help that person, and we have to wait ten years, we have to try for ten years. If it fails them, then we can advise something else after ten years. Or if they're on their deathbed. And this woman's on her deathbed. So I said, okay, that's your conscience. The only thing I can suggest at this point is you get her ten to fifteen dozen raw eggs, you put them on her bedside table and you tell her to eat as many as she can, there's no limit. So, on Monday morning, that was Thursday night. So, I'm sure they didn't get the eggs by Friday, probably Saturday morning. So, I get a call on Monday morning from a raspy-voiced woman saying, it's worked, I'm out of bed, what do I do?

And I said, well, who are you? And she said, well, my doctor called you last week and you told her to tell me to eat as many raw eggs as I could. So, I did. I'm out of bed, I'm off the machines this morning. And I said, how many eggs did you eat? She said, I ate 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday. I said, that's pretty incredible, isn't it? You're out of bed, you've been sick for seven years, you've been bedridden for two years on these machines, and after 66 eggs you're up and out of bed and functioning. She says, okay, what else do I do? I said, keep eating the eggs. And then after a while, when your digestion gets better, start eating meat and raw milk. That's what I suggest. So, eggs are a phenomenal food to eat. That's the only one that has cholesterol already formed. Your meats don't have cholesterol in it, because the animal has made its cholesterol and utilized the fat. The only place you're going to find cholesterol is if you're eating blood out of the bloodstream. And that's phenomenal. I mean, the amount of energy that you can get from eating half blood and half milk is absolutely astounding. And I've done it at least eight times. And every time, the charge is like wow. It's like I feel like Superman. And other people do too. And when the tribes do it, they have whole congregations of their community share it. And it's really good. If you have a question, write it down. If I go through and answer everybody's question as we go along, I found myself in New York City until one o'clock in the morning. So, when I'm asked questions, I get too in-depth with the answer. It's better that I cover your answer during the workshop. 

But if I don't answer it by the end, we will have a Q&A. So, as food moves through the intestines, you have digestive juices, you have your hydrochloric acid forms of it, and you have bile forms of it to break down proteins and fats. None of it etches the vegetation or even the fruit peels. Two to seven, eight percent at max. The only foods that etch properly from those corpses from the human body was dairy and meat and coconut. Dairy, meat, and coconut. Those were the only foods that showed signs of complete digestion after so many hours. And each one was a little bit, each one had a different timing. The meat took for proper digestion with those acids and the bacteria, it took 19 to 24 hours for the meat. Milk was 6 to 10 hours. Eggs, 27 to 30 minutes. Eggs, 27 to 30 minutes. And the egg is the only food in the world that contains everything. Every nutrient on the planet. All the varieties of A, B, C, all of your nutrients, every one of them vitamins, all of the different degrees of them. And of course, the egg, the way the chickens fed or the animals fed, also depends upon the richness of those nutrients. Even though it's all of them, they may not be in the richest form. So, again, it depends on what the animal eats. So, as this food passes through, it digests in the small intestine. Then all of a sudden we notice that we have a larger intestine. It's like a big version of the small intestine. Why do we have that? Because that is a whole different variety of bacteria, mainly E. coli. And what do they digest? They digest the same fats and proteins that have already been worked on that are left over from what the intestinal bacteria did not utilize, digest and utilize. However, those forms of bacteria break down the fats and the proteins into the microscopic form that feeds your brain and nervous system. So, your bowel feeds your brain and your nervous system. And most of the nutrients that are absorbed are absorbed in the sigmoid colon area for the brain and nervous system. 

If you have low nutrients for your brain and nervous system, you're going to have what's called constipation. Your body is going to hold onto that food for as long as it can and try to break everything down it can. That's a sign of low nutrition for your brain and nervous system. Two ways to handle that. You can eat high meat, rotten meat, rotten eggs. She was after my ass all over like a hip pocket about that. And she wasn't about to listen to how it could help. It just killed people. And I asked her, she said, it's killed one person. I said, what's the person's name? Let's investigate. No, it killed them. And I said, how do you know that? She had no answer. She just knew it's raw meat. It was raw rotten meat. I want to know the name. I want to investigate it too. I want to prove what I've proved at least 40 times before. You cannot die on healthy rotten meat. That means raw meat. If you're eating cooked meat, I explained this to her. I said, if you take a cooked substance that's full of chemicals, industrial chemicals, you know, food additives, pesticides and all that, and you've cooked it, you've already broken down to easy release, and then the bacteria feeds on that, what's it going to release? It's going to release every poison that's in that food. And all of your epidemics come from processed food, not raw food. You have not heard one epidemic of raw food. Oh, well, these five, these 10 people got it. Well, how about the other 30 people in the same region that were reported with it that didn't eat sushi or didn't eat raw milk? Why aren't they identified with that food? They didn't eat it. That's why. So, they get left out of the call. They get called out of the statistic. And I've seen that many times. In California, we have one case that went to trial against a big milk producer back in the 80s. And the head of the health department in California, Sacramento, Dr. Warner got on the stand. And he was trapped. He didn't know it. They attributed this one 10-year-old girl's death to drinking raw milk.

So, the attorney, who was a microbiologist and also a doctor who had become an attorney, was defending this dairy company. And he said, well, what was the exact circumstance of her death? Where did you find her? Well, the family found her at the lake. And at the lake, yeah, she had drowned. Wait a minute. She drank raw milk and drowned. She drowned because she drank raw milk? Well, yeah. She had the salmonella in her stomach. Okay. And was the salmonella the same as that in the milk? Well, we didn't check for that. Well, isn't that the logical thing to do? Well, not necessarily. We can just assume. I said, why would you just assume something like that? I mean, the attorney said, why would you just assume something like that? And he said, well, everybody knows the raw milk causes salmonella. Well, I don't know that, the attorney said. Does the judge know that? Do they know that or are they told that? Well, we're all told that. And the attorney said, well, who made up that? Where's that evidence that that's true? Well, we don't have any. Okay. Then they got the mother of the child on the stand. Does your family drink raw milk? Yes. Everybody drink raw milk? Yes. Everybody that's in your household drinks raw milk? Yes. Did everybody who used to be in your household drink raw milk? No. Who didn't drink raw milk? My daughter who died, who drowned. You mean everybody in your family drank raw milk, but that little girl didn't drink raw, your daughter didn't, she didn't like raw milk. All of us love it. We don't know why. She just wouldn't drink it. They blamed her death on raw milk and she didn't even drink raw milk. You have to understand how that prejudice works. That poor girl out there, let's hope she learns something today. Because I kept pleading with her to get scientific. If you're an investigative journalist, you're going to act like a scientist, not like some mouth ad girl who's trying to claim something. You've got to prove it.

So let's hope that works. So as the food goes through the intestines into the bowel, it feeds the brain and the nervous system as it's digested. If you have depression, it's because the brain and the nervous system is not getting fed the fat and protein it needs, and mainly the fats. Now how can you resolve that? You can do a suppository with, they're coming back... You can do a suppository with... Maybe they're calling the police to come and arrest me? So what you can do is, you have to understand, when you eat something, the small intestines are going to absorb most everything, unless you've been on a good raw diet for a very long time. So what's left for the bowel to feed the brain and the nervous system will be inferior leftovers. So how can you feed your colon and your brain and nervous system without feeding it leftovers? You can do a suppository. Take three tablespoons of butter, three tablespoons of coconut cream, three tablespoons of dairy cream, quarter teaspoon of honey just to help break down, to help provide some enzymes that are probably missing from the colon. And just take a tiny amount and you put that in a little four ounce jelly jar and you immerse it in a bowl of hot water. Not hot enough to burn your hands after six or seven seconds in it, but enough to make your hand uncomfortable. It's going to take about four minutes to heat that up to about 105 degrees, the hottest you want it. Over that you start destroying the nutrients in it. So take a bulb syringe and just right before you're ready to go to sleep, then you get on all fours, you bark like a dog and then you squeeze it inside. And once you get it inside, you're on your fours, your buttocks up on your hair, you're on your knees, put your face on your hands, on the floor, bed, wherever you're doing it. Then roll your stomach like a belly dancer. I can do that pretty well, yeah. So, and then that will get it to move up your descending colon. You do that for about four minutes, but you don't have to do it like I did it. It can be a slow movement. I've been doing it a long time. I'm easy with it.

And then you lie on your right side for four minutes with your left leg up in the air and you roll your stomach gently again or fast, however you want. And it will move it from the ascending colon to the transverse and down the descending colon, up the descending colon, across the transverse and down the ascending colon. So, you're going to get all of that fat throughout your intestine, your entire colon. Your bacteria are going to be so delighted and so will your brain and nervous system. I have taken people like on the Ripley show, when I did that, I had two people who had been on psychotropic drugs. One of them, a female, was on for 27 years. She was taking 27 drugs, pills a day, seven different psychotropic drugs, one to counteract the other one. Twenty-seven years on the diet, on and off the diet for a year and a half. And she called me and said, I could kill myself tonight. And I said, you just have to try the high meat. It may change your life. And she said, I'm already on this difficult diet, you know, with the raw food and everybody's going to think that I'm crazy. I'm going to be a brain-amoeba, like, boom, hung up the phone. Called about an hour later and she says, okay, how do I make this high meat? I went to her and she said, that's too long, I may kill myself tonight. I said, well, I've got a friend, the other fellow who was on the Ripley show with me, the young man, to me, anybody under 50 is young. He was 30 years old. And I said, he makes a lot of the meat and he eats a lot of it. I'll have him give you a call if he has any that he wants to give you or sell you. Okay. So I called him, gave him the number, he called her, I guess. Anyway, three hours later I get a call. It's like 1030 at night. I think it was 930, 1030. She says, I just ate some of the high meat, I got it from James and I'm really worried and I'm concerned and I really need to talk with you. No way I'm touching that phone. I'd have to babysit her all night. So she calls about every hour during that and said, I got to really talk to you. I'm really worried. It's been two hours and I think something's going wrong. Better answer this phone. I'm not touching the phone. I know she's not... So all of a sudden at 430 in the morning, I get this call and she says, okay, if you don't answer this phone, I'm just going to stay on this phone and run out your tape.

And she started whistling a happy tune. Now this woman is the most depressed woman I'd ever met in my life. I'd known her for a year and a half. She never giggled or laughed once. She never made a joke. And here she is being funny and whistling and doing the whole thing. So I answered the phone and I said, see? And she said, what do you mean see? And I said, you're laughing, you're making jokes. That's not you. Oh yeah, I am. And I said, if I had babysat you all through the night and answered the phone, you blame me for getting you through it. You see what the food did. You counteracted. You didn't believe that it worked. You just did it. You were afraid of it. And it still worked. Had nothing to do with your mind. It is actually a physiological thing that worked on you. It was your body's food chemistry. And you were happy. You saw her in Ripley's. She'd been eating it for a year. No more medication. She didn't take medication again. Whenever she had a problem, she ate about a golf ball size of rotten meat. Stunk terribly. Remedied her problem just like that. Week, two weeks at a time. That's a much better way than taking drugs all day and being a zombie. Food is your best medicine. So, if you feed the fat directly into the colon, you're going to get fresh fat to your brain and nervous system. Now I've seen that work. That was her other option. Why she thought rotten meat was an easier way to do it than shoving cream and butter up her butt. I don't know. To me, cream and butter up my butt is a better choice than eating stinky, rotten, foul-smelling meat that you have to put a nose clip over your nose. Maybe put some kind of lemon rind oil on there to keep from smelling it. But she chose the high meat. For some reason, I would probably say 70% of the people, I give those two options, choose the rotten meat and rotten eggs over the suppository. Suppository works longer. Maybe the high meat will last four or five days, two weeks. Suppository usually lasts a minimum of seven days, up to six weeks, depending upon how deficient your nervous system is. 

So, there are two options for you. If you know anybody who has, that you know anybody that you can tell this information that won't call the news police on you. Three tablespoons each of butter, coconut cream, and berry cream. And a quarter teaspoon of honey.

Q: You know, you gave that recipe for me to do on my daughter when she was a baby. It worked every single time.

Q: So, where did you get the coconut cream?

A: You have to make it. It tells you in two books and it also shows you how to do it easily in the DVD, the recipe DVD. If I were you and you want to make foods really nice, just like, I don't know why I can't think of your name, is that Kate? Kate said to me, she says, you know, I read the recipe book and it sounds so complicated. And then when I saw you do it on the DVD, it's like so simple. You can make meat sauces in like three minutes. You can make a blueberry cheesecake in twenty minutes. And it solidifies and it's delicious, so much better than any cooked cheesecake. And you can eat it until you're stuffed and you won't get indigestion and you won't get that, oh, Thanksgiving feeling. I'm gonna suffer for two days with this. There's no suffering. So, get that recipe DVD. It will change your life. I show you how to make your juice, make the coconut cream, everything so easy. Make it very easy. I've been doing it for years. So, how often did you have to do it for your daughter?

Q: Probably once every two weeks to begin with, and then it increased from, and then we decreased it from there, and now she's not on it at all.

A: And that's a baby. How old was she?

Q: The suppository that he's talking about, I actually did for my daughter. When she was born, she had a massive dose of antibiotics in the hospital, and it caused chronic constipation. And the only thing that would get her through was the suppository. We started off with doing it every once, no, actually, maybe it was once every three days for quite some time.

A: For how long?

Q: Oh, I don't know. Probably for about a year.

A: Every three days for a year?

Q: Yeah, maybe that. And that was only because we had other things that we were fighting to. It wasn't just the, it was other stuff as well. And then it backed off to, you know, once every two weeks, and then it backed off from there, and now she's five and she doesn't have an issue at all.

A: And she's healed?

Q: Yeah, she's perfectly fine.

A: She's fine. If a doctor had her on, she'd have Crohn's disease and be taking medication and be non-functional. With knees blown up this big. I had a pretty famous senator from the United States bring his granddaughter to me. Thirteen years old, blown out knees this big with Crohn's disease. Ankles blown out too. Painful. Couldn't walk without severe pain. I put her on a raw meat diet, everything minced, lots of milkshakes, and in six months her knees were completely normal. A year later she went back on to a crappy diet because she was well. Three years later she was back into Crohn's again. You know, so you can't, you don't think that, when you're cured, you're cured because you're eating properly. You start eating garbage again, you're going to get unwell again. So, and I've had a lot of people do that. A lot of people go on the diet for ten years and then find a partner that, you know, I want cooked food, I want you to eat cooked food with me, and they go do that and then ten years later, sick again. What kind of a lover is that? You gotta get a lover, train them to let you do what you need to do for you. Let them do what they want to do for them and even serve them and do that for them, but don't do it yourself unless that's really what you want to do, is venture back into illness. It's a ridiculous thing for me to think about. Somebody that's supposed to love you wants you to do what they want you to do just because they want you to do it. It's ridiculous. That's my opinion. And opinions are like assholes, everybody's got one, they all stink. Okay so as this food goes down and dumps through the body, it's not supposed to be toxic. There are creatures that eat dung. There are creatures that eat shit. Dogs. You have crustaceans in the ocean. You have bugs. You have beetles. You have all kinds of creatures. Worms. All kinds of creatures eat it. That's what breaks it down into fertilizer.

Creatures eat that stuff because it's not supposed to be toxic. It's just not finished digesting food. Now there's a tribe in Georgia, Russia. Years ago I saw a video on it where they were showing this woman eating what looked like she had chocolate on her fingers, smiling, black hair, blue eyes, very diminutive. And as they pulled back there was this buffalo tail swishing in the background. And you pull out further and she's sitting before a big pile of buffalo dung, water buffalo dung. And she's eating it. Vibrantly healthy. Now she was a poor person in that particular community. She didn't have chickens. She didn't have goats. So what she did was she ate the partially digested fecal matter of an herbivore. An herbivore doesn't digest everything. An herbivore will digest at maximum 67% of what they eat. So all of this food is coming out of them partially digested. So there are people also in India who do it. Who eat fecal matter from a cow or a buffalo because it's partially digested. We can't do it because our digestive tract is two and a half times shorter than herbivores. Plus they have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fat and the protein from it. It takes 24 hours to get through a food in our bodies and the foods that get through our bodies properly digested are meats and dairy. Even coconut doesn't get thoroughly digested. If we eat coconut pulp and we eat the whole coconut we will digest about 60% of it. But that's still a lot of nutrients. However the dairy and the meats and eggs, I consider that a meat, is completely digested because it's animal matter. If we eat bugs, snails, worms, any of that, we will digest those properly. But an herbivore takes 48 hours to digest vegetation. Plus they have all those enzymes to break down the cellulose that we don't. So if you take buffalo dung or goat dung or something like that and eat it, it's already going to be half digested for you. So by the time it travels through your body in 24 hours, guess what? You can actually be a vegetarian.

Oh shit, vegetarian. And it's the truth. I'm just giving you the information. There's reality out there. I'm not telling you to go out and live on dung. If you want to be a vegetarian, that's the way to do it. You won't have to eat meat. Well, you know, I've been telling people that if you eat the fecal matter, you can reverse your cancers and you can heal a lot of things if you eat dung. If you eat, you know, fecal matter. I don't eat fecal matter from a human because I don't know a human that's clean and healthy enough unless I were out with one of the tribes. And still, I don't have to eat it. But some people need to. Now there was an article that came out. Doctors are now taking fecal matter. Now I started this 25 years ago. Doctors took fecal matter last year from a mother and put it through a tube into her five year old, three or five year old child that was dying because it couldn't digest anything. Implanted the fecal matter, which was a good $20,000 operation to put in her and all of her kids. It was here son, eat this shit. And that would have been, you know, what? Two cents? Two cents of her time? And that was it. So they went through this whole medical procedure and all this great thing happened. The kid was instantly in a few days able to eat anything and everything and digest. But they make sure you do it through the proper way, the $20,000 medical procedure. It's an insanity. There's a lot of taboo out there that we need to dump. And anybody who asked me any, she didn't ask me if she'd asked me what, if she ever got to that point, she said, okay, what is the most important advice that you'd ever give to anybody? And everybody who asked me that question, I say, everything you hear from the medical profession, do the exact opposite. And you'll be right 99 times out of 100. Literally 99 times out of 100. They put ice and cold on it, you put heat on it. Literally everything they tell you to do, do the opposite. And you will be right 99% of the time.

So that pretty much takes care of the digestive tract. Now I'm not going to go into the glands and organs and all of that. That's on that, the workshop tape information. I'm going to get into detoxification. Now you've got all that other information in my books and everything. The only thing I don't have a book on right now is detoxification. I have a lot of that information on my newsletter. If you go to wewant2live.com, that's we, we live, spelled out, the numeral 2 instead of T-O, .com, spelled out, live also, wewant2live.com. You can get my newsletters, I think it's $85 a year, but you get all the back issues to 2006. So that's 1500 pages. That's four books of up-to-date information that isn't in the books. And it tells you a lot about detoxification. But I'm going to take you through it in steps that I don't address in different newsletters in a composite form here. So, we know that poisons have a tendency to go into fat. So fat is very, very, very important. The most important food that we can eat in a toxic environment. It is so important that if you even have bad fat, you will still be protected. The toxins go into the fat no matter what kind of fat it is. If the fat molecules are all swollen and large, of course, they're not going to be able to hold a concentration of toxins, so each fat molecule is going to have a small amount of the toxins. The more developed and concentrated the fat is, the more toxins it can hold. Now, when you heat a fat, when you cook it, it will swell 5 to 50 times its normal size. You've seen the raw pork rinds, you know, they're nice and thin and you cook them and they swell up and they're all crispy and large. Well, that's the way the fat molecules get in the body. Very large. Now, I'm right now 23% body fat. 23% body fat. Men are supposed to be 7-10% body fat. Do I look like I'm that big? I don't look like I'm that big. I'm big. I mean, I've got a nice full waist. It took me months to get here. I go from a 30 waist to this time. Since I was a fat teenager, I went up to a 42 waist. I had no pants that would fit. I have to put them down here to be able to keep them because they will go over my tummy.

And I worked hard, worked hard at getting that. I go down, when I go back to my farms in Thailand and the Philippines, and I actually do something other than talk and hit my computer board. I actually physically work and I swim every day. And I ride my horse and do all kinds of labors, things like plant, cultivate and do all that stuff. So, I go down and lose weight because I don't have all the butter there. I have to wait until I get back to the States and I'm eating the cream and the butter and they blow up again. And I look like Humpty Dumpty when I get there. When I leave, I'm slender and it's just up and down all the time. But, whenever I have the weight, I feel better because I am protected. I'm still out in fumes. I go on an airplane where there's benzene in the air and other triglycerides that are from the exhaust from the fuel. Everybody knows that your air goes right past the engine into the cabin. So, I wear a 12-layer filter mask when I'm on a plane the whole time to prevent that. If you go online and you look up some damage done to people, some flight attendants and pilots, they've lost their short-term memory. Australia was the only one that allowed it ever into the Senate, but they didn't do anything about it. You have people that were on board as passengers or as flight attendants or as captains or pilots, the radio man, all incapacitated, unable to work because of the fuel burned and got in there. Oil leaked onto the engine and got right into the exhaust system into the compartment. And you never know what's going to happen. You know when you take off on a runway, it backs up and goes right into the cabin. You can smell it right away. Well, I defend myself again. I'm around poisons all the time. Not only psychological ones, but actual physiological ones. So, I like to keep a lot of fat on me. I don't like to get thin. So, when you eat raw fats, the molecules will be very tiny. So, I can put on 23% body fat and look like I'm maybe 12. Other people will be huge and really they don't have that much body fat. The molecules are just swollen and big. 

Q: Cooked.

A: So, much more concentrated when it's raw and much more effective. However, any fat will protect you even if it's toxic fat. And I will show you this woman's eyes from 18 months ago to this year, her irises and show you the difference in 18 months with some and I can show you other people who have not had anywhere near the cleansing that she did in 18 months. And she's my only patient who has remained that size. She's even gained lots of weight, but that size. She's the only one that I've seen out of yesterday, out of my patients, that was able to detox that much and safely and nicely. So, fat is very, very, very important. Can't say enough about fat. And like I said, everybody who's fat, I said, you should throw a party, rejoice, be happy you've been fat. All these skinny people who've been saying, oh, it's unhealthy to be. Like that woman out there, she said, you're telling people to be fat, to be 20 kilos overweight. That's an awful thing. And I said, well, toxins store in fat. But that much, you got cholesterol, heart disease. And I said, how do you know that stuff's true? She doesn't. And you don't, except for by my experience and other people who've been on it and you can see them and talk with them. And I can show your irises to show you the difference. I can show you somebody who's been 100% on the diet. She's only been on about 80%. And she's cleaned out twice as much as people been on at 100%. Why? Because she had the fat to protect her. The poisons as they were coming out went into her fat, not into her cells. That's remarkable. So, you should be happy about being fat. Not happy about being skinny. Got to get out of that skinny mode. What's it going to get you?Most people who are very thin have a short fuse. They're very irritable. They have no reserves. They're usually type A people, hyperactive. Think about that. That's because you have no fat. All that information is not being buffered. It goes to the brain. So, what is your being thin getting for you? Not more love. Not more kindness. Not more happiness. Maybe a lot more energy.

But what is the reward from having that energy? Is it good relations? Good feelings for yourself? Or are you never satisfied? Because most of the thin people I know, whether they're men or women, that are thin are never satisfied. They're like Donald Trump or George Bush. These guys. And these guys aren't even thin. They're just greedy bastards. So, fat is very important. You need to eat fat to detoxify properly. A lot of poison is stored in the tissues and I find that most of your vaccines, which I talked about, are one of the most toxic substances on the planet and they're responsible for at least 70% of all diseases today. They set your children up, they set you up to be highly toxic and disease ridden in your lifetime. The vaccine racket is the first choice of the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and who else is it? Oh, now Bill Gates. Bill Gates is behind... Let's kill people by vaccines and he admits it. The way to reduce population is vaccines. Here's a multi-billionaire telling you that. Stay away from any injection. You have not a clue what's in it. And let me tell you, if it's produced by the pharmaceutical industry, it is intended for them to make money. That means it will do you harm, so you have to go to the doctor more and get more medication and they hear pocketing, pocketing, pocketing money, as you can see.

Q: I have a question on that. When you travel, you have to have immunization.

A: No, you don't. That's a lie. The only time you have, if you go to, let's say you go to Peru and you want to go to Sao Paulo, Brazil, they're going to require you to have a yellow fever vaccine. I've got a six page acceptance of responsibility that says what's in every vaccine, all the toxins in it, and the person who says that you have to have it signs off a million dollar responsibility for anything that happens if you have it. You can't get anybody to sign it, so what they do is they'll quarantine you for three to eight hours. They can do it up to 24 hours to make sure you're not sick, put you on that flight and you can go. And in that I cite the Geneva Convention law that shows you cannot be the subject and experiment without proper acceptance of it. And you do not accept that. And no vaccine. Yellow fever, any of them, are proved to be effective.

Q: A doctor might give you, I've got to tell you, if you give me a yellow fever because I don't have a fluid, he'd think that would kill you.

A: What?

Q: It would kill you.

A: Sometimes it will kill you, yeah. It will kill a lot of people. So, that is the way to avoid it. There are some states in America, there are 18 states where you have to give your children vaccines or else you go to jail. You move from those states. You have that here, you move from where you are. Do not subject your children for convenience to poisons like that. That makes no sense. So anyway, most of the poisons that are injected go to the stomach lining. Others will go in pockets, like little sealed areas in the body. If they don't go in like they did to my brain and the liquid ones and cause neurological destruction. And the one that went to my heart and caused the vaccine, the polio vaccine toxicity that went to my heart and caused the heart spasms for seven and a half years. So, the way to get that stuff out of the stomach safely is to find something that absorbs it. What can we eat that absorbs those poisons, doesn't release them and then dumps it out the bowels or allows you to vomit it or pass it through the skin. Those are the three ways that these things can leave the body or urinate. But urinating is not a good way to send toxins out of the body because the kidneys are too sensitive. Now the workshop DVD explains about the kidneys, but just so you understand where I'm coming from, you don't want to send toxins out of the kidneys because the kidney is a very important organ. It has one job, it's not supposed to filter out toxins. It does one thing, it filters out fluid from the blood stream so that you can be cold or warm, cooled or warm. If you draw fluids out of the blood, what happens? You get warmer, you get hot. If you put more fluid into the blood stream, what happens? You cool the system. So, the kidney will draw water out of the blood stream to cool the body, I mean to heat the body. And that is the main point. You notice that when you get cold, you start peeing a lot? Because you're trying to get rid of more fluid to thicken your blood so that you can stay warmer.

If you didn't have that kidney doing that, you could withstand about 7 degree temperature change and then you'd be dead. But with the kidney, we can have about a 50 to a 60 degree temperature adjustment in Fahrenheit, not in Centigrade. A little less than that, probably about 25 degree difference in Centigrade. So, that's the purpose of the kidney. The kidney is very sensitive. It builds ammonia like the stomach builds hydrochloric acid for digestion. The kidney manufactures ammonia. Why does it manufacture ammonia? Because red and white blood cells are repelled by ammonia. So if you pissed out your red and white blood cells every time you urinated, you'd be anemic and dead. So the kidneys filter out the red and white blood cells and allow everything else that's in the blood serum to move. And the more rich the nutrients are in your blood, the darker your urine will be. Again, your urine is supposed to be clear? Opposite. Exact opposite. My urine is brown sometimes. The more nutrients, the more eggs I eat, the browner it will be. The less milk I drink, the browner it will be. The more milk I drink, the more yellow or orange it will be. The concentration of nutrients changes the color and density of the nutrients in your urine. It should never be clear. If it's clear, you have very little concentration of nutrients in your blood. You're not feeding that blood very well. Those red and white blood cells are not happy. If you drink a lot of water, your urine is going to be clear. And what does water then do? It completely dilutes the nutrients in your body and washes away your nutrients. Remember, you cannot absorb water in a cell by itself. The H2O molecule has to be linked with an ion and it has to be linked with vitamins and minerals and other nutrients. When a cell opens to eat, you've got 93 to 107 nutrients bound in that smorgasbord. Cell opens, it tracks it in, that's a complete balanced diet for that cell. If you drink water, it dilutes the H2O. If you eat salt, it does the same thing. Breaks up those smorgasbords. So, a cell may get 27 nutrients, 23, 50. When it's supposed to get 93 to 117 nutrients every time it eats. 

If your urine is clear, how many nutrients do you think are being delivered to your cells? Very little. And the H2O cannot be absorbed into a cell without the nutrients. So, what does it do? It really dehydrates you. The more water you drink, the more water you want to drink. The drier your skin gets, the looser your muscles get. I have athletes, I have two world champion competitors in martial arts. One guy does 12,000 jump ropes an hour. When he used to do it, before he went on the diet 12 years ago, he was dry. He would get winded. His heart would race for about an hour afterwards. A year on the diet, in three minutes his heart was normal, beat was normal. He doesn't get skinny anymore. He went from 35th place to 50th place for about 15 years, and since he's been on the diet, he's never been under 5th place. Last year, he was in 1st place both times. He's 72 years old. Beating everybody 18 and 20 years younger, 25 years younger than he is. He competes against the younger divisions. They don't drink any water. They drink my sport formula, they drink milk. Why? What is a tomato? 92% water. All food is 92-94% water. Milk is 86-90% water. Meat, 50-70% water, as long as you don't cook it. Once you cook it, you fractionate those bonds of ions in the H2O. That's why people eating cooked foods are always drinking and drinking and drinking with their meals. Especially their high carbs. Rice, pasta, drinking down that water. I drink 1-2 ounces of milk following a meat meal, or some eggs, and that's it. But I sip milk and I sip a sport formula when I have it. I sip those all day long. Like everybody is going around sucking water. I suck nutrients. And I suck. I don't go glug, glug, glug, glug. I suck. I suck over my tongue and through my teeth. I had 2 sips, 2 tablespoons just then. That's all. But what happened? I'm just like a baby sucking a nipple. You get just as much saliva in with the milk when you suck. What's in the saliva? All the bacteria that's going to help you digest that milk. So I'm getting bacteria into my food, into my fluids every time I drink when I suck it like that. If you're gulping it, you're getting very little saliva, very little bacteria in whatever you're drinking. Not a good thing.

So let's get back to the toxins that dump into the stomach. Now you'll find that when the poisons are dumped into the stomach or stored in the stomach, they dump into your food every time you eat a little at a time. So that poisons your entire intestinal tract. That in turn poisons all the nervous system. Remember the nerve system is connected with everything. So the poisons go into the nervous system and then that filters out to the whole body. So the body spreads it out, thins it out so it isn't concentrated in any particular area. What if you don't want it to go to the rest of the body? What if you want it out of the body? You need to find something that will go through the body, pull it out, not be digested and leave the body with the toxins. I've experimented with clay. Clay doesn't have any nutrients in it that you can digest. We don't eat dirt. Plants eat dirt, we don't eat dirt. We can't digest it. We need vitamins and enzymes and other things mixed with it, not just soil bacteria. Sure, we can digest the soil bacteria that's in clay, but that's a micro amount of the clay. So, with clay in it, you can't eat it all day long. You've got poison dumping all day long. You can't eat clay all day long. It'll rip the mucous lining off of your intestinal tract and your stomach, your rectum, everything. You'll be dry as a bone. It won't work. So, what are other things? The Indians use milk. We're so toxic, we digest the milk. We're so nutrient deficient, we're going to digest the milk. We're not healthy. So, we're going to digest that milk and we're going to re-digest the poisons that go with it. So, what can we do to prevent the body from reusing poisons? I found that the body does not digest anything that's dehydrated and not cooked. And what is that? Cheese. Cheese is very absorbent, full of minerals, fat also, unless you made it from skim milk, the cheese, and it still will work because it's full of minerals, even though it's very low fat, still full of minerals and protein, combined with those poisons.

If you eat honey or a fruit with that cheese, you will digest it, because you're adding the enzymes that are missing in the dehydrated food. Any food that is dehydrated and raw will not be digested unless your body is borrowing enzymes from itself or you eat something like fruit or honey with it to digest it. So, we eat little amounts of cheese, raw, no salt cheese. And every time you do, without anything else, with a little butter so you don't get too constipated, because people have a tendency to get very dry in the colon. So, let it pass through and it will go and collect. You have a chain of this going through. I have some people that are eating once every 15 minutes some construction workers, heavy metal, lathe operators, heavy metal throughout their systems. I have them eating a little half a teaspoon of cheese, which is the size of a sugar cube, every 15 minutes. That's four an hour. I have some people eat it every 20 minutes. That's three an hour. Some people eat it every 30 minutes. That's two an hour. Some people eat it every 45 minutes. That's two times every hour and a half. Some people eat it once an hour. Depends upon your toxicity and what you are willing to do to remove those poisons quickly. And there are some people who really need it every 15 minutes to 20 minutes. And when I have experimented with it over the last five years, the results are spectacular. Now if you eat raw salted cheese, same as cooking it, salt is an explosive. Sodium is an explosive. When sodium is isolated, it's the smallest mineral we have in size and weight. But it is an explosive when it's in concentration. A football size, an American football size, of pure sodium crystal will take out New York City and all of its buildings. One football sized concentration of sodium crystal. My father worked on it for General Electric to make it into a weapon. They could not control it. It was more fragile than nitroglycerin. One and a half degree temperature change would set it off. So they couldn't, thank God, they couldn't make it into a weapon. But they made it into a weapon against you.

Especially the King and Queen of England. They got into the salt business. They took it over to India for over 200 years. And they knew that it makes people more confused in their thinking, less dedicated, more hyperactive. To give you an example, we went to a so-called organic meat market, and all organic certified and everything. And I looked at the bacon and I love raw bacon. Delicious, fat. So I got four strips of bacon and I got two kilos of ground meat. Got home and I had nothing else, only milk, and I needed a meat meal. So I was going to eat the pork first. Salt was tremendous in it. Must have soaked it in brine for a week.

Q: Does all bacon have salt?

A: Pardon?

Q: Doesn't all bacon have salt?

A: No.

Q: Oh, it does here.

A: Well, not in... We have our farmers make it for us. In Asia, we have them cut it. They don't put it in salt unless you're in a regular market. So I put that aside and went and got my beef. Salted so, too. Not as much as the pork was, but I had to eat it this way. Lots of butter and cheese with it, and egg to counterbalance the sodium. I had tinnitus. I still have tinnitus and that was two days ago. Well, 36 hours ago. But I ate it. So I still have tinnitus, I mean swelling in the ears, because what does sodium do? It causes water retention. It doesn't cause water absorption, it causes water retention. I was buzzed. I could barely sleep that night. So yesterday when I saw all my patients all day long, from morning to night, I was unable to sleep. But I was wired and I was focused, but it was harder to think, because of that sodium in my bloodstream and in my neurological fluids everywhere. So I'm still dealing with it. Salt is a dangerous substance. If you really want to see what I mean by that is, these guys ridiculed me. They were going to show that I was crazy, like that girl out there. These guys were going to show that my salt, that my salt, I don't know the word I would put it. My salt theory was not true. So they took dead frog legs and they salted them. Now these are dead frog legs. I don't know why you can't hear the sound. They're laughing and they're carrying on. I don't know why. Maybe the volume isn't right. This is exploding. These are dead legs. Why would they be reacting to salt? And they go on for 32 minutes until all the salt has exploded. So imagine what it's doing in your body. 32 minutes. They only show two and a half minutes of it, but this goes on for 32 minutes. You see now the thighs are starting to react. See everywhere. This is salt. This is what happens in your body. Your blood cells, everything. Any kind of salt, doesn't make any difference. It's sodium in rock form. Sodium in food is handled properly. Even if it's high amounts in tomato and celery. It's got everything it needs to balance it. Just look up frog leg salt video on YouTube and it will come up. Then they do it with pepper and I'll show you that one. 

Now what's pepper? Pepper is a burning irritant herb, right? You think that if you put pepper on dead legs they're going to go crazy, right? Something happens. A little something happens because there's a little salt in the pepper. You can see there's a tiny bit of salt with the pepper. There's three kinds of pepper here. There's cayenne, there's black pepper, and there's brown pepper. And there's a few grains of salt so you'll see two twitches. Look at how much pepper they put on that. They poured the pepper on. Twenty times more pepper than they put on salt. And it just twitches a little bit. So now you understand what salt does. Now you understand what salt is. Any form of salt is not good. We don't eat rock. What happens if you feed salt to a plant? You kill it. It'll burn the roots. Plants can't even eat rock salt. What makes you think we can? They're built to eat rock. We can't. Sea salt's the same. It's a rock. It isn't in a plant. It isn't part of a food. So there you see. So now I'm not so crazy am I? He's shaking it. He wants to get it to move so that's what he did. And it just won't move. So these guys were ridiculing me about that. That's a hemorrhoid right there. Let's see a nasty hemorrhoid. There's a hemorrhoid. This guy I told him to put a piece of meat up there and make it like a [unintelligible] so it won't come out. And it was relieved in twenty four hours. He suffered for over three days. But I'm going to show you lots of good stuff pretty soon. But I need to get through this other pre-stuff first. So cheese will absorb the poisons as long as it's no salt raw cheese. Salt will cook your foods by exploding it and fractionating it. Expose all of the elements that are in that food to digestion and absorption as an explosive. It does it through a like a combustion compressive reaction. Not like hydrochloric acid will dissolve it into a liquid. This is an explosive compressive reaction. So but it's a way of cooking your food putting salt into it. King and Queen of England knew this that's why they became the only exporters in the world for four hundred years, of salt. They bought the rights from China, from India. Anybody who made their own salt were punishable by death. Until Gandhi came along and in 1947 got three million people to go and make their own salt on the beach. You know how many people died that day clubbed to death? Clubbed to death for making salt.

This is the King and Queen of England's orders. Well it embarrassed the King and Queen so badly that not only did they get to make their own salt the Indian people, the Indian people also got independence. So called independence from England. So this is the King and Queen of England, the most powerful family in the world and the richest. They own three quarters of all the land mass on the planet. They own seventy percent of all food manufacturing in the world including those in the United States through trust. So King and Queen of England like to keep themselves low profile but these are the people running the whole show and Rothschilds and Rockefellers are just their puppets and you get this claim that they are one of the twelve rich families in the world running the world. They are not. Those twelve families all work for the King and Queen of England all through trust. So you know who your enemy in raw food is. And guess what? The King and Queen of England have their own cows and drink their own raw milk and eat their own food out of their garden. They don't buy anything from anywhere. They get no food that they don't grow and if they are somewhere it gets transported to them. They don't eat any food, they don't know where it's grown because they don't trust anybody not to poison them. I don't trust anybody not to poison me either but I have to. That salt that poisoned me, I'm still poisoned from it and it takes me a while to counter it but I'm countering it. Another way we can detoxify with that is because in the morning from the night time of being sedentary you are going to dump a tremendous amount of poisons into the stomach and intestines. So it's good to start your day off with like one and a half to two if you are a big guy, three tablespoons of cheese first thing in the morning. Anywhere from a half a teaspoon to a whole tablespoon of butter, depending upon how much cheese you are eating, just so you don't get constipated from it. It will go through and pull out poisons, it's going to go through your stomach, pull those, go all the way through your intestines and it's going to keep collecting all of the way. And then if you are eating that little amount of cheese every fifteen to one hour, you are going to have it go through the body constantly picking up poisons. 

Now I say that as I mentioned before in the laboratory experiments I've done, I found the stomach, every time you eat the stomach dumps those poisons into your food. What I also observed, once you stop eating, ten minutes after you stop eating, the flow of those poisons stop. So the amount of poisons that collect from the time you begin eating until ten minutes after you begin eating, it stops. So, how do you work that? You eat a piece of cheese, don't eat anything else for ten minutes. So just in that ten minutes all it's going to dump and it will be picked up by that cheese. Then you start eating in ten minutes your regular meal. You have twenty-five minutes to eat before the toxins will start dumping again into your stomach if you continue eating. If you haven't finished your meal, then you stop, you eat a piece of cheese, wait ten minutes, and then start eating again. You have twenty-five more minutes to do it. Works like clockwork. In my experiments, pardon me?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I had to tube down somebody's, several people's throats, and then just watch the, drew the acids out, you know, every, about five minutes. And it was absolute in all twelve of the people. It was over a twelve year period. Can't get many people to do that. Put a tube in their stomach and then live with that in their throat for, you know, a couple of days. So, not easy. And usually I got people who were already in the hospital or being fed through the tube or something like that to do it. So, and then when I said, well, you know, that's people who have already been sick and tubes down their throat. So I began experimenting over a three year period with a hundred people. People trust me. I'm not stupid, you know, I'm not going to lead them on a bad road. So I had them eating the cheese, depending on the concentration of toxins in the stomach or intestines, I'd have them eat a certain amount of cheese a certain amount of time. And the difference, it's like they would detox in one year as much as normally detox in three to five years. So it was a huge boom in my ability to help people. It's a phenomenal boom.

Q: Could you just go through the protocol again of the timing of the cheese, just so that we can get it clear.

A: Okay. You want to eat something. Eat a little piece of cheese. Ten minutes after that, you don't eat anything else. You don't drink anything. You don't sip anything, water, milk, anything. You eat the cheese. Ten minutes after that, you can begin eating. And that's ten minutes after you swallow the cheese. Keep it in your mouth and get it full of the saliva, wonderful. That may take you a minute or two. Start the ten minutes after you finish, after you swallow the cheese. And then you have twenty-five minutes to eat your meal, to drink your milkshake, whatever you're having. Eat your fruit meal. Twenty-five minutes is plenty to eat a meal, especially on this diet. Most everything's liquid. If you're patéing your meat, that's almost liquid. So it's very easy to eat on this diet. And I have eighty-two sauce recipes for meat in my recipe book that can be made in three to five different ways each, so that's four hundred sauces. You can't get bored with four hundred sauces. And what I do is, I mostly eat my meat just like it is. I don't like, you know, other condiments with it very often. But sometimes I'll just have to have sauces. Over two and a half months, I say, I can't eat just another plain piece of meat, or fish, or whatever it is. I need some sauce with it. So usually what I'll do is I'll make a big quart of sauce, like a liter of sauce. And I'll put that on until I can't stand it anymore. Or I'll make a variety of them. And then I'll have one, one meal, another one, another meal, another one, the other meal. And I can just, with a liter, two, three liters of sauces, I can go two months by taking two tablespoons or three tablespoons of that sauce and putting it on one meat meal. So it goes a long way. So you don't have to make your sauces every day. I've had sauces up to six, seven months in the refrigerator. And they do not go bad, any of them that I have in the recipe book.

Q: But are they nutritious still?

A: Pardon?

Q: Are they still nutritious after that time?

A: Yeah, absolutely. In fact, if they ferment, you have to remember, on this diet, a food that is aged in bacteria and is fermenting is what? Pre-digested. You're going to digest every molecule of it. Whereas you're going to have less fecal matter, you're going to have more completely digested fecal matter, when your waste product is not even your food anymore. It's dead cells and just garbage and mucus that's just dumped off of your body. When I was with the wolves and the coyotes living outdoors, they would eat something, I mean, they'd eat like that half a jackrabbit or two, and they're very kind. They let the weakest ones eat and the strongest ones don't eat. It's not survival of the fittest. That's a shit theory that's put out there to make you feel that you can do shit on your neighbor because you're stronger. Capitalism in its worst form. Greed, greed, greed. And you deserve it because you're the stronger. And they deserve to be pushed on, trampled on, starved because they're the weaker. So anyway, these coyotes, when they had a bowel movement, the wolves when they had a bowel movement, the only thing that they passed was the hair. They digested the bones, they digested organs, they digested everything but the hair. So you see these little hairy turds, and that's all they are is hair. And you see them, they're white and all of a sudden they disintegrate within a day in the sun and all it is is hair. It's like, wow, wouldn't you like to be able to digest that well? Digest the bones, you digest the skin, everything but the hair. Man, I want a digestive tract like that. So, if you're eating the right foods and digesting properly, the only thing you'll have in there are your hair balls. Like I said, keep your questions for the end in case I don't answer them. Because if I keep answering them, I'm going to get way behind. Thank you. But I'll bet you I answer your questions. So, the cheese timing, that's what the timing is, 10 minutes before everything. Plus, when you're not eating a meal, you eat every 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes to an hour, you eat a piece of cheese just to make sure you're going through and cleaning that up.

So, when you do have food coming through there, it doesn't mix with the poisons. It's been incredibly effectual. Like I say, people who are detoxing in one year would usually take three to five years to detox. And when you're looking at mercury, which is mainly the worst neurotoxin that's the most poisonous substance on the planet, it's a very fine molecule. Let me show you what it can do.

[chatter]

A: I don't know if you can hear it, I guess not. See if I can...

Q: Do you have to go up there too?

A: Volume, volume, volume. I hope this is the channel.

Video: In the past 15 years, medical research laboratories have established that dental amalgam tooth fillings are a major contributor to mercury body burden. In 1997, a team of research scientists demonstrated that mercury vapor inhalation by animals produced a molecular lesion in brain protein metabolism which was similar to a lesion seen in 80% of Alzheimer's diseased brains. Recently completed experiments by scientists at the University of Calgary's Faculty of Medicine now reveal, with direct visual evidence from brain neuron tissue cultures, how mercury ions actually alter the cell membrane structure of developing neurons. To better understand mercury's effect on the brain, let us first illustrate what brain neurons look like and how they grow. In this animation, we see three brain neurons growing in a tissue culture, each with a central cell body and numerous neurite processes. At the end of each neurite is a growth cone where structural proteins are assembled to form a cell membrane. Two principal proteins involved in growth cone function are actin, which is responsible for the pulsating motion seen here, and tubulin, a major structural component of the neurite membrane. During normal cell growth, tubulin molecules link together end-to-end to form microtubules which surround neurofibrils, another structural protein component of the neuronal axon. Shown here is the neurite of a live neuron isolated from snail brain tissue, displaying linear growth due to growth cone activity. It is important to note that growth cones in all animal species, ranging from snails to humans, have identical structural and behavioral characteristics and use proteins of virtually identical composition. In this experiment, neurons also isolated from snail brain tissue were grown in culture for several days, after which very low concentrations of mercury were added to the culture medium for 20 minutes. Over the next 30 minutes, the neurite membrane underwent rapid degeneration, leaving behind the denuded neurofibrils seen here. In contrast, other heavy metals added at this same concentration, such as aluminum, lead, cadmium, and manganese, did not produce this effect. To understand how mercury causes this degeneration, let us return to our illustration. As mentioned before, tubulin proteins link together during normal cell growth to form the microtubules which support the neurite structure. When mercury ions are introduced into the culture medium, they infiltrate the cell and bind themselves to newly synthesized tubulin molecules. 

More specifically, the mercury ions attach themselves to the binding site reserved for guanosine triphosphate, or GTP, on the beta subunit of the affected tubulin molecules. Since bound GTP normally provides the energy which allows tubulin molecules to attach to one another, mercury ions bound to these sites prevent tubulin proteins from linking together. Consequently, the neurite's microtubules begin to disassemble into free tubulin molecules, leaving the neurite stripped of its supporting structure. Ultimately, both the developing neurite and its growth cone collapse, and some denuded neurofibrils form aggregates, or tangles, as depicted here. Shown here is a neurite growth cone stained specifically for tubulin and actin, before and after mercury exposure. Note that the mercury has caused disintegration of tubulin microtubule structure. These new findings reveal important visual evidence as to how mercury causes neurodegeneration. More importantly, this study provides the first direct evidence that low-level mercury exposure is...

A: Now you notice that the mercury is way over there?

Q: Yeah.

A: Can you see what's happening?

Q: Yes.

A: The vapor from the mercury is destroying neurons. Not even the direct contact with the mercury itself. Now we'll show another one. That talked about the mercury that vaporizes from amalgams, fillings. It doesn't talk about how dangerous the injected is in vaccines or in antibiotics. Remember, a lot of your injections, almost all of them, have some mercury in them, whether it's penicillin, any of them. And they don't have to put it on there. They can say it is an antiseptic, an antibiotic, a preservative. They'll call it anything, and you don't even know it's mercury. And it's highly poisonous. And it's more poisonous than the form that's vaporized from the amalgam fillings. Now we're going to take a look at amalgam fillings and how dangerous they are if you have amalgam. 

Video: So all mercury silver fillings leak substantial amounts of mercury constantly without increases with any kind of stimulation. And as a result, mercury from fillings produces the majority of human exposure to mercury. The International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology is extremely concerned about the anecdotal claims of safety by manufacturers and dental trade associations that are at variance with the published peer-reviewed scientific evidence to the contrary. The precautionary principle requires action once the possibility of harm exists. It does not require proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that in the case of heavy metal and the antibiotic exposure is both very impossible and unnecessary. And what you're seeing is mercury vapor coming off a 25-year-old silver amalgam filling in an extracted tooth. The background is a phosphorescent screen. The mercury vapor absorbs the fluorescent light, and you can see it as a shadow on the screen. This is mercury coming off a filling that was dipped in water that's the same temperature as the human body. This is a filling that was rubbed with a pencil eraser for just a few seconds. 

A: We're chewing.

Video: These are not small amounts of mercury. If you can see it, it's more than 1,000 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency will allow for the air that we breathe. 

A: 1,000 times every second.

Video: What about the last time you went to the dentist and they drilled on your teeth? Here is the mercury vapor every time you raise the temperature to 110 degrees with hot coffee or warm water or even chewed on it. Mercury comes off fillings every time you stimulate them, and that stimulation causes the mercury to continue to leak out of the fillings for an hour and a half at a minimum. Some people grind their teeth. Some people chew gum. The dentist might send an old gold crown to the lab to be welded. How about the personnel? They're not being given informed consent. Back in 1985, the International Academy of Oral Medicine Toxicology set out to determine the amount of mercury that was coming off fillings, and here's the graph. Showing substantial quantities of mercury were measured coming off fillings, and then we estimated the total dose. Then we began animal experiments and put radioactive fillings in sheep. Mercury accumulated in the jaw, stomach, liver, and kidney of the sheep in just 30 days. Substantial quantities of mercury spread from the fillings to every organ in that sheep's body. This should be of concern for everyone. Then we measured that the sheep's kidneys dropped in their ability by 60% to clear annular, an indication of kidney malfunction. Whole-body imaging of monkeys found exactly the same thing. Proponents of amalgam fillings claim that sheep chew too much. But what's the problem with monkeys? They have mercury in their jaw, kidneys, liver, intestine, and heart. And further research found dystrophic bacteria that were antibiotic resistant cropped up in the intestines within two weeks of receiving these mercury-leaking fillings. Further studies have found damage to the ADP ribosylation of brain neuron proteins. In response to the controversy, and at the request of the Federation of Experimental Scientists and Biologists, Drs. Fitzgerald Scheider and Murray Binley wrote an editorial, the first ever, in facet, that point by point refuted the claims of the amalgam proponents. In 1991, the World Health Organization acknowledged that the predominant source of human exposure to mercury is from your fillings. That should be of concern to anyone wanting to have healthy children, because mercury is highly damaging to fetuses.

A: Okay, that just gives you an idea. Now, the mercury that's injected. Ten years ago, the amount of mercury molecules in a vaccine was 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury. Now, in the new mercury-free, 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury. It takes 50 to 200 molecules of fat to remove one molecule of mercury safely, unless you use the cheese method. Cheese method, you can do it about 10 molecules of cheese to every one molecule of mercury. Big difference. Instead of you living with that mercury your entire life, you can maybe get rid of it in 30 years. Because it would take 100 years for you to get rid of the mercury from three vaccines, if you had to wait for the body to use 50 molecules, 50 to 200 molecules of fat for one molecule of mercury. Do you realize how much fat you'd have to eat? Do you realize how big fat you'd have to be to be able to clear it out in 100 years? Tremendous. This cheese helps remove it quickly with fewer molecules of fat, when there's concentration of minerals with that fat. And the only form you can get that in is cheese and then clay. And of course, clay, you can't eat that much. You can't eat that clay all day long without absorbing and drying out all of your mucus, the lines of your mucus membranes. Then you'd have gas all the time, you'd have tears in your intestines, you'd have sores, you'd have allergies, you'd have real problems. But the raw no salt cheese will do it quicker, very quickly and safely. So far, I've seen no ill reactions from it. Just like she says, people get sick on raw meat. I've eaten it for, what, 40 years? And I've never had diarrhea or vomit from it once. And I've eaten some pretty rotten, stinky meat. So, that is a good way to remove the toxins. To remove, to break down a lot of the plaquing in the system that forms in congested lymphatic system, remember when I talked about margarine and hydrogenated oils that are plastic, that have become plastic. 

To get those out of the body, it takes heat. It takes a minimum of 105 degrees Fahrenheit at 90 minutes to start melting that plastic to where it can pass through the pores to get to a liquid form to pass through the pores. Imagine a stick of cold butter in a glass jar, a two-cup glass jar, lid on it. You've got 100 degrees, 98.6 on the outside. How long is it going to take to heat the coolness from that butter? How long is it going to heat that space around there to start that butter slightly melting? 90 minutes. 90 minutes. Because remember, the inside of that butter is going to be letting off its coolness. So, when the temperatures meet to the point where the butter gets hot enough to where the outside will start melting, it's a full 90 minutes. It takes two hours for it to get to the point where the whole butter will melt. So, it takes time at high temperatures to get that stuff to move. Remember your lymphatics? That's why I didn't talk about it here. The lymphatic system is responsible for cleaning every toxin waste out of the body. 

Q: Do you want to have a break, Aajonus?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do you want to have a break of two hours?

A: Yeah, let me get through this one.

Q: That's right.

A: I don't need a break, but I know you guys do. Where did it go? First of all, let's just take a look at the cell. These are red and white blood cells. The disks are red blood cells, the little fat things with little sparkles on them like hairs. Those are fat cells, white blood cells. So, you can see this blood is pretty fat deficient. This is one of those low cholesterol people. Not very healthy. Anyway, that's what it looks like. And you can see inside the cells, the red blood cells, it has digestive tract. It has organelles, they call them, liver, kidney. It has everything we have. They're just different shaped than we are. And they have a lymphatic system. They have a digestive tract. They have everything like we do, just a different shape. So, it's a microcosm of what we are on the whole in a different shape. Now, the lymphatic system, this is the skin. And you've got 11 layers there and 4 layers of tissue. You've got 3 layers in the fat. You've got 4 layers in the subcutaneous tissue. And then you've got 3 layers of actual skin here. But that's basically the whole skin. This is muscle fiber here. And this is connective tissue all in through here with fat, all in that layer. And the lymph system has a lot to do with the fat as it processes through nodes and glands. This is male, female, female. And you see it shows just like a circulatory system, like the blood or neurological. It goes everywhere. But you see those little nodules, those are glands. It even has smaller ones, thousands of them, all over the body. They're called nodes. They're even smaller. They can be as small as a BB or as large as a pellet. These glands can be as large as this. You know when you have a swollen gland in the breast or in the neck, you know how large those glands can get. What they do is they take the wastes, the localized wastes, and they'll take that fluid and they'll neutralize it with nutrients that we absorb to the intestines. And it'll neutralize those poisons, send the poisons under the skin to be perspired out of the skin. You can tell how much you're not getting rid of by touching your skin. You can see I have very little under my skin. My skin is right on top of my muscles because I get rid of mine.

If you touch it, yours is pretty good too, all over. Relax. Yours is pretty good now too. I touched you 18 months ago, most of that good. Relax. You'll see he's a lot more under there, under here, but good here. Relax. Now she's got twice as much as she should have. She's not here, it's okay. The skin here is holding her twice as much as she should have. And there are some people that hold on a tremendous amount. And you can tell by the space between the muscle and the skin how much you can hold, how much tissue you can hold. So just check yours. If it's a lot, then you need to be taking hot baths real soon. If you're skinny in that way, you're not going to have it anyway because your lymph system probably isn't working. And you're going to be sicker. And that's not a bad thing to have it under your skin, at least it's not in your cells. But if it hangs out in your connective tissue for long, there are two diseases that can develop, two main diseases. Lupus and MS. Two nasty diseases. Two that I hate to work with the most next to lung cancer. But I do work with them and I have reversed most of those cases. So you can see how they're spread all over the body. It's much more complex than that. That just gives you an idea of how it's spread. But it's everywhere, just like your capillaries are everywhere. All throughout the tissue is everywhere. So that lymph system dumps the waste under the skin to be perspired out of the skin. If you've got those plastic molecules under there, you won't perspire that. That stuff's going to lock under your skin, then go into your muscles next, then between the muscles and the bones, and you're going to be riddled with toxins. And you're just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I said you need to heat the body up to 105 degrees for 90 minutes. You need to get a hot tub. The most important health investment besides food you can get is a hot tub, where you can keep the temperature at a constant 105 degrees Fahrenheit, no hotter than 110. Saunas don't work, steam baths don't work, because they are too hot. Once the skin, mucous membranes go over 100 degrees Fahrenheit, it destroys the tissue. It damages it, scars it. So saunas, minimum of 132 degrees. That's above 110 degrees. Steam baths, 112 degrees Fahrenheit or higher. Infrared sauna is still 132 degrees Fahrenheit. Plus you have the EMF field in a sauna. In an infrared sauna, they use an electrical system in it. And the EMF field is over 200 milligauss. Your body cells are altered at 3 milligauss. At 3 milligauss, your molecular structure of animal cells are altered negatively. And that's 200 milligauss. That's 197 milligauss over what changes the molecular structure of cells. Infrared saunas are very bad. You need a hot tub to keep the temperature below 110 degrees Fahrenheit.

Q: You can't sit in the sauna less?

A: Pardon?

Q: The saunas don't allow you to sit in less? That's right. You don't have the sauna so hot and you turn it down?

A: Well, you still got an air thing. I've never seen one go under 132. It doesn't matter because you've got an air pocket. Water only has an aura of one inch. When you're in a hot bath, what happens? You move an inch, you feel the heat. You're in a sauna, you can move a whole foot before you feel the heat. Because you've got a buffer space of 12 inches. In water, you only have an inch buffer of heat. So you'll stay hotter and more consistent level in water than the air pocket. Even if it's moist air in a steam bath. The steam bath is way too hot. Burn your sinuses, damage your lungs, your throat, your eyes, your ears. It's going to damage everything. Slowly and gradually. If you look at the people who do a lot of that, like in Switzerland, and the cultures that do that, you'll find that they wrinkle and age very quickly in their old age because they're drying out their mucous membranes. They look like they all grew up in some kind of an elephant race. With elephant genes. Lots of wrinkling. Okay, so how do we get those toxins that are lodged in the body out of the body? A lot of, when you cook things, you cauterize the minerals and make them crusty like plaque on the teeth. And they have a tendency to form around the cell walls. Like barnacles on a whale. And when they get so thick, it's like you have so many barnacles, you can't tell they're on the whale. Can't tell it's a whale that the barnacles are on. So, that can build up. How do we reduce that plaquing on the cell walls? There are three things that do it safely. Pineapple. But all these things have to be eaten with fat. Pineapple. Raw apple cider vinegar. And lime juice. Now the property of each one is a little different. The raw apple cider vinegar has amino acids in it that they use in chelation therapy. So they're good for getting metals out of the body. Especially if you're using it along with, you know, like a vegetable juice with coriander leaves and stalks in it. Coriander helps pull out metals. The vinegar, the raw apple cider vinegar, will chelate with those minerals, so you don't reabsorb them. 

Then you need a fat to carry it out of the body. Raw coconut cream is the best fat for removing toxins. Now a lot of what you hear is, oh, oils, oils, oils. Everybody's going for oils. Essential oils. Oils in this, oils in that. There's very little oil in nature. In plants, we have a maximum of 7% oil of the fat in any kind of a plant. Coconut is probably the highest you will find. In a coconut, a coconut is 80% fat. 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate. Exactly what we use in the citric acid cycle to make fat into energy in the body. And fat will give us 2.5 times more energy than protein or carbohydrate. Have you ever seen a skinny weightlifter? Have you ever seen a muscle-popping weightlifter? No, you see fat. You see wrestlers that are fat. You don't see lean muscle on these people because they have no energy. They have no real force and power. I remember when I used to watch Schwarzenegger work out. He would eat tremendous amounts of raw eggs and raw fat and raw meat, raw dairy. In Austria, that's normal. All the athletes eat mainly raw foods, including raw meat. So he would eat that and he would eat tremendously. He would get very fat. And then 6 weeks before he'd go exhibit, he'd stop eating the fat except for raw eggs and work out and get rid of all that fat. But he'd go from lifting 600 pounds down to 400 and 300 pounds when he got slim because he had no fat for the strength. That's why all your wrestlers are full of fat. Your weightlifters are full of fat. And when you see those wrestlers, even though it's entirely entertainment, because you can go up to one guy, hit him and throw one time and he's out. So these guys do this whole dance. They're flipping around on stages doing this whole dance and exhibit. But this is a phenomenal exhibit. These guys are flipping up in the air, hitting each other. That is phenomenal force to be able to take those blows. And it takes good fat to do that. So fat is your most important energy source. It is your most important protective source. It is the most important cleansing substance that you can have in your body. Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat.

So when your body's cleaning itself, it needs the fat to take the poisons out of the body. You can use the coriander to pull the poisons out, the heavy metals out. You can use the raw apple cider vinegar and the amino acids in it to bind with that so it doesn't attach and reabsorb. But guess what, it's going to get into the mucous membrane lining, into the mucous and be reabsorbed into the skin, into the mucous lining anyway, unless you have a fat to carry it out of the body. And that can be cheese if it's in the intestinal tract. Remember, cheese is not digestive, so it never gets into the blood to help you. It pulls things out of the blood and the neurological fluids and the lymphatic as they pass through the intestinal walls. But you need to get a fat into the blood, into the neurological fluid, and into the lymphatic fluid to bind with those poisons that are unlocked in other areas other than the digestive tract. Cilantro does, I mean, you call it, coriander does that. And then blackberries, blueberries, dark berries, any berries do that. They'll pull it out. If you have raspberries and strawberries, they're good at getting the lighter colored metals out of the body like iodine and iron. Dark berries help get rid of heavy metals like tin, aluminum, lead, mercury, things like that. So they'll pull it out. Again, you can use the vinegar to bind with it, and you can use the coconut cream to bind with it. Now where I was going to go with that coconut, remember I said it was 80% fat? Only 7% of that fat, that's 80% of the coconut, is oil, coconut oil. That means that 93% of that 80% fat is not oil. Then what is it? It's water-soluble fat that nobody talks about. It is the most important fat on this planet. It is the predominant fat on this planet. But it's destroyed at 102, 105 degrees. So the industry completely stays away from it. Because if you understood the reactions and the need for the water-soluble fats, you would never cook anything again. You wouldn't buy anything out of the grocery store in the package. You'd only be buying produce, and you wouldn't be going to any restaurant that served cooked foods. You'd only be going to raw food restaurants.

So nobody talks about water-soluble fat. But it is the most important and most prolific fat on this planet. And the coconut is riddled with it. Milk is riddled with it. How much of the fat of the cream can you make into butter? A third. So even milk, even though it's a high proportion of oil, which butter is, it's still only a third of the milk fat of the cream. Some animals, you know, that's like from jerseys. You can have some animals, like Holsteins, that'll be one-fifth, one-sixth butter out of that cream. That you'll have the butter. Very little. But when the butter, when the oil, butter comes from dairy, it's completely utilizable. When the oil comes from coconut or plants, it's very little utilizable in the human body. Can't digest it very well. We need the water-soluble fats mainly. That's why I say coconut oil is not going to do you that good. A tablespoon a day may help you detoxify certain elements out of the body. But you need coconut cream. Coconut cream is 93% water-soluble fat, 7% oil.

Q: How about young coconut juice?

A: Pardon?

Q: Young coconut juice.

A: Young coconut juice has very little fat in it. When I don't have milk when I'm in Asia, though, I get half-mature coconut. I grate the meat out of it, which is not completely hard yet, and I blend that with my coconut water. And that will substitute as milk. I need to drink just a little bit more of that. Like if I normally go through two liters of milk a day, if I'm in Asia and I'm eating the coconut milk like that that I make, I'll go through three liters a day. Not just because of the heat, because there's less nutrients that I can digest and absorb in coconut as opposed to animal product milk. There's less available in it. But it's a great substitute. I met a tribe in Philippines. The whole story of how I got to them was illegal to go and visit them, but I finally found somebody who took me. It was a one-day four-wheel drive trip, and then a day in a boat, and then a day swimming. Literally, I had to swim a mile, which is a little over a kilometer. We got to the island, and they didn't let me go into the tribe because I was the first white man allowed on that. No white men had ever been there. Only Filipino government people had been on there before. And they wouldn't let me in with the tribe, but they brought part of the tribe out to me. Lived to a 138 years old minimum. Not minimum, average, 138 years old. And they lived on two foods. Raw fish and raw coconut. The men drank the water of one coconut and ate the meat of an entire coconut. The women ate mostly half, unless they were bigger women. And none of these guys were skinny. I was expecting growing up on fish, living on fish, you're going to be skinny. Because when I eat fish, I'm hungry right away, and I lose more weight eating fish. But everybody was burly and strong. Everybody was like you. Looked like you there, you know, strong. Meat on them, muscle on them. Not skinny. And all they ate was fish and coconut. Once a week, once a month, some of them would have a green banana or a green mango. But it was not normal.

Shoots the hell out of the pyramid scheme theory of what you need to eat. You need the carbs, you need the grains, you need the milk, you need this, you need that. You need your sugar. You got to have sugar. So, that's all garbage. Two foods. Very strong. Teeth, can you imagine having teeth, dying at 138 years old, 140 years old, with all your teeth immaculate, no fillings? I only saw one person with that one tooth. She had a scar right above her lip, above the missing tooth. So that was obviously an accident. She didn't lose it because she had decay. So, you need to get rid of the idea that your children need all this various food. If you have a baby, he'll live four years on milk alone. I've been with the tribes, they'll maybe chew on some meat and they give it to the baby to suck on. But they don't give them anything other than milk. None of these kids have diseases. They all have their teeth. People live old and healthy with all their teeth. They can even chew on bones. Can you imagine being able to chew on bones? Eskimos also were able to chew on bones. Mostly the small bones, you know, birds and rabbits and stuff like that. But still, I can't chew on a freaking bone. I don't care how soft it is, unless it's burned in that chicken wing. So, detoxifying the body requires a lot of water-soluble fat. Filling the body with water-soluble fat is very important. The nervous system mainly works on water-soluble fat, not oil. You can hardly find, when you break down a brain and a nervous system, you will find absolutely not a trace of oil. It functions entirely on water-soluble fats. And only in water-soluble fats will you have the spectrum of vitamin A, the spectrum of vitamin D, all of that. In oils, you'll have one variety of vitamin D, one variety of vitamin A. Where you have the full spectrum in the water-soluble fats. Mainly in milk and coconut. That's where you find your highest amounts of water-soluble fats that we can absorb and digest.

So, to hydrate your cells, you know, like I said, water pollutes everything, because it's nutrient deficient. We have no nutrients in water. We talked about an ion bond needed to take the H2O into the cell. Would you know how many ions are in water, even heavy mineralized water? Not enough to see it. But boy, you can see the nutrients in the milk. This is 86 to 92% water. But I can certainly see all the nutrients in it. Water, you have a trace amount of minerals. What the hell does that give you? It gives you nothing. It dilutes your digestive juices, it dilutes your nutrients, it dries out the mucus lining your stomach, your throat, everything. It dehydrates your body. You need nutrients with your water. So, how do we hydrate ourselves without drinking a lot of water? There are people who don't want to drink all milk. I have a sport formula. And in 2009, the two number one high school tennis champions were on the diet, on my diet. The male and female tennis champions of 2009. Walker Kieran and Valerie Mysick. They both came to me when... Well, Walker was brought to me when he was 8 years old. He had asthma. He had asthma for the entire 8 years of his life. I put him on milkshakes to make lots of mucus, to clean out his mucus membranes. Number one high school champion 2009. 15 and a half years old. Tennis player. From asthma to a champion tennis player. Valerie Mysick, same thing. Asthma and severe skin allergies. Breaks out from anything and everything. Number one female tennis champion 2009. What did they drink while they were in competition? My sport formula. One liter of fluid. And their competition are downing a gallon and a half. Five, six liters of water. And you see them getting weaker and weaker and weaker. And my players are just out there going to town. Not drinking a bit of water in water form. But they're still getting plenty of water. But they're utilizing it 100%.

So in the sport formula you have three cups of main ingredients. And it can be five ingredients. You can have all five to make up the three cups of those ingredients. But a minimum of two of those choices. Two of those five choices. So we have tomato puree. We have watermelon puree. And when I speak of watermelon you throw away the heart. That sweet center, you get rid of it. Everything within an inch and a half of that center you don't use. Because it will cause a sugar high and a sugar low. Use all the way down to the green, that white rind. It will give your muscles what they call citrulline. What makes the muscles strong and keeps the muscle pumped with blood. So use the rind. It's also good for male and female erection dysfunctionality. It makes us get hard and stay hard. So you have, and this is all puree. So you have watermelon, you have tomato and cucumber. You peel it. You cannot digest the peel. The peel is cellulose. They say, oh but most of the vitamins are in the peel. So what? An herbivore can eat it. They can digest it. But you're not going to digest any of those vitamins. Unless you juice it. Most of it is waxed. Even organic. They allow 17% toxic substances including petroleum wax on organic foods. So, you peel away the red, white, green skin. And then throw that away. And then you juice the rest of it. Get rid of the seeds though. Seeds aren't good. Because they'll cause some ill reactions from the phytic acid.

Q: Puree.

A: Puree. You don't juice. So, you peel the cucumber. You don't have to peel the tomato. Although you're not going to digest that peel anyway. But it's so thin, it doesn't matter. It'll just pass through you. But if you have the cucumber skin pass through you, it can cause some over alkalinity in spots and prevent you from digesting your milk and meat that may come behind it and catch up with it. And you don't want that. So, then you have milk and you have whey. Those are the five choices. Whey is the runoff for making cheese. It's kind of yellowish fluid, liquid fluid. It's full of uric acid. Uric acid is good for neutralizing the uric acid which is the byproduct of metabolism. A lot of your athletes get cramps in their muscles, in their calves, in their feet when they're out there. And they're working so hard and their body is not cleaning because they're having all this freaking water. So, the lactic acid builds up into the muscle and causes charley horses. Knots in the muscles are very painful. And then they can't even, they can't stand much less play. So, they're out of the competition. So, they go into one of those muscle cramps. Maybe they can sit on the bench for a few hours if the game is still on and if they can still compete. But usually it doesn't. Sometimes they'll give them insulin injections to try to get rid of it. But in whey you have lots of lactic acid that helps convert. The lactic acid that builds up in the muscles helps convert it and get rid of it. So, it's good as a sport formula. And it's not a sport drink. A sport drink is Gatorade which is all chemical. Or, you know, any colas. Those are so-called sport formulas because they've got corn sugar and caffeine and everything will give you a fall sport high. This is nutrient bound.

So, you've got three cups of at least two of those and maximum five. You can have all five. The rest of the ingredients are lime juice, two to three tablespoons. Lemon juice, two to three teaspoons. Apple cider vinegar, one to two tablespoons. Raw apple cider vinegar. Two to four tablespoons of dairy cream. Two to four tablespoons of coconut cream. If you're a weight lifter or you're doing something incredibly strenuous, the higher amounts of fat. If you're a jogger or biker, the lower amounts of fat. One to two tablespoons of honey. Honey makes you sleepy? Leave out the honey. Means you don't need the enzymes to help you digest. Honey is a digestive aid. Only when it's heated above 93 degrees does it become a high sugar substance. When the bees collect the nectar from the flowers, they swallow it. High carbohydrate. They produce an insulin-like substance that converts that into enzymes for digestion. 90% of it. So, it's only 10% carb. When you heat it above 93 degrees, it destroys that insulin, inulin type of substance. So, it's back into pure sugar. And so, the bee, when it takes it and swallows the nectar, flies back to the hive, and they get back to the hive, it's predigested, and it vomits. That's honey. Bee vomit. When you realize what these things are, you get away from that squeamishness about everything. Ooh, fecal matter, ooh, urine, ooh, ooh, everything's bad. Vomiting is bad. Everything's bad. It isn't. It's all part of good nature as long as you're not poisoning it with some industrial chemical. Industrial chemicals cause all disease. Cooking is an industrial process. It creates 32 toxins. Can you imagine if you're isolating 80,000 toxins and using them as preservatives or as additives or as pesticides or herbicides? You're poisoning everything. You're leading yourself into disease because as these chemicals collect, they do damage in the body. They break it down. Cell, dead cells collect, debris collects, interferes with functionality. Then you have to have all these bacteria, microbes, parasites, fungus in there to eat up this dead tissue. If you don't, you're going to be impaired.

But the medical profession points at the microbes and says, see, they're eating up your cells. They're the bad guys. They're not the bad guys. The industrial chemicals are the bad guys that are doing the damage in the body and it requires the microbe janitors to go in and clean out the tissue. But they'll take a petri dish with some human cells in there, human tissue, put some salmonella in there or some coli and say, see, they eat the human cells. Well, you've got human cells out of the human body. What's the next step? Reposition, recycling. So that's what they're there to do. They're there to get rid of cells that are not in their proper environment. I don't care how long you keep a human cell or an animal cell alive in a petri dish, it's not in its natural environment. And the natural process is for bacteria to decompose it. Before antibiotics, how did your body process dead cells? Bacteria inside ate them up. Then two-thirds to four-fifths of all of the waste product of a cell could be recycled. Only one-third to one-fifth would be thrown off as waste and then some other creature would get to eat it. A bug, an insect, a worm, a dog. But we look at that and say, the bacteria is eating cells. That's what it's supposed to do. It's the cleaning process. We are so toxic, do you know how much we get to reuse? Do you know how much of a cell can be recycled? In my experiment, seven to twelve percent. And it used to be two-thirds was minimum. That's how toxic we are. One five-day round of an antibiotic will destroy one percent of the body. And on this diet, you can only recover, and this is the best diet I've ever experimented with and found that worked. This diet can help you recover two and a half percent a year. And in five days of an antibody, you can destroy one percent of the body's functions. One injection, one percent of the body. Who in their right mind is going to go take an antibiotic when you understand that? One percent of the body in five days, when it takes you a year on a strict diet like this to get two and a half percent back. That means on a ten-day cycle, you've lost two percent of your body. A year to recover. That's if you're, let's say, ninety percent on the diet. A hundred percent, you do two and a half. Think about that. What degree of health do you want?

Now, I want to be Superman, so that's why I do it a hundred percent. But I've got forces out there, like that woman, who will actually physically do me harm. When I was here three years ago and vomiting all through that workshop, what happened that year? That was 2009. In February, I went on an international radio show and talked about the swine flu hoax. I'd been to the 1977 swine flu hoax when I was 29 years old, and I was with Ida Honorof and Dr. Eleanor McBean, who were blowing the lid on this so-called swine flu epidemic, that the Rockefeller, who was the Vice President of the United States, and his pharmaceutical houses got President Ford to go on and say, see, I took the swine flu shot. He didn't. Rockefeller didn't. He knows what's in that poison. So, Ida Honorof was a consumer advocate and then syndicated on 3200 radio stations worldwide. Eleanor McBean was an M.D. in San Diego. A nobody, but a bright woman. And she said, the only way you can get swine flu is to be injected with it. We are not pigs. We don't get swine flu. So, if you've taken tissue from a swine flu, and you've taken the flu from a pig and put it in an injection, the only way you're going to get swine flu is be injected with it. So, I had all the documentation from the desk, because Ida Honorof was such a good reporter, a true journalist. She got a lot of people at that time, the journals, your newspapers, a lot of your TV stations, locals, were family owned, not owned by big conglomerates the way they are now. So, she got a lot of the small industry papers, even the major ones are still owned by big families, to observe the polling where these people were getting injections there, free, you know, government given injections, swine flu injections. 2300 people died in the first 6 weeks within 5 days after injection. 2332 to be exact. The CDC in America shows 46 people died from the swine flu shot.

So, on this radio show that was international, I let out the true number and where they could get the true facts. I got death threats for 5 weeks. So, I got out of Dodge, out of Los Angeles, Malibu, and I went to the Philippines and decided to island hop. Use my cell phone, my credit card. In this little town, Tacloban, Leyte. I wake in the middle of the night, half sitting up, got a hypodermic hanging from my arm, two thugs on either side that look like clean cut CIA guys. They were not Filipino, these were European face, you know, Caucasians. And two hypodermics on the bed and this cloth falling down my chest, down my stomach. These guys were stunned as I was. And the guy on my right grabbed the cloth, put it up over my face. I was out in a split second. Now, I've had many operations as a child, many times under anesthesia that was ether. Took 15 to 19 seconds to put me out. This had me out in a split second. So, when I woke the next morning, I thought it was a bad dream, until I moved. Every bone, every muscle was going into a knot and I was sick, I was nauseous. I had three bumps here with the pinholes in them, the red pinholes. They had injected me probably with the swine flu shot. Because I went on that radio show and revealed everything in February and I said, the only way you can get swine flu is to be injected with it. And then a famous rap group from England caught that show and did a $1 million video, rap video called, Just Say No to the Vaccine. You can still see it on the internet. Just Say No to the Vaccine. And you hear my voice come in at 13 seconds. The only way you can get swine flu is to be injected with it. You are not a pig. And it goes on, it has my voice scattered throughout it, but mine is the only voice that is talking from that viewpoint. And they have babies you see shot, arms getting chopped off. I mean, they spent a million dollars on this video. That destroyed, that's why they came after me, that destroyed that whole hoax of the swine flu H1N1. How many countries sued Bayer in Germany? Six countries for fraud, for getting them to buy hundreds of millions of dollars worth of swine flu vaccine preparedness.

Only 6 million of 267 million vaccines were used in the whole world. I was partially responsible for that. So they came after me hard. We're going to say, see, he died of swine flu and he didn't get injected, but I worked. I caught them. So I knew what to do. I was so sick, I was passing out, I was vomiting, I was in diarrhea, and I knew that I had to get ammonia. Remember the ammonia? I talked about what happens when ammonia is present. The red and white blood cells will move away from the ammonia. But ammonia attaches to chemicals, even industrial solvents. So I called the hotel and I said, I need a driver to get me to a wharf as soon as possible. And I'm passing out every 20 minutes. I stood up. I was out after 20 minutes. Sometimes less time standing or walking. And really passing out. I'd black out. I'd go to my knees quickly and then lie down there and then lie on my side and I'd be out completely, turning black. Everything was going black on my way down. So I went to the wharf and I was looking for dead shark or dead stingray, not captured in water. I needed it dead and dead for at least a day. Shark and stingray produce three times more ammonia every hour that they're dead than any other meat. So I was looking for the highest ammonia I could get. So the second wharf we went to, I found the baby stingray had been dead for two days. Ammonia was out of sight. So I didn't know I was going to, because ammonia can stop your red blood cells from absorbing oxygen. So you have to know what you're doing. You have to regulate it. So I chopped up the, you know, in between my pass out spells and, you know, vomiting spells, I was chopping up the stingray to the smallest forms that I could to eat it to absorb the ammonia so that I could arrest those poisons and get them out of my body before they damage my red blood cells and I'd be dead.

So it worked. After about five days, I had no more nausea and no more passing out spells, although I still had vomit with no nausea. I kept vomiting. Also, my skin started exploding within ten hours of the injections. I have scars that look like shrapnel went through my body. I have one scar here that's this big where the chemical was just exploding out of my skin. Not much blood, but all this seeping fluid that stunk really badly. And that's what I still had when I was in August, when I was here in Australia giving that lecture. And it went into my spine. It hit my spine that day. And I was in excruciating pain. So I was, what, two and a half hours into the workshop and couldn't finish it, but Jeff Slay and Scott Wheeler finished the workshop for me. They had seen it enough and done enough where they could finish it for me. But I was in miserable shape that day. But I didn't tell anybody about those injections for a year and a half. Why? Because too many people think, oh, you're poisoned, got to get you to the hospital if you pass out. Like that August, everybody wanted me to go to the hospital. They were threatening to physically take me to the hospital. So if I tell them I was injected with poison and stuff like this, I'd have to face it more. So I had to play it cool and deal with it. Now, how did I finally get out of that pain? I got into a hot bathtub. Within 20 minutes, all the pain went away except for the headache. What did I do? I ate more rotten fish because I knew those poisons were flowing again, and I needed the ammonia. You know, if you do it with beef, it takes about six, seven days to start creating enough ammonia to make a difference. But fish, usually within 24 hours. And if it's shark and stingray, phenomenal amount of ammonia quickly. So that's how I dealt with it. And then the next day, because I knew how to handle it, what did I do? I saw five patients for private, and I didn't even sleep the night. I slept about three hours. And I was okay because I knew what to do. I knew how to handle it.

Q: But you were in the bath a long time?

A: I was in the bath five hours, four hours. That's where I did my sleeping. So I know how to get out of the messes and the tricks. Can you imagine how healthy I'd be if I weren't attacked by people like that out there who want to do me harm? So you need to be careful about what you say, what you do, what you let people know, because they will take it in their power to take your power away because they think you're stupid if you're doing things that I tell you to do. But I'm not telling you to do anything harmful. I'm telling you only to do things healthfully that work. But the world's upside down. The world's backwards. And if you can deal with that and not worry about people having to agree with you, like I didn't care whether she agreed with me. I just wanted to inspire her to be investigative rather than attack and get some ad. When I called her an ad girl, she went nuts. She went nuts. I'm not an ad girl. I said, you're not an investigator. If you were an investigator, you'd be investigating scientifically. You'd go to the laboratory. You'd see if the meat had the same bacteria in this person's intestine. If it was somebody who died, you would look at the connection bacterially, chemically with that food and with that person's death. And then it was like she understood and then she came out with, well, people die. Well, somebody die when you're dying. And then I'd repeat the same thing over again. And she would get it for a second and then she would jump back into the same thing. You have to get the people who are so afraid to think differently, to think out of the box, to be right, you know, in a wrong world. They'd rather be wrong in a wrong world than be right in a wrong world. And you have to get over that too. You don't have to have people agree with you. You say, look, this is what I'm doing and it works. Like Kate, I couldn't move my hands. My life was ending because I couldn't take care of myself and now she's totally functional. In fact, you can't keep her down.

So it works. All you need to do is make it work for you. Be an example. Don't try to sell people on it because you'll only get hurt unless you're like me. I've been through it 46 years. So I'm not affected by people like that anymore. I used to shake and tremble and get anxious and really anxiety stricken from it. But now I just see somebody else that doesn't understand, somebody else that doesn't know, somebody else that's flailing in a toxic world. And she's not going to be helped. But maybe I've stimulated her thinking. Maybe in 10 years she'll change. For example, I had a couple. The guy who runs I paid, or I'm in contract with, that runs We Want to Live website. He was with his wife for 10 years and didn't do the diet. She got cancer before she started doing the diet. And then once she started doing the diet, her whole life changed. He was doing it for 10 years before she was. Another couple. He was a ballroom dance teacher. His wife was a librarian. Oh, that Vonderplanitz, he's really got some weird information. That guy's in outer space. My husband, he's a dance instructor, so he must be not so smart either. But he had digestive problems and suffered. He couldn't dance, he couldn't move, couldn't do anything. Got on the diet. Was on it for 10 years before his wife got very sick, also with cancer. And she was 240 pounds and 5'4". 240 pounds, 5'4". She went on the diet. In 6 weeks, she lost 100 pounds on the diet. Felt better than she had since a teenager. Took her 10 years of her intellectual library mind to come around and say, hey, my husband's been on this diet 10 years, and look at him. He's teaching dance, he does the jig, he does the two-step, he does all this stuff, and he's fast and he's good. He's getting older, and he's 85 or 86 now, and still teaches ballroom dance. She died. She died of cancer. But she got an extra 7 years. And Jim Ellingson's wife had spinal cancer, one of the worst. She lived for 8 years on the diet, who was supposed to die within weeks. She got another 8 years. She wrote two books. She did all the things that she wanted to do before she died. Because she was able to do it on the diet. The diet worked for her. But she didn't do it right and enough, and she didn't follow my advice to get rid of the cancer cells. She was listening to other people. 

To get dead cells dissolved, vinegar, lime juice, pineapple, and coconut cream. That will help your body dissolve cells if you've got so many antibiotics in your body and so many industrial toxins that you don't have the normal bacteria, fungus, or parasites to do it. Now, virus. Virus are not alive. All those images you see of virus that are now generated in the last 5 years are fiction. They're Walt Disney animation generated images. They are not photographs of anything. And it was known 60 years ago, you never gave an antibiotic for a virus because there was nothing alive. All you found was dissolved tissue. You didn't know where the solvent came from to dissolve the tissue. You couldn't blame it on bacteria and the fluids had nothing to do with bacteria nor parasites nor fungus. So they called them virus. Virus are solvents. When your body is so toxic that bacteria, fungus, parasites cannot janitorialize your body and eat up the dead cells for you or the damaged and very sick cells, your cells will generate a virus, a solvent to dissolve those dead cells. It's the same thing as cancer. But what happens when you use a microbe to eat up dead cells? You reduce it. So when parasites eat the hundred times they're waiting 24 hours, they pass 1-5% of it as waste. I want that janitor. Takes a hundred pounds of waste and makes it 1-5 pounds. I can deal with that. I want a parasite. Bacteria can eat 50 times their weight in 24 hours and reduce it down to 1-5% waste. I want that as my second choice. Fungus. They have a lot more waste and the waste product cause a lot more itching and drying. You see that in the skin when you have a fungus. It can break down toxins in your body. Giardia, all of them. All of the molds that are said are bad guys. They're not bad guys. You've got toxins that damage a massive amount of cells and you have a fungus going in there eating those dead cells. You dissolve it so you won't get cancer.

What is cancer? Cancer is the body's inability to dissolve and eliminate dead cells. So it collects them. If it's a tumor without cancer, you've got no circulation into it. You've got no blood. You've got no neurological. You've got no lymph flow into it. It is a mass of dead cells. How are you going to get rid of it? You've got no circulation into it. Your body has to eat it from the outside in. I hate benign tumors. Give me cancer any day. Because the cancer cell is your cure. The cancer cell contains a fluid which is a solvent. It can dissolve 200 dead cells. And your cancer cells are like 1 per 200 dead cells. They are asthetes. They don't need other cells, live cells near them. They can isolate themselves. But they still get circulation through the blood, the neurological flow in the lymph. Because in a malignant tumor, you have circulation into it. You can get rid of a tumor in 5 days, 5 years. But you can get rid of it. Benign tumor you have to have surgically removed. Because your body cannot dissolve it and get rid of it. I prefer cancer. What happens when you see somebody's breast melting or their flesh melting? That's the cancer cells dying, letting out that serum, trying to get rid of the tumor. Why? Because it is about to impede functionality of the body. When you have a solvent-dissolved tissue like that, it's highly accurate. And it will cause destruction to other cells. So when your body decides to get rid of a tumor, you better have all the nutrients you need so you don't dissolve all the surrounding tissue. Now when we come back, after you eat and have some fun, I'm going to show you some nasty cancer pictures so you won't be afraid of them and you understand the process.

Q: There's sugar cane juice, there's whey, there's buttermilk, there's cheese and apples. For anyone over there. Thank you.

A: I'm sorry, I don't need a break.

Q: I know, I don't either, but I think it's good for people.

[break]

A: Gabrielle's eyes right here. This was 18 months ago, the two lower ones. This is the right eye, the left eye, that's the R and the L. And then the two from yesterday are on top. And you can see the difference in 18 months. The darker the poisons are in the lower one. You can see in the sclera, the white of the eye, see how gray it is on the bottom. She has a ton of tin and aluminium in that bone marrow. Now she only did the diet 80%, and that is a remarkable change with 80% of the diet. But that's because she's got a lot of excess weight. A lot of fat there to bind with the poisons. So she was able to put those poisons somewhere as she moved them. And that cleared it from showing up in the body. Even though a lot of it is still in the body, in that fat, it's not doing harm to the body, to the cells. The iris, you can see how mucky that is. Full of industrial solvents and heavy metals. Every time you eat something from a package, it's been processed in some kind of a steel container, metal container. Those collect in your body. My eyes used to be darker than those lower ones. In fact, my eyes used to be green and brown. And as they got cleaner, they got blue. When I got those three injections, and I've got the pictures for those, my eyes went from a bright blue to a gray blue. The intestinal tract showed up that those chemicals as metal spots all throughout the intestines. Another thing that happened when they injected me is I've got to take an EMF field meter that registers EMF fields, electrical dirty energy. I put it on my mouse. Without my hand on it, it's zero. If I touch it and put the meter on it, it goes up to a four, four and a half. They injected me with some kind of radioactive nanoparticles. So now I register electrical fields. Whether it's tracking devices or what, I don't know. But they injected me with a lot of garbage and a lot of stuff to really screw me up. This kind of toxicity, it's removed with good fat and good diet. Like I say, only 80%. Look at that change. And this is Gabrielle. Don't be afraid of fat. Happy for it. Delighted in it. Pardon?

Q: If you lose the weight, if you lose the fat that's been stored in...

A: Yeah, but you need to keep enough on to hold the poisons because you start detoxing, you're going to be detoxing all the time. If you don't have enough fat to put those poisons in, they're going to go into your cells and do damage. And then they're going to show up like a lot of people when they move the poisons out of the body, out of the tissues, from the iris, you know, would they show up in the iris? Move it into the bone marrow. So they move it from the tissues into the bone marrow where there's fat. Where do we have the most fat in the body? Bone marrow and brain. Where's the most toxic spot on every body except for her? Because she has enough weight. Most of the poisons are stored in the brain. Because the brain is 60-80% fat. The bone marrow is 70-80% fat. So that's where the poisons will go if you do not have enough fat on your body. Huge difference. Okay, so now let's just give you an idea. And, you know, Gabrielle didn't know how she was doing. She did the diet 80%. She was discouraged. Maybe she was afraid, you know, what she would find. But when she saw what had happened, she was delighted. She should be delighted. Everybody should be delighted with that kind of progress. And that was only 80%. So you can imagine what will happen if she starts doing it 90%, 100%. Or even if she stays at 80%, she's going to improve. As long as she doesn't lose too much weight. Or if she loses it, she keeps putting enough on. And I never let myself get under 165. So I always have at least 12-13% body fat. Before, when I was very sick, I stayed up 27-30% body fat. I stayed his size for many, many, many years. I always felt better. I was better protected, more positive, happy. You know what they say, fat and happy? There's a lot of truth to that. You're protected. Things are easier. They're not in your nervous system. They're not in your myelin, irritating you. You're not overloaded with impulses because you have the fat to buffer all that information that goes to the brain. If you don't, you're skinny. That stuff just bombards into the brain like crazy. And then you have hyper type A people. And if they're out among you, watch out. Okay, let's get into some nasty disease.

Q: Can you turn off that light in the kitchen, please?

A: Pardon?

Q: Sorry, I'm just talking to someone else.

A: In fact, anybody want to cut the lights out in the room? You'll see better.

Q: Well, half of them, maybe.

A: Okay. We'll start off with this one. This is my finger. This is a finger that was cut off when I was 3 years old, the end of it. And they had injected it with penicillin and tetanus all around the nail. So this was, you know, 50 years later, 60 years later, I guess, 60 years later. And just watch how it comes out, out of the skin in the finger. Swelling. See, it's getting fatter and bigger. And there's white blood cells will leave your bloodstream. And you know what white blood cells do. White blood cells are phagocytes. Phago means to eat. White blood cells eat red blood cells to keep the red blood stream clean. If you had to wait for cells to break down bacterially like normal cells do, then the blood is going to be highly toxic. And you'll be transporting toxins with your oxygen all the time. And you won't be efficient, won't have much energy. And that's the story of most people anyway, nowadays. It's a caffeine or something to boost them. So the white blood cells actually leave the bloodstream to go in and eat dead cells in your body. When you eat a cooked meal, an exclusively cooked meal, you have what is called leukocytosis, where up to a third of your white blood cells will leave the bloodstream and enter your intestinal tract to eat the decayed tissue in there. Cooked dead meat cells, pasteurized animal cells. They will go in there and eat them to reduce the toxicity. When you have pus, that's 99% white blood cells. Why do you think you cat and your dogs lick it? They're not going to waste good white blood cells. You may only have 1% toxicity in there. But your white blood cells have gone there, down there, to eat all the damaged dead cells in that area. That's not the proper way to do it. We shouldn't be that unhealthy that we're robbing from our white blood, robbing our white blood cells for some other part of the body. The white blood cells belong eating dead red blood cells, not somewhere else in the body. But we're so toxic, and they have such a difficult time, that we're sending white blood cells to other areas to do it. 

Now, I learned that if the pain didn't get too bad, the white blood cells would be reabsorbed and go right back into my blood stream. The skin would peel off with a little serum. So I didn't lose my white blood cells. But I tell you, sometimes the pressure is so painful, I'll pop it and let my cat or dog or somebody else eat the white blood cells. I don't, because I don't know what's in there with them. They seem to be able to handle it better. So, what I did was, I did not pop this one. I just let it get bigger and bigger and bigger, until the skin just peeled away. Now, I went on a trip. You can see it's starting to peel away here. All dead skin. And it went all around here, this whole layer of skin, just peeled away all the way up to here. You see how bad it'll be down the last one? See how it's starting to bleed a little bit? This whole peel, that whole thing peeled off. And I didn't lose one live white blood cell. Let's get this back to the beginning. Now, this is a year after the explosion on my leg from the injections. Every year in April, I would go through a detox. It would start in April, April 15th, I got the shots. That was 2011, and I got the shots in April 2009. So, this was the third year of detox, and it always started in April, almost to the very day that I got the injections. So, this was the third time that I had detoxification from it. There was the old scar from the first time. It'll start popping out here. See how discolored it is? I had the skin scraping done, and guess what was in there? Mercury and aluminum, in heavy concentrations. Same thing as in vaccines. Same thing as in the swine flu shot. And I have those quite a few places of the body where I have the scars, I have a discoloration, a gray discoloration. Again, the mercury and the aluminum. See, these sores would just, they'd turn red and just open up with an explosion, and serum would come out. It even damaged the nail heavily. I mean, all my nails, they turned discolored and toxic, and one of them got like almost a quarter of an inch thick, and this one completely deteriorated. Now they're back to normal. But it took four years. Well, five years, or 13.

And what I would do is I couldn't do much. I stayed in the Philippines during this time, most of this seeping time for almost two months, and Thailand to make sure the heat 24 hours a day was moving these poisons out of the body. I did go to a hot springs quite a bit. I did have my hot tub, so when I was in L.A., I did use my hot tub to help remove these poisons. I would say that maybe the swelling was more painful than the actual secretion through the tissue and the sores themselves, unless I put socks and shoes on, which I really didn't do but one time, and I learned not to do that again. That was at its worst.

Q: Nothing happened to your right foot?

A: That happened the first year. This was the third year. The second year it hit both legs, in my chest and back. I mean, like I said, it looks like I hit bullet holes going through a shrapnel right to my shoulder and back, arms scarring everywhere. I used to be okay looking, now I'm just a war scar. This was after I soaked it and got all the scabs off, after I got out of the hot tub. It felt much better after that because it would relieve a lot of the swelling in the tissues, because that was more painful than the actual sores. Of course, if I put something on the sores, then of course it would have hurt more, but I didn't use a sock or anything. I just put coconut cream and butter on it. 

Q: Do you use chlorine in your hot tub?

Q: Sanitize your hot tub? How did you sanitize your hot tub?

A: Oh, I just used a sand filter. A 300-pound sand filter belongs in a swimming pool. My hot tub fit 15 people. It was a Greek 10-foot round hot tub.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, that's poisonous. It's a chemical. Sand will clean out anyway.

Q: Does it run all the time?

A: I didn't run it all the time. I'd run it an hour and a half, two hours before I got in it. I had a 1500 BTU propane heater to heat it. I would put it on an hour and a half before I'd get in. I kept it low because it was only me. I got it for a lot of people, but I lived so far out in the mountains in Malibu, nobody would come and visit me. I would only fill it maybe this deep. I would just sprawl out in it and go to sleep. It was just a big 300-pound sand filter. 15 years, it never changed the sand. It kept that water crystal clear. I let the algae grow in my hot tub, which was all concrete. It was a Greek concrete hot tub. I let the algae grow, and I would let it grow this thick. Then I would scrape it off and put it in my compost pile in the garden. Boy, did the plants just thrive with all that algae growing on it. It was very soft. It's like being on silk. You have that algae growing, and it grows like a shag rug. It's phenomenal stuff. Great. My jasmine plants used to flower three months of the year, all the way from January to March. After I started putting my algae on them, they would flower for seven months, more than doubled the flowering time.

Q: I wonder you didn't eat the algae.

A: Yeah. Algae eats metal. That's why you see algae grow on rock. They eat rock. They eat metal. They eat minerals. We don't. I'm not going to eat algae that's eating all these toxic minerals. I didn't know at the time when I had the hot tub built, and I actually helped poured it. A bunch of guys and I got together, and we poured the concrete in there. I mixed certain minerals that were isolated to color it into a slightly green color.  I didn't find out until later that's highly toxic rock. I wasn't about to eat the algae, because I didn't know how much it would release and get into me. I did drink the water, though, but it was well water, and filtered through sand. It didn't have any chlorine or anything in it. That's the beginning again. You can see how chemicals will come through the body. This next one may be a little shocker for you. This woman in her 60s had nose cancer when she came to me. They wanted to remove her entire facial structure, jaw and everything, and put a plastic prosthesis in there, fold her skin back over it. $125,000 surgery is what they wanted to do, because she had cancer of the nose. They wanted to remove everything. I'll get to the point where she first came to me. I think this is about it. She said that they told her if she didn't have the surgery, she'd be dead within a few weeks. This is what it looked like when she came to me. I said, listen, Barbara, you're only going to lose your nose. We can get it stopped by that time. The most you will lose is your nose. I don't think you should go have that whole prosthesis done. You'll probably live maybe a few weeks if you do that, because that's a major surgery. You're cutting all of the tissue away from your skin. Whether you're ever going to get flow and blood back into it will be a big risk, because you're going to put it over plastic. Your veins don't grow around plastic easily. What she did was she just put a bandage over it, and for eight years before she died, she died in her sleep very peacefully. 

Her daughters would praise me every year. Every time it was her birthday, they'd call me and say we've got another year from her. You're just keeping her calm. It's so wonderful. She hasn't even lost the whole nose yet, and it's been five, six, seven years over those years, and she didn't lose any more than half of her nose. I thought she'd lose the whole nose, but she didn't.

Q: Didn't she do the diet? Why didn't she get cured?

A: It was already dissolving in the nose. The circulation and everything in the lymphatic system wasn't working, so it was impossible to really get it to stop. When the cancer cells would die off and melt everything away, I was expecting it to take the whole nose and the bone, but it only took half of everything. This is the worst it got right here. Still, that's only half the nose. I was very happy with that. Of course, I've learned a lot more since then, too. The way she got cancer in the first place is she was a nightclub singer. We would call that theater smoke. It's not real smoke. They used to use dry ice to create the smoke. Now what they use is vaporized plastic oil. You're inhaling plastic oil. I won't go to a theater. I won't go to anywhere where they use those plastic oils. If they start using them, I'll walk out. You're breathing particleized, vaporized plastic oil. They say it's safe because it's vegetable oil. I don't care what kind of hydrogenated oil it is. Plastic is poison. So that was a lot of years of breathing in that smoke. Here's another fellow who's an entertainer. He's a singer and guitar player. You can see his video on YouTube about his primal diet experience. He's been on it many, many years. He's been on it probably about six years here. He was in a touring group that had all this vaporized smoke for three hours. He played in it. I said, Malcolm, you've got to quit that show. Bad. This popped up about three months after he quit the show. It's worse than that. He's got cancer right out of his eye. I said, the worst you can do is lose that eye. But he didn't lose anything. In fact, I just saw him two months ago. He flew out from New York to New Jersey where I was giving workshops there. That's that sore under his eye. He doesn't even have a scar there. You can barely tell there's a scar.

Q: How many years was that?

A: How many years was what?

Q: How long it's taken him?

A: He had that for a year. Yeah, that took a year.

Q: And this was done when? How long ago?

A: That was in 2005. Now, this is an ultrasound of my bladder. You see that little item there? You see that on a circle? That's a bladder stone. That's the biggest one in history. They won't even put me in Ripley's, I mean in the Guinness Book of World Records. Literally, it's the biggest bladder stone that's ever been worked on. Now, what happened was, I started having trouble urinating from the time that I can remember, probably six, seven months old. When I urinated in my diaper, it took 10, 15 minutes. I trickled. When I hit about three years old, my mother started taking me into toilets, out in stores and stuff like that. It would take me three minutes to begin my urinary stream. And it would take a full five minutes to finish. My mother had three other boys, and we were all radical. She didn't have the time, so she used to really get frustrated with me. Nobody else takes that long. Hurry up and pee. Well, I couldn't. I had the bladder stone growing then. It wasn't until, as you can see, the date on there, 2006, until it got to so big that I could not pee unless I acted like a dog. I had to actually lift my leg to pee to get the stone to move over to get the pee out. And that wasn't a problem. The penis, the end of my penis, started getting stabbing, shooting, razor sharp, needle sharp stabs and scrapes. And I couldn't understand why, because nothing was coming out of my urine that was causing it. No stones, no crystals, no nothing. So, I went to a urologist and had them do a sonogram, I wouldn't allow x-rays, and found this. And I looked at the size of that and I said, there's no way that's going to come through my penis. No way. I don't want you to cut me, so what I want you to do is put me to sleep, put a tube up there, put your laser up there and start blasting at the pieces. So, he said okay. He said it would probably take 45 minutes. That's the biggest one I've ever seen.

So he had every urologist, this was a team of urologists, he had four urologists come in and everybody agreed that they hadn't seen one that big in a medical journal or anywhere. It was huge. And normally, one stone would take 10 minutes to blast out and it would be over. It took them two hours. Why? The center of it was entirely metal. Mercury, lead, and other metals from all my vaccines. All those shots that I got over the years went into my bladder and collected like a magnet. The nurse said I'd never seen him. He was sweating. Sweating because when you have that laser blast, if you just miss by an inch, you've slit the bladder wall. And the bleeding is tremendous with the laser. So, he had to do everything precisely to make sure that he kept hitting it. And it was hard metal, so it would have a tendency to shoot off to the side, reflect like a bullet off a metal. So, he had a very hard time getting it done. He kept all of it. The whole two and a half gallons of fluid that they threw me to wash it out with the laser was black. Literally, the water was black. And I had to analyze. It was high in lead, and mercury, and aluminum. The stuff that's in vaccines, of course. Lead was in a lot of things back in those days. Inhaling it all the time from car exhausts and stuff like that. So, that had been in my bladder since I can remember. Now, this is what it looked like on the outside. This, it looks like coral. Lots of calcium, and phosphorus, magnesium, potassium. All of that surrounding it. Like a growth. Like coral growth. Once he got through that and got to the metal centers is when the trouble started. And that took him an hour and twenty minutes to blast that large, marble-sized piece of metal. So, that's what it looked like just before he started blasting it.

Q: So, would all that metal come out when they flushed it out? Or would you have thought that that was being sucked out?

A: Pardon?

Q: So, it's being sucked out as...

A: Yeah, it's being washed out as he's... He would have definitely recontaminated my body if he didn't flush it out. Definitely. Had I known what I know now, I would never... I've not developed any more stones because I know what to do. I know how to eat. But that started when I was an infant. I was a child. He said, with that metal, that hard, he said, must have had every trace of vaccine and every tin and aluminum pot your mother ever cooked in. All of it was in all of it. It wasn't all of it because I had it all over my body. That was just one area where it was collecting and doing less damage to my system. I was a very sickly child. That stuff went everywhere. My eyes were brown and green. Now they're blue. So, that shows how much toxicity stayed in. That was one way my body handled it. 

Q: What was the size of the stone? Can you remember the size of it?

A: Pardon?

Q: What was the size of the stone?

A: Oh, well, you can see right there, D3. It was about, well, you can see 170 millimeters. That's pretty big.

Q: Yeah.

A: Yeah. That was the whole, everything all together. It was like you have a square mile or a square meter. It was quite a lot. So, and I mean it took up, even though that was my bladder swollen with fluid, to be able to see what was in there so it wouldn't collapse on it. So, that was my bladder with probably a liter and a half of fluid. But that's what it said. It said 170 millimeters. That's what it said. So, it kind of went. Now, this is a case of, this was a case of, of course, breast cancer. And she came to me for help. She got very paranoid because of her husband about my process. So, I don't think it would have been that bad because it mostly formed as more of a benign tumor than a malignant tumor, which means that she just had a big breast that was hard as rock for most of her life. However, they started treating her with this salve called black salve and it started melting her skin down and it killed her. You see what it started doing? It's putting that salve on it. At least she let me document it. A lot of people do find relief with the black salve. Then it goes somewhere else. Seals it off in that one place and then goes somewhere else, usually. Now, this is a woman who took a lot of sulfur-based antibiotics for kidney and bladder infections all through her childhood. And it came right through her skin. She was about 38 years old here, I think. And it came through her skin and made a huge burn in her back. Actually put holes in her back. Now, I've seen on some kind of a magazine show in the early 70s, I think it was 60 Minutes, where they had a segment on three women who spontaneously combust in their homes with no fire. One of them had burned three-fourths of her body. One woman had burned two-thirds of her body. One woman had burned one-third of her body. So, I was delving into chemistry at that time, and I was doing some acting on a medical center and some TV shows as an actor, because I was too sick to do anything else. So, my publicity manager was the head of MGM Publicity.

So, he called the show and got telephone numbers, tried to get the telephone numbers of those women, because I was curious whether they had taken sulfa drugs, you know, as an antibiotic-based sulfa drugs, in their lifetime and how much. So, what he did was he gave them my telephone number, and they did contact me, all within about four weeks. The one who had burned three-quarters of her body had taken sulfa drugs for bladder and kidney infections for 32 years. So, what happened was that sulfa mixed with salt, sodium, and other chemicals, and it came to the skin and acted like nitroglycerin. So, it hit the oxygen and spontaneously went up in fire. The woman who burned two-thirds of her body had taken sulfa drugs for 22 years. It was wild, 32, 22, and guess what the ones one-third? 12 years, sulfa drugs, each one of them. So, right away when I saw this, when she sent me this, I said, have the tissue checked for sulfa drugs, and sure enough, cold sulfur. And it was a nasty burn, it was very painful, and what I asked her to do was put lime juice on it. Remember I talked about lime juice helps you detox. Now, lime juice is actually an antiseptic. It will coat something that is very toxic, so you don't have to waste white blood cells on it, you don't have to waste a lot of serum with that particular foreign object in your body. When I had a motorcycle accident, took all the skin off of this, all off the leg, shaved down this bone here, the elbow and the ankle bone. I put lime juice on it first, screamed a lot. A lot, because I went all the way down to the bone, muscle gone and everything. And for 30 minutes I put lime juice, little at a time, all the way down to my foot. And I had sandals on, so I took off part of my toe, little toe. And I did a lot of screaming, biting on a towel, kept putting it on until it was completely covered. Then I put a little bit of honey on top of that. Burns, same too. That burn was almost longer than the lime burn. Then I put coconut cream on that, another burn. So this went on for about 45 minutes. I had a headache after that, just from the burning. And then I put butter on some slabs of meat, thin slices of meat, put that all over the body, and all over the areas. And then put a wet t-shirt material over that, and then plastic over that, not to touch the skin anywhere. And wrapped it in ace bandages all down my leg and arm.

In 12 days all the skin was back, and not all the bone. It took about six weeks for all the bone to grow back. But in 12 days, all of the skin came back, grew back. Because that meat acted as the top skin. So the meat underneath...

Q: Didn't rot in that 12 days?

A: Well, I changed it every three days. When it got so stinky they were going to kick me out of the hotel. I changed it, and it would get very stinky. But I didn't mind it getting stinky, because I knew it was helping the healing process. The more bacteria the better. But when it got stunk so bad they were threatening to kick me out of the hotel, I had to change the meat. So, the lime juice, what happened for the next year, of course the asphalt was all in that wound, and I couldn't clean it all out. Some of it was in the muscle fiber, some of it was in veins and arteries and all kinds of stuff that was exposed. And it would come out the skin with a little bitty like wart covering over it, and I'd just pick it off. And then I'd have a little grain of asphalt, or sand, something like that. And that was the effect of the lime juice coating that, so it could come through the body without poisoning my system. Lemon juice does not do that. Lemon juice incites bacteria. It actually causes fermentation. That's why it's good to marinate foods in lemon juice, but not lime juice. Lime juice is an antiseptic, antibacterial, and a coating of foreign particles, and prevents it from doing damage to the body. So I had to put lime juice on this, some coconut cream, but mainly sour cream. Sour cream works very well with burns. And I told her not to put meat on it because she was still detoxing the sulfur. If you're detoxing, you don't want to seal that wound. You want it to finish detoxifying before you want to heal. Always remember that. If you have poisons coming out, if you smell any kind of sulfur, or it smells metallic, or it smells chemical, do not rush to heal it. Let it exude its poisons first. Put lime juice on it. Put coconut cream on it. Things that will draw the poisons out. Clay with coconut cream on it, so the clay doesn't dry. You don't want to dry something like that out.

Q: So this was the sulfur as well?

A: This is the same thing. This is when it was exuding the worst. You see it's actually burned a hole right in her tissue in four spots, all the way down to the muscle. The blood clots there. And it was very painful for her. She has three children to take care of. But she went through it almost every other day with me. Sent me pictures. And that says it's healing there. Now I saw her about nine months ago. She has some scarring there. Definitely some scarring. But it's no worse than my scar here.

Q: So does MSM cause that as well?

A: Pardon?

Q: Taking people who take MS, what is it? That sulfur thing that they all take.

A: That's bad. That would add to it.

Q: I mean that would cause that too?

A: Yes, that could cause that too. Now this is a little autistic girl. She lives on Antigua Island. And I've got some patients on Antigua. When they brought her to me, nine years old, this was her entire life. I need a light on. That's all she did 24 hours a day. Didn't sleep. One parent would stay up with her all night. The other would stay up, you know, with her. Her husband was a pharmacist in a chemical plant. Vaccines did this to her. This is after a year on the diet. She's still not talking. It damaged the brain that badly, that part of the brain. But she's entirely functional. You don't have to hold her up. She can feed herself. Do everything but talk. It's pretty amazing. They sent her that for Christmas that year. First year after. That was about 13 months on the diet. And this is a nasty rash. Now this is a person who took iodine. Liquid iodine. And they used to eat tons of salt. That's a combination of iodine and salt. Blowing out of skin. Burning the skin.

Q: Any form of iodine?

A: Pardon?

Q: Any form of iodine?

A: Any form of iodine. That's why they use it as an antiseptic, because it's a poison. You don't eat rock. Now this is a New Zealander with breast cancer. I said, Angie, you're only going to lose that breast. And this was after three years. We finally got it to dissolve. Finally got it to leave the skin. And she went home to New Zealand. Now see, the breast is almost gone. But we're at the end of it. She goes home to celebrate, her family panics, because they see that. And they take her to the hospital. They have it removed. She's dead nine weeks later. We went through this for seven years together. And then in just a few weeks, the whole medical profession mentality takes over her family, takes over her. And I guess a lot of people have seen this. This is a guy, three years under the medical profession, eating probably 11, 12 pounds of food a day. He just kept wasting away. Now he was still 15 pounds lighter than that. But he'd started on his diet, on my diet. That was him after six months on my diet, on the recommended diet that they gave him. He was on the diet, his version of my diet, his understanding of my diet, for about three months before he came to me. But this is six months after I put him on a diet. That's no exercise. That's just eating. His cousin is the mayor of St. Louis.

Q: A what?

A: Mayor of St. Louis. Now, this is a fellow who's about 60, 67 years old. And he's been on the diets off and on, his version, since 1978. And he went vegetarian for about nine years, with just eating a little of the raw dairy. And he's in pretty good shape. He's back on the diet almost 100%. But you see where he stores a lot of his toxicity in the neck. Remember all these glands? We have our major lymph glands in the neck, armpits, breasts, inner calves, I mean inner thighs, and all the way up in the groin area and around the kidneys. So, he was processing most of his toxins out the neck, these glands in the neck. And he was putting a lot of dead cells in there. So, he had a lot of dead tissue in his neck. So, he looked like he had an elephant neck. So, this is just to show you how the body can express toxicity. Now, I have him take a piece of pineapple one day and rub it on the neck. Next day, apple cider vinegar. The next day, coconut cream. And you can see the amount of dead cells in his neck reduced by 50 percent over a year. And that was only applying one of those once a day. And he didn't do it all the time. He probably did it 70% of the time. So, you see how much it removed from the neck, all that dead cells and that toxicity. Now, this is also a girl in Antigua Island. They brought her in a wheelchair to me. She was skin on bone, literally. She was in the chair like this. All she could do was move her lips. And the sound was so light that you had to put your ear up against her mouth to hear what she was saying. They had to take her wheelchair over, what do they call those little mounds over a doorway? Pardon? No, it was a little bump. What do they call those?

Q: Threshold.

A: A little threshold mound. About the size of my hand. When she went over that, it took three minutes to get over that and she cried and cried and cried. That's how sensitive to pain she was. What had happened to her, she was a sophomore in college. They lost her vaccine records, so they told her she had to get all the vaccines again. She had them all in one day. And you can see all that, her skin was blacker than that, all mercury when they brought her to me. This was her about nine months after she was on the diet. That's her eating custard right there. My custard with raw eggs and papaya and stuff like that. When she was in the room with me, I couldn't talk with her. She could barely look and see me. I got her mother and aunt, both of them, to take care of her. Take the kefir that I made from my own expectoration, which I talk about. If you want bacteria that's right for you, you put about a tablespoon of your saliva in a liter of milk and let that bacteria, your bacteria, digest it and make it into a kefir. So, I gave her my kefir from my spit. She ate a half a cup of it. That was the most she had been able to eat in two years. And then she ate a half a cup of it, then she ate a whole cup of it and ate a cup and a half. She smiled and her mother said she smiled for the first time in three years after that. So, then the change came. She's actually able to feed herself. She's able to talk. She doesn't walk much because her legs just never rebuild right. And she can't get all the food. She eats about, the diet, about 30% only. So, that progress in only 30%. She lives in Antigua where there are no cows, no farms. So, they have to buy food and ship it from the mainland United States. So, that doesn't happen very often. So, she does the best she can. That's pretty good.

I have a picture of her when they showed her to me naked, but she won't let me share it with anybody. It's just frightening if you saw it. Now, this is a fellow. See that tumor in his face, chin? I was expecting to find some normal industrial toxin like vaccines up there in his throat. It kept growing and growing. I couldn't stop it. He couldn't stop it. He did the 100% diet. Of course, I don't know what I did... I didn't know then what I do know now. But I wasn't able to stop it. So, finally it got so big that it cut off his ability to swallow and breathe. So, we had to have it removed. So, it took me three weeks to talk his surgeon. The surgeon wanted to take all of the skin off, all of the bone, all of the lymph glands. I said, wait a minute. You take all of that away, the body has to heal more. The body has to do all this kind of stuff. I said, the lymph glands clean the body. You're always going to find cancer in lymph glands. 99% of the time that you say there's lymphatic cancer, it's not lymphatic cancer. The lymph are responsible for breaking down dead cells. So, you're going to find cancer cells there. And you're going to find a lot of tissue in the lymph glands. That doesn't mean you have lymphatic cancer. So, why would you want to take the lymph glands away unless you knew they were truly cancerous? Because you've got no way to clean the body. What's he going to do? End up having a tumor in his breast? It would be better that it regrows there if it regrows. So, finally the surgeon agreed with me and did that. So, he removed it. There it is growing back. That's the second time. You see the scar where it had been removed? See how it grew back? Breaking every vessel because of that surgery. But, no choice. See the scar there? It started breaking through. Now, I'll show you the actual tumor. There it is. Cut out. They did cut out a little bit of the skin. Which I didn't want him to do, but he did it. There it is. Scraped the skin away completely.

Now, you look at that and you say, Oh, that's pretty bad. You've got lots of fat cells in there. Binding with poisons. What are those poisons? Had it analyzed and it came back with kerosene and minerals. Where do you get kerosene and minerals? Supplements. He took 80 supplements a day for 60 years. Supplements are all made toxically. I don't care who produces them. Standard process, it doesn't matter. When you take a food and you extract something with it, how do you get it into a form that you can extract elements from it? You have to get it into a liquid. There are only two ways the laboratories do that. Hexane, which is a gasoline derivative, and kerosene. So, how many of you would soak your food in kerosene for 72 hours until it became a liquid, rinse it for two minutes, and eat it? Nobody? Every time you take a supplement, that's what you're taking. That's from a food. All the other supplements are just chemical garbage anyway. Vitamin D, they take not even food oil, not even vegetable oil. They'll take mineral oil, they'll hydrogenate, make it into plastic, and expose it to radioactive isotopes. Well, the sun makes vitamin D by putting radiation in the fat in your skin. That's how you make vitamin D. So, if we take oil and expose it to radioactive material, we've got vitamin D. 99% of all the vitamin D is made that way. It's not even vitamin D. It's plastic oil exposed to radioactive material. Only vitamin D that is truly vitamin D is from cod liver oil. And that'll be toxic if it isn't green pastures. I helped them formulate a way to do it, and all they do is ferment. They let the fish rot, rotten fish, and then they let the, that's of the liver, and then they let the oil rise, and it's fermented, it burns, it tastes nasty, it stinks. But that's what's good. They couldn't sell it, so they started putting flavor, oil flavors in it. So, that's supposed to be where you're supposed to get concentrated vitamin D. Just eat butter. Go out in the sun, you get plenty of vitamin D. You've got more vitamin D in three ounces of meat than you will get from the sun in 20 minutes. So, we get lots of vitamin D, unless you cook the meat and you destroy the vitamin D. So, supplements are very bad. And that rock you couldn't digest, built into a tumor, all those minerals.

Q: Did that guy die?

A: Yes. Well, the second time he grew back, the surgeon would not remove just that, he wanted to remove his whole face. So, the guy went for chemotherapy, and he was dead in three weeks. Three weeks of chemotherapy. Of course, I know now what I would do differently to help him, because I didn't understand it, I didn't know it was kerosene and minerals. I would know what to do now, but I didn't know then. This is a woman with a stye, it took about two weeks for that to go away, and I've had her put lime juice on it, and pineapple. And this is a woman who cut her finger off. So, that's the wrong, that's just the beginning. She ground her finger off in a coconut juicer, bone and all. And what I did was I told her to put lime juice on it, the honey, coconut cream, butter on the meat, wrap it. And she grew back. This is eight months later, and you can just barely see any. You've got a sneak preview, you're watching it grow back. There's when it was first done. See the bone, even the bone marrow there, ground away. That's it, after about ten months, it grew back. Here it is after about five months, it's still deformed, now it isn't. You see it growing back. It grew back. 

Q: Did she leave the meat on for all that time, or just for a period of time?

A: Well, I had her put it on all the time. Up until the finger was stable. Up until, let's see, it was at that five month marker, where was it? Not there, there. She stopped putting it on there. But you can still see the nails deformed and the fingers deformed. But, and you saw the later pictures, two and four months later, you could hardly tell it. And doctors will never tell you, they'll tell you, they want you to, like with me, they wanted to take all the skin from this thigh, and this buttock, and this buttock, and graft all the skin back on from the motorcycle accident. The only reason I went to the doctors is because I was on a big heavy Harley, about a 600 pound Harley, and I split the tibia down the center, and the femur where it sits on top of the tibia broke off the top of the tibia. So I had all this splinter stuff up in that joint, and I was in excruciating pain. And it tore the one tendon off the right side of the knee all the way up to the upside, and the left inside of the knee, that tendon was ripped to the bottom. So they were knotted up there. So I thought the knee was out of place, and that was what was causing the pain. So, and I was in Thailand, went to the hospital, and I got open wounds, flesh everywhere. I just put the lime juice on, and the honey and the coconut cream, and not put the meat on yet. And because I wanted them to adjust the knee before I started putting everything on. And they wouldn't touch it. The intern was about 27, 28 years old. He would not touch it. So he called an orthopedic surgeon, took him an hour and a half to get there. The orthopedic surgeon even freaked out. He said, we're going to have to cut you all the way down, the leg from the hip down. We're going to have to take skin, we're going to have to graft it on top of everything. We're going to have to clean it, because I let them take two x-rays. So I'm not going to look at it, I'm not going to do anything unless I see it. I said two x-rays, and I get to set the x-ray machine.

So I did, set the x-ray machine, and let them take two x-rays. And you can see the split right down the entire tibia, from the knee to the ankle. Spread open in the back. They wanted to put that back together, put eight to ten pins in that. And cut, clean out, cut everything down. Open up the knee, clean out the knee. And I'd seen people bend through that kind of accident, because a lot of motorcycle riders in Asia. And there's a lot of accidents like that. And I've seen the surgeries. They've lost two or three inches of that leg from it. And there are people that go around like this. I didn't want to walk like that. So I said, I just wanted to make sure that the knee was in place. X-ray showed the knee was in place. I just had those splinters in that knee and that joint. And plus the two tendons torn to both sides, and that's what was knotted up. So I went back to the hotel and put that stuff on again with the meat on top. And every day I talked to a woman. She was a Thai, a U.S. citizen who was a Thai who owned a hotel. Talked to her into putting more chlorine in the swimming pool for five days. So I got into the pool every day, even with my bandages on and the raw meat. And I walked, you know, in the deep end where I wasn't putting really a lot of pressure on the leg. We'd just walk around for an hour. After five days, a lot of algae grew in. She said, I'm putting the chlorine back in. I said, okay. So I walked across the street to the ocean in all my crutches. And every day I walked a mile in the ocean, just high enough where I was so buoyant that I was just moving the leg. Not putting any pressure on, just moving it.

So I did that every day for six and a half weeks. And I was running and walking six and a half weeks. When I was with those people in Antigua, I ran a quarter of a mile. And that was only four months after the accident. They said I would never walk again, much less dance again, if I didn't have those bone fragments removed from the knee. It shows how much they... When I said, I'm on a good diet, he goes... And I said, just give me your card. I'll be back in six weeks if my leg starts to fall off and rot. He gave me that and he just knew he was going to see me again. He didn't see me again. This is that girl that won the tennis match. Very sensitive to everything. She was jogging. This was about probably three months ago. And hit a knot on a...it was very...it's still dark. And she hit a knot on a root from a tree. And it bruised her badly. And she doesn't...her limb system still doesn't work very well. Of course, she doesn't do the diet 100%. She probably does it maybe 60%. She's in college. So she eats a lot of crap. So when she reacts to something, when she bruises this ankle, she exudes stuff through her skin immediately without proper decomposition, without proper breakdown. So she's very low in bacteria. She's a child, she got a ton of antibiotics. So she doesn't react well. Without the bacteria, she doesn't break the toxins down even from her own dead cells and leave the skin properly. So it causes all kinds of reactions. And that's just from a bruise. Now, take a look at that bruise. Now, what is that? You see the blue area? That's red blood cells that are not in the bloodstream. They will turn black as they decay. As the bacteria inside those cells start breaking them down. Red blood cells out of the bloodstream. Then they turn green and yellow as the body dissolves them into a substance to bring them through the skin.

That's what a bruise is. A bruise is red blood cells out of the bloodstream into the tissues. You're gonna turn black and blue and yellow as you're process of getting well. That's a good thing. Now, remember I talked about supplements. Now, this is vitamin C in food. This is... And that's even with the kerosene all dissolved. Okay? Then this is making it into a pill form. Used to be nice little spongy balls but loaded with kerosene now. And this is when they make it into a supplement for you to consume. Anything like vitamin C at all? No. It's crystal. Stuff. Poisons the body. It's ascorbic acid basically. With kerosene. Lots of kerosene. Vitamin B1, same way. We can have this in a form when they get it into a pill form. Nothing like true vitamin B1.

Q: What about omega-3?

A: All of them, if they're taken from food, they have to dissolve that food and extract it. If it isn't from food, it's all chemical derivative. They've designed it from proteins and other chemical structures. They said, oh, we've created this and it's a vitamin supplement. It has nothing to do with the true thing. Now this was a Thai girl, a woman who got impetigo. She ate a lot of spicy canned foods. Thai food girl. She's been on the diet probably five years. From all of the canned foods that she ate many, many years ago, all of a sudden they came out of her face in the form of impetigo. That's a bacteria that breaks down dead facial cells or skin cells. That's a good bacteria. You just have to get through it safely. Now I said, you might scar heavily or you might not. That was after it was all over. Very little scarring. Now, I saw her. This was February 2011. I saw her in November 2012. She didn't have any scarring at all. In fact, her face was smoother than it was before she had the detox. She's about 50, I think she's 50 years old. Exuding all that stuff. Okay, I think that's enough. You guys sick enough? I'm going to give him a dietary plan. Okay, let's turn on the lights. Okay, now you know how to take care of detoxifying. You know how to look at a situation and know how to get through it. Never panic about anything. You don't have to go to a doctor and harm yourself. There are elements of food out there which can take care of everything. Like Hippocrates said, like I said to that so-called journalist out there. Hippocrates said that food be your medicine, medicine be your food. And it can heal anything and everything. Your doctors don't want healing. They don't make money when you're healthy. I'm going to give you a diet now. My suggested diet which is an average diet for anybody to eat. Now depending upon the toxicity, if I don't see you to see your irises and to see the extent of the toxicity in your body, I don't know how much cheese you should eat. So I'm not going to recommend that. I'm just going to tell you a basic diet and then you on your own feeling or come to me and I'll tell you what I suggest in particular for you. But I'm going to give you a basic one right now. Wake in the morning with a poison to eat one and a half to two tablespoons, even three tablespoons of cheese. A half a teaspoon to a whole tablespoon of butter just so you don't get too dry. That's to absorb the poisons in the body, in the stomach, in the intestines.

Q: Straight after the cheese.

A: Pardon?

Q: With the cheese.

A: With the cheese. The butter and the cheese together. Let ten minutes pass. Fifteen minutes if you've eaten a lot of cheese and butter. If you've had three tablespoons of cheese, a whole tablespoon of butter, wait fifteen minutes instead of ten. Suck a raw egg. I'll show you how to suck a raw egg. It's easier. You don't have to clean a glass. So you take an egg. There's a fatter end and there's a thinner end, a smaller end, a narrower end. Now you don't want to put two holes at both ends because why? It's going to drip all over. You're going to try to hold it, keep it. It's going to get all over everything. Your clothes, your floor, your table, wherever you are. So what you want to do is you want to fracture the fat end without making a hole. So you hit it on the side against an eye tooth. And you make it about as big as a penny, a dime. I don't know what your change is here. But a little broken area where the shell is fractured without creating a hole. So you see that fracture. Everybody see that? No hole, just a fracture. Now you've got a membrane inside here. You've got a membrane inside there which holds the yolk and the white. Okay? Then you want to put a hole at the thinner end. So you put it down on the eye tooth, you know, the canine. And you make a little happy smile. You've got a little happy smile face in there with a hole in it. Now, eating the egg white is best to eat first. You suck a little into your mouth. I'm one of those that can't. You know, my throat never expanded properly as an infant because of all the injections. So if I put a whole egg in my mouth, I'll gag. And some people can just break an egg into a glass and down it. Sylvester Stallone could put five eggs into a glass and just down it. For real, he did it. And I can't do that. So I'll suck out about a teaspoon to a tablespoon of egg white at a time.

And I mix it with my saliva until it's no longer slimy. And the egg white just tastes like slightly salty water. Tastes like less salty ocean water. I bite on my teeth, and I keep sucking the egg through my teeth. It causes saliva to mix. It takes away all that sliminess. By the time I swallow it, it's all thin, like water, like slightly salty water. I hold it down like this so I don't get the egg yolk. If I go up, I'm going to get the heavy egg yolk. So I suck it up. I really like the taste of them. I'm so used to them. Now the yolk bobbed up. But not all the egg white's out of it. So I'm going to shake it a little bit, shake it loose. Egg white loose of the yolk. And I'm going to suck it again. More of the egg white. And down to the egg yolk. Upside down and down. See what happens when the membrane is completely collapsed? It's down, it's all over here. It's completely collapsed. The membrane's completely collapsed. So I was able to get every bit of the egg yolk and egg white out. If I put a hole in this end, I'd still drink it. Because you know, you see those plastic things in baby bottles? And as it collapses and the milk comes out? It's the same principle, they're not plastic. I got every bit of the egg out of here and I'm a droplet in there. And if you break it open, nothing but the membrane. Not a bit of wetness except on the membrane itself.

Q: Like you were saying that you alone can do it in a glass, do five eggs in a glass.

A: No, you don't want to do that. You're supposed to break one egg at a time, drink the egg white, then take the egg yolk. The egg white will digest very quickly and feed the liver. The liver, when it gets the protein, will make better bile to digest all the nutrients in the egg yolk. If you have it all together, it takes maybe 45 minutes to an hour to digest one egg properly. If you do it this way, 27 to 30 minutes. If I, you know, sometimes I'll be going up here and I'll not take my breaks and I'll just go on and on. All of a sudden, I don't have enough glycogen to run my brain and I'm losing order. I'll suck an egg like this in 10 seconds, already my brain is fat. It only takes me 10 seconds to digest enough to get my brain power going again. Other people may take a minute, two minutes, three minutes after eating an egg to get your brain power going. I have students that were getting D's, C's and D's. And they always get nervous before they go into class for a test. And I say, what you do is go into the toilet and take two eggs with you. You suck one egg, you wait three or four minutes and you suck the other egg. You do the egg white first and the egg yolk. You come out of that toilet, go into that test and whiz those tests. Those kids get A's, straight A's now. It's that easy. You just need the right brain power and the egg is the only thing that will give you the absolute best brain power.

Q: If you ate the membrane, is that bad?

A: It's fine. I do it most of the time. I've got to chew it and I've got to talk. And we're getting late, so I'm not eating the membrane. But the membrane is fine. Egg shell, most people can't digest egg shell. Dogs and chickens can, but we can't, and cats of course. So, suck a few eggs in the morning, get the brain going. Make sure you've got enough brain fuel. Two, three, four eggs, depending upon the size of person you are. Then, ten, twenty minutes after that, you're going to have a choice. If you're a highly toxic person, low energy, and you feel blah and dirty inside, have a vegetable juice. If you're skinny in that way, you put an egg in it. With one teaspoon of cream, up to one tablespoon of cream. Depending upon your size, the amount of juice. Depending upon the amount of toxicity. Come to me, I will tell you exactly how much I think you should have. Otherwise, have anywhere from eight to sixteen ounces. If you have the juice at that time, if you feel that way, you're going to have to wait an hour and twenty minutes or so to have your meat meal. If you don't have the juice, you go right into the meat meal. Ten minutes after the cheese, you have your meat meal. Always have butter with your meat meal. Ninety percent of the time. You can have sour cream, do not have fresh cream with your meat. It will coat it, pearlize it, and you'll digest half of it. Big waste of meat. Expensive. So, you can have sour cream with it. Sour cream won't interfere. Sour cream is pre-digested. The most difficult fat to digest is cream, raw cream. Best to eat it with something that digests quickly, like milk and eggs. Like in milkshakes.

Q: Even if it's cultured?

A: No, I say if it's cultured, it's different. Sour cream is cultured. So, sour cream can be eaten with meat. But you don't want to have more than, let's say, five meat meals a week if you're eating fourteen meat meals a week. Two meat meals a day. So, after you have the meat, wait twenty-five minutes, have a little cube of cheese. Cube of cheese is the size of a sugar cube, which is a half a teaspoon. I'm just going to say a cube. And that means a half a teaspoon the size of a sugar cube. Ten minutes after that, you have one and a half to three tablespoons of cheese with two and a half to three teaspoons of honey. Very small amount of honey. You can even be less honey than that. But at least one third the amount of honey to the amount of cheese. Remember, there are three teaspoons to a tablespoon. So, no more honey than one teaspoon of honey per tablespoon of cheese. I usually eat half that. Now, that cheese when you're eating it with honey, remember like I said, if you eat honey with cheese, you're going to digest it. But that's a huge mineral supplement. Do you know how many minerals are in a tablespoon of cheese? All the minerals that are in a cup and a half of milk. It takes a cup and a half of milk to make one tablespoon of cheese. Think about that. Of hard, dry cheese.

Q: But we're not having hard, dry cheese. We don't have hard, dry cheese here. We have curd cheese mainly.

A: Now, the best thing to do is to make a cheese like cottage cheese and let it get very, very dry. And you can press it yourself if you want. Better not to have cultured cheese when you want to pull the poisons out of the body. The honey will take care of the pre-digestion that you would normally do with culture. You do not want to digest that cheese that you're taking to pull out the poisons. But when you have the cheese with the honey, that you want to digest. So the mineral concentration in that cheese that you digest with honey is incredible. I had a woman who had 32% osteoporosis. 32% of her bone gone. Reversed it an entire year by having her have two tablespoons of cheese with one and a half teaspoons of honey three times daily, every day for one year. Medical profession can't even change 1% of your bone density in 10 years. So, the cheese with the honey, very, very important to re-mineralize the body to make you strong. People who cannot gain weight and stay very thin, it's because they're terribly mineral deficient. I help people get fat very quickly or gain lots of muscle if they want by eating three, four tablespoons of cheese, even five at a time with a teaspoon equal to a tablespoon of honey. And they'll do that three times a day. You can gain 30, 40 pounds in two months. I can do it in one month. I can gain 40 pounds, I can gain about 18 kilos in one month. Because I know how to do it. And I can take it off as quickly too, which I don't like. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You've got to be eating with the honey and you're eating other good foods, you know. Especially if you're drinking a sport drink, you're never going to eat too much cheese. You'll just get bigger and bigger. I had a model from New Zealand who was six foot one, as skinny as skinny can be, and she loved the honey and cheese. I mean, she ate so much, she gained, what was it, 12 kilos in a month. Her agent went bananas. Didn't want to use her as a model anymore. And I said, just tell the agent there are heavier models these days. She needs to be a heavier model. It worked. She's doing okay. So, you can gain a tremendous amount of weight. It's usually mineral deficiency because you don't have enough minerals to build the muscle, even if you eat the meat. But it will go very quickly if you do. Bodybuilders, they ask me, how can I gain muscle mass fast? You eat a whole moisturizing lubrication formula, which is on page 146 of the recipe book. You eat one of those with a pound of meat twice daily, and then lots of cheese and honey 25, 30 minutes after that meat meal. I had one fellow who was skinny all the way up to 61 years old. Always wanted to be a bodybuilder. When he'd get sick, two or three weeks after working out, all the time got sick, stayed skinny. And one year, he put four inches on his arms and six inches on his chest. Worked out for one year. Hasn't worked out in eight years, and maintains all of it. That's what's great about this diet. It's a diet you don't have to exercise to maintain the good physical muscles that you can build if you want. So, the meat meal needs to be with butter, then the cheese, and then the cheese and honey afterwards. And then for the next, let's say you haven't had the vegetable juice, for two, three hours having cheese, whatever your cycle might be, whatever you think it might be, every 15 minutes, every 20 minutes, every 30 minutes, every 45 minutes, every hour. And then you sip the sport formula, or milk, or milkshake in between.

If you're thin, you have allergies, you need milkshake. You need to build the mucus. If you're thin, you need to build the body. So, milkshake is the thing to eat, not milk. You've got extra cream in it, you've got the eggs, you've got the honey. Extra nutrients in there, dense, very dense. So, you have your vegetable juice at that time. Of course, you have that teaspoon of cheese, 10 minutes after that you have your vegetable juice. Then you go back into that cycle again. Whatever it is, you sip those drinks and eat that cheese for another hour or two. Then you come to your fruit meal in the afternoon. It could be anywhere from 11 to 2, 2.30. Your fruit meal should be whatever fruit that I tell you in the recipe book applies to your symptoms. I mean in the, and we want to live in the remedy section. You've got an ailment and it tells you to eat a certain kind of fruit, that's the fruit you should eat. I talked about the berries, detoxing metal out of the body. You can take it from that approach and eat berries. You've got a spinal problem, eat papaya, eat custard. You've got intestinal problems, don't digest well, papaya, pineapple. You eat, let's say if you're a small person, you don't want high sugar. So, let's say half to three quarters of a cup of berries or fruit. Or fruits or berries. But your fruit, let's say half to three quarters of a cup. If you're a larger person, anywhere from a cup to a cup and a half of fruit. Then anywhere from two to four tablespoons of coconut cream. This is your detox meal. Fruit is always a detoxifier. It creates fermentation, alcohol. But what, how does alcohol work with to make, as a solvent, something to dissolve and cleanse the body? Fat. Which fat? Coconut cream is the best.

Now when you're removing poisons from the body, you need a protection from the nervous system. Raw cream is the only fat that will completely feed the nervous system. Butter won't. Coconut won't. Kefir won't. Milk won't. It has to be concentrated cream, dairy cream. So, one to two tablespoons, three tablespoons, four tablespoons, with that fruit meal. To protect the nerves from the poison that you're going to move with the fruit. As it ferments in your system. If you want to, if you're highly toxic with a lot of metals in your intestines and stomach. And you start having black bowel movements. And they stink like metal. Be sure and put one to two tablespoons of lime juice with that fruit meal. To make sure that the lime juice surrounds the metal. So if it gets back into your body, it won't do damage, it won't go into a cell. It'll stay isolated and separated. And also it'll reduce the odor coming out of your system. Very important thing. Always, because lime juice is an antibacterial and an antiseptic and an antiseptic. And we don't want that completely. Have a teaspoon of lime juice, lemon juice, with every one tablespoon of lime juice. Remember, lemon incites fermentation and bacterial growth. Lime does the opposite.

Q: Wouldn't they just cancel each other out?

A: No. I haven't found that. They complement. Your body uses one in one way and the other in the other way. So it can do both. I was afraid of that when I first started doing the experiments. But it all never worked out badly. So it's good.

Q: The lemon is for what?

A: The lemon is to incite bacterial growth, fermentation.

Q: If you have a certain problem.

A: Pardon?

Q: If you have a certain problem.

A: If you have no digestive bacteria and you've got lots of metal poisoning in your body, you need the lime juice to surround those poisons. Even if they're, let's say you were a heavy, your mother was a heavy Windex user. Windex is the most toxic home product there is. And people are inhaling that. The lime juice will surround those molecules and keep them from doing more damage. And they do heavy damage. Windex probably causes about, probably one million cancers a year. So use vinegar and water. Clean your windows. Sure, leave a film, but it'll be a happy film. Not a cancerous film. And don't use newspaper to clean it. Because what's in newspaper? You've got a chemical drier made from soy, which is highly toxic. If I get near a newspaper that's fresh, I will sneeze and get a headache. So I have to let newsprint dry for a couple of days outside before I can get near it. Of course I don't read those anymore. I do everything online. So I don't have to worry about those chemicals. So after you have your fruit meal, and if you have a lot of toxins in your body, eat a little cheese with that meal. Eat a little cheese with your meat. Just to make sure the poison doesn't dump into your food. Even a little bit, you'll have something there to absorb it. And you don't have to have a lot of cheese with that. Then after your fruit meal, you go back into the routine of eating the cheese as frequently as you need it, with sipping all the sport formula, the milk, or the milkshake. And you do that for four or five hours. Then you're up somewhere, if you get up at 6.30, 7 o'clock in the morning, this will be about 4 or 5 in the afternoon. So, if you've had the vegetable juice before your meat meal, you're going to go about three to four hours up to your fruit meal. And then beyond your fruit meal, the same up into the evening. You can have another vegetable juice if you feel you need it. If you don't, then you just go right into your second meat meal. Again, butter with it. And the butter can be in a sauce that you like better than just having butter with your meat. And like I said, there's many sauces in the recipe book. And then, after that, again, 25 minutes, you have a piece or one cube or two cubes of cheese, depending upon how toxic you might feel. 25 minutes after that, your cheese and honey again. 

Then in the evening, you go back to your cheese, whatever cycle it is, however many minutes, and you're sipping again until you go to sleep. In the middle of the night, do not go through the night without eating. After five hours, the protein level in your blood completely bottoms out. So, what happens if you don't eat? Red blood cells become cannibalistic. And they eat each other. If you sleep eight to ten hours without eating, you'll lose two to four tablespoons of red blood cells. You will wake with anemia. You wake in the morning and you say, God, I don't feel like I slept. That's anemia. Coffee is no remedy. Theobromine in chocolate is no remedy. Caffeine is no remedy. None of those drugs are a remedy for anemia. Eating is a remedy for anemia. So, you wake in the night. You eat, let's say, an egg and a couple of bounces of milk, or you have a little bit of milkshake, like a half a cup, at your bedside. Drink that. A couple of eggs. Golf ball size of meat. Eat something. Half a cup of milk. Go back to sleep. You'll wake up with more energy, more clarity, more everything. With no anemia.

Q: Do you set an alarm to do that?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do you set an alarm to do that?

A: Most people need an alarm because they're not used to it. After they get used to it, the body just wakes. And if you're a hyperactive person, now I tell by the number of activity rings in the eyes. People have anywhere from none to 14. 14 is the most I've seen. Athletes have 7 to 14. People who are physically active, construction workers, ditch diggers, farmers, all have many, many activity rings. That means you need to spend a lot of energy in activity every day. If you don't, you're going to be in anxiety. The number of rings you have in your eyes tells me how many hours of hormones you produce for physical activity. You don't spend it in activity, you get to spend it in anxiety. And we know how that good as that is for relationships. Everybody loves people in anxiety. Giving them hell. Like that poor ad woman. She was full of anxiety. She needed to run around the block five times and then come and talk to me. But she didn't do that. So when you find yourself in anxiety, you need to exercise. If you don't have the energy to exercise, you sing. 20 minutes of singing is equal to an hour on a treadmill. Why? Because they're parts of the body we don't normally use. You have to control the amount of air that passes through the throat. You have to treat that as an aperture, both your mouth and your throat, to get the right note, the right sound out. Even if you're a bad singer, you'll still try. And all of that effort takes a great amount. Anybody ever seen a skinny opera singer? Impossible. They need tremendous amounts of fat to do that. I mean, you can be Mick Jagger and have a microphone and do it. And that poor guy eats eight meals a day. But he's so active physically. While he sings, he can't put on a pound or a kilo. So, singing is a way out of your anxiety if you don't have the energy to physically do something else. If you're a bad singer, pass out earplugs. Or find a closet.

But you'll see after ten minutes of singing, you're just all of a sudden very relaxed and exhausted. Unless you're a natural singer and know how to do it. And you're used to breathing that way. Most people are not. Ten minutes of singing and they want to fall asleep. Especially if you're doing it without music. If you have music, sometimes music will drive people on to be awake and alert. But if you're trying to sing on your own, you're going to be very exhausted very quickly. And that's a good thing. Remember, if you're depressed, it is a bacterial or fat deficiency in the colon. It has nothing to do with anxiety. They don't cross over. So, you stick some good fat up your butt or eat some high meat eggs. And that will resolve that. Okay, let's get to Q&A. Yes?

Q: Going back to salt, how are the sea animals different if they're able to handle the seafood that we're eating?

A: She asked about salt. Do the sea creatures eat salt? Because they were created that way.  If we eat, you mean a salty sea creature? They filter it out. You don't find a lot of sodium concentration in them. They filter it. Even your oysters and clams, they filter it out. Even in the liquid that's inside them, they've already filtered that. It's very salty tasting, not because it's high in sodium, because it's high in a lot of minerals. Questions?

Q: David, I've got a couple. When you talk about eggs, are you referring to chicken eggs or are there other eggs that are better?

A: Any egg is fine. I don't care if it's a turtle egg, but you'll get arrested if you eat a turtle egg. So, any animal egg. Somebody gave me an oyster egg for my birthday about 2005. It was worth 50 eggs. You know, 50 eggs, it was one and three quarters quarts of liquid.

Q: You mean ostrich?

A: Ostrich. Ostrich eggs. And I was like, you know, it's an optical illusion. It's about a liter, and it was one and three quarters liters of actual egg. It took me a whole day to eat it. But it was delicious. Phenomenal.

Q: Duck eggs and goose eggs.

A: It depends on what they eat. Remember, your chickens are scavengers. They're carnivores. They're rotten meat eaters. They're bug eaters. They love rotten meat. Now, you see when they're fed grains, what do they do? They lose their feathers. They peck on each other. It's a pecking order. If you look at my farmers who do what I ask, and it's in the contract, they feed their meat scraps, crushed bone, all of the garbage. They put it on pallets, let the flies lay their maggots. The chickens get to eat the maggots. They eat the rotten meat. They eat everything. The more rotten, the better, because it's pre-digested. These chickens have the best feathers, and they don't have no pecking order, and all they do is just roam, and they're so pleasant, they'll even brush up against you like a cat. They don't peck each other. That is a healthy chicken. You feed chicken grains, and just vegetables, and they're going to be protein deficient, and eventually kill another chicken, and then they all eat that chicken. Those who have chickens know that. A chicken, when they get so malnourished, and protein deficient, they will kill another chicken, and everybody will peck on that chicken, until they've had enough protein. Pardon?

Q: Humans do that too. Not literally, but...

A: Yes. They used to do it in some places.

Q: Fertilized eggs.

A: Pardon?

Q: Fertilized eggs. 

A: Fertilized eggs really doesn't matter. When I said fertile in my book, that was because you never knew if a chicken was in a small cage like this, unless the eggs were fertile. You know if the eggs were fertile, she wasn't in a small little cage. She had to be going out and having sex with a rooster. So she wasn't in just a small cage. Now they have what is called free range, and these are called free range eggs. Free range is supposed to mean out in a farm, out in the pasture. It doesn't really mean that. Pastured eggs means that. Free range just means they're not in a small cage. So they can be in a big cage, this big, and call this free range. And it's a lie, but that's the way the government lets them lie. When they're pastured, they're actually out in the pasture in a field. Okay? Any other questions? Well, give me one more, and then I'll go down to people.

Q: What are your thoughts about managing pH, and is this diet more acidic food?

A: Well, we are an acidic system. Remember I went through the hydrochloric acid, the bile, it's all acidic. We are acidic people. I have 5.5 on my blood, my urine, and my feces, and my saliva. Doctor, when I did the doctor show, you know, what was his name, Taylor? What was his name? Oh, the good-looking, tall doctor who towers way over me. He said, oh, if you had 5.5 blood, you'd be dead. So after the show, I showed him my 5.5 test that was done at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis. And, you know, I said, you don't know anything. You're just told a lot of bullshit, and you believe it, and you've probably never been in a laboratory in your life. You know absolutely nothing. You should never say anything about anything anymore until you actually have wisdom. And so what did he do? He went on the Phil show and talked about me and how dangerous my diet was. The Dr. Phil show. He goes on the doctor show, the Dr. Phil show, to talk about my diet and how dangerous it is. How do you get away with that?

Q: Thank Dr. Oz.

A: Yeah, it's amazing what these people can get away with. So, anyway, that answers your question, right? It doesn't matter. The pH of the body will take care of it. If you feel over-acidic, you have the vegetable juice.

Q: Okay, some people say that cancer only exists in a low-oxygen and high-acid environment.

A: Look at all, 98 out of 100 people reverse their cancers on my diet. So is that true? It's bullshit. It's absolute bullshit. And when I had cancer, and I tried that alkalizing garbage, I was in pain all the time and sick all the time. So don't listen to that garbage. That's theoretical crap that doesn't have any reality. A lot of those people who do those alkalizing diets, they have a reversal rate 20 to 35% only. 98 out of 100 on this diet reverse their cancers. That speaks for it. We are an acid creature. We're not an alkaline creature. People who go on vegetarian diets usually do terribly. David Wolf. I told him nine years ago, I said, David, I said, you're just on this diet fresh. You're going to hit that wall in seven years. You don't have anything of the type that I see, of the eight people I know, who could be a successful vegetarian. You're going to hit the wall in seven years. You're going to be coming back here. You're going to be eating meat. You're going to be eating dairy. Six and a half years he started eating dairy, and two years ago he started eating raw meat. Now he's an expert on raw dairy, and tells people that all the dairy has to be fermented. If it won't, it'll give you warts all over. Most of the people don't eat fermented dairy on my diet, and they don't have warts. I mean, he just spouts out bullshit, and you wonder, where does this come from? Where does it come from? Oh, it's full of virus. Milk is full of virus. Milk is full of bacteria. Anyway, somebody else had a question.

Q: What are your thoughts on toothpaste, and nail polish, and anti-bacterial?

A: It's all poisonous, very poisonous. Better to take coconut cream with a little clay. Brush your teeth. 

Q: Whitener?

A: No, not a good thing. You can take some sparkling mineral water like Gerolsteiner, and that'll put a little whitener in it, because your natural carbonation has a peroxide effect. So it has a teeth whitening effect. So you put a little of that naturally carbonated water in there, and a little bit of the coconut cream, and a little bit of clay, brush your teeth.

Q: Or the apple cider vinegar?

A: Yes, that's an anti-bacterial, and it'll help break some plaque. But, yeah, do it once every ten days maybe. It can be a little too acidic. Pardon?

Q: Hydrogen Peroxide?

A: Not real hydrogen peroxide chemical is dangerous. Food grade is just diluted toxic hydrogen peroxide. It's a lie. They'll dilute it down to three percent and say, oh, it's very toxic at any level over three percent. All of a sudden, three percent is going to be non-toxic? It's a lie. Any amount of it is toxic. Just use the naturally sparkling mineral water. That's a natural hydrogen peroxide without any side effects. Yes?

Q: Don't animals in the wild drink a lot of water?

A: Only a few. A lot of the animals who drink eat a lot of dried food. Grain, birds eat a lot. Cows, if they're fed, you know, hay, they'll drink more water. But you take a look at the African, you know, like the Maasai, when they used to have all the herds before the 15-year drought now, and they've decimated the drought, they didn't drink water. They had to hike them 2,000 miles during the dry season to find rain so they didn't dehydrate, but they only drank water two months a year. Camels and elephants drink water like birds regularly. If you ate bark and tree like an elephant does, you'd need some water too. And elephants can drink 55 gallons of water and not drink water for four months. They've got a pouch for it. Camels, the same thing. They can eat 23, 25 gallons of water and hold it and not drink water for 30 to 45 days. They are built to drink water. They are built that way. We are not. Most animals are not. Okay? Yes?

Q: So if they don't eat [unintelligible]?

A: Iodine, yes. Tomato, tomato, I'm sorry. I didn't understand it that far away. Iodine, she asked if there's food based iodine. Absolutely, but we need very little iodine. You can get it in shellfish, oysters, clams, any fish contains a small amount of iodine, especially shellfish. And shellfish, they say, oh, it's a bottom feeder, it eats fish shit. That's what it's built to eat. Thrive and healthy. I'm not going to eat it because it eats shit, because I know that shit is healthy stuff if the animal's not toxic. So they're eating what they're supposed to and they're vibrantly healthy. I mean, look at your beautiful, what do you call those big things that look like overgrown shrimps, lobsters. I mean, take a look at the lobsters. They're gorgeous and they live on shit. They're small creatures. You know, that's pretty good.

Q: Kelp?

A: Kelp is not digestible. That's a sea vegetable. We don't even digest land plants, much less sea plants. When I did laboratory tests, when I checked feces, people who ate algaes and stuff like that, 98% of it passed without digestion. 98%. Big waste. Chlorella, I found that you could digest about 6% of it. So have, you know, a pea-sized amount if you're going to have it, and let it soak in some vegetable juice for a while. Maybe you can get something from that. Otherwise, no. Yes.

Q: Why do you ever get excited of, you know, thinking, how delicious, let's have some raw meat, how delicious. Let's have some shit, you know.

A: Well, it's, you know, we're at the state, you know, it used to be that stuff. Like I said, when I was with the Eskimos, that rotten meat smell would make them excited. They've done it a long time, all their lives, and it's exciting. They love it. I'm to the point now, I smell it, and it smells good to me. 

Q: The condiments.

A: Not the shit, but the, you know, the rotten meat and the rotten eggs still smell good to me. Sometimes the rotten eggs don't quite smell so good. But, you know, I just put a swimmer's nose clip on. A little lemon rind, you know. Crush a little lemon rind and put that there, or orange rind, or tangerine, or something like that. Think of beyond it. I don't really care about, when you've been where I've been, and for bad health, taste is the least I'm worried about. I want health. But that's why I wrote the recipe book, and did the recipe DVD, so you can enjoy these foods. I don't care about enjoying them so much. I'm into it for the health. But I've devised great ways to make this diet very enjoyable. I've got a mother of six children in Chicago, Illinois. She makes everything that I've produced in the book, plus more. And she's got all these kids that are all happy doing the diet. Because she makes it taste phenomenal. And that's just from my book. And she's learned, picked up things, and knows how to do it on her own. So, you can make, and she says it's so easy. I don't have to slave over a stove for two hours, for seven people. She just throws it together. In an hour, she can have a seven-course meal. And I've been to them. And every time I go to Chicago, she prepares these foods for me. And it's like absolute heaven. You can make them. So, you can make the diet very happy and very healthy. Get the recipe book, get the recipe DVD, and see how to do it. Very easy. I'm just lazy. I've got no time for it. Except once in a while when I get so bored, I'll make sauces. Yes?

Q: Just a couple of questions. How do you stop getting malaria when you go to countries that are very prone? And coconut cream is sometimes hard for where I am to actually get fresh coconut. Can you get coconut cream from the can? Probably not.

A: Malaria is a falsehood. Malaria is a parasite in red blood cells. We give malaria to mosquitoes, they don't give malaria to us. That is absolute garbage.

Q: Really?

A: If a mosquito bites your blood and gives the malaria worm, which is so microscopic, it's smaller than a speck on the proboscis of a mosquito. The malaria is a red blood, it's an animal cell cleanser. It's a parasite that cleans the insides of red blood cells. It does not belong in the bloodstream of a mosquito. So a mosquito cannot be a carrier of malaria. If it did, maybe it had 500 malaria's in one, the whole sucking of the blood. And remember, the mother is the only sucker. The female sucks the blood. She's ten times larger than the male. They pollinate the tiny little flowers that the bees can't get. But they need blood to feed to their larva. So when the mother sucks her blood from you, she takes it and puts it in a bubble in the water for her larva to eat. And that's what they will grow up on. If that had malaria in it, they'd be eating and digesting it. Because the malaria would be the size of a fish to them. The idea that they're going to suck in a lot of it and get a lot of them is absolutely ridiculous. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's the pharmaceutical hyping it up. What about that English guy three years ago that took malaria pills every day and died of malaria in Thailand? Hello? It's garbage. It's nonsense. It is a pharmaceutical drug plot to make money.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: All of that is bull crap. Swine flu, they're blaming pigs. How can you have swine flu unless you're a pig? How can you have bird flu unless you're a bird? Get real. Common sense.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: How do you know he was sick with what they said? That's what I mean. People buy this shit and they keep reading it. Like this poor girl out here that was the ad woman. She was spouting out the same stuff. She kept asking me the same question 15 times. And I answered it in a dozen different ways. I said, how do you know that's true? That's just what you're told. Same way the pharmaceuticals telling the doctors what is so. Nobody investigates it. I did. I investigated. I worked on it in a laboratory. All of these things. And it's all crap. People are getting sick from medications mainly. They get heavy chemicals from foods. Look at all soda pop. Soda pop is all chemical. You can't digest that. You can't assimilate that into your cells. Some of that a great deal of it is going to store and cause problems in your body. If that builds up enough, what are you going to have? You're going to have a terrible sickness. You're going to have a blood disease where your body needs malaria to clean the red blood cells.

Q: Is that what happens in third world countries when they all get malaria?

A: They're not getting malaria. That's crap. They're poisoning the people. It's like all the AIDS in Africa. Where did that come from? The U.S. government and the British government gave 126 million smallpox infested vaccines with AIDS contamination. Documented by four doctors. Leonard Cohen, I mean Leonard Horowitz was one of them. Another doctor, I forgot his name. I addressed it in my bibliography of We Want to Live. AIDS was manufactured at UCLA in 1961 as a way to incite cancer in laboratory animals so they could study cancer. That information went right to the war department. War department decided they were going to practice on undesirables. So they found out what are the undesirables? What can we do? They found that homosexuals were getting mainly homosexuals in four major cities were getting hepatitis because of the heavy drug use. So in the drug use they decided we'll go to New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. And we'll put the contamination that causes AIDS in the smallpox, I mean in the hepatitis vaccine, hepatitis B. So that created a whole epidemic. So 90% of the people who were getting the hepatitis B vaccine were homosexuals. That's why 10% who got it were not homosexual. So they gave that 126 million doses of that contaminated smallpox vaccine to all those African countries. And there's a book on it. Okay, we're going to have to end this. One more question.

Q: You were going to share a recipe for making the cheese.

A: Well, I don't have a direct recipe. You can go online and find lots of recipes to make it. But when I was making cheese for myself, all I would do is take a gallon of milk. I put three to four drops of either lemon juice for fermentation or vinegar, raw apple cider vinegar. And that I used as my starter. It would cause the curds in the way to happen maybe a day earlier. Then I made a sock out of some material, material like a t-shirt, out of an organic t-shirt. Sewed the sleeve shut, cut them off, and then sewed the bottom of it so I had a big sock. Poured that mixture into there, let a bowl underneath to catch the whey. So you can have it as a sport formula, tied that off and hung it with a bowl under it for about a day and a half. That's very dry. If you wanted cottage cheese, you'd let it strain for about maybe three or four hours. If you want to make a harder cheese to help remove poisons out of the body, you let it hang for a day and a half. Then it will be dry. And then you can just press it or leave it in chunky form. It's up to you. Yes?

Q: In Australia we have soils deficient in zinc. What's the best way for us to get rid of zinc?

A: You don't need much zinc. You need zinc when you're more poisoned. Zinc helps get rid of copper and some other things. So if you're not eating a lot of copper and you're not eating cooked foods with high copper in it, you don't need much zinc. But there's zinc in every zucchini. And summer squash is loaded with zinc for some reason. Yes?

Q: I give plasma. Am I at risk at all?

A: You have what?

Q: I give plasma. Is there any risk there?

A: It depends on the poor person receiving it.

Q: Does the body regenerate fast enough?

A: Well, if you're giving a pint of blood at a time, it will take you about 60 days to reproduce enough red and white blood cells to gain that back. It's up to you if you want to spend your nutrients doing that.

Q: We've got to get going now. No more questions. No more questions.

A: He asked about Fukushima and the radiation contamination. Certainly it's affecting mostly the United States. It's not even affecting Japan as much as the United States because the wind current blows from Fukushima, which is on the edge and the top, right over to the United States. We have 2,000 times now the concentration of radioactive material. I do not eat fish from America anymore. I eat it when I come to, you know, go to Philippines, I'll eat it all day long. That's about all I'll eat because I know it's clean there. 

Q: What about other foods that are from the U.S.? 

A: A lot of it can be contaminated. I spend the least time possible in the United States now.

Q: We've got 12 people doing it.

A: That's going to take my consults. There are 13 people.

Q: If anyone needs to go, there are some gaps. We're doing some mini consults at my place on Monday. If anyone can't stay.

A: We'll gather on Monday.

Q: We have got 12 to do, which is 10 minutes each.

A: 6 to 10 minutes.

Q: We've got some mums with babies who need to go. People who may be booked in first.

A: We're going to have to end the Q&A. 

Q: We could do more than that at the end.

A: It's going to take 2 hours to do 12 people.

Q: If we don't have all 12.

A: If some people want to come on Monday, terrific. Any more questions?

Q: One of my clients said, my wife died. [unintelligible] swine flu.

A: No, it's not swine flu. A flu, when you have a virus, you have a chemical detox. You're so contaminated that you can't use bacteria, parasites or fungus to clean dead tissue out of your body. So your body makes solvents. Each cell makes a solvent to dissolve the surrounding dead cells to be able to get rid of it. That's a flu. It's not a swine flu.

Q: Hang on, hang on. Please, we've got people who are desperate to get this done. If you've got questions, at the end when people have gone, we could do the last question.

A: I said one more.

Q: Well, you've got to stop saying one more.

A: She just had a detoxification.

Q: All right. 

Q: But she died. What would you do if someone else did it?

A: Well, she died of what? Medical?

Q: Yeah.

A: They gave her antibiotics and killed her.

Q: That's it. 

A: Okay. Yeah.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Thanks, everyone. Thank you. I need another one of these lights. Anybody wants?

[audio cut]

A: Okay. What is your name? Joe? Hi Joe. Alright. Red blood cells are very good. White blood cells are pretty good. Left ovary, there's not much of it there. The left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. The left side of the pancreas is okay. Left thyroid is good, parathyroid is fair. Tonsil area is very, very poor. The right ovary is in pretty good shape. A little protein deficient. The right adrenal gland is also a little protein deficient, but good. Right side of the pancreas, a lot of scar tissue. Probably only about 10% of this is alive, but you have plenty of pancreas over here. You only need 10% of pancreas on this diet because we don't eat much carb. Right thyroid, excellent. Parathyroid, fair. Tonsil area, very, very poor. You have, see these white splotches all over? You've got a lot of lymphatic congestion, so your system is blocked. Your vacuum bags are full. You need the hot baths. Some people can sleep with hot water bottles. I did that when I didn't have a tub. I would sleep with one hot water bottle between my calves, one between my thighs, one at each hip, one under each arm, and one at one side of the head. I covered with a down quilt. I put three beach towels under me to catch the sweat. One time I didn't, I turned my mattress moldy, and it never gets unmoldy. It stinks forever. It was a brand new custom made bed. Ruined it. Okay, you've got a lot of metals in the brain. Now what I'm reading here is inside the cells. What you see in the irises is outside the cells. So this is a little bit more important because the inside of the cell is what produces most of our energy. So I'm going to suggest that you have mostly dark berries and pineapple for your fruit meal. Half a cup of pineapple, half a cup of berries. Mostly dark berries. And then coconut cream and stuff like that. If you have it with the coconut cream and you dilute it, it will be different. But without it, you're not going to move as fast. 

If you still do the hot baths and don't do the fruit, you're still going to move faster. Can you handle tomatoes as a fruit? Then you have more of the sport formula. You can do the same thing because you have the coconut cream in it, you have the vinegar, you have a little bit of pineapple in it. You can have two ounces of pineapple in a whole liter. You don't have to taste much pineapple.

Q: Do the berries have to be organic?

A: Berries always have to be organic. So if you can't get them organic in season, get frozen organic berries. Fruit can be frozen, nothing else can. Pears are good for you, unripe pears. Green melon, ok, unripe. You do very well on milk, you don't need as much meat as most people because you have a high acidic system, higher than normal. But still, I would eat some meat to regenerate some cells. Vegetable juice, maybe 12-16 ounces a day. I'm going to say about 25% carrot, 30% celery, 25% cucumber puree, 10% coriander leaves and stalks, and 10% summer squash, zucchini or something like that. And you need to move them out, you need to dance or something. You've got a high energy level in the bottom of your body, that's good for dancing, some kind of movement, some kind of art form. Who's next? We need to move this real fast so get ready who's up next. What's your name?

Q: Wes.

A: Red blood cells are pretty good, you've got a lot of aluminium in your blood though, that is a little bit difficult for concentration. Raspberries and strawberries are good to help control that, with coconut cream and some dairy cream and cheese. A lot of metal throughout the body. Did you work with aluminium? Did your mother cook with a lot of aluminium? You just absorbed it like crazy. It's like you didn't throw off one molecule of it. Heavy metals all over in every part of your body, lymphatic congestion most everywhere, so you need those hot baths. You also have that lower movement thing where you need to keep the lower part of your body moving like dancing, doing something. Relax the thumb a little bit more. The left testicle is about 20% scar tissue, but okay. Left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Left side of the pancreas is heavily scarred, probably about 25% alive. Parathyroid is pretty good, parathyroid is okay, tonsil area is very poor. The right testy, a lot of protein deficiency. Right adrenal gland, okay, a little mushy, too much water. Right side of the pancreas, way too much water. So you're storing a lot of water on the right side of your body. Excess water, water that's water, not good water like for milk and food that's not cooked. The right side of your pancreas is probably still about 40% alive, that's plenty. Right thyroid is very good, parathyroid is very good, tonsil area is fair. You have some cells stored under the heart, almost like a tumor, like a huge wart. Shouldn't be too, it doesn't look like it's out of, you know, it doesn't look like it's growing. It doesn't look like it's impeding anything. Did you smoke? Because you have a lot of tars in the left lung, all in the esophagus, the bronchioles. In the right side, all in the bronchioles, all throughout the esophagus, all the way down to the stomach. And all over in your left kidney. And all up in your brain.

So you have smoke tars everywhere. Best way to get rid of that is to get some raw tobacco, green tobacco, not brown and aged for smoking. You juice it, you ferment it for about three, six, seven weeks. Put a little bit of lemon juice, a little bit of raw apple cider vinegar in there, it'll help to break it down. And then you take about five drops of it in one of your vegetable juices. And that'll help start clearing that out, dissolve it. So a lot of smoke tars. Vegetable juice, I recommend about 25% celery, 10% spinach, 15% coriander leaves and stalks. About 20% cucumber puree, and the rest carrot. Fruit, lots of pineapple to break down the tar. Any kind of citrus, including grapefruit. Grapefruit will probably give you a little bit more energy. Pineapple will help you clean a little bit faster, so trade off on them. And you need lots of red berries to help get rid of that tar also. We need those hot baths, hot tub. Get ready, get up here. I don't care if you are my farmer.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You also have a lot of metal, especially aluminum in your blood. Especially the blood in your brain. A ton of aluminum in your brain. Also lead, mercury, cadmium. Looks like you worked with a lot of solvents. You have some poor circulation in your torso. You need hot water bottles under your arms, at your hips, at night time to get that moving. Also it's affecting the left kidney. Poor circulation. But that's only in about a third of the kidney, but still it needs help. You have pretty good fat everywhere, the white blood cells are good. Red blood cells are still functional, but they are highly contaminated. Especially on the left side of your body. Pears, good for you. Carrot juice, good for you. Head lettuce, good for you. Iceberg lettuce is stuff they say has no value. Iceberg lettuce is the only food on the planet, besides opium, that contains opiates. If you are feeling a little down and under the weather, eat some head lettuce. Iceberg lettuce, it will help pick you up. You could use it. That aluminum is interfering with some of the brain activity. Those opiates will make it right. So grow some head cabbage, I mean head lettuce. If you have bleeding, green or white, it's called head cabbage. If you are not bleeding at your period of time, you eat red cabbage. If you want to slow it down, you eat green or white cabbage. Green and white are the same, some people call it, because it's light green, they call it green. It's really white head cabbage, not Chinese leaf cabbage. Okay, you've got that heavy lymphatic congestion all over your body. It's not necessarily in the glands, but it's in the nodes and all of the areas under your skin. So it's storing in your, see this right here? It's all probably 40% more than you're supposed to have around your elbows. That means you hold a lot of toxins around your elbows. You need the heat to move it.

Meat wise, any meat you want, it doesn't matter. If I don't say what kind of meat you need, it doesn't matter what kind of meat you eat for quite a while. If I say that you need meat, it will be within a six year period that you need to eat something other than anything that you can. If I tell you that you need to eat red or white meat, it will probably be after a six year period. If you haven't heard from me, come back in six years. Pineapple is going to help your congested lymphatics also. You need to have more red berries than dark berries, but you do need some dark berries. Did I give you a lime juice mixture? Okay, this helps remove a lot of industrial solvents and chemicals out of the body. Three ounces of lime juice, one ounce of lemon juice, a quarter teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, three to four tablespoons of coconut cream, two to three tablespoons of dairy cream. And if you're thin, you need to eat about a third of a mango with it and more of a green than too ripe of a mango. If you're thin, I mean if you're overweight or in your shape, you eat and you're not overweight. You're just fine for me. You have a kiwi. And lots of milk. We have some chairs up here. All the people who are coming next, let's gather and put you in these chairs. So we'll go very fast. So all the people who are coming next, the next one here, the next one here. We'll have four musical chairs. And these are your four musical chairs, okay? Let me have both of them. And just let them go limp now. Okay, red blood cells are okay. They're probably operating at about 25% lower than they should. So you need, I'd like you to have cheese with all of your red meat and butter. Sour cream would be okay, but I would like you to have mostly butter. The left testes is in good shape. Left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Some scar tissue there, but okay. Left side of the pancreas is about 60% scar tissue, still 40% good. The left thyroid is fair. Parathyroid, poor.

Tonsil area, very poor on the left side. The right testes is in pretty good shape. Also some scarring here, about 10%. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. A little cold, so you're mineral deficient. So you need to eat that cheese and honey together. Anybody that's cold needs to eat lots of cheese and honey together until they warm. May only take a week. I've had people just eat once cheese and then honey, like the New Zealand model. She was always cold because she was skinny. Ten minutes after she ate about a fifth of a kilo of cheese with honey in one sitting, she was never cold again. Of course, she never stopped eating the cheese and honey. The right side of the pancreas is in okay shape. Got some congestion in it. Feels like lymphatic congestion. So you need to put a hot water bottle on this left side over here at night, at least three nights a week. See all this white splotching everywhere? Lymphatic congestion. Your lymph glands, your nose, and your system is very jammed. You need those hot baths 90 minutes a day. And if you make that first 90 minutes in your sleep, nobody drowns in there. I've never heard of anybody drowning unless they had a heart attack. So you're not going to drown unless you have a heart attack in a hot tub, even if you go to sleep. And I've fallen asleep over a thousand times, and only one time did I suck some air in, but it woke me up pretty quickly. So I didn't drown. Fruit-wise, you need lots of pineapple to help remove those toxins. And all the berries will help, and papaya will be helpful for your intestines. Now you have smoke tars all over the place. Were you a smoker?

Q: Yeah.

A: So you need to do the same thing if you want to remove those tars. Those tars don't come out easily. So you need the raw green tobacco juiced, fermented, a few drops of that, five, seven drops, and at least a minimum of a 12-ounce vegetable juice. Vegetable juice I'm going to recommend will be about 30-35% carrot, about 25% celery, and 25% cucumber puree. And the rest, coriander leaves and stalks. I would say, five days a week, have the majority of your fruit with the fat as pineapple. And how tall are you?

Q: Six foot.

A: Just six foot?

Q: Slightly under.

A: Then I would say about at least three-quarters of a cup of pineapple, but with enough fat. If I see a problem with somewhere, I'll bring it out. But your heart's in good shape.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. It's amazing, I'm seeing people with pretty good red blood cells here. I usually don't find that in America. Everybody's got pretty good red blood cells. But you do have a lot of aluminum on the left side of your body. And that blood that's manufactured on that side. You have some on your left, but not the concentration that you do on your right. You have also a lot of lead, a lot of mercury, some cadmium. You also have smoke tars in your chest. Were you around a smoker?

Q: Probably when I was very young.

A: You weren't able to get rid of it, it's just plaque hardened into your tissue.

Q: Unless it was nightclub stuff.

A: Well, there you go, nightclub you're going to get a lot. What are you doing in a nightclub?

Q: When I was younger.

A: So, I mean, that's a lot of it, it's just plaque. And it's not everywhere in your chest like a normal smoker. It's right in the bronchioles and lungs. Plaques on there. And the vinegar and the sport formula also. You can have a tablespoon of vinegar with about three ounces to four ounces of milk. Once every other day, somewhere around six o'clock. You have tremendous amounts of lymphatic congestion. You see all this stuff that's sitting under there? It's not moving. You need a hot tub, you absolutely must. Not a bathtub, you need a hot tub. You can keep that temperature at a regular temperature. If you get heat prostration in a bathtub or a hot tub, you take a bowl of cold water with ice cubes floating in it and a wash rag. You take the wash rag, get it so it isn't so dripping wet, put it on top of your head, immerse your hand, your fist, not tight, open. Put your hands through your wrist in that cold water for exactly two minutes. No more, no less. That will chill your bone all the way up to your brain and you won't want to get out of that hot water. But you can be so bad that you cannot stand one more second in that hot water. Once you do that, everything will change. The brain does not like to be hot. The body loves to be hot. And putting those bones here in the water and that cold rag on top of your head will chill your brain so fast that you will want to stay in the hot water. So be sure and do that. You need to remain in that hot tub, that hot water. You've got a lot of good cells everywhere else in your body, good health. You're just not cleaning the body. Your big problem is your lymphatic system. And it's causing everything else to fall. Even more than the diet, I'm not saying that for real, but I'm saying as much as the diet, you do need a hot tub. Vegetable juice, have a third, celery a third. We'll make it 30% celery, 30% cucumber puree, and 30% carrot. And then 10% zucchini.

I just want you to stay away from the heavy metal movement with the coriander leaves and stalks until you get that stuff moving. You don't need to get metal under there and cause MS or lupus. Because that would happen if you start moving that metal detox and it's not moving out of the body. Fruits, pears, citrus, tropical fruits are okay. I do suggest that you do what I do. Even if it's very mature coconut, just grate some of it and blend it with the coconut water. You need about two cups of that a day. And your milk, once you get the lymph system moving a little bit better, the milk will be more important then. But until that gets moving, I'd like you to have two cups of that and two cups of milk a day. And all the cheese you can eat to help pull those poisons out to the intestines instead of throwing it into your skin. Pineapple is also very important for you. So have about a third of a cup daily. Either in the sport formula or with your fruit meal. And you need about two and a half tablespoons of coconut cream with your fruit meal and about one and a half tablespoons of raw cream minimum. I don't care if you get very fat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I'm good, how are you? Relax. Red blood cells are very good except for, it looks like you have some kind of bone block on the left side of your body from about here down to your bottom ribs. Could be you have some bone cancer. And remember, bone cancer is any kind of cancer, just dead cells. It's not dissolving. You eat the sport formula with vinegar in it, pineapple, you eat pineapple, you're going to dissolve those cells. Cancer is nothing to worry about. It's a good thing. It stores your dead cells that you can't dissolve until you can dissolve them. And if you go on a shit diet and eat donuts and soda, you're going to not reverse that and you're not going to dissolve those dead cells. So eat things that take care of it. A lot of lymphatic congestion everywhere, so you need that hot tub a lot.

Q: We're going to have a lot of fun.

A: Yes, but take your cold water with you because you're one person that will inhibit prostration. Anybody that's overweight has a difficult time staying in that water with that bowl of cold water with lots of ice cubes floating in it. Okay, vegetable juice. You know, you've got enough fat where you don't have all these metals in your cells, which is fabulous. You do have them on the outside, I can see it in your eyes, but you don't have a lot of metal poisoning except in the right side of your brain. So you're a metalhead. But not anymore, you're less than most people. You've got the weight, again, every time I see people who are nice and overweight, there's so much less toxicity that is interfering with functionality. This lymph system is shit though, it is really blocked. You are the most blocked that I've seen in Australia. The left testicle is a little weak and very scarred. The left adrenal gland is pretty good. The left side of the pancreas is very scarred. So you did a lot of damage before. When did you gain the weight?

Q: I've always been.

A: There's a lot of scar tissue in that pancreas. Probably only about 20% alive. But you still have the right one to look at. Right thyroid, excellent. Parathyroid, excellent. Tonsil area, poor. The right testicle is a little weaker, a little smaller than it should be. The right adrenal gland is in good shape. Right side of the pancreas, also heavy scar tissue, but still about 35% alive. So you still have enough to do this diet and not have to worry with your pancreas. Right thyroid, excellent. Parathyroid, excellent. Tonsil area, fair. You need lots of pineapple, unripe pineapple or medium ripe pineapple. Lots of coconut cream, lots of the baths. You need to make one and a half sport formulas a day. You need to eat a little bit more sport formula than you do milk. Or you could drink probably one and a half quarts of milk a day, one and a half quarts of sport formula. And do lots of perspiring in that hot tub. You can have maybe a half a cup of water a day, only an ounce at a time. And spread it out every four hours. You could use a little water, straight water. That lymphatic, your cells need a little bit more solvent reaction. So they need a little bit more water to help clean out that lymphatic congestion. Okay.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Hello. Hi Wendy. Oh, cold somebody. Cheese and honey, cheese and honey. Relax. I know it's not easy to relax. Everybody's worried about what I'm going to say. If I walk up and walk away, then you're in trouble. Relax the thumb. The left ovary is barely there. The left adrenal gland is also very, very small. The right side of the pancreas, somewhat scarred, but okay. Left thyroid, good. Parathyroid, very good. Tonsil area, very, very, very poor. The right ovary is in very good shape. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. A little bit of protein deficiency. The right side of the pancreas, heavily scarred, but still enough. You only need 10%. Were you a vegan, vegetarian at all?

Q: Very, very short period.

A: But you're not digesting your cooked meats. You've got to eat raw meat. Because you're almost like a vegetarian. This is one of those people that don't digest their meats cooked. Like Jeff Slay. All of a sudden he stopped digesting all of his cooked meats. Started just shrinking away. You're not shrinking away, but you're bloating from it. And look at all this lymphatic waste that you have under your skin. That's a lot. And it's hardening, which is terrible. So it means you've got a lot of plastic fat in there. Hot baths, hot baths, and even sleep with hot water bottles to make it work. Or you could do what I used to do. I'd sleep four to six hours in my hot tub. Melt it out as soon as possible. Okay, your lymphatic system is jammed everywhere, that's why. See all that splotching, white splotching all over? That is the second worst lymphatic system I've seen. Actually, it's worse than his because you don't have the fat he has. You must have been on a fat-free diet a long time because your intestines are like beef jerky. Very dry.

Q: Well, not intentionally, I would just eat whatever I wanted.

A: And it wasn't much fat. You didn't get into ice cream and some of those good things?

Q: Yeah, I've always eaten butter and what have you.

A: Real butter?

Q: Yeah.

A: Not assimilated at all?

Q: Well, not really until recently.

A: Okay, you've got a heavy digestion problem. It's so white, the whole hand, I can't tell that it's different from the intestines. But your intestines must really be impaired. Aged milk, kefir, but not cultured unless it's your own saliva. You need really the bacteria from the milk, not some cow's stomach. You need the bacteria that's in the milk and the bacteria from you. Leave your meat out at least 12 hours before you eat it. I mean, I leave mine out for a couple of days. I have so much energy, I sleep three and a half hours a day minimum. I mean maximum usually. Last night I slept four hours. Wow, that was amazing. Probably because I didn't get much sleep the day before because of all that salt. But I got better sleep last night. You need about a half a cup of pineapple every six days a week. On the seventh day I want you to have a custard. Two days a week I want you to have the papaya and the eggs and the butter and the honey. You put some ginger in it. Take a little bit of ginger root and grate that in there. It will even propose a little peristalsis and also make it taste better for you. Probably don't digest the butter very well. So the ginger will also help digestion of the butter. Probably do better with meat and butter together. But you need it for your intestines because they're drying out like beef jerky. That means you're not going to absorb much food. So I'd like you to live on maybe one meat meal a day only. Lots of eggs. Fourteen, sixteen eggs a day. You need to pull yourself back into health quickly. Vegetable juice. About thirty percent carrot, thirty percent celery, thirty percent cucumber puree. And you need the coriander leaves and stalks. And I would like you to have one of your eggs and that vegetable juice with only one and a half teaspoons of cream. Twelve ounces maximum. When it's cold only eight ounces. And that's all in a day.

Q: Thank you.

Q: My hands are going cold.

A: Some cheese and honey. Very cold. Okay. You have metal poisons all over. Did you grow up on a farm?

Q: No. [unintelligible]

A: Oh. How many? Let me see. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven. So you have seven. And they're huge. Huge. So you need to get those removed as soon as possible. You saw the video. One filling was giving out one thousand times the toxic dose for an hour. I mean it was for a whole day but you were getting it in an hour. So you've got six of them. Red blood cells are withstanding it though. Good red blood cells. Very low fat. Very low red white blood cell count. It's another reason you're cold. Very low in fat. Very low in minerals. Your intestines are even more turning into beef jerky than the last person. So they're all drying out and hardening. Once you do that you stop absorbing food. So you need to start diluting it. Eggs, milkshakes, pineapple in your milkshakes even though it may not taste so good. Grate a little ginger in it. A lot of people don't like the taste of milkshakes made with pineapple for some reason. For some people it makes it taste like vomit. But it helps digestion. Remember vomit is partially digested food. And so some of your food when it's aged and proper it should taste like vomit. And if I were you I would have the two tablespoons of cheese with two teaspoons of honey three times a day for at least a year. To remineralize yourself. The moisturizing lubrication form would be good for you to have every other day. Fruit, except for the pineapple. Berries, only thing I would suggest. Oh cherries, cherries when they're in season would be good. Help you remove some of that toxic iron that you have. You have a lot of toxic iron in your chest, in your lungs, in your esophagus, in your bronchioles. I know you didn't go around inhaling iron. Or maybe you did. Maybe iron was dusted around. Maybe iron was shaved around your neighborhood. Or you raised around a metal factory.

Q: Yeah, we could have been when I was younger.

A: So you were getting all that metal that was rusting, airborne. So it's in your lungs, built into your lungs. Carrot juice helps get rid of that, red berries, cherries, red meat, eggs, ginger. Well pineapple you need for your lymphatic system. Your lymphatic isn't terribly jammed, but underneath your skin you're not perspiring properly. So you need the hot baths to get that going. Now when you've just got the block under the skin, it takes a minimum of a 40 minute bath. When your lymph glands and nose are jammed in the lymph system, you need 90 minutes minimum. So you need 40 minutes minimum. Go for the whole 90 minutes. And you need the coconut cream, and you need the dairy cream, you need the butter. You just need a little bit of honey with all of that. You're a little low in digestive enzymes and digestive help. And that's only because you've just solidified and dried so much. Your digestive tract itself is going to rob the enzymes from your food and not enough to help digest the food. Okay? Oh I wanted to check your glands, sorry. I did, didn't I?

Q: Did you see any silver?

A: Relax, pardon?

Q: Did you see any silver in there?

A: Well it's pretty, pardon?

Q: Ten years.

A: You what?

Q: Ten years on colloidal. For ten years.

A: Well maybe that's what some of that metal is. Well I would say you're handling it better than most people inside the cell. I'd have to see your eyes to see how you're doing with it. If your eyes are supposed to be blue and they're very steel gray, you're storing it on the outside of your cells rather than the inside. Now not everybody does badly with colloidal silver. I've known three people that did okay with it and didn't harm. But I've known hundreds of people that had very bad reactions from long-term colloidal silver. Colloidal silver means that minerals, metals are reduced to ultra-microscopic form that enter a cell easily and can contaminate the cell. You just haven't absorbed that much in your cells. Maybe you're not really having colloidal silver because you're not getting it into your cells as much as I would expect. And you have a lot of bile all in the lower area here which can cause irritation, can cause some vaginal burning, some yeast infections, itching, dryness. Do you like the moisturizing formula, the lube formula? Have you tried it?

Q: I haven't really used it, no.

A: It's on page 146 of the recipe book. It's the butter, the lemon juice, the honey and the egg together. It tastes like lemon meringue. It would be helpful to get those intestines moistened again.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: As long as it's my shoe and not my foot, relax. Now, this gentleman, you see how thin he is. It's a hard time relaxing because he has very little fat to absorb any acids in his body. And we're acidic. If he were with the Maasai tribe, he'd be fine because they'd work him to death. And then he wouldn't be in tension. But he has a very difficult time relaxing tension all throughout his body. That is what is a problem, the biggest problem with no fat in the body. And the second big problem is the poisons enter all the cells. And you're loaded with metal poisoning. Some very intensely. Looks like you're going to get a lot of earaches with that left ear when you start cleaning. Your intestines are also turning into beef jerky. More side the left than the right. Lymphatic congestion is medium. Left testis is in okay shape. Very cold. You're very mineral deficient too. So I'd like you to eat 7 tablespoons of cheese with 5 1⁄2 teaspoons of honey. Twice daily. And then at night, 3 tablespoons of cheese with 2 teaspoons of honey. And a half a cup, well you can drink a whole cup of milk at night time with an extra tablespoon of cream in it. When you have 7 tablespoons of cheese, also following a meat meal, I suggest you have 2 tablespoons of butter with it, follow it with a half a cup of milk. Wait 5 minutes at that time. During the night, you don't have to wait 5 minutes to have the milk. Also, lubrication formulas, excellent for you. Meat doesn't matter, you need it. Eggs, as many as you can eat. You need a lot of berries. I would say 7 days a week you need dark berries to help remove that metal. Coconut cream, at least 5 tablespoons daily. How tall are you?

Q: 6'1".

A: Remember, if you pate your meat, you get to eat less. Because you can digest and absorb all of it. And it takes a lot of the load off the intestines. And you have so much dryness in your intestines, I suggest you pate all of your meat. Once in a while, if you go to a restaurant, order a steak raw, fine, eat it like that. But most of the time, puree it, grind it. The only place that you have a lot of good fat is along your left side of your back. Right side of your back, not enough. Why you decided to put it there, I don't know. And also your adrenal glands are pretty good. Everywhere else, you're very, very deficient in fat. I'd like you to have milkshakes instead of milk. Except when you have it after your cheese, that's straight milk. I'd like you to make maybe a quart and a half or a liter and a half of milkshake a day. So per liter you could do, depending upon the size of eggs, 6 to 7 eggs. Cup of raw milk, preferably if it's aged a little bit. At least, let's say, 12 hours out of the refrigerator. Preferably a day and a half out of the refrigerator. Have 2 tablespoons of honey and take a little bit of fresh ginger root. And grate enough, just to have the taste, don't make it strong. I don't want you having diarrhea or passing the food through too fast. And then put about 3 to 4 ounces of cream in that. And then make one and a half of those per day. Vegetable juice. I'm not wild about you having vegetable juice for a while. Rather you eat cucumbers, eat tomatoes. You could have the sport formula instead of juice. Don't want you to have too much vinegar. Maybe have 1 tablespoon of vinegar. Don't want you cleaning out too fast because you don't have any fat to bind with. You start pulling fats out of your body and the only place you have to afford it is your brain and back. Left side of your back. And then you weaken your back and you'll be more stiff back there and have more of a problem. So lots of moisturizing lubrication formula.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're very welcome. Hi Maria. Okay. See how clean and see how less gray there is and green in these hands? Because it's all in the fats. The poisons are in the fat. She does have some metal poisoning in the brain. Mostly mercury. She has some tars. You've been around a smoker?

Q: I smoked a bit 20 years ago.

A: There you go. Still in your system. Not as bad as if you still were smoking. I can see it. It almost looks like secondhand smoke now. But it's still there. Your lymphatic congestion is everywhere. Lymphatic glands, lymphatic nodes, lymphatic passages, veins. Even under your skin, nothing's moving. Relax. The right ovary is okay. The right adrenal gland is pretty good. The right side of the pancreas is heavily scarred. Barely working. Not even 10%. Left thyroid, very good. Parathyroid, fair. Tonsil area, very, very poor. Relax. The right ovary, some protein deficiency, but okay. The right adrenal gland is a little weak, a little protein deficient, but okay. Right side of the pancreas, much better. Probably a good 65% alive. So you still have a lot of pancreas. Like I said, we only need 10% of an alive pancreas to make this diet work, because we eat so little high carbs. Right thyroid, excellent. Parathyroid, excellent. Tonsil area, fair. Digestion is okay on the right side, not so good on the left side. Poor circulation. You need a hot water bottle at your tummy. Every night that you think of it. You're getting skinny on your left side of your body compared to the right.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's probably why you get imbalanced. You have probably two more kilos of weight on the right side of your body than you do the left. So that makes it difficult to be as coordinated.

Q: I have a very bad knee.

A: Not just that's causing it though. And you've got that extra weight on that right side. That doesn't help. So put a hot water bottle on either side of that knee. Take a towel and wrap it around the two hot water bottles. Make sure you put your hot water bottles inside a pillow case. Wrap the extra material around so you don't burn yourself. Never over 140 degrees Fahrenheit. Put it on both sides of your knee. Wrap a towel around it so it doesn't leave your knee all night. Wrap a towel around it plus inside the pillow cases. It'll stay warm for 6-7 hours. Stay above body temperature for 6-7 hours. If you don't put the towel around it, it's going to cool in 4-5 hours. You need lots of pineapple. And you need lots of coconut cream if you want to clean fast. Melons are wonderful for you, especially with whipped cream and dairy cream. 

Q: Do you mean watermelon?

A: Any melon. You know, it's pretty easy. All you need to do is drink your milk, eat your eggs, eat a little bit of meat, and eat your pineapple and take your hot baths. You're in pretty good shape. You just need to recover. Eat your cheese, too, though. You could do a pretty simple diet. You could be mostly a dairy person. But you need that dairy. And you need at least 3 meat meals a week. That hot tub is going to be so important for you. Vegetable juice, if you want, probably sugar cane would be better.

Q: Can I ask you a quick question? I've got black salve here on this basal cell carcinoma.

A: Don't put that on it. Take pineapple, put it on it one day. Take vinegar, put it on it the next day. Put coconut cream on it the next day. And you just rotate like that.

Q: Okay.

A: Any skin cancer, any mold, even if you have, you say, liver spots, the pineapple will get rid of liver spots, get rid of freckles. Remember that freckles and liver spots are all contaminated glandular cells that have left the inside of the body. And they're not completely dead, so they can still act as skin, but they don't create, if they're liver tissue, it doesn't create bile anymore. If it's pancreas, there's no enzyme reaction, there's no insulin production, so the body just throws them out on the skin. You can reverse that pigmentation just by putting pineapple on it every couple of days. Don't put so much pineapple on it that you burn your skin. And it will burn your skin if you put too much. When you put it on, just take a little piece of pineapple, rub it on, let it dry. That's it. Once a day, once a day the pineapple, the next day, once a day the apple cider vinegar, and once a day, one day the coconut cream. If it starts burning, then put coconut cream on it. That means the pineapple and the apple cider vinegar are working too fast. They're working like cancer cells would do to dissolve the dead cells.

Q: Will that go underneath scar tissue? Because I had it there a couple of years ago.

A: And put the black salve on it and scar it over? It will help eat the scar tissue away. It will help actually remove scar tissue. So will papaya, putting papaya juice on it. But papaya juice makes your skin smell like vomit. So if you're kissing anybody, it won't be good to use papaya, just use pineapple and vinegar. Okay?

Q: Thank you so much.

A: You're welcome. Okay. Hang on. Let your hands go limp. Okay. You're storing most of your poison, metal poisons, all on the right side of your body. Red blood cells are fair on both sides, not good on both sides. White blood cells are excellent on your left side. Poor on your right side. You need a lot of fat. You don't need any raw cream. You need sour cream. Not digesting raw cream. You need to make sure all of your milk is aged and made into kefir. All of your cream in your milk is soured. I don't like starters for you because you're not even using your own bacteria right now. I need you to use the bacteria from the milk, not from a cow. A cow's bacteria helps them make alkalinizing cells for their intestinal tracts. Their intestinal tracts are alkaline. Ours are acid. So it counteracts a good digestive tract to use cultured dairy products. Unless you culture them with your own spit or just the milk itself, its own bacteria. And it will. All of my kefir was in two days. Of course I had my farmer not refrigerate the milk at all. It was warm, never chilled. So it goes into kefir faster. I put it on wood, wood floor, wood tables. It goes faster. Put it on formica plastic. It's a cold energy. It won't multiply in bacteria as fast. Even on concrete, tile, it will not age quickly. The bacteria grows slowly. On wood it goes fast and better and tastes better. Was it you that I gave my kefir? Was it you that didn't like kefir and then they had a taste of mine? Who was that? Don't remember. Hated kefir. And then the one that I just let naturally ferment. She said, oh my God, this is a whole different taste. It's like the wine makers and the vinegar makers like to age everything in wood. It makes a whole difference on how the bacteria grows, the fermentation of the food. So you need lots and lots of sour cream. I'd like you to eat a cup of sour cream a day. And I'd like you to have about ten to twelve eggs a day. And you could have that in a milkshake. And you put sour cream in your milkshake. And if you make the milkshake with kefir, your own naturally made kefir, even better. You're just so bacterially deficient right now.

Q: That's why she's not digesting this egg.

A: She's not digesting much of anything. No. And honey won't help you so much. Pineapple will. Papaya won't, so I can't give you custard. I'd like you to stay on mainly eggs and your dairy and your meats and make sure they're all pate, all liquefied. But I want you to concentrate on a cup of sour cream daily and a quart of milkshake. You don't have to have all the sour cream in the milkshake. You need a cup of sour cream daily. Have some with your meat meal. And just spoon it out as you like, because sour cream is pretty tasty. And then maybe four ounces in your milkshake. Five to six eggs in that milkshake, depending upon the size of eggs. One tablespoon of honey only. A little bit of ginger to help move peristalsis, but not much ginger, because you could end up with diarrhea.

Q: So you couldn't eat honey?

A: Pardon?

Q: I think she said she can't eat honey.

A: Not much honey.

Q: No, she said she can't eat honey much.

A: I said only a little bit. One tablespoon, yeah.

Q: She hasn't been able to eat honey.

A: Yeah. Yeah, but when you have it, you need it with heavy cream and eggs. It's only one tablespoon.

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay, the left ovary is barely there. The left adrenal gland is also disordered. You're eating your own body. The left side of the pancreas is okay. Some scar tissue there. Left thyroid, excellent. Parathyroid, excellent. Tonsils are pretty good. Relax. The right ovary is okay. It's about, let's say, 50% there. The right adrenal gland is also disappearing, eating that away. The right side of your pancreas, heavily scarred. You're going to need meat down the road, but I need you to gain about 10 kilos before you start eating a lot of meat. I need a lot of fat to start binding with those poisons, because every cell in your body is full of poison. What did you do most of your life?

Q: I taught, went to boarding school.

A: Oh, so you had a lot of cleaning to do. Scrubbing floors and toilets.

Q: No, I didn't use any chemicals or anything.

A: So it was a good boarding school.

Q: Yeah, I didn't have to do that. I washed up, but that was about it.

A: Not all that Clorox and Chlorine and Windex around?

Q: No, I hated Windex. I couldn't use it. It would give me a headache, so I didn't use that. And then, no, then my teaching.

A: Before you went to a boarding school, where were you?

Q: Out in the country.

A: And around pesticides?

Q: Well, I don't know. I didn't know.

A: It looks like you were around aerial spraying pesticides.

Q: I don't think they did that back then.

A: Yeah, they've done it since 1926.

Q: When were you born?

A: In Wellington, New South Wales.

Q: No, what year?

A: 1939.

Q: They did tons of aerial spraying in New Zealand. All the time.

Q: I had a reading before from you last time. A full reading.

A: But you had more weight then.

Q: Yeah, I was.

A: Yeah. Now all the poisons are going into the cells. You don't want to eat much fruit, except for pineapple. Make sure you eat it with enough fat. So, lots of sour dairy, lots of eggs. 

Q: All right.  Okay.

A: That's easy to do. For a year.

Q: Do you want to go now?

Q: Yeah, I'd be happy to go now.

A: Okay. 

Q: You're last one, last one.

A: Okay, last one. This is it?

Q. Yep, last one.

A: Good. You need cheese and honey. A little cold here. It's like you're full of kerosene. Do you take supplements? 

Q: Not now, but I did for a time, yeah. 

A: A lot for a long time. Are you using any kind of a distilled oil? On your skin, anywhere, anything?

Q: Flaxseed oil.

A: Huh?

Q: Flaxseed oil.

A: That's not distilled. That's not distilled.

Q: No, I'm not using any.

A: So, no Young's oils, no fragrant oils, nothing like that? Essential oils.

Q: I'm sorry?

A: Distilled oils.

Q: Yeah, essential oils.

A: Okay. Yeah. You've got to stop them.

Q: Okay.

A: You're actually dissolving your cells.

Q: Okay.

A: Usually, I only see this in people who have been long-term vegetarians and using lots of distilled oils. So, your tissues are just dissolving and melting away. It means you don't have many cells alive.

Q: I was vegetarian for 10 years, and then I stopped. And I spent two years in Mount Isa, so it's fairly toxic.

A: Where?

Q: Mount Isa, mining.

A: Oh, yeah, yeah. Okay. Well, you need to get on a heavy egg and dairy and cheese diet. Not so much meat. You need meat every day, but not two meals a day. You need lots of something in there absorbing the kerosene that you have and gasoline, the hexane you have in your body, and those distilled oils, essential oils. Cheese, just dairy. Dairy and eggs and some meat. I wouldn't even go for fruit.

Q: Yeah, I find it too chilling.

A: Yeah.

Q: Makes me cough.

A: Tomatoes are okay. They're acidic. Maybe an orange once every two or three weeks would be okay. Just make sure you have it with cheese and some other fat, either avocado... An avocado would help this condition also, help your liver. Your liver is very lumpy. 

Q: Yeah. I've had problems with that since I was a teenager. I was born in China, so I had all the injections to come out to Australia.

A: Right.

Q: Okay. And I also spent some time on a cotton farm, about six months, and also I did a working holiday, and about three months in a cotton gin, so that's a lot of processing and a lot of chemicals.

A: Yeah. Yeah.

Q: And I felt the difference after that.

A: Okay. So you've got all those poisons inside. I'd like you to eat cheese at least every 20 minutes.

Q: Yep. Hard cheese, yep. Okay.

A: And eat a bunch of cheese in the morning, and you need a lot of minerals to replace, so you need two and a half tablespoons of cheese with two and a half teaspoons. You need enough honey. You need the help with honey, and you can handle it. So you need two and a half teaspoons of honey with your two and a half tablespoons of cheese three times a day.

Q: So that's the healthy cheese, the nutritional cheese with the honey?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. Because I'm no good with honey on its own, so I'm going to have to start...

A: You mash it with the cheese.

Q: Small amounts, yeah. No, no, sugar. I'm crappy with it. As soon as I get any kind of sugar, even honey sugar, I've been really dreadful, so with this it should be...

A: But when you mix it with the cheese, it's going to be entirely different.

Q: Yeah.

A: It's going to react in the cheese.

Q: Yes.

A: If you add honey and milk and something like that, you're going to have problems.

Q: Yes, I do.

A: Okay. But honey mixed with cheese and a little butter is not going to be an issue. If you want to, buffer it quickly. You can mix, let's say, one tablespoon of honey with a teaspoon of butter and then take a lot of the cheese, have it at room temperature, very warm, it gets melty, mix all that together and then cool it and chill it again. So it's already mixed.

Q: Yes.

A: The honey will never be an issue.

Q: Yes.

A: In that form. And I suggest that you eat cheese, eat about a half, a quarter of a teaspoon of cheese before every egg. Put it in your mouth, dissolve it, take it down, then start eating your egg. Either sucking it or putting it into a glass and sucking the egg right first.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Pardon?

Q: It's the hard cheese you talk about.

A: Yes, you can make it, like I said.

Q: Do you wait 10-15 minutes and then the egg?

A: Absolutely. No, when you're having the egg, I want you to do it 10 minutes before you start eating your eggs, but I also want you to have a little cheese immediately before you start eating the egg. Okay. You just have too many very toxic poisons.

Q: I was a smoker for a while. I started smoking at 13. I gave it up about 15 years ago.

A: But you were one of those people that used that tar as a fat. There are very few people that can turn that tar into a fat and utilize it beautifully. There are very few people that can do it. You are one of those, because you don't have the tar anywhere except in your gallbladder.

Q: Okay, cool.

A: And it's no big issue there. Okay? Maybe a tiny bit in your esophagus, right where the bronchiole meets the esophagus, but that's no big deal. Okay?

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: When you talk about the hard cheese, what do you think of the molten gold, which is a slightly matured and has changed in some way? Do you call that a hard cheese?

A: The what?

Q: The molten gold. 

A: Is it cultured?

Q: No, it's cultured.

A: So it's pre-digested. So you're going to re-digest your poisons.

Q: So it's no good having that?

A: Well, it's good having it to help build, not to help detoxify.

Q: So when would you take that?

A: That's where you have your honey and cheese together.

Q: With that?

A: Yeah. You could have it with the honey. Yeah. And that'll be very fast and good.

Q: Okay. I was just trying to clear it again.

A: Yeah, to rebuild your bones.

Q: You have the camembert, molten gold, but when you're having it on its own, you have the curd cheese that we've dried out even more to make it firmer and stronger because it's really quite a moist one otherwise. I was putting it on tea towels. When we get that curd, tipping it onto tea towels and then just leaving it out with another tea towel on top to dry it for a day at least. And then I got it down to half or a third of the size.

A: Well, if you just let it hang.

Q: I know, but you have to hang it for four days. I did to get it dry. Oh yeah, four days. Not one. It's too warm here. It's too humid, you see. It's four days it took me to get it dried enough. And then I had to keep the flies out, so you have to have a sort of a netting.

A: Right.

Q: So there are ways of doing it, but I just wanted to explain that that's not as quick.

A: Well, you can go through what I used to do when I was making it in Thailand. I'd go through and squeeze it.

Q: Yes, you can do that.

A: I would squeeze it several times a day.

Q: Yeah.

A: I still made mine in a day and a half.

Q: So that recipe you gave us a day and a half, if we just keep squeezing it.

A: Yeah. Good stuff. If you've got a moist house, yeah, if you've got high humidity.

Q: Is the [unintelligible], is that definitely cultured?

A: Yes.

Q: Yes. That's why I asked the question, because I actually talked to Camille and he said he's not making it.

Q: And his curd cheese definitely isn't?

Q: Yeah.

Q: And his curd cheese definitely isn't?

Q: No, no. He said he doesn't make it. He doesn't make it. He doesn't culture it. No, he cultures everything. So he doesn't make the hard cheese at all. So I had a good talk to Camille and then I spoke to Aajonus and said, bring it up in the question and answers.

Q: Yeah.

Q: So I can give the recipe to everyone. But the curd is cultured because he's making it.

A: He said it's cultured.

Q: Yeah, I mean the ordinary curd is cultured as well.

A: Pardon?

Q: The regular curd is cultured as well.

Q: Yeah, curd.

Q: Of course it is, because he's making cheese.

Q: Yeah, he doesn't have the hard cheese at all.

A: Yeah. Yeah.

Q: So he doesn't have any uncultured.

Q: None.

A: Right.

Q: So we need to make that ourselves.

A: Yeah. And it should go faster if you put the few drops of either vinegar or lemon in it. Taste, you know, whether you like the cheese a little more tart, put the vinegar in it. If you like it a little more sweet or salty, then put the lemon juice in it, you know, the few drops. You're not putting enough to make a big diet change or a big taste change except that you're going to create different bacteria to break it down.

Q: And I love that you spoke about salt. You know, all the natural therapies all my life were saying salt, you know, animus, salt this, salt that, and my body couldn't stand it. And, you know, we've got this culture now that people are taking salt for minerals. And they're hurting themselves. They're getting rheumatism, they're getting worse and I'm just sitting around there arguing because it's the culture again. It's what's popular.

Q: How about Epsom salt in the bath?

A: Epsom salt's good.

Q: In the bath.

A: In the bath. I say it in the book. Put milk, you know, if you're in municipal water, you put milk, you put raw apple cider vinegar and you put either sea salt or Epsom salt in that water.

Q: I've got a question, another one, which is very, very important. All our water's heavily fluoridated and chlorinated. And sometimes chlorine is stronger than it is in a swimming pool. So if we're soaking in that.

A: I know. I put milk in it. You put milk in it. Turn it on, I smell that chlorine instant.

Q: Okay. Milk, coconut, if you haven't got coconut cream, and no one makes coconut cream, I have to tell them to add coconut oil a bit. So I say add a teaspoon of coconut oil because you've not got coconut cream. But, you know, listen, that would be better than nothing, wouldn't it?

A: All you have to do is hire a couple of high school kids, have them break your freaking coconut.

Q: But they haven't got the juicer for it. They haven't got the, yeah.

A: Oh, well, you buy one juicer and you have one or a couple of kids or some, you know, a couple juice for you a couple of days a week.

Q: Debbie's got to bring it back. Debbie, where's Debbie? Debbie, when are you coming back with your juicer from Thailand? The juicer for your coconut is about $800 minimum.

A: Yeah, right. Well, it's more than that.

Q: Well, it's not about $800. Debbie's bringing one back from Thailand.

A: But, I mean, if you get, you know, a really good one you want to manufacture, I imported three of them from Thailand. To ship here would be less expensive because you're not that far from Thailand.

Q: Debbie?

A: But it's about $4,000, but you can do five gallons an hour. And you can do a lot. And I also have a connection with it could send you reasonably priced coconuts organic from Thailand to here.

Q: Really?

A: I just have to set you up.

Q: Would you?

A: Yeah.

Q: Well, how much would that cost you then?

A: Well, if you buy that juicer, it will cost around $4,000. And that's not bad because you can do just five gallons an hour. And you also get a smaller machine which, you know, grinds the coconut down and then you put it through the shaft and it juices it. And it looks like, anybody see a champion juicer?

Q: Yeah.

A: Yeah. So it looks like a steel champion juicer. It's about this long, about this high, and it's wonderful.

Q: What about irradiation? Anything that comes into Australia gets irradiated, doesn't it?

A: Not necessarily.

Q: Not necessarily?

A: You send a UPS and FedEx, very little gets scanned.

Q: Okay.

A: You send it through the postal system, about 50% gets scanned. If it goes UPS and FedEx, put food on it, something like that, perishable, then you have to worry about customs.

Q: Yes, you do.

A: But they won't scan it.

Q: Okay.

A: But only about 2% of anything passes through FedEx and UPS gets scanned.

Q: Can you do the [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah, absolutely. I've had, I had one man who was 93 years old and he was being fed through a tube and they made the liver formula for babies that they have in the book, made that, diluted it with more milk, didn't let the milk age because it would get too thick, so everything was pretty fresh. And he was on that for four and a half months, got well and off the tube, out on the street like a normal person again. He was supposed to die.

Q: So when they send the coconuts, will they spray them?

A: Pardon?

Q: When they send the coconuts, will they spray them?

A: No. Nonetheless, Australia requires them. And I don't think Australia requires them from Thailand. Because from the Philippines I think they require them.

Q: I had a client who unloads the containers and he says they actually spray every container and at one time he actually went in too soon and he ended up with valve palsy. So apparently they do, they spray everything that comes in. They said they do.

A: Yeah, but they spray the container, not the object inside.

Q: Well it's inside, so depending on how it's packed, I suspect it would go through the packing, so we'd have to be, no?

A: It's in crates, wooden crates.

Q: Wooden crates?

A: Transporting them, yeah.

Q: Okay, well talk me through that.

A: Now Australia did that to me. I came into Australia the first time and I said I'd been on a farm. They took my shoes and they dipped them.

Q: Yeah.

A: My shoes came apart. Destroyed 125 dollar shoes.

Q: I'm so conscious of this crap, you know.

A: Yeah.

Q: I'm surprised they're falling apart constantly and through this neglect.

A: And he got angry at me because I got irate about it damaging my shoes, poisoning my shoes.

Q: Yeah. Thank you very, very much.
