A: Before we get started, if anybody wants to purchase the books, it's a straight $30, no tax. Make a check out to Carnelian, it's Carnelian Bay Castle, [unintelligible] it'll be easy. In fact, just so I don't have to carry the books back, I'll sell them for $27, and I am not going to carry these books back.

Q: Would you be adverse to taking cash?

A: Not at all. While we're waiting, everything gets squared away, if anybody wants to buy a book, go ahead. I'm just going to relate to you what has happened, what happened yesterday. Somebody sent me an email a few weeks ago and said that the Washington University School of Medicine was doing research on raw fooders, and they didn't say that it was vegan, they didn't say raw fooders, so I got in touch with these doctors who were performing this testing, and I told them about my diet, and they said, oh, would you come and be part of the test? Well, we're just doing vegan raw fooders, but we'd love to see what you're doing, because the head, John Holzkowski, he's won, you know, quite a few Olympic prizes because he deals in the athletic field and health. He's somewhere in the 70s. So he was fascinated by this diet, and he hadn't met anybody on such a diet. So on my way here, I stopped in St. Louis for the test yesterday, and you have to understand that I was the type 1 diabetic from the age of 15. I took insulin up until I was almost 22, when I decided I was going to handle my diet. So I handled it. Of course, eating lots of fruit, you know, when I was doing fruitarian things wasn't easy. Now I just decided to keep it way down and low. So yesterday, during the glucose tolerance test, I started off with a 104. I went up to 240, I think it was, which is normal, the high sugar increase. And this is the first time I had sugar since probably the last time I had a glucose tolerance test, which I think was in 71. So let me tell you, I was buzzed out. I was dizzy. It was really strange. But the first half hour was 240. Next half hour it was down to 103. And the next half hour it was down to 53. And they stopped doing it. And she said, your pancreas has got to stop working. I said, you don't understand, you put poisonous sugar in my body. My pancreas is going to try to get rid of every bit of it. And I bet you if we continue this, she said, no, that's all we do in a day. But that was exciting for me because I did not know that my liver had rebuilt it. I mean, my pancreas had rebuilt itself. And it's actually working. So here's a type 1 diabetic that actually reversed diabetes completely by rebuilding the liver. I mean, rebuilding the pancreas. So it's all possible. That was the only thing that I could not tell whether it was working or not because I still had a problem when I would eat fruits, too many fruits, too often. And I would keep it down to one every two or three days. Now I know I can probably handle more. Not that I may want to because I was so – being a diabetic, with your sugar level up and down all the time, it creates over-emotionality. Because when you read my book, I was trying all the time and always feeling things so intensely, the sadness and all of that. And when I've cut – since I've cut the fruit down to once every two to three days or three to four days, I don't have all that emotionality. It's a lot more fun.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Sweet fruits, yes. Tomatoes, that's different. I eat a lot of tomatoes in place of other fruits. So they checked my heart. They were expecting to find all kinds of plaque. Because they said, what's your diet? I said, well, I eat – during the spring and summer, I eat from eight to ten ounces of raw cream a day, maybe more. And I eat – in the fall and winter, I'll eat a stick of butter a day minimum. And they're just – you know, they're very polite. Because these are mainly cardiac people. This is a cardiac ward of this hospital, and they do everything cardiac. So they're just waiting to get to my – to take a picture of my heart and my veins. So what they do is to check the carotid arteries on both sides and check the heart with sound, ultrasound. So they have all – I mean, they've got a room with these specialists because they've heard about me. They've got a room with these specialists in there waiting, and they're watching the picture. This guy's going, this is beautiful. This is amazing. You know, 50 – almost 56 years old to see somebody with a completely clean heart and not a bit of plaque on it anywhere. And these were the superlatives. They carried the tests on for a good 45 minutes instead of the normal 20 minutes. Because they kept just trying to find something. They checked the heart from every angle, every angle. And then here, usually they'll do this for about 3 minutes on either side. They were doing it 10 minutes on each just to check it. And they found just the slightest bit of plaque that's usually found on people who are about in their mid-20s. 

Q: Is it an ultrasound?

A: Pardon?

Q: Is that an ultrasound?

A: Yes, the ultrasound. They wanted to do a bone scan on me, but the only equipment they had available was x-ray. And I wouldn't do the x-ray because they didn't have the ultrasound for the bone. So I'm going to try to do that for them at UCLA. But they were quite shocked. And then, you know, the head cardiologist who was heading the research said, you know, there was no exercise supposed to be involved in this. Would you go up there and do some weight stuff for us? Just see your strength level. I said, sure. I don't do anything. I haven't worked out in 24 years. I'm 24 years [unintelligible]. So I don't know if I have any strength because I just do this, you know, on my computer. And that's it. That's my exercise. And I go shopping once a week for food. And that's it. And my girlfriend will get me to go walking with her once a month and once every two months on the beach. And I said, that's literally my exercise. Oh, but we want to check your natural strength. I said, OK. So we go up there on the weights. They're putting the weights in. And they start off. And I'm just doing this kind of thing, you know, pushing a big machine, which I don't think I've ever worked with. And we keep putting all the way up. And we get to the last one. And it's, I think it was 253 pounds, something like that. And I had to strain with that one. And they're recording all this because they had my heart, you know, those electrodes with the meter there. And they were checking everything. And the heart, you know, when I got to the strenuous stuff, just the last few blocks where it went from, I think, 220 to 253 in those three exercises, the only time that my heart overworked. And it went right back within a second. As soon as I let the pressure off, the heart went right back to normal. So they were very impressed. And that was on the foot. That was on the feet. Then on the arm one, let's see, I went from 99 to 196 before I had the, you know, that tension there. While I was doing the foot exercises up to 253, there was no stress from the heart with my leg exercises. So one of the guys, one of the doctors there, Luigi, he's the assistant to the main doctor who was handling this, he's ultra thin and skinny. And he's looking at me going through this. And they're talking about somebody else who's a champion weightlifter. And he said, our champion weightlifter with a good heart does what you do. And you do it without exercising. He works out all the time. With that much weight. So this is the first time I've had any confirmation, you know, in laboratory tests. Because everybody's asked me that all these years, and I found the opportunity. So, it's great. Now I'm waiting for the LDL and the HDL and all the other symptoms, all the other information they look for to tell you whether you're healthy or not. So I have hardly any plaquing at all in my system. My heart has no plaquing at all. And it's in great shape. And now when they come back with my LDL and HDL sky high, high cholesterol levels, they're going to say, oh, well, it has to be bad. You've been doing this for at least 20 years. But your heart's clean and your arteries are clean. This can't be.

And there was a whole team of doctors that came out three months ago and said that there's a cholesterol [unintelligible] that it doesn't relate to anything at all. And there was one article that was written called The Big Fat Lie. Lie about fats. So this team had never heard about that whole research, so I gave it to them while I was there because I had it on my computer. So that is going to be another piece of information that these people can evolve from so we get the better information for people out there. So it's becoming contagious, which is great.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, and I don't do exercise at all. Well, people say, well, wait a minute, in your book you're talking about having sex all the time, so you have exercise. Well, my girlfriend's been gone since January, and I haven't had sex since January, and this is not having sex.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's because they eat too much.

[audio cut]

A: I was also born into a family that was very violent. Everything was arguing and yelling and punishing. Everything was handled with violence. Nothing was solved in any other means. No rationale to it. And a brother who was 18 months older than I, he was still in diapers when I came home and never forgave me for it, because I took all the attention away. So he tortured me nearly every day for 15 1⁄2 years before he went into the Vietnam War. And then he got to hurt people over there. It's a perfect place for him. And by the time I was, because of all that, I was accident-prone. So I was always in fear of being hit from behind. And my mother and father would say, oh, that never happened to you. So my father was an 8-millimeter movie buff. So I got out the 8-millimeter film and I started going through that. And I'd say, okay, why don't you watch this, Mom and Dad. And my brother would go behind me and take his knuckle like this and punch me right in the back and the spine. Pulled my hair and pulled me backwards. And I just pointed it out to all of these times and I said, you just ignored me. That went on all the time. So I was under tremendous stress. So I became accident-prone because I was always in fear. I wasn't paying attention where I was walking. I was afraid I was always getting attacked from somewhere. So I began cutting myself and breaking things because I had very brittle bones. So if I'd fall down and fell on my elbow, I broke my elbow. I fell off of a ladder about three feet high and I shattered my heel cap. That's how brittle my bones were. So I started getting injections of antibiotics and tetanus very young. And there was thimerosal, which is liquid mercury, in every vaccine. Liquid mercury is a known poison. And it has been linked in the last ten years with autism. After my third injection when I was a year and a half of tetanus, I became autistic. All of a sudden, my brain could not relate words with concepts. So I was then autistic. I had to learn to hear sound patterns, correlate them with reactions. And because the thimerosal and the vaccine itself had damaged my memory center, I had to hear sounds back in my subconscious before and not be aware of them. You know, like autistic kids, they have the ability to add mathematical figures. It can be 20 figures long, come up with an answer like that. Well, my brain got to be able to do that, but I was never conscious of knowing languages or understanding what I was saying. I would just parrot the sounds. If I had been asked to stand and read in front of the class, I couldn't even read the word "the". I didn't look retarded or autistic, so they always thought I was just a belligerent kid who couldn't, you know, not that I couldn't read, they just thought I was belligerent and wouldn't read. So by the time I reached 10 years old, I had developed peritonitis. It was a misdiagnosed as appendicitis, and they opened me up and said, oh, your appendix is fine, but we'll take it out anyway, just in case it bothers you in the future. So that's the medical profession. So I suffered, I had injections like every two to four hours for five days, to the point where I had to actually take the tray, the hypodermic tray, and knock it out of the nurse's hand, and to get it to her head so I wasn't going to take any more.

And then 24 hours after they stopped injecting me, I finally got enough strength to get out of the hospital. But I was very cold. I think that's when my blood and bone cancer started, because I was so cold from that point on that, I grew up in Cincinnati, and it's cold. So I'd get up, and I could not move without severe pain, so I'd go huddled in front of the heater vent, just to be able to thaw out, to be able to move. Then by the time I was 14 1⁄2, I developed—sorry, I was a borderline diabetic. By 15 1⁄2, I developed angina, child with angina. Muscle cramping, my heart would go into such cramping that I'd pass out for 20 minutes at a time. They'd just let me lay there on the classroom floor, because the doctors couldn't figure out what to do. Didn't have open-heart surgery, you know, back then, and thank God they didn't. They certainly would have experimented on me, I think. So, not in Cincinnati, anyway. So, then the diabetes was onset at that point, at 15 1⁄2. Then I got married at 16, married a girl who could telepathically communicate, and I learned enough sounds to be able to get through, you know, everything. The way I got through school was, I always picked the smart— when you're psychic and intuitive, you know who's smart and who isn't. I always picked the smartest girl in the room. And for some reason, they were always sensitive enough and let me cheat without knowing it. So, I copied their hired list. And from a distance, sometimes that isn't all that easy. So, I'd write it down. Sometimes it wasn't a word at all. But I got through, you know, mainly D's, all through school. Then when I got into college, it was different. But it was funny. I was blessed because several of the professors understood that I had dyslexia to a severe point, so they gave me all of my exams auditorily, orally. So, I was very fortunate. And I had a mind which would do flow charts for computing. And I didn't understand what I was doing. I just had a talent just to write a program. I couldn't explain it, how I got it, or anything. I could just write it. So, I passed second in the class. Not even being able to read. So, I became a junior executive for Carte Blanche Corporation. And I would write flow charts for them, and rearrange their entire company, making them an extra $300,000 a year, and here I was, an autistic person who couldn't even read. But none of them knew that I couldn't read. So, I was able to get by. When I got married at 16, had a child at 17. Born the week of my first week in senior high school. And there was a lot of stress because I had to go to school in the day, and then work at night, and then take care of him during the night. He had a lot of problems, a lot of digestive problems. So, he screamed all night long. So, by the time I was divorced at 19, I developed, I was an alcoholic, and I smoked two packs a day, Lucky Strikes, non-filtered. And I loved it, and I would be smoking today if it were healthy for me. And it's not, so I don't. And I mean, I loved smoking. My mother used to say, stop that, you're a fiend! Because I would inhale it and get it hot like that on the end. I just loved that burning sensation. I loved it, you know. So, by the time I was 19, I developed a stomach ulcer.

I found that out because I went on a spree with a couple of guys down in Mexico. We went to the bullfights, hit every bar all the way from Mexico up to Los Angeles. And I went into the restroom because I was feeling pretty nauseous and I started vomiting blood. So I went to the hospital and found out I had an ulcer, a duodenal ulcer that was dumping back into the stomach and bringing up the blood. So they treated with Maalox and they had lots of Maalox, bottles of Maalox, a couple of bottles a week at least. Well, that caused some kind of cauterization in there and it caused a tumor to develop right next to the ulcer. So then they said, well, we better go in and cut it out, you know, and heal it up. Take your pylorus and then stretch it out about three times its normal size. You know, I don't know, they know what they're doing, of course, you know. I've got three uncles who are doctors, my mom's an RN, eight aunts and uncles who are RNs. I was raised around it, so I was, you know, indoctrinated to believe that they know what they're doing. I didn't know that stretching a pylorus would cause 90% scar tissue so the pylorus wouldn't even work within about a year, you know. So, you know, it's just a spontaneous thing, we'll take care of everything right now, we don't look at the future. So, they told me that after they did, they severed all the vagus nerves to my stomach, it was a vagotomy pyloroplasty, so they cut all the vagus nerves to my stomach so I'd never secrete hydrochloric acid again, and stretch the pores. They said, now you will not be able to eat anything raw again in your life, nothing raw. You are in danger, like octogenarians, of parasitical, viral, and parasitical, bacterial, parasitical, and viral invasion through your food, and you could die very easily. So, I ate everything cooked like they suggested, and of course, if I ate meat of any kind, fish, chicken, anything, I would break out. I looked like raw hamburger, I was a scribe at one time. And it was true, I would just break out all over. So many pimples covering everything, my neck, shoulders, arms, everything, and I just looked like raw hamburger. So I realized I had to get off of meat. So I stopped eating meat, so I started going vegetarian, started eating raw. And I went through, after I went through that, the incision that's right here became tumorous. And they decided, well, we better irradiate it. So I went under intense 10 weeks of radiation therapy, cauterized my spine, so this was my new movement. This is how I can move. So if I sat down, I had to come over and sit down like this to sit down without too much pain. And I could never touch my knees unless I was really straining. It felt like if you've ever had, you know, tight hamstrings, that sort of felt like only intensely painful. So I went around that for a long time. They put me through surgeries, you know, to stretch out the spine, clean out the cauterization in between, and the mineral buildup in there from the radiation. And then they gave me blood and bone cancer, multiple myeloma. So then they said, well, we're going to have to give you chemotherapy. So here I am a cripple, and they want to give me chemotherapy.

So I took chemotherapy, and I did cripple. I crawled around like a worm on the floor for months. And it would take me sometimes a half an hour to get from here to the sink. You know, I'd get up every night and urinate in bottles. I had two people from a hospice come in twice a week. They did my shopping, helped me, made some food, prepared it for days in advance, and they cleaned my house. Well, one of them came one day with a booklet, well, to the chemotherapy after three months of it. I said, that's it. I didn't know that for every one cancer cell you kill, that chemotherapy kills one billion healthy cells. So it's like killing everybody on the planet because you don't like six people. Pretty barbaric and stupid. We're not talking ignorant. We're talking stupid. So there's one, a volunteer, he was a black man who was an entertainer, great voice. He was with the Going Thing at the time. He was only like 18 or 19 years old. He brought me a book that was about 82 pages, written by a woman who had supposedly cured her uterine cancer by drinking a gallon of kerosene a day. Of course, I couldn't read, so it didn't make any difference to me. He gave me the book. And I hated carrots because I'd only had cooked carrots in my life. My mother cooked everything. She was a nurse and was afraid of all bacteria. So everything was overcooked, burned, awful. Leather, shoe leather is what I ate. In fact, if you gave me your shoe, I might think that was a good meal, you know, as a kid. So this carrot juice, finally the guy got me to just taste it. And my God, it was the only thing that tasted good in a while. But I said, it's raw, it'll be sick. I said, who cares? I don't want to die anyway. I'm miserable. And I've wanted to die since probably the first time I thought about killing myself was 10 years old. And it was pretty constant all the way, but I never had balls to do it. And the only thing we had was a .22 rifle, and I knew sometimes if that got into the brain, you didn't die. You just became a cripple for life, an idiot for life. And I was already a semi-idiot. So that was out. One time I did think that I was going to accomplish it. My mother was always, do not get wet and stay out in the cold. You'll catch pneumonia and you'll die. So I thought, oh, that's what I can do. So I was about 12 years old, and I had had the appendectomy and all of the vaccines and all of the chemicals, and I was severely depressed. I was fat. They called me Fatty Arbuckle. And, you know, I couldn't breathe. I couldn't do anything. I couldn't play with other children, and you get that kind of ridicule, too much. So I saw this big pond. So I broke the ice in it. I got in and knelt in it. And I had a big wool coat and got just sopping wet. And I had a whole mile to walk home, and I thought, it's going to kill me. I didn't even get a cold or a flu. And I got colds and flus over the last three to five months of the year, and that year I didn't get one. So, you know what my mother was talking to me about after that? I just said, [unintelligible]. Nothing happened. So I had all these things that people were telling me. I couldn't correlate with anything with reality because whatever was told to me didn't work. 

I remember when I went in for it, I had my tonsils out at three years old. This is good for you. This is good for you. And I had this terrible sensation before we went in. Fierce. I come out of it, and I'm not in the hospital and at home, so they had drugged me so badly. I must have given them such a time. They had drugged me so badly that I didn't even come conscious until I got home. I woke up, and I guess it was pretty bad because my whole family was around me expecting me to die or something. And I woke up with this headache and this feeling like I was in some kind of a high-pressure vacuum capsule. And I was nauseous, and my throat was just so sore, and I knew that it hadn't developed from my own body. And I knew that my parents were offering me Jell-O and this kind of stuff, and I didn't want anything. And I lost my trust for them at that point, three years old. So I didn't trust anybody from that point on, anybody in the world, until I met some girls who were very psychic, very sensitive, and understood me completely. We didn't have to use that language thing that existed. So that worked. So, anyway, that was a long story. I [unintelligible] the carrot juice. Anyway, I drank the carrot juice, and it was delicious. I started feeling better, and all of a sudden, ten days after drinking the carrot juice, and I was only drinking like a quart a day. I didn't move a gallon a day. I was still diabetic. So all of a sudden, the language connection in my brain worked. And I looked at the words, and I knew the word "the". And I knew every other word. I mean, I had almost no good vocabulary, but I all of a sudden understood language. A word meant this, and I was all of a sudden able to put it together. So I borrowed $110 and went out. In 1969, that was a lot of books. And I bought $110 worth of books, and mainly on, well, I bought Siddhartha, and I bought all books on nutrition. And that was my lead-in to raw foods. So I got into eating raw foods by the time February of 72 came around. I had a great experience with my girlfriend who almost died of peritonitis, forcing the doctors, you know, to not commit surgery on her like they did me, and not giving her all this medication and antibiotics, and then feeding her raw food substances. And they said that she would not be able to go back into ballet for a year and a half after peritonitis, minimum, if she ever recovered. With the dietary program that I put her on, she was back to ballet class in six weeks. I was so impressed by what had happened was I made a commitment that February 1972 to be a raw fooder. I mean, I cheated a little here and there because I was a raw food vegetarian, fruitarian, so it was very difficult for me to eat, you know, to be without meat or dairy of any kind. So I did my cheating all the way. And then I'd bicycle all around the country and Alaska, Mexico, living with Indian tribes, living with animals, coyotes, alligators, chipmunks, just observing them for months at a time and see their patterns.

Because I knew that I wasn't going to find it with man, because man did not know what he was doing when it came to health. So American Indians, primitive ones, told me, three different tribes, raw meat's what you needed. Well, I knew what happened with meat, you know, I had to break out like hamburgers. There was no way I was going to touch meat. And it never correlated. I don't know why. Raw meat will be different, just like every other raw food is different than cooked. And it will react differently, but I was so afraid of it that I didn't do it. So after traveling around for three years, ignoring what the Eskimos to me told me, the Yaqui Indians and the Sioux Indians told me to eat the raw meat, ignoring it, my multiple myeloma resurged again, and I was back in pain. If the temperature dropped below 70 degrees, I was in pain in certain joints. If the temperature dropped below 50 degrees, 49 degrees, I was crippled in pain, couldn't move. I was in such excruciating pain. So while I was with the Eskimos, they broke out this green, black, white, moldy stuff out of the ground, rolled in these these hives, and it was so foul that I couldn't get within five feet of it without wanting to vomit. So I thought it was a blend of these herbs that they had put, you know, together, and this was going to be medicine. So I had about a ping-pong ball-sized amount, and all of a sudden, I felt better. It was getting down to, you know, about 48 degrees at night. This is in September, 76, and, I mean, September, 75. Yeah, September, 75. And the joints started feeling better. And the whole time that I was up there, for that, I didn't have that severe pain to where I was crippled. So I thought it was just a blend of herbs, you know, because I couldn't even speak English very well, much less, you know, Eskimo. These were pretty prominent, and he didn't know much English. So I couldn't find out what it was, but they kept saying it was high meat. They had this word for high meat, and I thought it was herbs. And I didn't find out until the 80s that it was high meat. It was rotten, stinky meat that they buried underground for a minimum of six weeks, and when it stinks a half mile downwind, that's when they ate it. And these children, they would smell that stuff, and they would just start getting excited, and it was like candy. And it was so bad that I, I mean, I was, I got this close to it, and I was starting to vomit already. So what they did was, I had some cotton balls, and they had some musk oil, so I put it in musk oil, and the cotton balls would stuff it up my nose, and we were able to eat it. Did anybody see me on Ripley's Believe It or Not in July and August? Well, I ate year- and three-months-old buffalo brains that were moldy and green. The cameraman was puking all over the place. Close to it, like this. But I did that to prove that, you know, all this supposition that you're going to get parasites and bacteria food poisoning from eating aged raw meat, and they're full of, you know, molds and bacteria and parasites, there was not a danger or harmful at all.

So then I proved it. I proved it many, many times, but I wanted to prove it to the world. This company in Germany saw it. It went national, I mean worldwide. And the company from Germany saw it. They flew a team over for me to do it again. And it's so funny because I had three of my patients there with me, eating it with me. And two of them had had chronic depression, and one of them had been 27 years taking a minimum of five psychotropic drugs a day, manic depressive. She was diagnosed with everything. And a good day for her was, I feel good today. And I'm not exaggerating either. That's how bad she was. And I tried for a year and a half to get her to eat the high meat. This is the last call. I'm already on this crazy diet. It's antisocial. Nobody wants to speak to me. But she was really feeling suicidal. So she fell on her neck and said, OK, how do I get this high meat? I said, well, it takes about four weeks to make it. I don't have four weeks. I said, well, I have another class that has a lot of it already prepared. Maybe he'll sell you some. So she called and got some. So also to get this call, I got some. And, you know, I usually answer the phone right away. But I thought, let me listen to this one. So I got the high meat. I'm going to take it. I just want to know if there's any precautions. I know you explained it to me. I'll go ahead and take it. But call me as soon as you get in. So then I get this call. I had that, I had it about 20 minutes ago. Now I'm really frightened, so you need to call me. And you know I'm not going to answer that phone, because it would be all night long, that I would be babysitting her. So I refused to answer the phone. So after the third call, she's calling every 45 minutes. And the third call is, I really need you to call me. She's giggling. I'm really frightened. This stuff smells awful. And I ate it. So I just let it go. By 4 o'clock in the morning, she calls and she's whistling, waiting for me to answer. Whistling a tune. You know, a tune. She takes it every other day. She eats high meat every other day to control her depression. And it works. Ten minutes after you take it, you're giggling. And a psychologist and psychiatrist from Santa Barbara came down after he heard about it. And he did an experiment. So we sat on my back porch. [unintelligible] a stinking house, for 24, 48 hours. Hang in the curtain, whatever you have. So I went back to the porch and ate it. And most of your psychologists and psychiatrists get into that because they've got emotional problems to begin with. You know, he's all of a sudden started, 10 minutes later he's giggling. And he's saying, this really works, doesn't it? This really works. So he starts, this is a very educated man who's up in a very rich neighborhood, Santa Barbara. Very socialite environment, Santa Barbara. Who's now telling people to eat stinky high meat. He got prostate cancer, so guess what diet he's on. He gets younger every year, he's in his 60s. So he's doing great. I guess you've heard enough for the lecture part of it. We're going to go into workshop after this. Now the workshop, for those who haven't signed up for the workshop, the workshop will be about two and a half hours of me explaining certain facets of how to get healthier.

We're going to concentrate, the rest of the book and my first book here cover everything but detoxification. And you have all that information available. I'm going to have this workshop mainly on detoxification. How to help you, make it work for you, so you can get healthy as quickly as possible. And explain why it works. Then after that I will do mini consults. Which means that I've got a pattern of reading the palms. This is not psychic, this is actual patterns, physiological patterns that appear in the hands. That I can tell how your glands are functioning. And now I know it's completely accurate because my pancreas has been showing for the last four years that it's rebuilding. Well I got confirmation yesterday. Because I thought the pancreas was the one thing that was not rebuilt, especially in a diabetic. So anyway, it really works and what I will do is suggest foods that are more likely to help you get well quicker. And that's $30. So the workshop is $50, the mini consult per person is $30 after that. So it's $80 if you want the two. The people who are getting a full consult tomorrow and Monday, you don't need to sign up for a mini consult. Because I'll be doing that in the full consult. Alright?

Q: Do you want me to hand this?

A: Okay. Would you do that?

Q: Yep.

A: Okay. So if anybody hasn't signed up for the workshop and would like to. Who is this? Did she see, did they see Eva or who?

Q: Oh, it's Sherry.

A: Sherry.

Q: If someone has changed their mind and has decided to do a mini consult, then you can come and see me now, then. This time.

Q: I want to pass this out to everybody who's going to show up tomorrow for the full consult. You all know you're coming to my house, right? Right.

A: So raise your hand if you're in a full consult. And the second piece of paper you have there, which is a request for advice for me to sign it, pull it out, and bring it in.

Q: [unintelligible]

[chatter]

A: Okay, the thing that I will cover in the next book, which will probably be out next spring, is a book that will cover detoxification. Now, I covered it just, I mean, I mentioned it a little bit in the recipe for living without disease, that fat is very important to cleanse the body. That was very well illustrated in my test results yesterday. I had 20 years of eating meat on a daily basis, as of December, will be this December, 20 years eating meat on a daily basis from one to three pounds a day. 1976 is when I started eating lots of raw fat, consuming at least six ounces of raw cream a day, and a stick of butter a day, lots of fat. Now I went from 118... 

[audio cut]

A: They thought they'd freak out my readers, but when I went out in the desert to fast myself, it was to fast myself to death, and then the coyotes brought me the rabbit. I thought eating that rabbit was going to kill me. That story got changed a little bit in the story, but when those coyotes brought the rabbit to me to eat, I thought, because I had all this information kept running through my head, my father was an inventor, and my mother was a nurse, and all my relatives who were in the medical field said, wild rabbit has an enzyme or a bacteria in it that will kill you within 24 to 48 hours after eating it with very, very painful stomach cramps. Something like rabies. So I thought, one, two days, stomach pain, it's nothing like the cancer pain, I can handle that. If I continue fasting, it's going to take me 40 to 60 days to die. So when I ate that rabbit, I ate it to kill myself. What I did was I got strong for the first time in all those years. So another little fiction, myth, went out the window for me. However, when I came back into LA, after eating, I started going to farms in the area, shoveling goat manure or anything I could to get chickens, to get eggs, to get raw milk, to build myself up. So I go back into Los Angeles from a skinny, skin and bones individual, to this miniature Arnold Schwarzenegger. And I went back and said, I've got the answer. He said, oh yeah, you look like it, what are you doing? And I said, I'm eating raw meat. Raw meat? Are you crazy? You're going to get a brain fluke. You'll be an idiot. And I said, well, I've already been that. But I feel so much better in law. I feel great. First time I've ever felt this good in my life. Until I ate the boy's mushroom. But I started eating lots of cream. I would drink a quart of cream a day with a quart of carrot juice mixed together. Good and great combinations. And that's what I ate a day. However, first time in my life, I had exercise. After leaving the farm, I wanted to keep exercising. It felt so good. So I began doing 250 push-ups a day with my feet at least this high, sometimes this high. And I would do 50 to 100 handstand push-ups against the wall. And then I would do about 30 chin-ups at a time without stopping. And then I would run 5 to 13 miles a day. So I used that cream, a quart of cream a day, just burning it up. It was incredible. It was wonderful. Fats, I learned, are the most important nutrient in the system for keeping the body lubricated and for giving you energy and to get out all the old fat. I mentioned in this book the analogy, if you take a fat and you cook it, it's like taking clay and firing it in the kiln. You solidify it. It is then pottery. It's not a clay which will produce life, which will grow life, whether it's mold or a plant. Clay can do that. But if you fire it, it will no longer do that, unless you've got an aeration plant that grows with its roots exposed and gets its moisture from the atmosphere. But the clay itself will not breed life once it's been fired. The same thing with fat. Once you cook it and the higher the temperature goes, the worse it is. It's like you fire the cone and firing with pottery. The more brittle it becomes until it becomes glass-like. The fat does the same thing. The higher the temperature, the more lipid peroxides that are formed, and they're all carcinogenic. Plaques on the system, so that's what the doctors were looking for. All that plaque from all that fat.

People say, oh my god, you know, I've got a high cholesterol level. In fact, the older the people are, usually the higher the cholesterol level. I said, well, I did a laboratory test back in 1991 and it cost me $8,000 to have my laboratory technician find the difference between a fat molecule that is in a person from a cooked fat and then from me they took one that was from raw fat. And he found the difference between the two, so that what he could do is he could pull the blood and find out which ones were old toxic fats that were being removed from the body and the new healthy raw ones. By the time he told me, [unintelligible], about $8,000 to do it, but by the time we finished it cost me about $23,000 to have them develop that one. The guy died three years ago. He never went on the diet. He saw all this work for me for years and never bought it. All the validation and verification right there, but he was able to do a test that cost about $6,000 per person that could differentiate the difference between the old cholesterol and the high cholesterol, because when they do a test on cholesterol, they do not differentiate. They just look at LDL and HDL. Big deal. So, if you're cleaning out old, hardened cholesterol from your body, especially if you have a tendency toward overweight, you're going to have a much higher cholesterol level. I know one person that has a severely high, two people who have severely high cholesterol levels, but they're athletically inclined and they're not overweight. One girl was a, what do you call them, a competitor in the Olympic, a figure skater, and she came to me at 28 years old. She was fatigued. You know, that's a lot of work doing figure skating. A lot of practice, because of the balance is so particular. She was going to retire, she was feeling terrible, chronically fatigued. After about an hour and a half, she was shot. So she went on the diet, and in six months she was doing spins around the 16 and 18-year-olds. She's still skating today, she's 31. Makes tons of money at it, too. She's also become an actor. She's more balanced in her body, you know, just in a good balance in general. Completely different person. And I found that my athletes will maintain a very high cholesterol level. Paul Cohen, who's been on the diet about five years, the 10-year coach for McEnroe. He's been on the diet five years. He's 60 years old, 62 maybe, years old, and he swears by this diet. He said, if I only knew back then when I was a coach what I know now, it'd be completely different. I want to also give you an example of one of my athletes. He's a martial artist. He's 57 years old now. He went on the diet about 55, 56. He jump ropes three times a week. One day he will do 12,500 jumps. Can you imagine doing 12,500 jumps one time? Then another day he does 3,700 and another day 2,500. When he came to me, he kept to his heart rate after the completion of exercising. His heart every month for that year, his rate averaged between 163, I think it was, and 190. The next year on the diet, he goes down and spikes down here like this.

He's been on the diet now two years and his heart is steady when he completes 12,500 jumps with a three-pound jump rope between 96, 98 to 102. That's his heart rate after doing 12,500 jumps. Remember when I told you I was doing 13 miles sometimes? One time I ran 13 miles in freezing rain in December, barefoot, through gravel. And my heart rate was 100 all the way through, even while running. And when I stopped after 13 miles, this is after a year and a half of working out, I wasn't even panting, was breathing normally. When I was running, I would concentrate on complete inhale, hold it, complete exhale. So I didn't overwork my lungs, because most people will breathe, hyper-breathe. And they're not even using half of the oxygen that is in their lungs before they're expelling it. So what I did was I trained myself to use all the oxygen before I let it out. And that allowed me to keep a good breathing rhythm. So when I stopped the exercise, I wasn't panting, I was breathing normally when I stopped. So that's something you might consider if you're doing an exercise. 

Q: You didn't tear up your feet running on the ground?

A: Well, I had been barefoot for nine years, so by that time they were pretty solid. And going to the desert at 160 degrees sometimes burned your feet. So I had a lot of callus in my foot. But then after the poison mushroom, I ate the deadliest, the only deadly mushroom in the world called the death cap. I ate enough to kill 15 people my size, by accident. And that destroyed my liver. 90% of my liver gave me blood and bone cancer again. This was in 1981, and it made my skin paper thin, so I couldn't go barefoot after that until recently. The last six or seven years. It took me 11 and a half years to recover from that poison mushroom. But I'm the only person that's alive that's ever had that mushroom, you know, that quantity. That's 15 times the amount that would kill somebody my size.

Q: How did you get into eating this mushroom?

A: That's a story you can read in there.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, it was delicious. Delicious. A woman ate it with me. She vomited it all up within a few hours. I mean, she didn't digest any of it. It came right back up. But I hadn't eaten that morning and went for a walk on the beach. And I had eaten them out of the yard, which was a stupid thing to do, because they must have used pesticides or herbicides or some kind of chemical fertilizer that mutated that mushroom, because all the amanitas, and there's only one deadly one, and that's the one I had, they all grew out of a cup. Right at the dirt level, you can see a cup at their base. It's easy to identify them. One of the easiest in the world to identify. However, this one must have been deformed because after I realized, you know, how sick I got four hours later, dry heaving and diarrhea, it was a mess. Severe pain, cramping. Every muscle in my body went into a cramp. Face, nose, ears, everything went into a cramp. I was like this and hardly, excruciating pain. I would stay in that pain for about 20 minutes, pass out, wake up after 20 minutes, be awake for 20 minutes, and then I would move anything from my chest down, and I went back into the cramps immediately. So I had to crawl around slowly, you know, and I forced myself to drink two gallons of water a day, and eat a pound and a half to two pounds of butter a day to force my liver back to work, because that's how you die. Liver stops working after a poisoned mushroom like that. So recuperating was difficult. Anyway, you know, when I was able to move about three weeks later, I went to that yard and dug up some of those mushrooms, and the cup was an inch to an inch and a half below the dirt level, which is not normal for that. mustard use some kind of herbicide. So I learned never to pick them out of a yard and never to pick a mushroom until I made it all the way down to the base where my ceiling grows and where the root stalk starts and I find any cup. It's just a membrane that grows up like you see in a fountain, you know, like a cup that comes up like that and then the stalk comes, goes up from the stalk, the cup, and then the stalk comes up again and then the mushroom. And if that cup exists, it's an amanita, and if it's the death cap, you're in trouble. The other ones will make you sick but not kill you, but the death cap, I'm the only person alive who's eaten it. I'm also the only person alive that has had multiple myeloma, lymphoma, and cancer of the stomach. I'm the only person alive who's had that combination.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah. And let me tell you, everybody who's had it, been diagnosed with it, is dead. There's no medical treatment. Yeah. It's been diagnosed with it. Yeah. Dr. Hardin B. Jones kept track of those people who were diagnosed with it in Berkeley when he was there. And when he testified back in the 70s, he said that—and he only worked in the oncology unit of Berkeley— Dr. Hardin B. Jones, he said that all the people who were diagnosed and refused any kind of medical treatment, when he followed up on them, 76% of them reversed their disease. What he concluded was that cancer is just like a cold or a flu. It will run its course 76% of the time if you don't do anything.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: He said not multiple myeloma and not lung. Those two did not seem to have that recovery rate.

Q: How many percent? Cancer will run its course in how many days?

A: Oh, it could be years. He didn't say a date.

Q: How many percent?

A: 76% of the time, not days.

Q: He checked that after how long? Is that what you're saying?

A: He followed up on it over years. 76% of the cancers were reversed. And he said that the average lifespan of that group was 12 and a half years. All the others who had one or all three cancer therapies, only 2 to 8% survived. And their average lifespan was three years. So he said, stay away from all the medical therapies. One of the greatest oncologists alive today, Samuel Epstein, says the same thing. He says that it's a big money racket. There are $480 billion a year in chemotherapy. And Bristol Myers and Bayer, they love that money. Also, they feel, from what I understand from the people who are on the level of the Bush family, they believe that it's the natural process of overpopulation, war, and disease. So they encourage it. Because people will overpopulate, have too many children, and they think that they're self-righteous and annihilating people. And, you know, that's just the consciousness. And that may be very well what it is, because it's happening.

Q: Until it's their own.

A: Even if it's their own, they believe it, from what I understand.

Q: What was his name?

A: I was asked to get involved in that group, and I refused to do it.

Q: What was the name of the second doctor?

A: Samuel Epstein. He's probably in his late 70s, mid to late 70s.

Q: He's in Chicago.

A: Yes, he is. He's in Chicago.

Q: You were asked to join what group?

A: Pardon?

Q: You were asked to join what group?

A: That group that believes in helpful genocide to regulate population. 

Q: What's it called?

A: I won't say because I don't know what they would do to me.

Q: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: You can be on this diet and you can do very well if you don't mind gaining weight and having high cholesterol levels. People who do that, who don't mind being overweight, do very well. Let me give you two examples. I've got actresses in Los Angeles, of course, they will not put on the weight. They'll eat a good diet, the diet that keeps their blood level clean as possible, their lymphatic level and their nervous system keep it pretty clean because they don't eat cooked food, they'll just eat the raw, they'll eat the meat, they'll eat the cream, the butter, but they won't eat enough to get overweight. When I look at their eyes and I show them in comparison and I show them people who will gain the weight, the radical difference between the eyes in a year or two years is phenomenal. The people who stay thin do not have that progression, they don't have all that tissue change. Fats are what the body uses to help pull out to make solvents. You know, we make soaps before, you know, we were using coconut. Coconut is a fat. Back in the 50s and 40s and 30s and 20s, every soap that existed had coconut in it. It was a great saturated fat that cleaned the system. The body could make solvents of it very easily, 80% fats, 15% proteins, amino acids, and 5% alcohol. And the body makes that same substance, those same substances from fat, amino acids, and alcohol by fermenting carbohydrates in the body. So you take the soap and you start degenerating things like we have solvents that'll melt plastic, wood, metal. It'll just dissolve it. Our bodies make 60 varieties of cholesterol to do it, if you're eating good raw fats. If you don't, like I say, they're cauterized, they're hardened and your body can't do it. But when you eat the raw fats, that's the main process of the body cleaning the system out. That is, the basic purpose of the fat is to clean out the body when you're toxic. Normally, it would be one-third to clean, one-third to stabilize the system, and one-third, that means protect it. You'll coat the cells, membranes to protect it, and one-third for fuel. At our toxic rate, 50-80% is used as solvents to detoxify the body, and only about 20-25%, at best, is used to help lubricate and fuel the body, unless you force yourself with athletics. So fat is very important. If you don't get enough, your body's going to use it all in metabolism, and just to lubricate your body a little bit, but you're not going to have enough left over to do the work of cleaning out the system. Two women, one woman, was on the diet three years, came back, you know, 20 pounds over. She's about six foot tall. She's 20 pounds over what she was when she came to me. She was skin and bones when she came to me. She's about six foot tall. She was about 123 pounds when she came to me. Now she's about 143. So she's not thin, but she looks healthy, a little bit thinner than you. The progress is minimal. People who have gained a lot of weight, like one of the girls, had cancer of the right kidney attached to the right adrenal gland, cancer of the right breast, about 30 rock-hard lumps in her breast and in her hip joint.

She'd been chronically fatigued for eight years from the age of 20 in college. She was able to work six hours a week only. That's how chronically fatigued she was. She would sleep 12 to 16 hours a day. She went on the diet. After two years, it broke, but it didn't break until she went on... This is a girl who's 5'5", about 5'5". She went up to 160 pounds. She was a healthy, strong, German-looking girl at that point. She did more progress, and at four months, that weight, her chronic fatigue broke up. She spent about five more months. She spent a whole nine months at that weight. The progress in that nine months with that excess fat was phenomenal. I still suggest that people go up and down. For the last two years, I did experiments with several people, seven altogether, and I had them do rapid weight gain and weight losses. Some of them could gain the weight an extra 30 pounds to 40 pounds. These were men, mainly, two women, five men. They would gain the weight in a small period of time and lose it as fast as they could. At the end of that two-year period, there was some damage. So I went back to the sixth month. Now, there was good. There was good. I mean, they were still ahead of the game, but they had some parts of the body had more scarring, and some parts had more advanced glycations that obviously looked like they were trying to clean out with the detoxing. The fat was gone at the proper time, so it stayed locked in somewhere else in the body. So I went back to the six-month program. You gain the weight in two months. You hold it for two months, and you lose it in two months. And I encourage everybody to do it. Anybody who's underweight, push it. I'm going down right now. Not only 5'8", a little under 5'7", and 3 quarters. Now that's what I was at 16 years old, 16 and a half. Everybody shrinks. However, I got on the measuring pole yesterday, and I hadn't reduced even a 32nd of an inch. No shrinkage. And I had spinal cancer, blood and bone cancer, and I had shriveled up, but I had grown back. I went down to about, when I was last measured, after the chemo in 72. This is, 69 was the last time I had chemo, but the last time I saw a physician was in 71. And at that time, I was about 5'5", but I couldn't stand up completely straight. If I had, I probably would have been about 5'6". But yesterday, barefoot, measured 5'7 3 1⁄4", exactly what I was, 16 1⁄2, I was the highest. So, no deterioration there.

Q: How old are you today, Aajonus?

A: 55 now. Good job. And at 21, I was about [unintelligible]. I had patches of hair, and it was all gray when it came back in. [unintelligible]

Q: Did you say what you weighed?

A: I weighed, oh, so I'm getting at it. Yesterday, I weighed 184 with a hospital gown on. And the week before that, no, the month before that, I weighed 190. So I was a little bit bigger. That was my, you know, I'm starting to go down now, because I want to start going up in December again, because I like to stay well padded for the winter. It's nice to be warm. And then sometimes I tell women to start gaining weight in December. You know, you hold it, you know, December and January, you gain it. You hold it through February and March, and you start losing it. So bikini season, you can wear them. And then you go back up again.

Q: Did the animals in nature do that?

A: Pardon?

Q: Did the animals in nature do that?

A: No. Well, yeah, they will, but they'll wear heavier coats, and they'll put on more weight. Yeah, they do it. But on this diet, you know, your body, your instincts tell you, yeah, I'm not hungry anymore. I don't want to eat anymore. I don't give a shit. If I say, if you're not vomiting, you're eating. And that's what I tell these people, especially the skinny ones. One fellow came to me. He was 6 foot tall. He weighed 123 pounds. I only have 10 steps up to my office door. He was exhausted, and he was standing like this. And I opened the door, and, you know, he took a minute. He goes, and he threw his arm forward to get the momentum to step forward, and that's the way he walked in. He was like that. He sat down, and I said, well, obviously you're not eating. He said, well, I've been a vegetarian. I said, obviously you're not a raw one, or else you'd have an appetite. He said, no, I've been a cooked food vegetarian. I lived in an ashram in India for four years, five years. And he said, I've been weak ever since. He says, I've gone to the medical doctors. They can't figure out why I have the chronic fatigue. They can't find anything wrong. He's been to acupuncturists, herbologists, everybody, on medication. Nothing worked. So he said, I have no appetite. I said, I don't care, James. If you're not vomiting, you're eating. That means I want you to keep stuffing it down you, even if you feel like you're nauseous and you don't want to eat. Well, the point when you actually start doing that, then you stop. You don't want to bring it up, but that's the point when you stop. Nine months later, 60 pounds heavier, he's got the biggest smile on his face, red and full of color, and before he was as white as that blouse there. And I'm not kidding, he was that white. And I should have brought the pictures. I've got lots of pictures to show you. Anyway, the difference is astounding in a nine-month period. Astounding. And I have a lot of people that go through this if they will force themselves to eat beyond that point. There was one person in here that had [unintelligible]. Oh, right there, yeah. He says he gets to a point and he feels that, you know, he doesn't want to eat more. I say ignore that. Push it. You will get well faster. I've been doing this a lot of years. Like I say, the people who go with that instinct stay trim but don't get well as quickly. Push it. You will advance yourself quickly. Now, when I was 55, I mean, when I was 30 years old and doing all that exercise, I was only 160 pounds. I had a chest much bigger than I have now. Thighs bigger than I have now. Waist about the same. And I was only 160 pounds. I'm 184 pounds. Everything gets very dense and very heavy and it does it about a pound a year. So you will be at the same size that you were the year before at a pound more the next year. So you keep adding that. That seems to be the sequence. So you want to keep adding an extra pound when you push your weight up. I used to go up from 155 to 175, 180. Now I have to go all the way up to 190, 195. Put on that extra weight.

Now if you see my eyes, my eyes used to be mainly brown with a little green. Now my eyes are bright blue because they got rid of almost all the toxicity. There's only one small brown spot left. And that's right here where they gave me all those injections at 10 years old. All the thimerosal stored right in here in this area. And this is the only place that causes me severe pain at times when I'm detoxing that. And lots of scar tissue still in the body. But I got rid of most of the plaquing and the cholesterol and the toxicity in the system that was residual waste products that accumulate in the body. Especially the advanced glycation end products from eating carbohydrates, especially cooked carbohydrates. So I was able to get rid of most of that. Now what I have is lots of scar tissue still left. I got rid of 70% of that off my spine by going into spinal meningitis. Doctors who [unintelligible] spinal meningitis are talking death 60-70% of the time. That's because they treat you with medications, but they still say you're going to die if you don't have your medication. Spinal meningitis is the one difficult disease if you get it that is a massive detox. If it is a bacterial, virus, the doctors freak out even worse because it's very aggressive. Use the solvent process, like I say, to dissolve compounds in the body. The body can do it like the virus do. The virus is not alive. There are protein bodies, part of the solvent process to dissolve. But if you're just using the basic solvent process, the body will go in and clean out things. One of the byproducts is identical to turpentine, and it's as toxic. It creates low-grade nausea, lethargy, and depression, feeling blase. When your body uses the next stage, stage 2 of cleansing, you can use bacteria, virus, or molds to help you. They work 2.5 times faster than your body can use the solvent process. Plus, it's 50% less toxic, the byproducts, than the turpentine-like substance. So, the virus, bacteria, and molds are very helpful, even candida. They feed on the degenerative tissue that's in the body. They help you get rid of it quicker. You can be very uncomfortable at times. If you go on this diet, handle pneumonia, you go to work. If you're not so fatigued, you can't go to work. Spinal meningitis and cerebral meningitis is another case. Most people do not function.

Q: You said there's a couple categories going into that now. What's the solvent process?

A: Solvent is 80% fat, 15% amino acid, 5% alcohol. We make solvents like we make to dissolve wood, metal, and aluminum.

Q: What are we doing on this diet? Is it a solvent process?

A: You can use all. Hopefully. Unless you've had chemotherapy and severe bouts with antibiotics that store in the system. Chemotherapy stores in the system, in the tissues, and so does antibiotics. So if you have a bacteria or a mold in the body, those antibiotics and that chemotherapy or any other chemical in your body, even mercury, can keep your body... It will poison the mold and the bacteria so it can't help you. It can also do that to parasites. It will destroy them so you don't get the help, so your life will be slow to wellness. Yes.

Q: So if you're speaking of scar tissue as almost not being permanent or even part of your body, like your body knows this is scar tissue and this is normal tissue.

A: Okay. Look at this. Do you see that scar very well now?

Q: Yep.

A: See this? I don't know if the light's... Okay. See this scar? It's really due to the vagotomy pyloroplasty. [unintelligible] ulcer and the stomach cancer. When it keloided, it became tumorous. It was this wide and this high. This is how much it reduces. It keeps reducing every year. Underneath it was the same way. It was just like a rock. There's a little lump here left and that's about it. It's all soft on the inside. Scar tissue doesn't have to remain. Nothing remains. If you're on a good diet, you can clean anything out. But scar tissue, obviously, is one of the last things to go. And it takes 40 years. Some of you say, oh my God, 40 years? It takes 40 years to go from ill health to optimal health. You have to think about it. It took you 21 years to develop, to finish your growth pattern. It also takes 21 years to break it down. So you've got 40 years there. I'm only halfway. I started eating raw meat on a daily basis December of 82. Next month, I will have been on this diet 20 years. When I started eating the meat regularly, that was a big difference. I'm only halfway. I see the scar tissue that's left in the body. I may be able to do it in 10 years, 15 years instead of another 20, because of what I've learned in the last 10 years. To be able to push it with the extra fat to gain the weight. And it's working. So you may be able to push it, but just consider that it takes 40 years. There's no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow. You get better every day. Your body gets healthier every day. Not one case, not one incidence of anybody being on this diet got worse. No matter if they had terminal cancer and they didn't live, they still felt and looked better doing the diet before their death. And their life got a little bit easier. So even though it may take a long time to get to the ultimate goal, each day is a better day for your body. Sometimes it doesn't feel like it, like if you're going through spinal meningitis, or cerebral meningitis, because you feel like you're coughing your whole body out of yourself. I mean, I would use bath towels and fill them with green mucus that was full of gangrenous tissue. Because the brain mainly discharges its poisons, if you don't have tonsils, into the lymph glands, out the mucus membranes, and you spew it out through the mucus. Mucus is very important. We've got Arnold Ehret, who says, mucusless diet, now we'll try spewing without mucus. Try having sex without mucus. It won't be any fun. Nor will eating food. You'll just strip your throat. You've got to have mucus for everything. Every mucus membrane in the body needs mucus. You need tons of mucus. Especially if you've been on a cooked diet most of your life. You need the mucus to discharge the brain tissue. And your body will use every part of itself as a bowel. So, I'm not uncorrect by saying we're all assholes. Because we use the tear ducts to discharge poisons. We use the earwax. We use the gums. We use the salivary glands. We use the tongue. You know, when you have all that plaquing on your teeth? Most of that is toxic metals, minerals coming out of the brain. A lot of electromagnetic transmissions going on. Where do you think the waste products go? Because we have so many of them when we cook food.

They have to discharge out the mouth. Causes all that plaque on the teeth. Some people say, well, it's natural. Other animals don't have to brush their teeth. On this guy, you're going to have to for 40 years to clean it all out. Because other animals don't eat cooked food unless they're domesticated animals. And they have the same plaque on their teeth and the same cavities. ild animals do not have cavities. As long as their food chain hasn't been disrupted with poisons. They have no dental caries. Eskimo. First dental caries was discovered in 1886. It was 50 years after using sugars and breads that the Germans and British brought. The first case of cancer was until 1936 in the Eskimos. Those people lived 99% on raw animal matter until the Germans brought over their cauldrons in the early 1800s. No diseases. The Maasai tribe, the Samburu, and the Fulani tribe in Africa eat only raw foods. Fulani tribe mainly lives on raw milk. Completely healthy individuals. No plaquing. No heart disease. No degenerative disease. The only thing they have is discolored skin. Discolorations of skin. It's the only differentiation they have. The Maasai eat mainly raw meat. Three months out of the year they mix raw blood and raw milk together because when the cows are calving, of course, they can't take as much milk. So they'll bleed a bull and use 50-50 milk and blood. They'll take a bamboo shoot, they'll cut a sharp angle on it, wedge on it, and they take like a huge slingshot and they'll shoot right into the jugular vein of the bowl. And they'll put a cork in it and they'll bleed that animal for about three days. And then they'll pick another bull and do it. And, you know, it sounded pretty disgusting to me because I've had blood, you know, I've killed animals and drained and not very appetizing, but when you're starving, it's nice. So the Brownsville Indians is the first time I came across that in the mid-70s, but they wouldn't share it with me because I wasn't a member of the Aki tribe, but they let me watch the ceremony. So two years ago I was in Hawaii, and there's a whole community that used to be vegan, that a few of them weren't on my diet because they had such a problem with the vegan diet. And some of them were on what's called the Instincto diet, where they eat only what appeals to their senses. And that's mainly fruit. Everybody was eating these sweet fruits, so they ate 60% of the diet was fruit. Deteriorating the body, they had lots of staph infection, sores all over themselves in a hot climate like that, in the jungles, you know, where they live. A couple of them got on the diet. Within six months they had changed completely. Everybody saw those changes. I mean, three communities within two years were on this primal diet instead of the vegan diet or the Instincto diet. And the raw food, fruitarian, vegetarian types all changed because it's so stable. Anyway, when I went there to, well, I have lots of patients in all the islands, and they all come to one island when I go there. And we got a goat and we slaughtered it. We made a harvest for it and spun it around in the tree until it went to sleep. And then I cut its jugular, had a bowl of milk, the goat's milk in it, underneath it, and drained the blood into it. And we had 15 people all together at this ceremony. And we had some drummers, you know, they did very fine.

And some people put the blood, you know, here and all this. It was very interesting. Four of the people, four or five of them, were strict vegetarians. And we had, by the time we finished draining the animal, we had a gallon of blood mixed with a gallon of milk. So we had two gallons. So we were all going to share, you know, an old tribal sensation, experience. So, you know, the lead of the man who put Pangaia together was drinking, or the brother of it, he was drinking it first. Everybody was, you know, expecting something horrible, you know. And all of a sudden you see the eyes go bright, you see him start guzzling it. You know, I did the same thing, you know. So the coagulated blood, you know. Not all that appealing. And it tastes like ice cream. It has no relationship to what you think it would be like to eat. It's exactly like ice cream.

Q: What flavor?

A: Vanilla. Vanilla. And I mean, we had 45 minutes, these non-vegetarians and the vegetarians and the non-vegetarians, had consumed those two gallons. Couldn't stop drinking it. Passed around, waiting to get it again. It was so incredible. Changes it entirely. So anyway, the Maasai tribe eat that way three times a year when the calves are nursing from the cows so they don't get enough milk. And they live in the desert, so, you know, they're very thin. They're the tallest race. They're also the smartest race and the most agile, and they have the greatest stamina. All they eat is raw meat, raw milk. In three months out of the year, the raw blood mixture, the milk. None of those tribes have any degenerative diseases. The Maasai started having troubles when, what was their name, out on a limb, Shirley MacLaine went over there. She took candy to them, started bringing all this bad food, and they started getting dental caries, having emotional problems, infighting.

[audio cut]

A: ...rituals for them, but they are not allowed within our area, and it's maintained to this day. It's been about 18 years now, because they saw what happened. But those three tribes have no degenerative disease, and they only eat the raw foods. Okay, back to the detoxification process. As I said, the first level is where your body makes the solvents from the fats and proteins in the alcohol, from the fermenting carbohydrates in the intestines. Remember, that's a very slow process, and it has a turpentine-like substance, which is very toxic. Hard to handle, takes a lot of fats, a lot of nutrients and proteins to arrest everything. Then you have the bacteria, the molds, and the virus. The virus is basically like the solvent level, but it works much more radically. It's not alive, it's not like the bacteria, the molds, which are alive and grow. In fact, the virus is not a living body, but it acts like a solvent, it's much more aggressive. The third plane is parasites. Parasites will clean your body out five times faster, the degenerative tissue. It doesn't feed on inorganic substances, but the actual dead cells, dissolved cells, scar tissue in the body, it will feed on. It works five times faster than the body will use the solvent process. And it's a hundred times less toxic. That's why most people who have parasites have not a clue that they have parasites. The only danger is that if you're not eating proteins that will help you regenerate cells or take live cells from one area or other dead cells like scar tissue, you can block up an area that has an ulcer in it because the parasites have eaten very rapidly and left an ulcer. And you're not able to regenerate. Then there's gut exchange, could be peritonitis, could cause paralysis, death. But in any of my laboratory experiments with animals who had parasites, and we had 32 of them, not one of them died who only ate the raw meat and had no dewormers. We had three groups. One group ate regular kibble and canned food with both cats, people with cats and dogs in each group, in the three groups. And we didn't spike them. When you give an animal worms or any kind of a disease, it's called spiking. We did not spike these animals. We put an ad in the paper that said, we are looking for animals that already have been diagnosed with parasites, that have not taken any medication yet, dewormers. We need those animals, and we will try to get them well. So we got about 32 all together. We got a little bit more, but we took 32. And they were all different kinds of parasites. We couldn't find enough to, you know, just isolate one parasite. So we had about six different parasites in these animals, and we would section them off into the groups equally. And the first group, we fed the kibble, the canned food, and gave one part of that group, half of that group, medical dewormers, pharmaceutical dewormers, and the other half of the group, herbal or homeopathic dewormers. The second group got only raw foods. Part of the group got the pharmaceutical dewormers. The other half of the group got the homeopathic and or herbal dewormers. The third group got no dewormers, only got the raw food. The death rate in the first group was about 60%, even with the dewormers. The group that got the pharmaceutical and herbal dewormers had about 50% death instead of 60% of the pharmaceutical dewormers. 

Before they died, they had more energy, they weren't as lethargic, but they were still not very happy, not very active creatures. Those on the raw diet that got the dewormers looked resilient, got healthy pretty quickly, looked pretty well. Those that were only eating the raw foods and got no dewormers, they took up to six months, about five and a half months, to recover from the worms. But when they completed their cycle about two months later after no signs of worms, they were like puppies and kittens. None of them were under 12 years old. None of them was under 12 years old. Some of them were as old as 16. Everyone in that third group that only had the raw meats and no dewormers got so much healthier that they were like puppies and kittens. When they all died, we followed them for about three and a half years. Those that died, autopsies were performed. The tissue was much more resilient than in those in the second group in their lifespan. So that's how I was able to prove that the parasites work five times faster than the bacteria or virus or molds in the body. As long as you're eating the raw meat to regenerate the cells to fill in, the [unintelligible] were parasite-free, rapidly. So don't be afraid of all these things. Hulda Clark, you know? Has anybody seen Hulda Clark in person?

Q: Yes.

Q: Who is she?

A: Hulda Clark, she's the woman who... She comes in that group as well. Yeah, she's the woman who believes that parasites are the problem, all problems in the world are parasites and mold. If you get rid of them, you get rid of the disease. She doesn't realize they're the cleanup crew. She calls them the problem.

Q: What do they do after they're done cleaning?

A: They just go dormant. Now, in one test to prove that worms were part of flesh in general, part of all animal tissue, was I took... We went into a laboratory. It was completely sterile, the walls, everything. $2,000 sterilized this one room. And we took an animal that was completely sterilized and cleaned and brought him in, butchered him in the room, took the flesh, put it in a medically sealed environment. Everything was done with gloves that had no powder on them. Everything was completely clean, so there was no residue. Nothing could get in. The only ventilation from one room to the other to where this meat was in this closed, hermetically sealed environment was a shaft going to several plants, corn dracaenas, which put off oxygen. And there was two filters in between, two HEPA filters that were pretty thick, about an inch and a half each, so that no bacteria, nothing could pass through to get onto this meat, this section of meat. It was a center-cut meat, not near the intestines. It was down below, I think around the rump. So it was away from the spine. It was away from the tissue in general. Any tissue, it would be more prone to have parasites. And all of the testing was done to show that there were no parasites in the blood, in the meat, from biopsies. So we put this chunk of meat in a hermetically sealed container, kept it at the animal's normal body temperature, which was about 96.8. And worms developed, spontaneously erupted, about five days later, between three and five days later. Parasites, worms, are a natural part of any animal tissue. If you have enough of it, they come out to help you. They'll eat up that degenerative tissue, help you do the cleaning. Like I said, the solvent process, if you have to use that process, slowly, it's going to take a very long time, and it's going to be depressing on you psychologically in every way. When you have the parasites, the bacteria, especially the parasites, and the molds to help you, you move through it quicker. People get happier so much better. Like the one fellow I said was so thin, he had parasites all over his body. You know, he wasn't functioning. But when I told him to force himself to eat within nine months, he was normal. He was a normal, functioning individual. This man was 30 years old, 30 years old. His mother made a comment to me. She called and she said, it's unbelievable. This man, his whole life, would call me and say, hi, Mom, his whole life. He was just a melancholy, kind of depressed being. She says, now he calls and says, hi, Mom! You know, he's got all this energy and feels good. Let me tell you, the people who would not force themselves to eat like that do not have that kind of recovery. Fat is so important to clean you out and protect you and give you strength. So if you have a severe problem, push it. Push it. Even if you don't have a severe problem, push it. Yes?

Q: Did you investigate sweating as a means of cleansing?

A: Yes. You know, you have the pores of the body. I was just talking about the brain and where detox is here. But your skin is the bigger bowel than the one inside. Because you discharge a lot of poisons out the hair. You build toxic minerals and proteins into the hair. It's one reason that there's hair loss and hair grains. Because all the toxic metals, they get dumped and built into the hair and damage the follicles as it passes out. It also destroys the para-aminobenzoic acid glands within the follicle. The para-aminobenzoic acid, which is a B vitamin, controls hair coloration or pigmentation of skin and hair. So it damages that. There's heavy metals, mercury, aluminum, lead, cadmium, all of those. So that's usually what causes discoloration. After the chemotherapy, you can imagine how many alkaloids are in chemotherapy. That's why people who have chemotherapy, most of the time when their hair drops out, it's a metal poisoning that does it. And then when they get their hair back, it may be stringy or gray, and you've got very bad hair days for the rest of your life. My hair came in in patches and was all gray [unintelligible]. Now, periodically, I'll go through heavy graying. Four years ago, five years ago, I had a whole patch here, completely gray. Six months later, the color came back. This was all gray in here two years ago. Now it's turned into a small portion here. It comes and it goes as my body starts discharging. Now, women, we know that scientifically women live 20% longer lives than men. Do you know the only scientific evidence that can be responsible for that is that women discharge 20% more mucus out the vaginal cavity. They discharge 20% more toxins. Women are lucky. They may not think so because they have to deal with, you know, all the discharge, but that discharge is a very great help on getting rid of poisons. A lot of mucus, a lot. And, of course, you have the bowel and the urinary tract is another way to discharge poisons, and now the nails, just like the hair, will discharge lots of poisons. If you've got lots of metals in your nails, they'll crack, they'll [unintelligible], they'll crease. It causes a general mineral deficiency. You need the good natural minerals to bind and chelate with the toxic metals in your blood and in the serum, in the systems. So that's why I said in the first book that ridges in the nails means that you're mineral deficient because you have too many poisons that are using up the minerals in the body. Now, as far as the detoxification process, if you want to have less fat hanging, then you eat most of your fat with a meat meal.

[laughter]

A: If you eat a major, let's say 80% of the fats that you eat, if you eat them with your meat, that means beef, buffalo, lamb, chicken, turkey, any kind of fowl, any kind of seafood, the fat will store in the muscles. Now, I don't exercise. I'm not kidding. I take a walk once a month, once every two months. Or maybe every two months I'll stand up and do this. This may be my exercise for the month, standing up here. So you don't see the fat hanging around here, because I eat 90% of my fat with my meat. So it goes all throughout, and I'm 27% fat. 27% fat. My body is 27% fat. Look, it's solid. Because I eat the fat with the meat. It does that.

Q: What are you supposed to be?

A: Men are supposed to be around, let's say, 16% to 17%. Women, around 21%.

Q: That's according to...

A: According, yes. Right. It's all, again, fictitious. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's if you're a marathon runner. But you notice that your weightlifters are all fat. You don't see a thin weightlifter, because they need the fat for the strength. Bodybuilders are all muscle. They're all, you know, protein powders and stuff. And let me tell you, when they go... When they stop working out, everything melts. Because it's not good, stable protein. It's all from protein powders. Solvent extracted, mainly from soy, which is a poison in the human body. So they just melt. But on this diet, I haven't exercised at all. And you see the solidness of it. All of the weightlifters are fat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They've got all these fat around there, all around and within the muscles. Your weightlifters don't. It's purely buff and they don't have the stamina. But your weightlifters, you see them in the Olympics? They're fat. They've got all this extra. They've got all this extra fat because that's good energy. Even your sumo wrestlers. They wouldn't have to get that big to be that strong. I showed them yesterday without even working out. I had the strength of people who normally worked out.

Q: How do athletes do on this diet?

A: I was telling you earlier about the guy with his heart level. I have a marathon runner in New York City. After three to three and a half months on the diet, cut 40 minutes off of his time. A marathon runner in Las Vegas that cut 20 minutes off of his time after two and a half months.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Gain.

Q: Can you just say soy is a poison to the human body?

A: Soy is a poison to the human body. Even if you eat cooked soy, it's a poison to the human body. It has to be solvent extracted and processed. Highly processed for the body. That's why so many cancers are developing in high protein diets.

Q: Why is it a poison?

A: Because it just has that, it has several enzymes in the bean, which are poisonous.

Q: Enzyme inhibitors?

A: Well, all grains have enzyme inhibitors, but there is a poison enzyme. In fact, most legumes are poisonous to the human body. Even if you germinate them and eat them, you will have diarrhea and stomach cramping and you may not believe for three days you think you're going to die. But soy is the most deadly.

Q: But don't eat tofu.

A: No, tofu is cooked, garbage processed, solvent extracted garbage.

Q: There is a company called Sunrider.

A: I know. I know the company.

Q: So that's...

A: It's all false. They have no long-term effects, they're showing short-term effects, and they're eliminating all those animals that come up with the disease.

Q: I just might... everybody might be interested in this, but there's a quotation from the Greek mathematician, philosopher, [unintelligible], from several thousand years ago. He said that beans were the final representation that evil exists in the universe.

A: Yeah, because they killed a lot of people. Beans killed a lot of people.

Q: So you don't advocate Mexican food, I take it.

A: Well, cooked, it breaks down some of those enzymes. But still, you know, it was not good, you know, over the long run. Because the proteins could cause other diseases like cancer. Especially the soy, because of the high estrogen-encouraging effects of it, the hormone-producing effects of it. So it's been known to create a lot more breast cancer in women who eat soy. The highest rate of breast cancer is in my clients who were vegetarian and lived on tofu and soy.

Q: What?

A: Who lived on tofu and soy. Highest rate of breast cancer in women that came to me for dietary stuff. Most of them had breast cancer and ate tofu.

Q: Can you [unintelligible]?

A: Asians only use soy as a sauce. They never use tofu. They didn't use it as a cheese. They didn't use it as a meat. That's all garbage and hype. They only have a little bit, tablespoon a day is the average.

Q: Who's behind all the garbage?

A: Soybean is the easiest crop to grow and it's easy and cheap. They have chemicals that can dissolve it and eliminate the so-called poisonous factors. It's a money maker. Incredible money maker.

Q: So this [unintelligible], the head of that company, he's a pharmacist, along with his wife, who's an American [unintelligible], have been scamming the whole world with that tax?

A: No, they are scammed too. Well, they are scammed. They obviously believe it. They are scammed. They believe it. They have to believe it. They are scammed. They believe it.

Q: And where do you have the information to refute that?

A: I've got it in several places. No, I didn't put any of it specifically. That's going in the two books, not the next one, but the two following that, with questions and answers. But you can find it. All you have to do is you can go to Mary Enig. You can go to Sally Fallon. You can go to Price Pottenger Foundation. You can go to Weston Price Foundation. They wrote an article called Soy Boy. And they've got like 30 test results and all kinds of information.

Q: [unintelligible] one of the acrobatics movement in the 70s, he definitely came out and said nobody should eat soy. And he's an oriental. 

A: Very nasty stuff.

Q: [unintelligible] My son, he actually took a lighter and burned the top of his skin because he couldn't get rid of the warts. He was so aggravated. He was going to college at the time. [unintelligible] My son took it for about a month or so. I called him up and said, [unintelligible].

A: I said, solvents use proteins, amino acids. The solvent-extracted protein in a soy makes a great solvent. But it won't stop it just dissolving your warts. It'll dissolve lots of tissue in your body. Not just the bad stuff.

Q: If the person excluded soy, and they followed a raw vegan. What weakness would it have compared to eating raw meat? Well, they also talk about detoxing and the whole thing.

A: Right. Well, any time you have pain, any time you have discomfort, any time you have discharge, it's always a detox. The body's throwing off some poison. Period. That's it. I don't care what diet you're on. On this diet, the only difference is when you cleanse, you cleanse properly. You remove the poisons properly if you've got enough fat and eating enough, on the body and eating enough. And your body will heal. Those people, I would say 50% of my clientele that come to me have been fruitarians or vegetarians, even raw fooders. They get their teeth to disintegrate, their bones disintegrate, osteoporosis, all kinds of diseases. Same thing was said yesterday at Washington University. They're following medical universities. They're following raw food vegetarians, and they're finding the rate of osteoporosis is astronomical in that group. And the plaquing. There's still plaque all over the system, even though they're not eating meat. They're eating all these vegetable oils. And according to some of the scientists out there, your vegetable oils cause more plaquing than the animal fats even when cooked. Because you take the resin of a tree, and what does it do? It crystallizes and hardens like amber. Amber is a sap from a tree. That's an oil from a tree, and it's a rock. And it crystallizes in the body. It causes more placking than anything else. There was very little arterial congestion and heart disease until the processed oil industry came in, Preston Processed Oil Industry came in, especially after hydrogenation. Then the fat molecule links became very, very, very elongated. Not malleable at all, so they would just congest everything. And 50% of the vegetarians that come to me, come to me with cancer. And 90% of those ate soy and tofu. In the worst cases, ate soy and tofu. I remember one mother, I mentioned her in the book, she ate tofu for 14 years. She had 63 tumors in her body.

Q: I believe there's even a lot of research, even in the holistic field and traditional, that the soy, a lot of people say, well, the Japanese, they don't have cancers. And yet, the amount of soy they ate was so minimal.

A: Yeah, we mentioned that before.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, the alcohol has a tendency to break down the fats, but also it makes the minerals a little bit, I mean the amino acids a little bit more radical in their solvent reaction.

Q: Alcohol is good, huh?

A: French sure worked with it well. They had to eat lots of fat. As long as they drank their wine, it would protect their brains. Civilizations who don't eat a lot of fat and drink, they're like the wine [unintelligible]. They lose their brain cells. But I'm not saying that alcohol is good for you, because even if you have a lot of fat, unless you're mixing it with the fat, it's going to destroy liver tissue and nerve tissue instantly. There's no way it's digested. It penetrates and just enters the cell. It eats right into it. Nerve cells and liver cells. 

Q: So Kahlúa and cream is okay?

A: There's a lot less damage. If you had to do something like that, that would be preferable.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes. Soy seeds can.

Q: Even if we use the raw bean.

A: You can't have it raw. Did you ever eat raw soybeans? It would kill you. You've had them steamed or toasted?

Q: Roasted. Sprouted.

A: Oh, you sprouted it. Sprouted soybeans.

Q: Well, but no. I'm talking a little... Toasted, it sprouts a little bit.

A: Yeah, that's sprouted. Most soybeans will cause people a lot of sickness. Even that way. But you don't look too well, so... You may have a lot of toxins stored in your body.

Q: Oh, well, you'll tell me later on.

A: You've got that much fat on you for a reason. You've got poisons stored in your body.

Q: Oh, yeah, tell me about it. I understand detoxes. Hey, with the chemicals that we put on... I mean, it's very rare to find organically. [unintelligible]

A: Oh, yes, it's the bean itself.

Q: And so when we're feeding the beans to the animals...

A: Now, cows, horses, those animals have all the enzymes to handle the soybeans perfectly. Chickens do not. Chickens, like humans, will be poisoned by it. So the only way you can feed the soybean to a chicken or a bird is to process it, solve and extract it. So it's not a raw substance. So if your chickens are eating soy protein, it is garbage. We've got a company in California called Rosy. They call their chicken organic. So I call it, you know, it's very white, you know, even the red meat's white. It tastes a little like paste. And I call the company, I say, what are you feeding this? Oh, it's all organic. And I say, yeah, well, what are you feeding? Well, it's 75% to 80% soy. I say, wait a minute, you don't feed raw soybeans to chickens or any fowl. And they said, no, it's processed, of course. I say, wait a minute, you have to solvent extract. There's no water process for soybeans or for any beef. You have a petroleum product that has to break it down. And they said, yeah. I said, this is no longer organic. And you're not even feeding the animal raw foods. So what we opted for, and of course, we can't have everything perfect, what we opted for was Rocky Jr., which means there's 75% to 80% raw corn and only about 15% that's soy protein. So we take the best that we can. So at least the Rocky tastes rich and alive. So we do the best we can. So also in this diet, when you go through a detox, like pneumonia, you can function. You can go ahead and go to work. People around you will be afraid because they're also bacteria and viral-phobic right now. They see you hacking and continue working, responding, working on it. They don't want you to come to work, but you can still work on this diet. But if you're going to have a spinal meningitis, a cerebral meningitis, it will take you down. I had one woman that got it, probably one of the sicker women that's come to me. She went through spinal meningitis and she was down for six weeks. But now...

Q: [unintelligible] a doctor?

A: No. Oh, but the doctor came to her. See, she's a famous director, movie director, film director, won awards. So when she went in to her ex-husband and her 15-year-old son started freaking out, the famous MD for the stars came to her and said, you've got to get to the hospital. You're in bad shape. You're going to die. She didn't listen to him, stayed there, and got well.

Q: Six weeks?

A: Yeah, six weeks. But she was this very skinny, skinny, skinny woman, frightfully thin. She got very large. I mean, especially here at the end of the spine, because I had her eating three lubrication formulas a day, which meant three sticks of butter a day, plus raw cream. So in that six weeks, she went from this very skinny thing to this woman with all this cellulite and everything. She couldn't get into her clothes, and when she finally got out of bed, she started crying. She said, I'd rather be dead than look like this. You wait three months, it'll be gone, and you'll be gorgeous. She said, no man's ever going to look at me.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: He wrote her a prescription, but she didn't get it, though. And she didn't go to the hospital, either, like the doctor recommended. Pardon? Well, there are volunteers on this side in Los Angeles that have, we get together in groups. We have potlucks once a month. I only attend one every two months because that's the big one. But there are smaller groups that get together every month, and then every two months we have a big one, anywhere from 45 to 80 people. And of those groups, there are some people that have their lives changed so much, including a woman who's an attorney that's near 60 years old, and her whole life turned around. She was a scrawny little thing. Now she's buff. She goes to work sad. She loves all this stuff. But we have a lot of very educated people who are volunteers. So when we have somebody like that who's in a bad shape, which rarely happens, maybe two in a year, people buy the food for them, will juice for them, and take them the food. So there will be one volunteer which will juice, one volunteer which will go buy the food, another volunteer which will collect it all, take it to the individual, and sit with them. You know, for hours and hours, and help them through it, and stay there. You know, some of them will stay there eight hours at a time and have shifts. So there are volunteers who do that. [unintelligible] like these that we want to help out. So two and a half months later, she's still fuller than she's ever been. She doesn't think she looks attractive. Her ex-husband and all the men in her life have all been assholes. Of course, she wasn't a very great person either because she was too skinny and freaked out and over-emotional about everything. So now she's this calm person, delighted and happy, enjoys everything she does. She's got a boyfriend who's ten years older and has sex with her, ten years younger than her and has sex with her three or four times a day. She is in heaven. And she's not attractive. Her body is not attractive. But because she feels so good, she is so happy, there's a radiance about her. And we've got five women in L.A. which were ultra-skinny and believed in the no-man's-ever-going-to-look-at-me, you know, syndrome. And now have men ten years younger. Why these particular women, four or five of them, have guys ten years younger? Just those four women, five women, just those five, each of them has a man ten years younger. Don't know why. Nature, the psyche, the universe is showing them, you know, that it doesn't work that way. They all have great men. So, we need to get rid of it. I know, looking in this room, I don't have that big a problem. Because obviously people don't mind being heavier and adjusted to it, and that's a good thing. I want to tell you another episode, another thing. This woman who thought she was very healthy had her blood checked. She went to a dark field microscope tester, a microscopist, and had her blood checked. And the slimmer woman, who was buff and felt really energetic, had really sticky, contaminated blood. Everything was, you know, everything was sticking to the blood cells, so nothing was functioning very well. And the woman who was your size, who was jollying, her blood was just as clean as it needed to be. And I said, well, there you go. She has the fat to bind with all the poisons. You have none. It goes right into your cells, damages and sticks onto your cells. 

Get the fat on your body. Let the fats protect you. Take care of it. That's the whole point. You know, in 40 years, we can be like, you know, the Maasai, the skinny, beanpole look, you know, and be healthy. But until you get clean, your body's going to be damaged by the poisons in it. And with this kind of pollutants that are in the air, I don't know that we'll ever be able to be thin like the Maasai or the Samburu. The Fulani are all very thin, too. No, the Fulani, well, no, the Fulani are not thin. They're the ones that mainly need, I mean, milk, and they're not thin. But the Fulani, the Samburu, and the Maasai are thinner, but they don't have all the pollution. So count on being overweight. I'm overweight, according to the charts. I had this extra little fold here a month ago, just a little larger, but I don't care.

Q: But don't your ideas of fat and skinny also change? Like, recently I watched a little bit of clips about models and stuff, wherever it was. They look so freaking skinny, they don't look healthy.

A: Poisons go right in and damage the live cells. That's why they're so temperamental. Twiggy. Everybody remember Twiggy? That was the one that started it? I had one date with her. I took her to the premier of... My publicity agent at the time, who was the head of MGM Publicity. He asked me to take her on a date, so we limo'd and all that. So we go into the theater, and the Avco Cinema was just built in Westwood. New Avco Cinema 3, one of the first multi-theaters in Los Angeles. This is in 1972, I think. And so we limo'd there, and she's kind of a fine person. Driver [unintelligible]. You sure have a cute face but you ain't no Marilyn Monroe. She went into stitches. But when we got finished, I didn't want to go through all the cameras and all that stuff. So I wanted to go out the back way. I was diseased and sick, so I didn't want to get into the cameras. So I'm walking her out the back. And the theater isn't completely finished. So the hallways where you go out the back, it's just stone or concrete. It's kind of unfinished with things lying around all over. And I said, oh, Jesus, I hope that doesn't lock on us, and I hope we can get out of here. She freaked out, absolutely. Look, we're stuck in here. And for five minutes, she's screaming, screaming. And, you know, I said, let me just go test the door. It's open. See, it's open. And I had to do that to calm her down. And I realized that every time I went out with a thin woman, I had the same— there was over-emotionality. Things seemed to be much more desperate. Of course, they had no fat to buffer any of the electromagnetic energy that goes to the brain. So they're much more emotional. They're much more inclined to take something to an extreme.

Q: And you suffer anxiety attacks and other— 

A: Yes, anxiety. You know, so I won't get near a thin woman. I won't. I won't do it. I only know two that are coherent. So, you know, it's difficult. I won't even date them. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, the people who are already overweight, what I suggest they do is they go on the diet for six months. Don't gain any more weight. Just stay stable. Eat all the fats. If you gain two, five, ten more pounds, that's okay. And then, after that six months eating the diet, you go on a weight loss program that's in the book. The recipe book. And it'll start knocking it off. So you take off, let's say, 25 of those pounds. Let's say you're 60 pounds overweight. You take off 25 pounds the first time. Then you go up another 15. And then you take it off another 25. And then you work your way down. Some women, even though they're overweight, they'll go up, you know, four or five pounds. And then they'll go down 15 or 12. And then they can't take off anymore. The body says, no, no, no. I've got too toxic poisons to remove in the system. So they have to go back up again and work their way down slowly.

Q: I've been 80% on the diet for a little over a year now. And I've put on 15 pounds. And I have kept track of when I have put it on. Only when I ate, when I become not so good with my carbs, did I put on weight. And you, bless you, you gave me the perfect excuse. I'm happy with my state. And you had talked about the starch is helping you control the hormones. I'm also 46 years old. Gave me the perfect excuse. And I very seriously, only when I go nuts on carbohydrates, have I ever put on any weight. I can eat all the raw meat. I can eat all the honey. I can eat all the fat. I have never put on a single pound until I have gone... And bread, specifically bread. I can eat potatoes and it doesn't bother me. It's thin bread. And I can track it down. The times that I went nuts on the bread. And it takes about three days for it to show up. I stand on a scale and go...

A: You have to realize, even with the raw carbohydrates, those create, like I say in the new book, even those create natural raw carbohydrates, have a high rate of advanced glycation end product. When your body makes the glycogen from the carbs, there is a high rate of by-product, called advanced glycation end product. Columbia University found that in a healthy body, it stores at a rate of 70%. In an unhealthy body, it's a rate of 90%. So you figure, every time you eat a cooked carbohydrate, you know how radical it is, because you have the acrylamides and from cooking, the starches, the carbohydrates, and you have the advanced glycation end product collect together. It stores in the body like Coca-Cola. It causes melting of the tissue, the skin has to start sagging, because it just melts the tissue. When it stores up and collects for a lifetime. If it's even a raw food, you have a high rate of advanced glycation end product that collects. So that's why I suggest no more than 5% of your diet carbohydrate foods. That means one fruit a day. If you're diabetic, one food every two to three days.

Q: I don't understand why you have to put on weight to detox.

A: I just told you. You take the fat to detox properly.
 
Q: Yeah, but if you're eating the raw fat, it's helping to detox the raw fat. The toxins should be coming out. It shouldn't be storing on your body. I mean, how does accumulating fat help with the detox process?

A: Okay, you're building a house, right? You get all your lumber and all your tools and all your cement piled up over here. It doesn't all of a sudden go... magically appear every place and to be rebuilt. It takes time to dissolve those substances from where they've stored. You have to get them free, dissolve them, neutralize it, pass it through these different channels of the body through the lymph system and detox it. The lymph system is the most important system in the body. The lymph system not only feeds every cell in the body except for the red-white blood cells, it detoxes everything that's detoxed in the system. It feeds every cell except the red and white blood cells.

[audio cut]

A: The eyes, the ears, vaginal cavity, the urinary tract, the skin, the hair, nails, wherever it will send it. The lymph system is responsible for doing that. If you've got a congested lymph system, you're in trouble. A lot of people have a congested lymph system. Coconut cream is the best to get rid of and dissolve that. Especially in the afternoon in conjunction with a fruit. If you've got heavy metals in your body, berries and cream. Coconut cream. Coconut cream, you take the coconut meat and you juice it. Pulp comes out one end, the thick cream comes out the other. You mix that. If you're strong and healthy, you can have three ounces of coconut cream to one ounce of raw cream. I don't suggest that many people have or anybody have coconut cream by itself. Because coconut cream is 92% saturated fat. Saturated fat can almost always only be used as a solvent to dissolve poisons. So what's going to protect you? What's going to soothe your tissues around all this contamination? Raw cream or butter? Raw cream works a little bit better to protect the nerve tissue.

Q: Is that what causes it?

A: That's right. Because it all starts dissolving and you have nothing to bind with it. Harness it. Yes.

Q: So you've got to mix the raw cream with the coconut cream with the fruit?

A: No. Raw cream, raw cow's cream, raw coconut cream, and the fruit. The fruit will determine what you're going to detoxify. If you use berries, it helps get rid of metal. And also some mutant antigens or some mutant moles that may be in the body. If you have it with papaya, it's going to help clean out the elementary tract. The entire digestive system. If you have pineapples, it's going to help clean out the bones and the lymph system.

Q: So it means you use the Champion for the juicing process?

A: Not the best.

Q: What is the best?

A: The best is the Green Star 1000. The reason that the Champion is because in the shaft, I mean the gear that goes on the shaft, it has teeth, it's a masticator. So you put it in there, grind it fine, but the pulp has a tendency to get behind that gear and push forward so it blocks the pulp from coming out. So it causes it to be very hot in there. So when I used to use the Champion juicer with the coconut, I used to have to push down really hard and it would take some strength to do that. Push it down on the front to push that gear back onto the shaft better and then the pulp could come out freely. But that was a lot of work. With the Green Life juicer, you have to do a little bit more preparation only for coconut. You just have to slice it very thinly and put it in and it will just go in and jam it down. If you take big chunks of coconut and put it in the Green Star or the Green Life or the Green Power, it takes a lot of force. The Green Star, you don't have to do any preparation for the celery or the parsley or any leafy vegetables. If you have the parsley and you jam it down in with the curly leaves or any leaf vegetable on top, and you jam it down in there, it takes a lot of effort. But if you take the stalk in and put the stalk down in first and the leaves are up here, it gets caught in, there's two gears that grind it and crush it and it just pulls it down in. So it's effortless. Pulls it right down in there. Celery, just pull one down in and just push it down in. So easy.

Q: And Vitamix, do you like the Vitamix?

A: Vitamix is not a juicer. It's a blender. Remember, if you're blending in a bowl like this, what's sucking down into your food as it's blending?

Q: Air.

A: Oxygen. Guess what happens to your food? It oxidizes it. And guess what? You've lost a third of your nutrients by blending in a blender. And you haven't separated the pulp. So you're eating all the cellulose that we can't digest. We're not an herbivore. Herbivores have two to four stomachs. They'll eat some food, they'll go to one stomach and they'll regurgitate it, and then they'll chew it again, swallow, regurgitate it again, and chew it. Then after it passes through all the stomachs, it goes into their very long digestive tract, which is two and a half times longer than ours. It passes through their system in 48 hours. It passes through ours in 24. We digest one third of a vegetable. They digest 90%. And what happens is our bowel has to be completely acid, because E. coli, which is the final stage of digestion, has to live in an acid environment. If you eat whole vegetables, it turns the colon alkaline. Guess what happens? You get constipation. On this diet, if you eat all whole vegetables, you will get constipated, because it destroys the final end of digestion. The E. coli is responsible for 60-80% of the volume of fecal matter. And if you eat the vegetables, the whole vegetables, it destroys E. coli, so it can't build the fecal matter. So, on a cooked diet, it's fine, though, because you cook the meat, and the other foods that you're eating, cheese and stuff like it, so there's no vitamins and enzymes. So it sits there and starts putrefying. If you eat a salad with it, you've got some enzymes to start the pancreas working and start moving the meat through, the pulp. So you have an acid-alkaline balancing act going on. You can never stay ahead of, but at least it's a little bit better. On this diet, you don't eat vegetables and meat together. They neutralize each other. Nothing digests properly.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You eat animal products together, which is fine, any of them, and only a few fruits like tomatoes. You can eat more fruits with your white meats, but not the red meats. But that's explained in the book, in the second book.

Q: In the same with the idea that you don't start the meal with a little salad?

A: No salad meal. You've already destroyed your acid stomach.

Q: Okay, so you're saying you can give up all the vegetables.

A: You only have vegetable juice, is what I'm suggesting. And the vegetable juice is never within an hour of any other food, before or after. Except for raw cream, or raw coconut cream, or butter. Because the acids in the stomach are not responsible for the digestion of fats. The liver takes care of that. So it passes into the liver without regard whether it's acid or alkaline. So fats are the only thing, certain fats, are the only thing that can go with vegetable juice. But all that's explained in the recipe book.

Q: And what about people who are lactose intolerant?

A: I haven't met any.

Q: And how do you explain that? What do you mean?

A: Because they're lactate intolerant if they're eating pasteurized milk. If it's raw milk, they won't be. Now, a woman came to me about a month ago and said, if I give raw cow's milk to my baby, she gets this rash all over her. And I said, and it's raw? Yes, and it's even organic. It's organic pastures. I said, okay. And I said, are you feeding it to the baby cold? And she said, well, what does that matter? I said, well, if you don't leave it out so the bacteria start breaking it down, when it goes into the stomach, the stomach will contract. It won't secrete hydrochloric acid. When it passes into the duodenum, you're going to have undigested protein and lactate that gets into the blood. So that's not going to make a difference. She notified me on Thursday and said, you were right. She has no reaction to the raw milk as long as I warm it up for at least five hours. It's out of the refrigerator for five hours or longer. Should we all do better? I think everybody should do better. Because I don't see anybody here that's healthy enough to eat it cold raw, even if you had no reaction. It doesn't mean that the raw proteins, I mean that the undigested proteins involved and the sugars are not getting into your blood. Because when I've had blood analysis done, sure enough, it shows up in even people who don't react. So you're using a lot of the good fats that you're eating just to bind with those toxic substances. And they wouldn't be toxic if you just let it sit out for a while. It would be better if people didn't walk over there because other people lose information. Please.

Q: Yeah, I had a lot of it one time. My husband's family, they were farmers, so they were used to it. And so they had it one time at home, and I was supposed to sing on the church choir. [unintelligible] But I'm telling you, I turned so green, and I thought I was going to explode. And I suffered all these things. I had to get off those bleachers when we were singing in the church. So why that reaction?

A: Well, sometimes the fats will cause a detoxification of the liver, spleen, gallbladder, or pancreas. If you've got a lot of poisons in one of those, start pulling it out, especially in the nerve tissue of a raw milk, because raw cream has an affinity for the nervous system. So starts pulling the heavy metals out of the nerves or one of those glands. But it doesn't happen very often.

Q: But it would cause all the gas?

A: It would cause it temporarily. And for people like that, what I suggest that they do, if they have those reactions, only eat a half a cup a day for a month, and then increase it to a cup for another month, and a cup and a half for the third month, and usually it's over by then.

Q: I noticed that same reaction when I was doing hard-cooked and raw milk. I would get bloated and I was holding water and felt swollen. Once I went on the diet 100% raw, I don't bloat from it. So sometimes I think it's the combination of cooked food and raw milk.

A: [unintelligible] diet for two years?

Q: No. Since January, 100%. Almost a year.

A: Yeah. But before that, you were eating partially?

Q: Partially, yes. It was May.

A: Well, when she came to see me, it was a year ago.

Q: Yeah, about a year ago.

A: She looked ten years old. I nearly fainted when I saw her. She was very thin. Very thin.

Q: Where did you get this in the Midwest? It's difficult to get raw cream and raw butter.

A: Yeah, well, there are sources that will say, lots of Amish people who provide us dairy, and they'll ship it anywhere. Canada, Hawaii, everywhere.

Q: Do you [unintelligible] the same as raw cream?

A: No, cream doesn't have that effect. Like I said, cream doesn't depend upon the acid, stomach acid. It depends upon the liver. So by the time the fat gets to the liver, it's already warm. I mean, for some people, it's better.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's almost part of their religion, so the law doesn't like to step in to them.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Nobody's gone after them so far.

Q: Have you ever had people that have tendencies towards bladder or kidney infections? Do they get rid of them? And if they do, do you know why that happens?

A: From raw milk? The only thing I can think of is that maybe they have some heavy metals or some drugs stored in the kidneys. Do they take sulfa drugs? Or any kind of heavy alcohol and drug that would affect the kidneys? Even smokers could have a problem like that.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: If you say it to your animal, they can do it all.

A: Illinois is fine. In some states, they say if a farmer has been in business before a certain date, they can sell raw milk. Hello? I mean, these doctors who run the health industry don't have a clue what's going on. They have no rationale. I explained that in the second part of the book when I told you about all the research on the benefits of raw milk and all the disease that's proved that pasteurized milk has caused. I've had doctors read that and say, well, raw milk is bad. I say, well, give me the proof. Couldn't support it. That's why I had to go when I got the law changed in Los Angeles County, I had to forget all the doctors. And I had to threaten the Board of Supervisors with a lawsuit. So I wrote a three-page executive summary and had two attorneys that are on the diet sign it and hand deliver it to their offices. And I had two ex-senators the day before the vote take it and hand it to them personally to threaten them. And let me tell you, the day before the vote, it was four against, allowing the raw milk in, uncertified. Because the certification by the Medical Milk Commission was so high that the dairy passed less than half the time inspection. Absurd. Absurd regulations. So the guy that I thought would be the hardest I was working on with his health deputy, the board supervisor, Yaroslavsky, he's the head of the district that has all the doctors. Bel-Air, Malibu, Beverly Hills, Pacific Palisades, that is his area. And he obviously got the message the day before when that stuff was handed to him, because he must have read it, because he looked at, we're talking about the head of Los Angeles County, the biggest county, one of the biggest, the biggest county in America, Los Angeles County. The head of the health department there, Yaroslavsky says, you know we had milk a couple of years ago, raw milk, and it's been on the market for, since hundreds of years. Did we do something wrong? For him to, he baited him, because he knew that the questions would be very hard in court. So he wanted to go right away, he went right to the heart of it. And the doctor sat there, this is the head of the department, five doctors, behind this guy's name, and he goes, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh. Yaroslavsky just went at it, started going, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. What do you have? Why do you say this? Why do you do this? They had no support, because I had shot everything down. They had used five cases and all of them were false. Investigation. And I had 52 pages supporting raw milk. So guess what? It passed through. Passed. An attorney who had been fighting that law for 36 years said I would never get it done. He came up to me afterwards and shook my hand for five minutes. [unintelligible] It was so great. It was so great to win that. I mean, we all just jumped up and just hugged and danced, and it was wild. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I'm about to take off my clothes.

Q: It's becoming more and more difficult now, these meat processors.

A: Hold on.

Q: The meat processors that we deal with locally in Indiana. A lot more pressure on the government. They won't sell us the fresh meat, only frozen. Now they're trying to force these processors to [unintelligible] all the meat. How do we fight this on a local level to continue getting that food?

A: Well, first of all, just like they did with the raw milk, they blamed every disease that they could on raw milk. Still they do, with no proof. So what you have to do is say, what clinical tests have been done to show that raw meat, you've taken raw meat, you've spiked it with disease and fed it to an animal. Not one test has been done. Not one test has been done to prove it. And you just have to have a good attorney, or some guy that's an asshole like me, that's out there on the butt like a hip pocket.

Q: [unintelligible] They just want to control. And so a lot of people have been running their own business.

A: Well, you know, juice is illegal to have raw juice after January. It's illegal to sell raw juice in the store after January. It's a federal law. It's being adopted by most states. California starts in January. Last January, for many big places, you know, big fruit, big juice suppliers, Coca-Cola bought up Odwalla. Odwalla Juice. They pushed hard for that. Pasteurization. You know why? Shelf life's longer. Odwalla used to be all raw. You can't find Odwalla's raw anywhere anymore. It's not raw. Coca-Cola pushed it through. That's the law I'm fighting right now. I need your money if you have it. Because I've got to pay other researchers to do it. I only have $8,000 in donations so far. And I need about $12,000 to finish the project. So what we're doing is writing all of these papers showing that vitamins and minerals and enzymes are good. They are found in raw. They are not found in pasteurized. You're damaging your children and all other people by feeding them pasteurized. Those who are poor can't afford vitamin and mineral supplements. You'll see you have that angle, too, so it's discrimination. And you have no proof. You have one case of Odwalla, which was accused of the E. coli contamination with the orange juice. Now, that little girl died. Now, she died of HUS, like I say in the book. She died of HUS, which is kidney degeneration. There has been no test to prove, no empirical test to prove that E. coli causes HUS, which is deterioration, disintegration of the kidneys. Cipro has been proven to cause degeneration of HUS-like symptoms in the kidney. Guess what that little girl was given? Antibiotic Cipro. Do you think that that doctor was going to blame herself for causing the death of that child by giving her the antibiotic Cipro? Odwalla was just a bunch of nice guys who were making a juice. And they didn't have the science behind it. They didn't know. They thought the health department was right. They thought that the E. coli killed the girl. The husband is also an MD. The female doctor who took care of the little girl. Her husband is also an MD. He and I got into an argument about it. I said, show me one empirical test that shows that E. coli causes degeneration of the kidney outside of a laboratory with an actual animal. Now, I said, but I can show you a list of the damage caused by Cipro to the kidney, which is exactly what the little girl had. And he shut up. He just shut up very fast. He never called me. [unintelligible] you haven't heard a thing. I haven't heard from them. I haven't heard from anybody. And I spread it all over the internet. And let me tell you, if it had been long, she would have come after me pretty quickly. She couldn't. I've got the facts. They don't.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Any time you eat anything cold that's protein, your stomach is going to contract, and you're going to have less hypertension and less digestion. As you can see, I let all my food sit out. It's meat. Sometimes if I want it really warm and tasty, I put it in a light, free container, and put it in my car where it gets nice and warm in the sun. But I definitely leave it out. Always.

Q: You don't eat any cold food at all?

A: Some cream I will.

Q: Why is that?

A: Because, like you said, you're not listening, you're talking. Cream doesn't rely on hydrochloric acid in the stomach. It goes to the liver, and by the time it gets to the liver, it's war,.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Is it good, like, if you want to drink a glass of milk in the morning, should you leave it out the night before?

A: Yes, you should, well, at least five hours. And you leave it in a dark cupboard. If you leave it out until sunlight hits it or any kind of light, it will turn it bitter. If you leave it in a dark cupboard, it will just get warm. If you leave it for days, it will get sour and go into kefir or yogurt, and then eventually cottage cheese. But it will not turn bitter. If you leave it out in the light, it will turn bitter, because the light damages some of the fat-digesting enzymes. It doesn't allow them to grow properly, so that causes a bitterness. The only thing that I drink cold on a regular basis is my vegetable juice. 

Q: Why?

A: Because it's so fragile. It starts breaking down instantly. So when I carry my vegetable juice, I have a little cold pack. I put a, you know, ice pack in with it, and then carry on with it.

Q: [unintelligible] Those two, do you keep them in a cupboard then?

A: [unintelligible]

Q: And how long do they keep out of the cupboard?

A: Twenty-five years. Well, you have the things called the century egg by the Chinese. You can mold it anywhere from a year to 25 years. Usually it's not... It's a minimum of five years to 25 years. A 25-year-old egg that's all white or black or blue, molded, bacteria. A thousand dollars an egg. You know who can afford it? These old octogenarian rich Chinese men. And you know why they eat it? Because they get all this incredible energy and they can have sex two or three times a day. And for a month they eat one egg.

Q: I heard they have them now, but they're made with chemicals and salts.

A: That's not a century egg. No, a century egg is broken down with bacteria and molds. Naturally, over a period of time. I have lots of clients who let the eggs sit out and rot in the sun. Really stinky, so you eat them outside. It's just like the high meat. You can charge them energetically. If you like sex, it's great.

Q: Is that a nutritional factor or is that a drug effect?

A: I couldn't understand.

Q: Is that a nutritional factor that's had a drug effect from the chemicals that are being produced by the mold and bacteria? You know, it's like there are certain molds that produce LSD. You know?

A: It's not a bad thing as long as there's no degenerative effect on it. I've been observing it since 1976, and I've only put it out to the public after 15 years of observing people doing it. And it never has created any degenerative effect. Even if it's eaten regularly, on a every two-day basis. In fact, what I've found is that if you've eaten... You know, back in the 70s is when I started doing this, when I realized after being with the eskimos. If you've eaten a cooked food, you've destroyed the natural molds and bacteria that occur in them by cooking them. So, how are you going to recycle anything without help? So you're going to store a lot more toxins. What is the best way to help get rid of those toxins? It would be to eat the same food in its moldy form, wouldn't it? In its fermented, moldy, putrefied form. And it's true. It helps clean people much quicker. Somebody has a liver problem. I tell them to make some high liver. Sure enough, the liver reacts much quicker. Sometimes it used to take me two and a half years of what I can do in nine months now. Because they're eating high liver. So it's very favorable. And that's caution. That's the same kind of caution that I have. [unintelligible] Because it works. And there's been no trauma to anybody of any kind. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, but I found a better way to do that.

Q: Okay.

A: We're getting all into that.

Q: Is that true with any of the high foods that you're going to have a period of detox?

A: No.

Q: Okay.

A: Mainly with the berries, the high mold of the berries and eating that much. What I recommend people do now is only have three moldy berries a week. And they just do it like that a little at a time. There's no lethargy involved. High meats, I've found no lethargy involved in anybody who took it. Even people who were already chronically fatigued.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The way you have to make the high meat is in quart jars. A pint of each kind of meat. Say some beef or buffalo, some chicken, and some seafood. You have a pint of each. And they go in three separate jars. Chop it up so you can eat it. In bite-sized pieces. Then you put it in these jars, one in each jar. And you put it in the refrigerator. And you let it sit for four days. It takes four days to use the oxygen. At that point, the particular bacteria or part of the particular bacteria that we want, the aerobic type, go dormant. So you have to take it out of the refrigerator every three to four days. You take it out of the house. Open it, because you don't want to stink up your house. And you wave it two times. Figure eight, twice. Do the aerobic, put it back in the refrigerator. After four weeks of doing that, it's ready. And you can start eating it. And you don't want to eat it between the second week and the fourth week. It's too radical. It can cause spinal meningitis. It can cause some heavy radical detox. Only between that period, two weeks, and four weeks. So you don't want to have it between that. And before two weeks, it's not high enough to do anything. So after four weeks, you can start eating it. If you want to just take it easy, once a week, you know. Eat it more if you want to.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Right away. [unintelligible] You know, and the swallowing. I mean, the woman, the girl, the woman who was telling you about the psychotropic drugs for 27 years. [unintelligible]. That woman chews it until it completely dissolves. Because it works so fast. She'll get so high.  That quickly. She'll chew it completely. She'll put the clip on her nose, the swimmer's clip, on her nose. Because the taste, if you've ever had braised and brandy lamb, it's so soft. [unintelligible] It's dissolved like that because of the alcohols in the mold. It's broken it down. So it's so tender. It's just the odor. And it is never stuck in anybody's breath. So you don't have to worry about that. Or after about a half an hour, you might want to take some lemon juice to clean your mouth after if you have to go on a date. If you were depressed before a date, you take that 10 minutes, you're happy. You know, if the date's coming too soon, squeeze some lemon juice in your mouth. Rinse your mouth out. It takes care of it. Just don't breathe on it for about 30 minutes.

Q: You say rapid detoxification...

A: Well, what I did one time is not necessarily as an experiment. My girlfriend served me some fish. You know, I've been around her so long, and I'm working away. So she served me a whole cup of high meat that was between the second and fourth week old, but a whole cup. I'm sitting there because I'm lost in my work. I was trying to finish that book, and I'm eating away and not realizing it. I say, holy shit, I just ate a whole cup of this. And I call her, and I say, why would you do that? She says, well, I thought it was all right. It's only three weeks old. Sure enough, I went into a cerebral and a spinal meningitis within two days, and it lasted about three weeks. And I was crippled for about five days. I went on crutches for three of those five days. In two days, she had to lift my leg up because the bone cancer I had had in this hip and this hip and this knee. And I just detoxed this side every time that I'd had it in the past, two times that I'd had it in the past. After each one, I was able to get a little lower, and I was able to touch the floor after the second one. This third one went into the brain even more so. It cleaned out 70% of the scar tissue in my brain. You can see the iridology. But it was a painful experience. I'm glad that I went through it, but I wouldn't choose to go through that heavy of a one without being prepared because it [unintelligible] me. So you just want to watch it. You know, you want it between that second and fourth week, and you don't want to have too much of the time.

Q: Where is the reason that people die of spinal meningitis? They're not doing that, but it's detoxification.

A: Yeah, if there is spinal meningitis, that's a detoxification.

Q: I mean, some of these kids in college or something have died of spinal meningitis.

A: Yes. They're detoxifying. That's the body naturally going into a detoxification. However, they're not on a proper diet to detoxify properly and heal properly, and they're on drugs. You know, not recreational drugs. I'm talking about medical antibiotics. So it destroys their ability to digest. I've had four people with malignant brain tumors go on the diet, and they're still living today. One in Hong Kong and two in the States. I don't know, brain tumor doesn't seem to be a big problem. Lung cancer is a bad thing. Lung cancer, that's a difficult one. Because the lungs keep filling up with fluid, and, you know, it's hard to respirate, it's hard to be mobile. And the doctors want to go in there and take out the excess water, and people won't stop drinking water. And a person with lung cancer should not ever have water. They should only have tomatoes for their water. They need the meats. What time is it?

Q: It's 3.30.

A: 3.30? Well, it's not even time. We'll start the mini consults between 4 and 4.30. Okay, but we need to get into the question-and-answer cycle, but we seem to be doing that all the way along the line. So anyway, we've covered almost all of the detoxification information. The next book will cover whatever you didn't get today, because the detoxification book will hopefully be ready next [unintelligible].

Q: You didn't answer my question about [unintelligible].

A: Okay, the bees, when they collect the nectar, they swallow it. They produce an insulin-like substance, which converts 90% of the carbohydrate into enzymes for digesting, utilizing, and assimilating protein. That insulin-like substance is destroyed between 93 and 100 degrees. So honey should be gotten without heat at any point. And if you've gotten it from bees that are collected in the summer in a desert, where the top of the hive gets very hot, bees fan it. They fan it. They keep it at 92.8. If one is heated too long, they will abandon the top of the hive and go to the lower hives and protect them. And they'll never eat that upper hive unless they're starving. So you just have to be familiar with who will handle your honey properly and not let it go over 93 degrees. That's for diabetics. Then they can have a lot of honey without any problem. If you're not a diabetic, it still goes back into good, healthy sugar and isn't destroyed. It doesn't become a radical sugar until it goes over 104 degrees. Then it's a radical sugar. Yes?

Q: What's your opinion on comb honey?

A: Good unless it's been on top of the hive where it gets hot. 

Q: So the honey doesn't contribute to the formation of those toxins that you were talking about, the glycation end products?

A: Well, if it's only 10%, your body can handle it. If you're having only 10% of the honey that you're consuming is a small amount of carbohydrate, or your body is making the glycogen from pyruvate, there's only a 7% to 8% byproduct, and your body can handle that easily. But if you're consuming a high carbohydrate or a starch that's very complex, 70% to 90% stores, and your body can't handle that. So, what I recommend is, like I said in this book, if you're eating a pound of meat a day, you can have 6 tablespoons of honey a day. And it goes by protein. If the honey is heated over 100 degrees and the insulin-like substance is destroyed, then of course it's going to be all carbohydrate, and you're going to have a higher rate of the advanced glycation end product, but it's not going to be extremely high. But still, it's going to be [unintelligible]. And if you eat too much honey over that proportion to meat, you're going to have a problem because you're going to become protein deficient. Your body's going to start looking for protein with too much honey.

Q: So is that six teaspoons or six tablespoons?

A: Six tablespoons, three ounces per pound of meat. Did you have a question?

Q: Yes. Bee pollen, fermented bee pollen, royal jelly, and propolis. [unintelligible]

A: Propolis is tree sap. It's an anti-mite. Bees like to place it around because mites don't like the odor. It sets out a gas that affects the mites. So it protects their honey from the mites. That's what propolis is used for. In the body, it's so hard to eat enough to get a reaction. But I'm sure that from all of the processed vegetable oils that we've had, it will help break down some of those. But again, it's in a solid form, and it's dry, so I don't suggest that propolis is too good very often. And in small amounts, it may be fine. Bee pollen is wonderful. It's microscopic nuts. They have a hard shell on them. If they're dried, your body's never going to digest it. You're going to be putting a very expensive substance right through your body. So it's been killed or heated, and those pellets are hard. It's no good. No value. If it's refrigerated and soft, the shell will break down and your body won't be able to absorb those very fine amino acids, those proteins. And it has all 22, just like meat does. It has all 22. So I like to use it as a nerve strengthener. That's why I call it, in the book, I call the pain formula also a builder, a booster. And the pain formula in the recipe book you'll see is called the lubrication or moisturization formula. Women like the word moisturization, so they like to feel moisturized, so they go for it. Men like the word lubrication, so that's why I use the two terms. And that formula with bee pollen in it, it strengthens, it helps stabilize and strengthen the nervous system. It's finite protein.

Q: Fermented bee pollen?

A: Fermented bee pollen is not a good thing, because what it does is it takes the protein and turns it all into pyruvate, and that's still [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No. I said it's good to mix with that formula in the book that's called the moisturizing or lubrication formula.

Q: Wouldn't fermented bee pollen be very similar to eating the aged meat, though? In that the fermented bee pollen can be broken down, and usually it should be more accessible for you.

A: Well, it's already a concentrated protein, and it doesn't have the same effect. It turns it into more of a solvent reaction. It'll go into the nerves, and I've seen it cause intense neurological detoxifications, over-emotionality, irritability. You know that when you have a trauma in your life, anxiety in your life, you have neurological chemical compounds going on all the time. They have byproducts like every other waste function in the body. You have waste products. Those store in the body like any other toxin. So, you know, let's say one day when you're not feeling well, and you and your wife, if you had one, you get upset with her again. You have no idea why you're upset with her. You're just pissed off at her. Because maybe, you know, when you were ten years old, your mother beat the hell out of you, and those neurological hormones are still stored in your body, and you start detoxifying them. Then they break out. Now, that was scientifically proven by Elnora Van Winkle. She's the last person on the back side of the recipe book that gave that testimonial about cancer. She spent 40 years at New York City Medical Center studying neurological compounds. She cataloged them. She was a pioneer. She has a paper on the Internet called The Biology of Emotions. And there's the layman's, and then there's the technical one. It gives every chemical and its byproduct. And she said that when these start detoxifying, you're related to the emotional outbreaks that don't belong to any incident in the body. And she spent 40 years proving that. I experienced it a lot with myself and other people. So that fermented bee pollen has a problem with that.

Q: What about [unintelligible]? I guess it's from New Zealand. And somehow they cracked it. They're saying that we can't digest the pollen that well. And by them cracking that cell wall, it unlocks its nucleus.

A: Okay, remember I said that it's like a nut. Once it's dry, that nut cannot be broken in our system.

[audio cut]

A: ...like Coca-Cola buying the raw juice and now pasteurizing it, flash pasteurizing it, or irradiating it, and saying this is good for you, this is healthy for you. Yeah, it helps. It's got a longer shelf life, that would be better.

Q: It helps them, huh?

A: Yeah, exactly.

Q: So you're saying even if you're a diabetic, you can have that much raw honey as long as you balance it with a protein, and you're not going to, if you measure your blood sugar, you're not going to see a big spike in it?

A: Yes, you may see a spike in it. But what happens is it starts pulling out the toxic sugars that are stored in your blood with poor insulin. Because you have that, you're a diabetic like I was. A lot of times I would find a spike in sugar but not have the symptoms of it. And that's when it's the old toxic sugars that are coming out. But when I actually had my laboratory technician check the quality and the availability of that high sugar level, 90% of those sugars weren't even available. They were attached to fat molecules. So they've never been released. They couldn't be utilized.

Q: Even if your type 2 was really insulin sensitivity?

A: Yeah, you're easy. That's easy. I'n talking about diabetic 1.

Q: Something I've never heard in the literature on the primal diet sites, lately I've been getting into magnets, [unintelligible]. He claims that in the human body, that we have magnets in each cell. He claims that it's excellent for the body, pressure points to be exposed to the north pole of the magnet, as well as juices and things like that to be put on a magnet, and that will boost our electromagnetic energy of the body, because he thinks that electromagnetism actually helps to cellular nerves and everything else for longevity. Do you agree with any of that?

A: Yes, I agree with it to a point. When I was experimenting with magnets from 1989 to 1992, I found that they were beneficial to the point that if you slept on a magnetic mattress, with alternating poles it was better, a positive, negative, positive, negative, all the spirals, like the Nikken products.

Q: Nikon?

A: Nikken. Every other one was positive, negative. That was a good one. Now, when they first put out their mattress, they put it out in these strips along the bed, and I had paid $1,000 for this frickin' mattress, and it didn't do anything. So I went through their specifications, and all of their laboratory tests, and it showed that they did everything in spirals. And here they were putting these round magnets at this wall in lines on the bed, and it wasn't having a good effect on me. In fact, it was disturbing my sleep. So I ripped out all the magnets and put them down in spirals in this mattress. Then I had good effects. After five months on it, it had just reversed. It started making me feel horrible.

Q: They're usually negative and positive, because I believe all the ones that I've heard of are probably only the north pole or the negative pole.

A: That can be very harmful, because they bombard you with too many negative ions. It's like having too much rain. What happens in countries where they have so much rain, the suicide rate's extremely high. Too many protons makes people crazy and hyperactive. That's why you go out to California, you'll find most of your looney tunes in southern California, because there's rarely any rain. Then after the rain for a few days, everybody's so cool and so calm. They just mellow it out, because the protons become very intense. Then the rain brings the negative ions, which balance it, and then levels everything out. The same thing with these magnets. You can use them therapeutically and in small doses, but I wouldn't use them all the time. Hold on, there's somebody over here.

Q: What do you think of using hyperbaric oxygen chambers?

A: It's awful. Because the oxygen that they produce is laboratorily formed, causes headaches in a lot of people. If you want to build your own chamber, get a lot of dracaenas. There are some other plants that produce a lot of oxygen. Put those in your bedroom. 

Q: Dracaena is better than ionizer?

A: Ionizer is a mechanical thing. It can only reach a balance if you're testing all the time. But in nature, they know how to balance it. They'll produce their carbon dioxide and their oxygen at night. We give them our carbon dioxide, that's their oxygen. Our toxin is their food, and their toxin is our food. It's all the dracaenas. There are also some other plants. Corn, D-R-A-C. E-N-A-S, dracaena, D-R-A-C. I mentioned it. It looks like a corn plant.

Q: I'm buying one today.

A: There are several plants... Just look it up on the internet, oxygen producing plants. Or just oxygen plants. You can come up with some websites to tell which ones give off the most oxygen.

Q: Speaking of [unintelligible], is it true that microwaves do that? Does that put a reverse spin? I mean, whatever. It does something, I heard it has a reverse spin. So whether you put in water, a cup of any liquid or product, it will change the flavor.

A: Yeah, as long as it's loose, it's okay. But if you put a live animal in one of those and it reverses like that, it will explode. The animal will explode because it's contained and active in a live animal. If you put a live animal in a microwave, it will explode.

Q: I would never think of doing that. I would never think of doing that.

Q: It's the same for a cup of water. This instrument, it changes the flavor.

A: Yes, it will change the direction.

Q: The direction.

A: Yes. That's how it breaks down.

Q: Would that make the flavor worse?

Q: Yes.

A: Yeah, it will flatten it. Just like any cooking. Any cooking will, you know. It's why they put so many spices in your food. If you ate cooked grains, what would they taste like? Paste. Dirt, you know. Nothing. So anything that's cooked has to be spiked in flavor. Sugar added to it. Herbs added to it. Anything to give it flavor, because it's all rotten, lousy food. No good flavor to it. People say to me, but you're eating the same thing on this diet. I said, yeah, out there in the world you're eating the same grains, just a different flavor. Whether it's as a donut, or as a cake, or as bread, it's all the same thing. Grains. Eating all these grains. Same food. Meat, same thing. Pizza, it's cheese and grains, you know. Maybe it's the meat. It's all the same thing. It's how you flavor it. Yes.

Q: Celtic salt. You give everything salt free. All my readings, everything, Celtic salt.

A: I explain it in the second book, thoroughly. Yeah, it's too long to go into that.

Q: What about like brown rice stuff, like rice milk, rice sour cream?

A: All very processed. So, you know, you have your advanced glycation products and your acrylamides that form out of it. Okay, we'll take two more questions. Yes. Okay.

Q: Just briefly on freezing food. Especially [unintelligible].

A: Okay. When you freeze something, what happens to it? You freeze something and you put it out and you steam it up. Say you take a piece of fruit or you take a piece of meat and you freeze it. What happens when it thaws? It immediately starts to break down and melt. The molds, everything decomposes. It is rapid. As I say in the book, E. coli and any bacteria will grow on a frozen product, meat, much quicker. Because all that happens after freezing, it's all dead. It's going to have to be recycled into the earth. So you've destroyed most of your nutrients in it. The only way it can go is through detoxification.

Q: You mentioned that only ice cream can [unintelligible].

A: No. Because the ice cream, you have a lot of fat, and fat doesn't react as badly. Fat can be frozen for a short period of time. It's mainly the egg, which is only going to sustain 24 hours. You might get away with just freezing cream for a couple of days and not be so bad. But every time that I eat cream over two days, I start having intense lung detoxification, spinal detoxification. So I don't suggest people move in that direction. I like people to detox so they're not so uncomfortable and get help and gain a lot of weight so that everything is much easier. People who stay thin, like I say, the poisons go intracellularly, and there's a lot more ill reactions. Much more discomfort. So if you have the weight and you have the fat, you're much more protected. Raw, I mean frozen fat, you're getting into causing, like the coconut, too much of a saturated fat that will all be for detoxification, not for strengthening your system. So that's dangerous. Doesn't mean it won't help you, but, you know, it's like you're going to the frozen mushroom with the high fish, that much high fish. Sure, a good reward came out of it, but hell going through it. I don't think that people have to suffer that much. Being overweight for our, you know, for all this fashion is hard enough for women to go through, but I think that they can do that. 

Q: I think in terms of preservation [unintelligible].

A: Raw dairy products never go bad. They only go to cheese. They only are more digestible. Who likes sour cream? Who likes cream cheese? Practically everybody. That's all they go to. You have cream? Keep it in the refrigerator for three months, you've got sour cream. Keep it in there for a year, you've got cream cheese. Or if you take it out of the refrigerator, leave a little air and space, leave it out of the refrigerator, you put it out, two weeks, you have sour cream. 

Q: But it tastes different, actually, than the kinds that have the culture added.

A: It's because you're putting it out in light. You put it in a dark cupboard, away from the light, and it won't do that.

Q: Wow. [unintelligible]

A: The bitter taste is because the light's hitting it.

Q: Really?

A: And if people open your cupboards too often, you better put it inside something. It keeps the light out. And that's what I do with my milk, too. I put it in a dark cupboard. When I leave any dairy out to warm, I put it in a dark cupboard so the light doesn't turn bitter.

Q: Do you want it covered, like, such as in a jar?

A: Yes. Air-tight. Oxygen will cause it to sour quicker. If you want it sour quicker, then you can leave it [unintelligible]. All right. One more.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Wonderful. Just don't give it to him cold. [unintelligible] you're very temperamental. Start ripping your house apart.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, maybe pasteurized because it causes osteoporosis. The raw milk to those animals... There's not an animal on this world that people talk about... Nobody, no animal over a certain age eats raw milk. Well, have you offered it to them? I've offered it to horses, grown horses, eight, nine years old. They eat it. Cows will eat it, grown cows. Near death will eat it. Every animal, dogs, wild dogs. My wild coyotes that I feed all the time, they love old meat. They never get old meat, because when they eat something, they have to eat it right away before some other creature comes to get it, or worms. So they really never get much high meat, unless they've gone down to alligator country, where the alligators pulled it down into the water and caused it to rot and get moldy and start blowing up in the water and fermenting. Then if it washes up and the alligators have eaten as much as they want, then dogs will come and eat some high meat. But rarely do they get it. So I've got all this extra high meat all the time, because lots of people say, I made so much, I can't use it. If you've got clients who want to use it, and I'll keep it for so long, and I know when it gets to a certain point, nobody's going to eat it but me, but I can't eat all that. So I throw it out to the coyotes. The only time I've ever seen coyotes fight is over high meat.

Q: Oh, really? They will?

A: They will only fight over the high meat. They'll growl and get crazy with each other. Regular meat, not at all. That's right. They'll share and they'll let the weakest one have it. No problem ever. If I put that high meat out there, everybody gets nuts. They want it.

Q: I have a comment on this, please. You make your recommendations as if they're universally applicable. Can you speak to the concept of biochemical individuality? And if you're eating an all raw-food diet, how much do you encourage people to trust their own experience? And you've learned a lot from your own personal experience, and I learned a lot from my own personal experience. For instance, I eat whole, soft, granule bee pollen, and it's good. And I like the energy I get from it. But fermented bee pollen, for me, feels even better. And it seems to be even better for my digestive system. It doesn't make me over-emotional, and it doesn't make me hyper or anything. It just seems to be better, more easily digested nutrition for my body once I've been fermented. And I suppose there's different ways it can be fermented, and maybe [unintelligible].

A: When you're not on this—if you're rigid on this diet, usually everything is pretty homogenous. Everything works on a good balance. If you're on and off the diet, if you don't have the extra weight, and you're vacillating with some cooked foods and some fermented foods here and there, you're going to have different reactions. A lot of people will have high—like your fruitarians out there, they feel so high in charge on all that sugar. It makes you feel good. I did, too, for six and a half years. I was so sickly as a child, I had no energy. I was lethargic all the time. I mean, I didn't get to play with the kids. My mother dragged me around everywhere with her, so I knew more about women than I did anything else because I didn't get to play with the men, the guys, because I was so ill. Now, when I got into being a fruitarian, after going through blood and bone cancer and having no energy and all that life, I was charged with the sugar all the time. I mean, I was so energetic, I felt great, but I was manic and hyperactive all the time. But to me, that was healthy because I didn't know anything else. I had been so sickly, that felt good to me, but that doesn't mean it's good for you because if you watch behavior long enough, then you can see where, well, it may not be so good if you have alcohol, if you have a fermented protein product. What is the result of that? What does it do in the system? Sure, it may give more adrenaline rushing. Sure, it may start detoxing the nervous system, or it may stimulate the adrenal glands in general, but that doesn't mean it's a healthy reaction because it gives you a charge. So does cocaine. So a lot of drugs out there make you feel incredible, but they're frightfully damaging, and that's why I say that you have to be careful and see what works and what doesn't really work.

Q: What makes me think about that is the high meat because people get such an immediate reaction to it. I think it's more, it seems to me, it's more of a drug-like activity.

A: Well, biochemically, we checked it out. It didn't come out with chemicals.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, they had to, because I thought it might be something bad, too. I thought maybe it was the ammonia. And ammonia's not good, you know, circulating in the nervous system. And there wasn't, you know, even though high meat has a lot of ammonia in it, it doesn't get into the nervous system when you eat it in high meat form. But if you're, you know, if you're taking a product that has ammonia added to it, then it will get into your nervous system.

Q: So how much do you suggest that people rely on their own personal experience, especially when you're eating raw food?

A: Well, as I said when we started, instinct is a great thing to a certain extent. But I spent 15 years of the raw meat thing, even on this stage of it, from when I started eating meat on the daily, doing instinctual, not following the weight principles. For the last seven years, I've been following, disregarding people's instincts, telling them to get fat, telling them to eat when they're not hungry, force-feed themselves. And the reversal of disease has gone from mid-70s to the 90s with a lot less stress, I would say 90% less stress. So even though in my first book I said that I still wasn't sure, I still had five more years to go because the book was published in 97, but that was the results I had to 96. And I said, go ahead and use your instincts. You know, you won't go wrong, but it doesn't mean that it will speed things up. I found that in the last seven years since I finished that book, the first book, that you'll get better results if you say, to hell with your instincts, except maybe something you like to eat. Let's say you like berries or oranges rather than some other fruit that I might suggest. Then the fruit that I suggest will help your problem better, but emotionally you might need that particular food two days a week and do what I suggest five days a week. So, in that area, I would say give yourself a little bit of a leeway in your instinct, but my research over the last seven years has shown you to screw your instincts until you get well. Right now, we are completely, all of our instincts are bastardized, and they're manipulated, and they're not good, basically. You've been raised in all the wrong foods. To have the proper instincts to know what to go for, and that's the problem.

Q: That makes sense to me. Unfortunately, you're right.

A: I know, but let me tell you, when I was eating all that fruit, and I was wired and more happy, I had to have sex six, seven times a day, or else I wasn't happy. Now, if it's there, and it's available, and I have that kind of inclination, it's not a drive. It's something that I get to choose to do. But when I was eating all that fruit, I was wired. I was manic. It just wasn't a good thing, overall. And people getting well so much quicker, and with so much less ill symptoms through their detoxification, makes all the difference in the world. I mean, all my clients I used to have to work with, they were severely ill. Every day I had to help them change their diets or adjust something. With this particular program, the way I laid it out in the recipe book, 90% of the people, even if they're very ill, can do it on their own and sail through it pretty well. And don't need my other 10% too.

Q: The less ill you are, the less [unintelligible].

A: Well, that's not necessarily true because you can be full of hormones and not know you're ill. Because the hormones, you know, it's like you take a diabetic, goes into a coma, you give him a shot of just a pinprick of diluted adrenaline, pop up, stand up, not even know he's in a coma. The man's still sick, the body's not operating properly. There's a lot of people, especially thin ones, who produce an abundance of hormones and it burns up their fats. It also keeps them high like sugar did to me. Food sugar did to me kept me high. You don't know what's deteriorating, you don't know how ill you are. So you start deteriorating. And a lot of these athletes, what happens? 50, 40, 50 years old, they start drying up, having heart attacks, dying, just like this. But they had a good life while they were around. They were drinking, smoking, and all these good things. Never knew that they were getting ill, but they got to do what they wanted, to die quickly. But most of us don't get to die quickly. We suffer before we die. But I didn't choose to be one of those people who had all that hormonal activity and die in an instant. I suffered too much. People who are thin and have all that hyperactive hormone energy, I think that's a great way to live. Burn the candle at both ends and die quickly. I don't see anything wrong with that as long as you're built that way. I think that'd be great. You eat all the shit you want. That'd be great. 

Q: What's the old saying? [unintelligible]

A: It's not a problem. I'm not that way and most people aren't. And I doubt that anybody is here in here. Maybe you. The man can't stand still. Most of us aren't so that's what I'm here for.

Q: Just as a quick corollary to Jim's question. What do you think of the D'Adamo blood type diet and Kelly and Wolcott's metabolic typing idea?

A: It has not a relationship to the raw diet. I've had lots of people that were on D'Adamo's diet. They were A types. They were anemic as hell as long as they didn't eat red meat. When they came to me from on red meat, great energetic, happy, doing great. So as far as I know, it may have some validity on a cooked food diet, but I haven't seen. I've heard people say that they did better on a cooked diet, but on the raw diet it has no basis. Because I've taken people, people who've been on my diet and say, oh, well, if I follow D'Adamo, I'll do better. It doesn't work.

Q: Okay. And what kind of water and how much water?

A: In other words, they would do the same things that D'Adamo said, stay away from certain, eat all the raw foods, but stay away from the things the Adamo said to stay away from and eat the things he said to eat. They didn't do better, they got worse.

Q: Okay. What kind of water and how much water do you recommend?

A: As little or none as possible. And I explain that thoroughly in the second book. The reason I'm having so much trouble today is because yesterday during the lab test, of course, the hypoglycemic, I mean the insulin test, I forgot the name of the test now. The glucose tolerance test, they give you sugar water and all that concentrated water. And I don't drink water. I maybe have a cup a week. And in the fall and winter I don't drink any. And tomatoes I eat, and all the foods that you eat, you can absorb 90 to 100% of the H2O. It can be absorbed and utilized intracellularly. But when you take water, only 8 to 10% of it can be utilized and the rest, the other 90%, goes in and starts leaching good nutrients out of your body. It's great if you need to be everything dissolved. You know, it'll help get rid of some contaminants. But what it does is it leaches much more too quickly. So it causes a lot more stress during detoxification. So if you're drinking milk, a quart of milk, a quart of juice, and eating tomatoes, you don't need water. Even if you're exercising, right? Athletes, muscle builders, they say, one cup of water or three today is what would you rather have? And they'll take the three because it takes less time to eat, they're nourished, they don't get the dry mouth, they don't get dry skin. They'll have some cream [unintelligible].

Q: What if you're thirsty a lot for water?

A: That's only because you've gotten into the momentum of water. It dehydrates more so it causes you to catch 22. You keep getting more and more thirsty because that's what water does. Water is what? It's rain, it comes down, it dissolves the earth, rock and everything so the plants can eat. Very few animals have adapted to drinking water. Birds will only drink water in the season when they're only getting grains. Camels and elephants are basically the only animals that have adapted to drinking water.

Q: Farm animals will drink some. 

A: Only because they're not given fresh food.

A: They're given dried hay and stuff like that, sugars, grain. But if they're not eating grasses, they don't get nearly water.

Q: That was a good experiment with my dog. He used to eat the dried food and he drank the water all day. The bowl, I couldn't keep it full enough and now he's been eating it all raw and water sits there for a week or two before he even drinks it. [unintelligible] I remember reading about when women get pregnant and their morning sickness is because they don't have enough water.

Q: Because they're toxic.

Q: [unintelligible] And my daughter's boyfriend came, an ex-marine, came to visit. And I showed him the book. He said, oh yeah, I know all about that. He said, the Marine Corps. I said, how do you know about this? He knows everything about everything now. I said, okay. I said, how do you know about this? He said, well, when we were in the Marine Corps, whenever you had a complaint of any kind of any problem, health problem, then you just drink more water. That was their answer, drink more water. I'm thinking all along, drink more water. And I'm thinking to myself, how come every time I drink water, I'm running to the bathroom and I think I'm depositing more than I'm drinking.

A: Right. It just starts pulling out minerals, it starts pulling out nutrients, and you're dropping them every time you urinate. All those good nutrients. In Asia and India, they drink their urine to recycle it. Because the proteins, everything that's in your blood is in your urine, except for a little bit more ammonia and less red blood cells. It's in the blood. So your urine and your blood are the same, except there are not many red blood cells, and there's no ammonia in your blood. There should be no ammonia in your blood. So when you drink the urine, you're recycling all that. And for civilizations who live on grain, they don't digest the protein the first time through, so they have to keep drinking. That's why urine therapy works for some people. On this diet, it doesn't work. You're too acid. Everybody's too acid.

Q: Why were these people drinking their urine?

A: To get the nutrients. In other words, they didn't deposit it in the ground. They wanted to keep those nutrients going. Because it was concentrated nutrients. When you drink water, it just leaches everything out. That's why urine therapy is so...

Q: Doesn't it depend on the quality of the water that you're drinking?

A: No. It always will dehydrate you.

Q: Food combining, [unintelligible].

A: Oh yes, it'll cause swelling and bloating.

Q: Even if it's structured water.

A: Even if it's structured water. [unintelligible] Unless it's in fat and food. This is structured water. There's 70% water in here, 80% water in here.

Q: In any fruit or vegetable, right?

A: 86% water in milk.

Q: In any fruit or vegetable, you have structured water, right?

A: Yes, that's what I mean. If you eat those foods, the ones that don't cause you imbalances, so you stay away from the high fruits, get into the... high sugar fruits, and get into the low sugar fruits. Like the tomatoes. You know? Cucumbers. Zucchinis. Stuff like that. But you juice them. And you get all that structured water. It won't leach from your body. Straight water leaches.

Q: What's wrong with taking [unintelligible]?

A: Because there's too much cellulose in the summer squash.

Q: Oh, in the summer squash.

A: Tomatoes, that's fine. You don't have to juice the tomatoes.

Q: You don't have to juice lettuce or...

A: Yeah, you do. Because it's too high in cellulose. I've been over that. Okay, we're going to have to start the...

[applause]

A: I drink my vegetable juice so I don't get acidic. That's why we drink the vegetable juice. 

[audio cut]

A: Who already has the tape ready?

Q: I do.

A: Okay, let's do you first.

Q: Well, no, I'm not here to get...

Q: No, wait, wait, wait.

Q: I'm all prepared.

A: Ready?

Q: I just...

Q: We're all set.

Q: Go ahead.

A: We're all set?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay. What was your name?

Q: Mark.

A: Mark. Relax your thumbs. Okay. Protein in your left teste is disintegrated by about 50%. The right one about 30%. So you need lots of protein. But they're still working. Testes are working fine. You have a history of very overactive adrenal glands. So you need to keep fruit and stuff like that down to a minimum or else you're likely to get hyper. Pancreas is working okay. On the right side, on the left side, it's pretty debilitated. So I'd say you have about 25% of your pancreas working, which is pretty good. So you'd handle one piece of fruit a day fine.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Too much. You're not handling it properly. It means it's deteriorating your bones, also the protein. It's going into your glands to get the protein. If it can't find it in the blood, it'll go into your glands. That's what I say. It's eating away 50% of this particular gland. Up here, it's dissolved almost completely, your thyroid. Thyroid's not active. Your parathyroid on the right side is good. Your parathyroid on your left is half gone, too. Tonsil area is almost all gone. Did you have your tonsils removed? It doesn't look scarred.

Q: No, I never did.

A: I mean, they're functioning. Your thyroid and parathyroid, your thyroid is deteriorating. Very poor circulation in the intestines. Lots of metal around the heart. Lots of metal in the left kidney. Lots of metal in the liver. Lots of metal in the right kidney. The thymus gland on the right side is good. On the left, it's not functioning. Lots of metals in the brain, the neck, shoulders. I recommend that you have 60% red meat and 40% white meat. 30% of the 40% white should be fowl, like chicken. Either red or white meat doesn't matter, of the chicken. Juice, I recommend 80% celery, 20% parsley. After about five months, lower it to 70% celery, 20% parsley, and 10% zucchini or cucumber. A good balance of both butter and cream when you have meats, half and half. I'm going to suggest that you have about two ounces of cream and three tablespoons of butter with each meat meal. I recommend that you have two meat meals a day rather than three. As I said in the book, if I suggest a two meat meal day, the whole pattern for eating is in the recipe book. It says start off the day with the juice, then go to the meat meal. Remember, eating a meat meal is the first stable meal of the day. It will get your brain to use pyruvate to make glycogen. That means you'll be much clearer thinking, you'll be much calmer, you'll be more alert. If you go for milk or any fruit, after the juice you're going to create carbohydrates, which have a lot of byproducts, the advanced glycation end product, that will throw your thinking and blood sugar levels off. Follow the pattern in there. For you, follow the pattern for two meat meals a day.

Q: Are eggs considered fowl?

A: No, it's not a meat. Like I said, it's not a mature protein. And I recommend that you have about six to eight eggs a day. And have four of them Rocky style, and you could have three in some kind of a milkshake.

Q: But not in the morning. First I should have meat.

A: You should have meat. And then after that, or even with meat, you could have some eggs along with the cream and butter. Like steak tartare, or as part of a sauce. You could blend the egg, the cream and the butter together with some kind of onion or spice, whatever is in the recipe book. Flavor that you like. If you're going to drink water, make sure it is carbonated, because you're not transporting oxygen very well throughout the system. Red blood cells are damaged, probably because of all the metal poisoning in your bones. Damage your bone marrow. Bone marrow is what produces your red and white blood cells. So if your bone marrow is toxic, your red and white blood cells are going to be weak. And even though you may have a good red blood cell content, you could still be anemic, have anemic symptoms. And yours, because of the high hormonal activity, the adrenaline and the testosterone, and the parathyroids and the lymph glands in the throat and one side of the thymus, because they're so overactive, you wouldn't notice the anemia because there would be too much energy there. However, what you would notice is that you would have less stamina. You'd be out of breath quicker because you're not absorbing and utilizing the oxygen in the blood as well. So the brain won't work as well. A lot of things won't work as well. Fruit, the type of fruit, pear is good for you. Apricots when they're in season. And everything I'm going to give you is in season. And occasionally some pineapple, but not much unless you have lots of fat with it. Lots of lymphatic congestion, so coconut cream is very good for you. Coconut cream and pineapple maybe every other day. But not a lot of pineapple. Slice about maybe a half an inch thick by a circular diameter. And if you slice it that way you can put it face down on a plate and that will seal it so it doesn't spoil quickly. And it's always best to get unripe fruit. Remember the ripe fruit is high in sugar, means a lot of sugar byproducts to get in the blood. If it's unripe, lots of enzymes. It's the way all animals eat, even birds, they eat everything unripe. Let me give you an example. John Goodall who made a film called The Beginning in the early 60's is Jane Goodall's father. He followed some apes throughout their lives before Jane was even into it. I saw him giving birth, but he showed that in this one tribe of gorillas, they noticed that all the gorillas, no matter who they were, monkeys, ate the green bananas and they would eat the peel and all. So they couldn't figure out why they did that, so they cut down, they figured they just didn't want to wait. So they cut down a huge bunch, it was about from that wall to here, of bananas. And they let them all ripen, and then they threw them out, they followed the tribe of gorillas for a couple of weeks until they all got ripe. And then they threw this big bunch out there, and the gorillas were going around trying to figure out what it was, and they'd tear one off and smell it. Go like this, and they'd try to eat it, and it would squish out all over, so they'd learn to peel it and start eating it.

And within 40 minutes of them eating it, they started fighting over it, and they started going manic and crazy, and they kept eating and eating and eating, and finally they started killing each other. So they realized that the high sugar was a problem. I thought because they ate all the fats that I wouldn't have that problem, and I still was pretty manic eating a lot of fruit, sweet fruit. And lots of berries for you with coconut cream and cream to get rid of the metals, but only one fruit meal a day, only one.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: I didn't know I had so many things wrong.

A: Well, you're one of those high...

Q: I'm always, my God, I mean, I work out. As a matter of fact, this morning I was doing Jiu-Jitsu.

A: Well, as I say, you have all that hormonal activity. You've got the adrenal glands and the testosterone of an athlete who can spend 8, 10 hours a day being an athlete. If your blood were better, you could have done it for a profession.

Q: But that can improve.

A: Yeah, absolutely.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: Hi.

A: Hi.

Q: Excuse me one second.

Q: Okay. I'll see you Monday.

A: Okay. Milk's good for you, as I said, but since you work out, you eat a lot of tomatoes. Tomatoes and cream together. Tomatoes and cream together. You'll find you won't be drinking all that water, and you'll have a lot more strength and energy.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: Hi.

A: Your name?

Q: Gail.

A: Gail. Hi, Gail. Nice to meet you. Cold. Too thin. No fat in your tissue. Okay. You have overactive ovaries. The protein is broken down in them. The left, right one is much better than the left. Usually in women, it's the other way around. Very long history of overactive adrenal glands, so it shows hyperactivity. The left side of the pancreas is almost shot, and the right side is only about 20% functional. So you have about 10% functionality of the pancreas. So your border... I'm not a doctor, and I'm not diagnosing it, but from what I see, you would be called, termed a borderline diabetic. The left side of the thyroid is working okay. The right side is working very well. The left parathyroid is working very well...

[audio cut]

A: No? Well, this one looks completely deteriorating. This one looks like it might have grown back if you had had it removed, but it shows very little tonsil activity, which means that your brain is not as being as protected. Tonsils protect the brain. The thymus is okay. The intestines, especially the right side of the small intestines, are completely dehydrated and shriveling. You have some digestive problems. I've seen that... People have cancer of the intestines at this stage. This would be on the left side of the small intestines in this area. So what kind of digestion problems do you have?

Q: Well, I've never been diagnosed with anything, but I've had for several years, well, up until recently. It's very hard for me to digest certain foods, especially high fats, but most of them are the cooked fats, the fried fats.

A: Because the body doesn't send them out to the liver, because the liver is not even handling, because the liver is full of metals, and the duct going into it doesn't look like it's open very well. So the liver is in really bad shape. The kidney is in bad shape, and lots of metal all over in the kidney area. So, you know, you've got this bad digestion on the left side and the bad liver. So you need to eat lots of, like I did with the poison mushroom. I forced my body to make the liver work by forcing myself to eat a pound and a half to two pounds of butter a day. I'm not suggesting that much for you, because you're not in that kind of shape. But I would suggest a minimum of six ounces of raw cream a day and four tablespoons of raw butter a day, unsalted raw butter a day.

Q: Why unsalted?

A: The salt causes dehydration, doesn't allow the water to be used properly, causes magnesium imbalance, causes more dehydration, causes more pain, causes more water to... causes edema in the glands and in the circulatory system. You can do it in the brain and cause swelling in the brain. So sodium is not good in any form, unless it's in, like, tomatoes, which are highest in sodium. So I say tomatoes are the best place to get your water, because it's almost a perfect balance, unless you're sucking oyster juice. That's high in sodium. If you like things that are really salty, just blend it with a... you know, make a sauce with an oyster in it, and then you get plenty of salt that'll be used fine, in a fine way. But it isn't the sodium that's causing all that sweetness. It's a balance of all the minerals. See, minerals, it isn't just salt that causes the sweetness, and sugar is the cause. It's the minerals that cause the sweetness, because how can tomatoes be that sweet when they're not high in sugar? It's because certain minerals have sweet tastes. You have lots of jaundice. It means you've been fat deficient for so long, your body has used bile, which is to digest fat. You just use bile in place of fat to bind with your poisons. So you're going to have a jaundice condition for quite a while. You may even get brown spots, heavy amounts as they discharge. If you're on a good diet like this diet, it usually takes six to nine months before they dissolve and go away. If you're not on a raw diet, they stay forever, your whole life. The worst spot that I saw came out on a Hawaiian, and that stayed for a year and a half. And sometimes, like my girlfriend, she came out bright orange, then turned brown, and then was gone in six months. But it was orange for about a month. It was brown for about six months. I'm going to recommend that you do two days of two meat meals a day, then go for one day of three meat meal a day. Two meat meal, two days. One meat meal, three meat meals, one day. So alternate like that, because you've got a little bit of a hodgepodge, but it will keep you in a good balance if you do that. Well, definitely no cold milk. I would have your milk at least 11 hours, 11, 12 hours out of the refrigerator. It doesn't have to be real warm, as long as it's out of the refrigerator in a dark cupboard building the bacteria. But what happens, it looks like the milk's going to start pulling out some of these poisons out of the liver, and it's going to make you nauseous. And it will be less nausea if it's warm. But you're going to have to deal with it. You're going to eat some cheese if you get nauseous on a regular basis. Eat sugar cubes, like one, two sugar cube-sized amounts of cheese at a time, and that will absorb some of the poisons that are dumping into the stomach. Nausea is always poisons dumping into the stomach. So fat will arrest it. Cheese is a fat that isn't digested in the system very well, but it's a great sponge for poisons. You can always dilute the poisons by drinking cream or something like that, but sometimes that always doesn't sit so well because it's not really a sponge. It just coats and chelates with it. It's a big waste of some good, tasty, tasty good nutrients. Relax your... Severe dehydration in the intestinal and whole abdominal cavity, all around the liver. Have you had hepatitis?

Q: No.

A: Or just were not diagnosed with it?

Q: Never diagnosed with it.

A: That's what I mean, just not diagnosed with it.

Q: Right.

A: You have all the indications of somebody who's had hepatitis. Hepatitis is the last ditch save for your liver. That's why you don't want to stop hepatitis. It usually starts dissolving liver, just like the poison mushroom did for me. It starts dissolving the liver. You just need to eat a good raw diet with lots of buffalo liver, or some kind of organically grown, mainly grazed meat liver. I suggest you have liver three pounds a week. That's a lot at first, and I suggest you do that for about three weeks minimum, and then cut it down to a pound a week. But I would really give it a boost.

Q: You've got a good recipe, right? I hope.

A: Several ways. Okay, because even though you don't look anemic, and it looks like there's a lot of indications of types of anemia. So I'm going to suggest, and you're not normally, you should not be a person who eats a high ratio of red meat to white. If you were healthy, I would say 50-50. Since it doesn't look like you're as healthy as you should be, and you're on the other side, I would suggest that for a while you eat 70% red meat and 30% white. 20% of the white, 20-25% should be fowl and 5-10% seafood. When you eat the red meat, I'm going to suggest that you have some fish with it, your seafood with it. That way you won't get over-acidic from the red meat, because you're likely to get a little irritable from having too much red meat. But it isn't really too much for you. You just need some alkalinity there to balance it, and then you'll be level with it. Fruit, lots of metal in your brain, especially the left side. Lots of metal in the left ovary through the kidney, adrenal gland, some on the right side. All around the liver, like I said, so you need berries. I would stick pretty heavily with berries. If you can't get fresh organic berries, organic is the key point with berries to remove metals from the body, because pesticides carry a lot of heavy metals, a lot of alkaloids, so you don't want that. You can get the Cascadian Farms organic frozen berries. You eat that with, like, I would say you start off with 1 ounce of coconut cream and 3 ounces of raw cream, and make that 2 1⁄2 ounces of raw cream and 1 1⁄2 tablespoons of butter for that mix. You can blend it together, mix it together, whatever you like. And the berries, not too many raspberries, but mainly the dark berries, blueberries, mulberries, boysenberries, blackberries. And have that in the afternoon, like it says in the book. You probably do better if you let the milk sit until it turns into kefir. It means when it starts getting thick. You can wait until it gets yogurt until it's very thick. Just keep it in a dark cupboard. Vegetable juice, I'm going to suggest 60% celery, 15% parsley. Your lymphatic system is pretty congested, so I'm going to recommend that you have about, you have berries four days a week. You have pineapple with more coconut cream, like three ounces of coconut cream. It may make you nauseous, suffer it. One ounce of cream, and the pineapple should be no more than a quarter inch thick. Circular, unripe.

Q: Unripe, not in the refrigerator?

A: It's okay if it's in the refrigerator, that doesn't matter. And have 5% of your vegetable juice pineapple. Per cup, that's going to work out to about a tablespoon. So what you do is you don't juice the pineapple, you puree it, and you pour it into the vegetable juice.

Q: So my vegetable juice is celery?

A: It's going to be 70% celery, or did I say 60%? 60% celery, 15% parsley, 5% pineapple, and the rest summer squash, like zucchini.

Q: And yellow, is yellow okay? Yellow squash is okay?

A: Yellow is fine, as long as it's not the orange squash, and it's not the large one, the acorn squash. No, it's got to be summer squash. So the crookneck and the sunburst are okay, yellow. The others are too high in carbs, too much sugar.

Q: That's why I like them.

A: Okay?

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: I'll let you know.

A: Alright. Thank you. It's nice to meet you.

Q: Do you have extra tapes, by chance? People could buy a few to tape their sessions?

A: You know, if somebody's fast in writing, they could jot this down.

[chatter]

Q: Well, if they just give the first and last names, I can pick up from where it is and re-tape for them.

Q: Okay.

Q: Are you taping this still on yours too?

Q: Yeah.

Q: I need to come with smaller tapes. You've got a side A, right?

Q: A side A?

Q: Yeah.

Q: A side A. No.

A: What's your name?

Q: Diane.

A: Diane. Hi, Diane. Hi, how are you?

Q: Diane Walensky.

A: Relax your thumbs. Okay. The protein in your left ovary is almost completely gone. You have a history of overactive adrenals, but it doesn't look like they've been functioning very well. So if you get well, these adrenal glands will make you quite active.

Q: If I get well?

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay. This will pop out again?

A: No, it's not to pop out. That just shows hyperactive adrenal glands. It's just because of the coloring. It looks like they're just not very active right now. Pancreas? Yeah. The left side is probably working by 5%, 10%. The right side is probably working by 2% or 3%. So it's pretty gone.

Q: Too much sugar?

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay.

A: So it'd probably be better if you only had fruit once every other day. In the afternoon with fat. And I recommend that you have the three...

Q: I don't want to take some good...

A: No. I recommend that in the recipe book you use the three-meat meal a day regime.

Q: Three-meat meal?

A: Three-meat meals a day.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay. I recommend 75% to 80% red meat. And then 20% to 25% white meat. And about 20% of that should be fowl, 5% should be seafood. It would be good for you to combine all the meats in that ratio each time you eat. You'll be more balanced, feel better.Lots of metals in your brain and in your shoulders. Lots of metal in the left ovary. It's another reason protein is gone.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The coloring. The right kidney is full of metals. Lots of metal around the liver. Half the liver doesn't look like it's working. The left kidney, very debilitated. Heart muscles are a little weak. Lots of metals right outside the heart and in the thymus. Left thyroid is okay. Parathyroid is very good. Do you have your tonsils?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you're not processing your fats. That's a liver problem with you. Your tonsils look good. Do you have your tonsils?

Q: No, I don't.

A: This one looks like it was removed. This one looks like it's regrown or you've grown lymph glands to compensate for the missing. See the way this one is folding right here? That usually happens with removal, tonsil removal. But over here you see this nice mound? You may have grown it back. I just grew back a tonsil when I was 53, 55 now. That was 50 years after losing it. I had a terrible sore throat for a few days and I looked in there and there was the tonsil. 

Q: Wow.

A: It grew back. The right parathyroid is not working so well and the right thyroid isn't working at all. Thymus is okay. There's heavy metals in it on both sides.

Q: So you have two thyroids? You've got a right thyroid and a left one?

A: Yeah, right side and left side thyroid.

Q: What about the parathyroid?

A: Parathyroids are dotting it.

Q: Okay.

A: The thymus is here.

Q: So I'm worrying about the one with the weight.

A: That's not your problem. Your thyroid is not your problem.

Q: No.

A: You're not metabolizing sugars, so they're being made into acetones, which are toxic fats that can't be utilized. So you have to stay away from all those things. You need the good fats. Okay. Cream, butter, stuff like that. Okay. Juice I'm going to recommend... Just a basic one. You need the heavy sodium. So 80% celery, 15% parsley, and 5% summer squash. Especially cucumber. 

Q: How much cucumber?

A: 5%. 5% cucumber. Circulation in the small intestines is terrible.

Q: Where is that?

A: It's in the small intestines.

Q: Oh, right in here. Okay.

A: Doesn't look like there's any good circulation in there. Lots of scarring.

Q: Can I tell you right now?

A: Yeah.

Q: I got an adjustment from an osteopath. He did something to my area right here. I just have such weak digestion. So I went back to a different therapist and told him about it. And they did an ultrasound and then saw another therapist. And he said, you've got a problem right there. It's got to do with your digestion and your cravings, which I'm having trouble with.

A: Well, if you get the right nutrients into your body, you'll probably be able to repair that. When you have that much...

Q: Without an adjustment?

A: No, you still need adjustments.

Q: Okay.

A: You're going to continue to need them. You've got so much toxicity in the intestines that's backing up into your spine because you have a certain amount of nerves that go from the spine to the stomach and digestive tract.

Q: Right, right.

A: Those are so congested, it's backing all the way up into the spine, all the way up to your clavicle. So it'll affect you all the way up to the shoulder blades. Hot baths, hot water bottles, any of that will help. If you're lying on your back or your stomach, put them at your sides. If you're lying on your side, you can put it at your back and your stomach. The hot water bottles are the things to use. You don't want to use heating pads because heating pads put off electromagnetic fields and it alters the cellular structure, molecular structure of the cells, and it's very damaging. They don't reproduce well after that and they stay weak. The heating pads, electric. So you want to use hot water bottles.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No.

Q: Is that the thing that you microwave?

A: Yeah, because it's radioactive. It emits radiation into your body. That's how it works.

Q. The silicone is just the medium.

A: Yeah, but it does it by radiation. It's radiation excited.

Q: The stuff that you put in the microwave?

A: No, the stuff that you have to put in hot water. Hot water.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's a little different, but it usually gets too hot.

Q: Yeah, wrapping it in extra towel.

A: But it's risky. It's better not to get it too hot, because if you get it too hot, you'll destroy the enzymes in your spine or wherever it's resting against. And then you'll lose function in the area, circulation in the area. Fruits.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, that's all the scarring. Your hiatal is completely scar tissue. Your body has to dissolve some of it. It's going to dump, it's going to cause...

Q: It's not going to regenerate.

A: It will take a long time to get rid of some of the scar tissue, but it will regenerate eventually. As long as you're not putting toxic foods into your body, not all the acetates that will be formed from the carbohydrates, especially carbohydrates, that will collect in that area and make it worse, as long as you don't eat those, and you're eating lots of cream that will soothe that area. So you won't have all the heartburn, and that effect will have less pain. If you put heavy fruits in there that don't digest easily, that are high in sugars, they have to form poor acetates that are high in advanced glycation end products. It will cause more irritation to that ulcer.

Q: The sphincter muscle for the stomach, if it's a hiatal hernia, it's opened up completely, right?

A: The hiatal is the membrane that separates the stomach from the lungs. It's not the sphincter. What happens when the hiatal gets very toxic like that, when cells start dissolving that scar tissue, it dumps it right above the sphincter, and it just dumps it down in there. So the acids cause a burning all the way up, heartburn, or they cause indigestion, they dump.

Q: What did you say about the hiatal? Explain to me from the very beginning.

A: The hiatal is the membrane that separates the stomach from the lungs. That's the hiatal. A hernia means that you have a tear, an ulcer in it, where your lung starts going through and your stomach starts pushing up. One of the others is passing through the tissue that doesn't belong in that area. That's a hernia, a tear in that. When it's acidic like that, the only place that the hiatal can dump its poisons is right around that muscle above it, and it causes the acid burn. It causes burning all the way up, and it causes gas, and it causes the acids in the stomach to be very highly toxic and cause swelling. The cream and the cheese will absorb it, but it takes a while to break that down because that membrane has no release.

Q: But that membrane can heal.

A: Oh, yeah.

Q: Oh, really?

A: It just takes a while. I would say berries three days a week with two ounces of coconut cream, one ounce of cream and one and a half tablespoons of butter. Pears are good for you. Cantaloupe, it has to be unripe. 

Q: Unripe, I don't understand. Unripe cantaloupe.

A: Firm, so when you cut it, it's chewy like an apple rather than like soft, mealy.

Q: So it won't be sweet then, right?

A: It will still be sweet but not dirt sweet. And tomatoes are also better, more green, firm. Okay.

Q: Good, thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's fine.

[audio cut]

A: Okay, relax your thumbs. Okay, your left teste is almost completely dissolved. Relax your thumb. The right one is about 50% dissolved. You've had a history of very overactive adrenals, so you must have been a guy that's always active and always doing. That's usually what that implies. However, the folds here show that this one is completely debilitated right now. This one was never debilitated. This one showed that it was still producing lots of adrenaline, but this shows debilitation in it. The pancreas on the left side is working probably 10%. On the right side, it's pretty shot. So I would say it's borderline diabetic. Again, I'm not a doctor. I'm not diagnosing. The left thyroid isn't working so well. Parathyroid doesn't look like it's working at all. The tonsil area looks very good. Tonsils on both sides look good. The parathyroid on the right side is excellent. The thyroid on the right side is pretty good.

Q: I don't have my tonsils.

A: Then you've developed some very good lymph glands to support it. You still have lots of scarring around. Both of them, right in the center of this one, but all around in this one. But it still shows good function, protecting the brain. Very poor circulation in the intestines. Small intestines. On here, the descending colon is not good. Poor circulation there. Do you have a problem with constipation?

Q: Mild.

A: You're dehydrating everywhere. You see all this wrinkling that happens all over? You're not handling your fluids well at all. You're drinking too much water.

Q: I thought I wasn't drinking enough.

A: You're drinking way too much water. You need to eat tomatoes. You need to eat milk. You need to eat things where you can utilize the water 100%. You look like a person that doesn't utilize water at all. It just disintegrates you. And it just pulls good nutrients out as it goes. The body's trying to tell you something. Do you have a lot of stiffness in the shoulders, neck?

Q: Well, I've always had a problem in my shoulders, but it's never been a major problem. There's some discomfort in the shoulder in a certain position.

A: There's hardly any lubrication up there. All the muscles are just raw. I'm gonna recommend that you have eight ounces of cream a day. Break it up into four ounces with each meat meal. And two tablespoons of butter. I'm going to recommend that in the evening that you have the lubrication formula that's in the book. Juice, I'm going to recommend 80% celery, 20% parsley. They get 15% parsley and 5% summer squash, mainly cucumber. If the cucumber isn't organic, peel it. They've bastardized the meaning of organic, as I was stating earlier. So if you get zucchini or apple or orange or any fruit that looks shiny like it's waxed, you know it's waxed. They're allowed to use 3-5% petroleum product and still call it organic. That's the FDA. So peel it. They allow 2-5% petroleum. No, those rules don't even say it, don't even mention it, but they're own private rules. They won't cite anybody that only has 3-5% chemicals in it at all. They're not supposed to, yeah. You have lots of metal poisoning throughout the body. Were you around chemicals?

Q: No, not that I know of.

A: Were you raised around farms?

Q: No.

A: In the city? Airport?

Q: All my neighbors used [unintelligible] on their lawns. And I've been in that situation for the last 7 years.

A: And it could be pretty bad. I would say 5 days a week use berries with cream. Coconut cream might make you a little too nauseous if you have too much. So 1 ounce of coconut cream, 2 ounces of cream, and 1 to 2 tablespoons of butter with your afternoon berries. And I recommend 2 meat meals for you a day, that plan in the book, 2 meat meals. And the other days don't have any fruit. Just have eggs or a milkshake with no fruit. Once a week you could have pineapple, like a half an inch circular slice of pineapple with that same mixture of butter, cream, and coconut cream. Did I give you the ratio of meat?

Q: No.

A: Okay. I'm going to suggest 80% red meat for about 2 years, 2 1⁄2 years, 20% white, 15% of that should be fowl, 5% should be seafood. And I would have an equal that ratio with each meat meal, the 2 meat meals that you have in a day. Okay.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I can read that in the eyes, but I can't read that here. It shows down here that you've got a lot of scarring in that area and swelling in the prostate. But I'm always reluctant to say about those unless I can see it in the eye. But there is swelling. I just don't know what's causing it. Oh, and because I used to give the quantities of meat per individual, but that's in the recipe book. It says for your size. Anybody who's over 5 foot needs a pound a day minimum. And that's just not red meat. I mean, that's talking about all meats. When I use the word meat, it means no matter red, white, seafood, whatever. It's flesh food. Okay?

[audio cut]

A: Very protein deficient on the left side. Probably 25% of the right ovary is disintegrated. Lots of metal poisoning in the right ovary and left. You had a history of very overactive adrenal glands. So there's a lot of hyperactivity. Looks like the pancreas is completely shot. So if I were you, I'd consider myself diabetic. The thyroid doesn't look like it's working very well on the left side. Parathyroids are fine. Lots of scarring at the tonsil area on both sides. Parathyroid on the right side is barely functioning. The right thyroid doesn't look like it's functioning. The thymus is barely functioning on the right side but okay on the left. The entire chest cavity is starting to shrink. You're becoming tight in the chest. Yeah, well as soon as it's caving in, pulling your shoulders over. This whole area is starting to cave in.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Uh-huh. So probably what happened was they coated you with mercury, you know, either the methylate or mercurochrome, which is liquid mercury, and it's gone to your chest. Because this is a heavy metal all throughout here. Both sides. It's gone down, damaged the heart, too. Kidney, left kidney is almost completely saturated with metals. Right is, too. Yep, they used a lot of garbage on you. Lots of metal in the brain. How do you feel?

Q: Well, I got my flexibility band, which I feel grateful for. Tired. I'm tired. 

A: Because I would say that you'd be in chronic fatigue, and it's going to be hard to get you out of it. I would recommend that you have juice, 60% celery, 15% parsley, 15% cilantro, and the rest summer squash. Cilantro is going to pull out the heavy metals. So you need a fat right along with your juices, because the juices will be refrigerated. You need to have, if you're having butter or coconut cream or cream, whether you could have one or all three of them, but no more than two tablespoons with each juice, each eight ounces. If it's a coconut cream, when it's refrigerated, it's like butter, it's hard. So you have it before you drink the juice. If it's a raw cream from the cows, you just mix it in the juice right before you drink it. If it's a butter, you have to eat it before you drink. And I would rotate or have all three at one time before each juice. But don't have the same fat with each juice, because it'll go pull out metals out of different places, and you want to rotate the areas because that's very toxic. And the reason that, you know, you're just dissolving everywhere because you don't have good fats. You're not absorbing your minerals because you lack the proper fats. So you need lots, lots and lots of... It's going to be difficult because you need the weight, because of the surgery too much weight is going to cause stress in those areas because the surgery has been so recent. So you're going to have to, you know, keep a balance of it. Go up a little bit slower than normal and hold it for maybe nine months. The excess weight, take two months to take it off for maybe ten years. There's a weight loss program in the recipe book that will help you. For fruit, I recommend only the berries, the dark berries, to help get rid of the metal poisoning, with two ounces of coconut cream and two ounces of raw cream. With the meats, you need about two ounces of cream. How tall are you?

Q: Five foot and a half.

A: Okay. With the first meat meal, one ounce of cream and two tablespoons of butter, so it's two tablespoons of each. And then for the, to use the two meat meals a day. And for the evening meat meal, have two ounces of cream and one tablespoon of butter. The other day in the evening, I'd like you to have the moisturizing formula. It's in the book. Tastes like a lemon meringue drink. Meat, I'm going to recommend, did I already recommend meat?

Q: Yeah.

A: Yes, I did, 80% red. 80% red. A little bit, well, what I'm going to suggest is that you have, every time you have red meat, you have some seafood with it, so you don't get too acid, too irritable. And lots of tomatoes. 

Q: A few years ago, prior to the surgery, I thought I was too acidic. I was breaking out in an eczema and went to two or three different skin doctors. I finally just went away by itself, but my hands, body, I was itching like crazy.

A: Well, you've got all this dehydrated tissue and lots of sugar byproducts in there. I see them always. They're trying to eat a yeast product, so they're trying to eat it. So that causes itching, but if you have enough cream and tomatoes, you'll be fine. Be sure to have your juice, even if it makes you a little sleepy and tired. Take a nap.

Q: How can you do that when you work for 12 hours a day?

A: You have to take an hour out of your day. Even John F. Kennedy took an hour out of his day as a president. He said, nobody bothers me between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock, took his nap.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You're welcome. Okay. What is your name?

Q: Dan.

A: Dan, hi Dan. Nice to meet you. Relax your thumbs. Okay. Overactive and strong testes. History of overactive adrenal glands. Usually implies that somebody has a high sexual, you know, nature. So, if you don't have a partner, you need to take care of yourself. The left side of the pancreas is about 20% operative.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: And I take care of myself. The right side of the pancreas is working about 10%. So, it looks like you're borderline diabetic. That's what happens. The pancreas overworks and overworks and then it breaks down. And you're just deteriorating. I mean, you're still not at that point where you're diabetic. This side looks completely shot. Thyroid gland, right side looks okay. The thymus is even better, but lots of metals around it. Lots of metals. Looks like you have some kind of growth in the liver. Left thyroid looks okay. Parathyroid's not functioning. The left tonsils don't look like they're functioning.

Q: Yeah, that's why. I did have it. It was diagnosed on the point of the liver. I had lung and bone cancer a couple of years ago and treatments and just a lot of stuff. Then they reduced it down to thinking it might be a small cyst on the liver.

A: Well, it's not a little cyst anymore. They treated you. That thing's pretty big. They cut up about a third of the liver. You don't have any signs of bone cancer. What you do is have metal in your bones and that creates an anemia and a blood contamination that looks like blood cancer. 

Q: I'm actually getting the amalgams taken out of my teeth.

A: Are you going to? 

Q: I'm in the process of doing that. The doctor's going to give me cilantro and other things to take after the treatment.

A: Yeah, but it doesn't help unless you have lots of fat with it. So you have to take lots of cream. Cream has affinity to the nerves and that's where mercury goes into the nerves mostly. Lots of cream, and I mean you should be drinking 8 to 10 ounces of cream a day minimum. And gain lots of weight because you need to protect yourself. You need to get all that metal out of the bone. Did you work with chemicals?

Q: Not that I know of.

A: Looks like you inhaled them because it's right around, because it's in the whole digestive canal going down and locks into the kidneys and then goes from there to the bones and the hip and spine. So probably inhaled.

Q: I wonder. Not that I'm aware of.

A: Did you grow up around the airport, farming land, city.

Q: In the suburbs.

A: That's usually not that bad unless there's a plant nearby.

Q: Did you smoke?

Q: I did smoke cigars a lot.

A: Cigars is pretty bad even though you don't inhale the smoke. There's heavy metals in that. 

Q: It's been about 3 or 4 years.

A: Stays in your body for a lifetime. Unless you get the right nutrients to remove it. Juice I'm going to recommend. 60% celery, 15% parsley, 10% cilantro, and the rest summer squash.

[audio cut]

A: I recommend that you put a hot water bottle at your right side to get that liver functioning. Every time I've seen cancer take over a body is when the liver stops functioning. Stops digesting the fat, dissolves dead cells, so they start collecting. Your liver is pretty close. I would say 90% of your liver doesn't look like it's functioning. There's only 10% functioning. That's like what happened after my poison mushroom. You need to get that functioning. You need to force it to function.

Q: A lot of fat.

A: A lot of fat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Of course. There's no other language with me. And the kidneys are pretty bad, so hot water bottle all in this area. Put them on both sides. Hot both sides. I'm going to suggest the lubrication formula for you. I'd like you to make one and have half of it with each meat meal. Plus two tablespoons of cream, I mean two ounces of cream with each meat meal. I'm going to recommend liver three pounds a week for about six months. That's heavy on it, but you need to do as much as possible. Because if this goes into liver cancer with that much gone, it's not going to be easy.

Q: How many meat meals a day?

A: Well, I would say one day two meat meals, the next day three, alternate. Normally, you should have two meat meals a day. But because you need so much protein regulated at least every other day, I would alternate. After a couple of years, cut it down to the one, I mean the one, two a day consistently. How old are you?

Q: Fifty-one.

A: You still have some growth hormones left. So, I'm going to recommend that while you, from the next six years, because that looks like how long it will be unless, you know, if you don't eat a lot now, keep it going. Because it looks like you're aging pretty rapidly. So, eat one and a half to two pounds of meat a day. And I mean force it. You can mix it with that, you know, or even wash it down with a lube formula if you're having a problem. And with the liver, you can blend it with a little red onion. It's like pate. I hate it. So, what I'll do is I'll spoon some out, wait about ten minutes. I have another one. By the time twenty minutes goes by and I've had two tablespoons, it tastes delicious to me. And then I can just eat it and eat it and eat it. But I have to give myself, I have to let my body get familiar with it each time. And then it's delicious. I would suggest that you blend it with milk because then it's very easy, but you can't get enough if you're blending it with milk because it takes about 50% milk and 50% liver. But you can do it like that a couple of times, but do the pate more often to get it down. And lots of berries, you know, the dark berries with two ounces of coconut cream and two ounces of raw cream. And then just sip cream all day long. Lots of tomatoes. Okay.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Do me a favor and give me an egg. One that has something in it. Easy. Fast food. Okay.

Q: I like to enjoy the yolk by itself. Don't you? Just eat it.

Q: Is that close enough to hear?

A: When you do this, the white comes out first.

Q: So the yolk goes?

A: Yeah. The yolk goes last.

Q: Do you also do duck eggs, quail eggs? You say? Ostrich eggs?

Q: It's on pause.

[chatter]

A: What's your name?

Q: Linda.

A: Hi Linda. Would you believe you're fat deficient?

Q: Do I look it?

A: No. That's what I said. Every bit of, almost all the fat in your body is completely not moving. Your lymph system is just like solidified. So it's collected, congested, all this stuff in your body.

Q: I believe it. But I've been trying to work on it.

A: I'm going to recommend that you eat about four ounces of coconut cream a day. So have a tablespoon before each vegetable juice. And in your vegetable juice, I'm going to recommend 70% celery, 15% parsley, 5% pineapple puree, which means you put the pineapple into a blender and you blend it. Get all the pulp and pour that into the vegetable juice. And then the rest, summer squash. Even cucumbers are okay. And you have to have one tablespoon of coconut cream before you drink the vegetable juice. And put a half a tablespoon of cream in the juice right before you drink it. Coconut cream first and then half a tablespoon of cream, cow's cream, in the juice. The left thyroid doesn't look like it's functioning very well. Lots of scarring at the left tonsil. And scarring at the right tonsil. Parathyroid is working excellently on the right side. Looks like it's overstressed though. Thyroid on the right side is good. Not transporting oxygen to the system properly along with all the lymphatic congestion. So lots of warm baths to get some of that fat dissolved and fluid again with the new raw fats coming in to dissolve it and make it move. So I would say, you know, half an hour minimum in a bath, 45 minutes to an hour preferably. 

Q: I used to take that.

A: But if you do what I used to do, I would get into a bath at night and I would sleep in the bath.

Q: Did you?

A: Yep. I'd wake up every hour and a half, two hours, freezing cold, warm the water and go back to sleep again. And six hours in water like that is worth ten hours in a bed.

Q: And have something in that water?

A: Yeah. Yeah, have two tablespoons of sun-dried sea salt, two and a half cups of raw milk, and a quarter of a cup of, which is two ounces of raw apple cider vinegar.

Q: I've done that with vinegar.

A: And then you'll be able to sleep in there a long time. Get that stuff moving and out of there. Pretty caked. Fruit. I suggest that every other day you have a quarter-inch slice of pineapple, circular slice of pineapple, two ounces of coconut cream, and two ounces of cream. So you might mix them together so you're not so nauseous. I never did like coconut. I know. Because it'll start ripping that stuff out of your system. But get through it. It's your major detox. Do it. Force it. Also, flax oil. Every other day with one of your meat meals. Especially one of your white meat meals. Because flax oil tastes like fish anyway. So I suggest having it with a fish meal.

Q: How much of that?

A: About three tablespoons minimum. Up to five tablespoons with that meal.

Q: I don't know about it, but I haven't really done that.

A: Very poor circulation in the small intestines. Lots of metal in the brain. So one day you'll have the pineapple, the next day you'll have berries. It's the same ratio of cream to coconut cream.

Q: My hands break out too, also.

A: Sugars. Yeasts coming out. It looks like this. Yeasts coming out. Well, they turn dark, you know, at the joints around here. That's usually like antibiotic molds or molds from breads. Stuff like that that you've eaten. When it's like this, it's usually sugar molds, yeasts. 

Q: Okay, about two years and it breaks open. They break open. I've been wondering and trying to figure out what it was.

A: Your lymph system isn't dissolving anything.

Q: I'm taking herbs.

A: You shouldn't be taking anything.

Q: You shouldn't be taking anything?

A: They're more acid. Unless they're fresh. Your vegetable juice or your herbs is your herb tea. You just don't cook it.

Q: Don't cook?

A: You don't cook your vegetable juice. When you cook herbs or even dehydrate them, they turn acid in the system. It takes a hell of a herbal digestive tract or herbivore to digest those vegetables properly. That's why we juice them. Herbs are not that good. If you're lackey living in the rice fields and get no protein, it can be helpful. There are times when there's no fresh vegetables available. But mainly it's not good.

Q: Do you really stop doing this?

A: Stop taking... Any kind of supplement. Any kind of herb. Raw cream and coconut cream is what you need to start clearing the system.

Q: Can you tell if it still has...

A: As I said, I looked in your eyes and I see it in your hands.

Q: I still have it. I've been trying to clear it.

A: There's no way you're going to clear that without doing something drastic. Like the baths and the coconut cream. It's been a long time building up. 30 years. So follow three meat meals a day.

Q: Three meat?

A: Yeah, three meat meals a day. So follow that pattern in the book of eating.

Q: Parasites. Don't worry about parasites.

A: It'll be a good friend. Parasites are not something you should even think about. I doubt you're not even going to get parasites. But your lymph system, you know. Parasites don't feed on toxicity in the lymph. It takes solvents to dissolve that. So I suggest the coconut cream and the flax oil. 

Q: Okay, and I have never liked coconut.

A: That's why. Just go in there and rip stuff out. And you need to have a steady supply of fats and proteins together. So I suggest any time you're thirsty or hungry, you have lots of eggs.

Q: Eggs?

A: Eggs, like I just had. You can break them into a glass. When people get bothered by the eggs, it's the texture of the egg white. If you break it into a glass, or like I do, you suck a little of the egg white at a time, it's tasteless, benign as can be, and it's easy to swallow. If you try to put it all in your mouth at once, that causes the gagging of that. So a little bit of egg white, and most everybody loves the yolk, so it's a treat when you finish with the yolk. Some milk, not too much milk. The honey with your meat's good. So lots of cream and butter with your meat.

Q: No salt butter. I love butter.

A: Good.

Q: Always have. What am I doing with this? How much butter?

A: I would say about 5 tablespoons a day. You need cream. I gave you the amount of cream and also coconut cream and eggs. But you have to have the protein three times a day. Most of that fat goes with the protein, except when you're having the fruit. Eggs are something you can have outside of other meals, because it's got a balance of protein already with the fat. The eggs do. Yeah. So that's your fast, quick, easy, easiest meal is your egg. But it doesn't help regenerate cells. It will help rebuild cells that are already alive and those that are weak, which are alive and weak. But it won't help regenerate or it doesn't help cell division.

Q: I had a live blood cell test, and that said parasite oxygen. I was lacking fat walk. I'm fat, but I shouldn't be walking.

A: You should be lucky to have parasites.

Q: Be lucky. And I wanted to get rid of them.

A: No, then you'd get even fatter.

Q: Oh, really?

A: Because your lymph system isn't working for you, and you've got protein poisons. Because the parasites only work on degenerative cells. They will only eat cells, degenerative cells. So if your lymph system isn't breaking dead cells down, you're likely to get cancer if you get rid of your parasites.

Q: If I get rid of them? I was anxious to work on that. I had cancer ten years ago. Modified radical mastectomy. Left side. I've been through the chemo, and I didn't know all your words that you were saying about that. But I did it.

A: That's probably what was the last draw for your lymph system. You're going to have to suffer through the vomiting and everything. Oh, yes.

Q: Oh, really?

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay, thank you.

A: You're welcome. It used to be ice cold everywhere. It could be 90 degrees and I'd have gloves on. It's so nice not to be freezing cold.

Q: Hi, sir. Do you have any plans to be coming back any time soon?

A: No. Whenever you guys get a group together again, it's usually once a year I'll go.

Q: Do you have papers?

A: Yeah, somewhere. Well, all of my information is in the back of the book.

Q: Have you ever heard of Dr. Joe Mercola?

A: Yes, yeah. He's just new. He's new. He's just learning. He's a baby in the industry.

Q: Well, [unintelligible].

A: He's good, yeah. But he draws too many conclusions too quickly.

Q: About what in particular?

A: About milk, you know, cow's milk. Gosh, you know.

Q: Egg whites.

A: Pardon?

Q: Egg whites.

A: Egg whites, yeah. I mean, he just draws so many conclusions. He gives me a little bit of information, and he takes it for granted it's right. Yeah. And it isn't.

Q: Oh, yeah?

A: Yeah. Yeah, but he's got a good heart. Yeah. He's just too skinny and too panicked. He needs lots of fats.

Q: He's got your book. We want to live.

A: Oh, yeah?

Q: Yeah.

A: He sent it to me, and I read it earlier this year.

A: Good.

Q: Yeah.

A: Good man. Good heart.

Q: Yeah, we're doing the best we can, but it's a process.

A: You're going into psoriasis if you're not already into it. I'm not a doctor, and I'm not diagnosing it, but these are all the symptoms of psoriasis all over the system.

Q: Mm-hmm. I don't have it anymore.

A: Pardon?

Q: I don't have it anymore. I see myself as a truly healthy person. Good energy, good mental clarity.

A: You see all the dryness in here?

Q: Yeah.

A: You see all that? That's a sign of very poor health.

Q: But couldn't that be from just the surface, from the soaps that I use?

A: Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Because you see other people using them. They don't have dry skin like this. Also, you're very jaundiced. See how yellow you are? Yeah. It means you don't digest your fats properly, so your body's using what normally digests fats to bind with poisons. So your whole system is highly acidic.

Q: Maybe this carotenoid is also building up from all the spirulina and other natural sources of beta-carotene.

A: It doesn't look like that.

Q: Yeah?

A: No. In fact, the carotene will bind with the bile.

Q: Why do I feel so healthy then?

A: Because you're full of bile.

Q: That's better than being full of shit.

A: No, it's true. Your system is constantly hyperactive and irritated. You also have very – relax your thumbs. Your testes are very overactive. You've got a history of very overactive adrenal glands, one of the [unintelligible] adrenal gland areas that I've seen on both sides. So, like I say, you have a lot of hormones, enough to keep you pumping. But this kind of dryness, you know, ten years you might find yourself in sores all over, if you weren't to change your diet.

Q: Let me give you some further insight of why this is there. The first 20 years of my life I was chronically ill, and I had severe allergic dermatitis. And over ten years, the doctors, all they had to offer me, because the skin on my hands would become so dry and inflamed, it would crack and bleed. No, topical hydrocortisone creams for ten years while I was growing and developing.

A: Oh god.

Q: And I know that the skin on my hands, it looks like an old man. You know, the skin everywhere else on my body I think looks good, but the skin on my hands looks old.

A: Let me see your feet, one of your foot. Give me your, let's see, you're right-handed. Give me your right foot.

Q: Okay. I used to have it on my feet too, but I didn't put nearly as much hydrocortisone cream on my feet as I did on my hands.

A: You get the same problem. Let me see the bottom. Same problem. You just need lots of cream. 

Q: Raw fat.

A: Raw, lots of cream. More cream than butter. You need cream.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: And I would say, well... Let me see. And when this bile comes out, it's just going to, you know, you're going to be even more yellow than you are right now, but you're very yellow. That's all bile, not the carotene. Carotene doesn't look like that.

Q: You mean bile or bilirubin?

A: Bilirubin, bile turns, bilirubin turns into bile, or bile turns into bilirubin. They can exchange back and forth.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: So... But they're there to digest fats and break down fats.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: They're not there to... Fats are to bind with poisons. You are using the fat digesters to bind with poisons in place of fats. So you've got bile everywhere in the system. Everywhere.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: And that causes irritation to the system. Um...

Q: I don't feel irritation. I feel... I feel my experience is peaceful energy, relaxed strength.

A: A lot of people think that they feel that way, but if they had somebody observe them, they wouldn't... they may get a different impression.

Q: Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

A: I've gotten a very different impression, because I've seen you go into fear four times, and almost, you know, almost like a... an aggressive, attacking approach. You may think that you've got it under control, but I can sure see it.

Q: When? When did you see it?

[laughter]

A: I saw it four times today. Four times. And you did not relax it until I gave you enough of the answer that you understood, and then you were completely relaxed about it. But when you're...

Q: I was so oblivious about it, I didn't...

A: When you're disturbed, you're not, you know, you're not balanced, you're not calm. Most people who are that way don't realize it because they're living in it. Just like when I was, like I say, hyperactive with all that sugar. For me, it was great because I had been so weak all my life. I loved all that energy. And I didn't think there was anything wrong with it. I thought I was perfectly healthy until my teeth started dissolving. My bones started going after six and a half years of it. So, it's... You're not your best, you know... Everybody is not their best mirror for themselves.

Q: Okay.

A: Juice... Go for a straight 80% celery, 20% parsley.

Q: Okay. Why that recommendation?

A: Because I don't want to start dissolving anything. I just want to stabilize your system before you start detoxifying. You need to stabilize your system.

Q: What quantity of that juice and also what quantity of the cream?

A: I'm going to recommend... A cup of juice the first thing in the morning. You could have 8 to 12 ounces in the morning. Then in the afternoon, have 8 ounces, then 12 ounces, then 8 ounces. If, after the 12 ounces of juice in the morning, if you get sleepy and tired, then cut it down to 8 ounces. And then do 8, 12, 8, 12 before you go to bed. Or 8, 12, 12, 8 before you go to bed. So your urine ain't so much of the vegetable juice. Celery, parsley.

Q: How long should I do that?

A: About a year and a half. And I suggest that the lubrication formula that's in the book, you make one of those for each meat meal. I'm going to suggest you have two meat meals a day. That routine in there, for the two meat meals a day. Have a lubrication formula for each time you have meat. And I'd like you to sip like two ounces of cream at a time, four to five times a day. And have at least four cherry tomatoes each time you have that. It'll help capture some of the bile that's throughout your system. It'll relax your nerves a little bit.

Q: I was pointing to my head. I thought you were going to say it's going to help you grow hair.

A: Usually people that have that much bile in the system don't get their hair back. It's like I said, that 40% of my book that don't grow their hair back, you're one of those with all that bile. You know, maybe in 12 years when you get rid of the bile, maybe that's a possibility, but I haven't seen anybody do it yet.

Q: And why do you suspect this bile has built up?

A: Because your body was fat deficient. The proper fats to chelate with poisons in the body. Because that's what fats do. Fats lock on to the poisons. That's why poisons go to the glands, because there's so much fat in there. It's so fat-rich, and the brain.

Q: I didn't start looking kind of yellowish until I started drinking fresh organic vegetable juice. About 10 years ago.

A: What it does is it's helping you throw it out the skin. So it's already, you're detoxifying it, but you have a load, quite a load, in the system. Because this says it's everywhere still.

Q: I grew up on junk food. Nothing but junk food. I wasn't breastfed.

A: Well, what it means, though, is that your liver was bad.

Q: My history is similar to yours, not quite as bad as yours. I mean, it's like the medical profession was trying to kill you. They were just, you know, abusing me.

A: What do you mean? They were trying to save me.

Q: It's amazing how much abuse we can now take.

A: I know.

Q: And still keep going, and the body, our life force, energy drive.

A: It doesn't stop.

Q: Incredible.

A: Well, most of us, it doesn't stop. And I would suggest, also, eggs are very good for removing the bile out the intestines.

Q: I don't eat eggs, the yolk's raw. Sometimes I cook the whites.

A: Another one of Mercola's things. Don't digest the proteins. Recently he said something about not the egg whites.

Q: Avidin [unintelligible].

A: That was a misprint in my first book.

Q: I actually listen to my body on this. Sometimes when I do raw egg whites, it digestively doesn't agree with me. There's no pain or anything. For some reason it produces gas.

A: Because it starts pulling the chemicals into the stomach.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I had it in my first book. But the spell checker changed the avidin to albumin. So it screwed it up. So if you substitute, when I talk about eggs and the biotin combining with albumin, that's supposed to be avidin. The spell checker changed it. And in my lab work it showed that it created, it got rid of biotoxins. So it's not a bad thing. That biotin is being used very well. And the only time you're going to be biotin deficient is if you're eating a cooked diet. There's plenty of biotin in meats and everything.

Q: So you can eat a raw egg, there's no problem.

A: Correct. In fact, it's very healthy.

Q: Plus, if you have a healthy intestinal flora, you're going to be producing biotin there too. But I was listening to my body. I do the egg whites gently cooked, and it feels better digestively. I eat them raw and have a little bit of a problem.

A: Because it's pulling the chemicals out. When those chemicals dump into the intestines and mix with your natural hydrochloric acid, it causes a gaseous reaction. Not a bad thing, but that's something you have to go through. It's like having to decontaminate areas. The gases that are produced are not pleasant, but it's a necessary thing. You can try to do it another way, but like I say, there's no way quicker than raw eggs. The whole raw eggs. Egg yolk. Because it takes a protein to help get rid of the bile. But you do what you need to do. I'm just giving you my information.

Q: By the way, raw salmon is great to have with raw ostrich. Have you ever had raw ostrich?

A: No, I haven't.

Q: It's really good.

A: Yeah. Okay, I'll try it sometime.

Q: The raw ostrich is really lean. It's hardly any fat. So the salmon makes some good fatty salmon. Yeah. But it's a great combination.

A: I'll try it. Yes. And as far as, if you're going to have milk, milk's usually not good for this kind of a condition.

Q: I don't do any dairy at all.

A: But you definitely need to do the cream and the butter.

Q: Cream and butter, and also coconut cream?

A: Yeah. Well, no, I don't want you to eat coconut cream.

Q: No?

A: No. Too much of a solvent. You don't like that. You need to stabilize your body. So I suggest that you eat the cream and the raw cream, the goat's, I mean the cow's cream and eggs and have, you know, besides the two lubrication formulas with the two meat meals, I suggest that you have about five to six eggs by themselves at one time and another time you could have a milkshake with three eggs, three ounces of cream, two ounces of milk only a day, and then a tablespoon and a half or less of honey with that.

Q: Really raw?

A: Really raw is good honey, very good honey.

Q: I do something with egg yolks I call Magnificent 7, it's the egg yolks I mix together with bee pollen and green superfoods like spirulina and chlorella and some barley juice, grass powder. What do you think of those, you know, green foods, those green powders?

A: I found that they're not good on a raw diet, they help people who eat cooked foods. They cause like any kind of over mineral reaction like heavy salts, they'll cause a stimulation to the adrenal glands so it makes you feel better but it's not necessarily a healthy stimulation like coffee, caffeine, you know, theobromine and chocolate, it's not a healthy stimulation so I've cut them out and the vegetable juice works very well to replace the vitamins and enzymes in them and do it without causing a problem.

Q: I have something I teach patients at the clinic, I call it the big seven health foundation pillars and nutrition is just one of the pillars, the other pillars are breathing and water, I know you would take issue with that, but some like fresh air, exercise and sleep.

A: All very important, but I mention those in my book.

Q: Can you give a little bit more explanation about why you don't personally exercise?

A: Oh well, it's just because I was so unhealthy as a child I never got into exercise.

Q: Which you did there for a while, you were exercising.

A: Yeah, because it was something I'd never experienced, but then after that year and a half, I thought Jesus, I could be using my brain and my art, so I got into painting and I did all this stuff, and I had no time for that. And it didn't excite me, like, you know, the mind stuff, because I was able to read and you know, all those things that I...

Q: So you needed to follow your enthusiasm.

A: That for the enthusiasm, yes. Now, if I had worry circles in my eyes, I would definitely, even if I didn't feel like it, exercise. But I have no worry circles in my eyes, and you have four, minimum that I can see. If I blew your eye up, I'd probably find six. But you have worry circles. And people who have worry circles, if they don't exercise, they will get emotionally upset, because the hormones will overwork on their systems and they need to burn off the hormones. And I have no worry circles, not a one in my eye.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It can be other things other than cortisone. It can be adrenaline. It can be over testosterone. It can be a combination of all of them. Every one of my champion athletes has at least five worry circles and up to eight worry circles in their eyes. So they have to spend eight to ten hours a day working out. And that's why they're great athletes. Because they're built that way, biologically.

Q: How much direct sunlight do you get and how much do you recommend for me?

A: Well, I recommend most people about 45 minutes a day, 40 minutes minimum a day. But in a city like this, it's not easy and working is not easy. I get like 20 minutes minimum a day, usually 40 minutes. I'll take a nap in the sun. And then I'll take my vacation, of course. I'll spend most of it in the sunshine.

Q: What time of the day?

A: It's between 10 and 2 o'clock.

Q: Is that in the noon?

A: Yes, absolutely. Where I am, I can do it. Mountains of Malibu.

Q: What about sleep?

A: Sleep, it depends upon the individual. Most cellular reproduction, 80%, 90% of cellular reproduction happens in the sleep state. That means that much healing happens in the sleep state. So for some people, they need a lot of sleep. For others, they don't. I used to sleep, you know, 20 hours a day when I was in my healing state. Now I sleep anywhere from 3 1⁄2 to 4 1⁄2 hours a day. And with a nap.

Q: What time do you go to bed?

A: I go to bed whenever I feel like going to bed.

Q: Well, I'll put it this way. I called him at midnight our time when I was going through some bad detox. He answers the phone.

A: Yeah, I only sleep about, like, last night I slept 3 1⁄2 hours. And then I slept 45 minutes on the plane. And I'm not tired. I stay alert and active all the time. When I used to have to have a lot of sleep, now I don't need as much sleep.

Q: Well, you look a little tired to me today.

A: Yeah, I may be. My body, after what I went through yesterday, yes, definitely. An IV, the sugar water.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, that's all right. Yeah, I should be tired after what I went through yesterday, definitely. Well, normally I don't, even though I'm in the [unintelligible]. But I had some things put in my blood, and a pint of blood removed. More than a pint of blood removed yesterday. I'm just glad I'm not feeling it, because then I wouldn't be doing well for you. Anyway, I'm not here to challenge you. We're taking up way too much time, so we need to move through on this.

Q: Okay, fine. Thank you. Thank you very much.

A: Let me see if there's anything else here. Pears and cheese are good for you, with some butter.

Q: What kind of cheese?

A: Monterey Jack, no salt, would be a little bit better. Jack is a little bit better.

Q: I don't know where to get raw cheese from this year.

Q: I do.

Q: You do? All right. I haven't eaten since this morning.

A: Poor circulation in the intestines, on the left side mainly. So you might want to put a hot water bottle on the left side. Did I tell you the ratio of meat? Looks like, I don't think I did. Looks like you should have about 50% red and 50% white. And I'm not sure with this kind of an acid condition that I would eat red meat without having some white meat with it. So I'd always combine white meat with your red meat. So you might want to make each meal that you have a balance of red and white.

Q: I haven't done that yet. I just eat red meat exclusively.

A: You can't repair the skin without the white meat.

Q: Would white fish with red meat, that wouldn't cut it?

A: No. Fish is mainly to reconstitute the inner workings of the brain and nervous system. But the actual myelin sheaths and the epidermic walls of cells, intestines, skin, everywhere is better reproduced with white meat. That's fowl. I've seen it react much quicker that way.

Q: Specifically chicken and turkey? Duck would cut it?

A: Duck is fine. Any fowl.

Q: Any fowl. Duck is a darker meat.

A: Doesn't matter. Whenever I talk about fowl, fowl is always white. Just like fish, you can have tuna that's red, it's still white meat. The way it reacts in my laboratory tests with animals. They did nicely with brain activity and neurological activity with fish, no matter what kind it was. And those that were fed the chicken always had better skin, intestines, better neurological framework. Not that the brain worked any better or the nervous system worked any better, but they always had good skin, good coats, good everything with the white meats. With the red meat, they always had better blood, better muscle, better glands. Dark glands, not the lymph glands.

Q: That's interesting because I don't eat any fowl right now. I haven't for a long time.

Q: Ostrich?

Q: Ostrich?

A: That's a fowl.

Q: It's a red meat though.

A: No, it's a fowl.

Q: It counts as a fowl?

A: It counts as a fowl, absolutely. Like I say, any bird will count as white meat.

Q: Even though the meat is red?

A: Yeah, just like I said. If it's red fish, it's still white meat. If it's red, you know, it can be turkey wings, which are very dark red, it's still white meat. The way it reacts in bodies.

Q: So the buffalo and the grass-fed beef?

A: It's all red meat. Lamb, goat, deer, any of that's red meat. That will react on the glands, the blood, and the muscles, mainly.

Q: Okay, that's an important clarification.

A: It's in the books, too, both of them.

Q: I just picked up the second one today. I want to thank you very much for all the wonderful work that you've done. It was a pleasure meeting you. I'm glad I came. I'm going to share this experience with a lot of people. Thank you very much.

A: Milk. Yes, thank you.

[chatter]

A: What's your name?

Q: Al.

A: Al. Well, Al, you're one big metal. You're a robot.

Q: Sounds good to me.

A: Where did you get all this metal?

Q: I don't know.

A: Were you a mechanic?

Q: No.

A: Live under an airport? I've only seen people like that with this kind of poisoning. And also people live on farms that use sprays.

Q: Maybe a past life.

[audio cut]

A: All of your glands are overactive. It's starting to dehydrate everywhere in your system. How old are you, Al?

Q: Sixty-two.

A: The left side of the pancreas doesn't look active. The right's about 20% active. The parathyroid on the right's weak. The left's okay. You have lots of overactive hormones. That's why you can't stand still.

Q: I can stand still. I don't move for eight hours, ten hours, when I finally get a chance.

A: Then you really go for it. You have to figure out where the metal poisoning came from. Did you do drugs?

Q: I've been in the drug culture. I don't know what the quantity is, but not a tremendous amount of quantities.

A: Well, sometimes it doesn't take a poor... I met a kid who came to me who smoked a lot of marijuana for only a two-year period, or a year-and-a-half period. But that marijuana had been sprayed by the U.S. government in Mexico, and it had mercury in it.

Q: I was big into grass when it was before spraying.

A: Well, you thought before spraying?

Q: Before spraying.

A: You think before spraying?

Q: No, no.

A: We have to figure out where this came from.

Q: I don't know. I can't... I mean, they weren't even doing what I was doing with cocaine. They weren't doing the spraying. They weren't doing anything.

A: Yeah, but cocaine's loaded with alkaloids.

Q: Yeah?

A: How much cocaine did you do? Did you sniff it, or did you smoke it?

Q: Never smoked it. Never would smoke it. Never would inject it, because that's—that would control me.

A: Well, if I know what it's from, I know how to—you know, what to tell you. But some of it is from cocaine, so that's heavy alkaloid. So it's some pretty toxic heavy metals. That's why it turns people's teeth gray. It just starts rotting the whole system, because it's very heavy in alkaloids. Even the natives down there, they're so poor that they eat—they chew on the raw cocaine leaf to kill their hunger, because they get so protein deficient. And then their teeth start falling out at the age of 30, because they're getting so protein deficient, because they keep aborting their hunger, because they don't have the foods. So they eat the cocaine like that, and cocaine's full of alkaloids. You'll see people with cocaine history, their teeth are just gray. You can see it. Yours just didn't go in. It's your teeth, let me see. It went into the rest of your bones, everywhere, tissues. But it's a lot more than that, so you need a lot of eggs to clear that. Eggs will clear that out pretty well. Coconut cream, berries. I suggest that you do the two-cycle meat suggestion in the recipe book. That pattern of eating. I recommend that you have two ounces of cream with each meat meal and make a lubrication formula. And have half of it with each meat meal plus two ounces of cream. Don't put the cream, don't blend the cream in the lubrication formula. But have it, let's say have the cream right after you have the meat meal with the half lubrication formula. And then have mainly eggs by themselves. You'll do a lot better if you have eggs by themselves. About eight, six to eight a day. Even ten a day sometimes to help pull it out. And after you do that, about a half an hour later, have about three cherry tomatoes or half a tomato. Either the three cherry tomatoes or half a tomato. With two more tables, two more ounces of cream. Just to coat your nerves because of this... No matter what kind of metal this is, if it's mercury, it can cause it to start dissolving and burning tissue if you don't have the cream there right away and bind with it in the blood. It can cause scarring all over. See this scar right here? I had very lightweight carport that I built. Every year the 80 mile an hour winds up there in the mountains tore it through it all the way down to the beach three miles away. I live up in the mountains. So this time I got big bars and I drilled them with even greater anchors into the concrete. I took off this glove to anchor what I was going to drill and that drill bit slipped off and just scratched me just like I had gotten a thorn scrape from a rose bush. Very light. But the dust got into it and I brushed it off. I thought nothing about it. I didn't think it went through enough layers to cause a problem because it wasn't bleeding. It was just a scratch. The next day I woke up and I left it alone. This whole skin was burned and bubbled up and blistered and just came right off. So I waited until Monday. That was a Saturday when that happened. Sunday, the blister blistered and came off. In this whole area, the scar tissue was elevated this high up until a month ago. I called the company where I got it and I said, What's in your metals? And they said, Well, we don't manufacture, we just resell. So I said, I need to talk with the company that forged these metal bars. So I got the name of it. I found that they use building materials... They're allowed to use 12 to 20 percent mercury and radioactive, spent radioactive waste in building materials. Jewelry, they're allowed to use 7 percent in your jewelry, especially silver. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, yeah, yeah. So white gold and gold, you're better off using those for jewelry. Every other jewelry, keep away from them if they've been produced in the last 15 years. Platinum, same one.

Q: Would they have mercury in their jewelry?

A: In jewelry, yep. Silver already has a lot of mercury in it, but there are alloys now that are building in it daily. So that's what caused that blistering. The metal stayed in that spot. My body couldn't reject it, so it melted, and I had a huge scar there, a keloid. So it was hurting so bad, and it would stay inflamed. I took a knife and cut the scar off, and instantly it stopped. The pain stopped. But that's how bad metals can react in the system. You have them all over the body. So you need the fats regularly in your blood because if you start moving them out of the system, you want to bind with them quickly. Lots of berries, you know, like six ounces of berries in the afternoon with a couple of ounces of coconut cream and three to four ounces of cream with it. Always more cream. You know, we need creams to bind with it and less to dissolve just to protect yourself.

Q: Better than avocados?

A: Avocados don't take care of that. In fact, they're going to be hard to digest. You get a lot of metal in the ducts going in and out of the liver.

Q: Does anyone ever get a good review from you?

A: [unintelligible] I sit there and say, oh my God, if I could only be like this. If I saw it, I would give it.

Q: Could you read yourself?

A: Oh, yes. Okay.

Q: No listening to heavy metal.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I would say about anywhere from 92 to 98% is what we respond to. People who do what I suggest, 92 to 98% of them always do better. If they don't do what I suggest, they don't do as well.

Q: When did you start learning how to do this?

A: Well, I started studying kind of palm... You know, the Chinese have methods and other people have methods of reading. I wasn't good at the Chinese method. It didn't make sense to me and I tried to do it by the book and it didn't seem to work for me.

Q: You also use your tongue in Chinese.

A: Yeah. But everybody's tongue is going to be, you know, putting out the toxins. So they should always look white until they finish cleaning out the brain and the throat area. Always going to have toxic minerals and all these byproducts that have to leave through the tongue. If you're healthy, just go out the mucous, the sinuses, and that would be the end of it. You know, it's like the native Hawaiians, you know, that on the one island, that are still pretty raw. I mean, they'll honker once a day and that's it. In the morning, they'll... And that's it for the whole day and they're healthy and great. You know, and the Maasai and those kind of tribes, they don't have all that toxicity. That they're constantly, you know, excreting all day long like we are. What's your name?

Q: Marcy.

A: Marcy. Hi, Marcy. How many more people do we have to do?

Q: Two more.

A: Two more. Your children?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay. So, to finish the question anyway, when I was out on Venice Beach, I tried... When I felt I got everything on the diet pretty into a good formula, that I could work with a lot of people, then I needed... Because I'd only worked with about 400 people for a 25-year period, 20 to 25-year period. So I needed to have a lot of people, as many as I could, join the program. So I set a table out on Venice Beach and put out that I was a palm nutritional reader. If anybody saw that show, was her name, the redhead actress who had a talk show for a while? Henner? Marilu? She put me on her show as a nutritional palm reader. And I read her palm on the show. She said, you can read all that in hands? Because I was hitting her on because how she shows herself on the show is nothing like she is in person. Because she doesn't come across that way, but I said, you're very irritable. You're very aggressive. And this is not something you put on national TV. She won't hear this stuff. And she got flushed and red. And the producer, I can see you in the back going... See, she doesn't realize she's this way. She thinks she's completely calm. And she's very hysterical. I mean, she's very hyperactive and hysterical. So that was after I had set it out there. And I got to really observe people. I got 3,000 people to do it. I probably saw 8,000 people while I was out there on the beach. So I got to confirm, you know, the things that worked and didn't work. And, you know, it wasn't always that way. Like most of the time, I could tell a diabetic instantly when they sat down. But sometimes, you know, it looked like they were diabetic, but still their pancreas was working. That was the only gland... And that and the tonsil. Because I found that the body could overgrow when you have them removed as a child, would start overgrowing and creating more lymph glands or lymph nodes than normal to compensate for the missing tonsil. And I found it never happened in an adult who had the glands removed. But in children who had them removed, that would happen. So that's about 50% on about the tonsil. And the little problem with the pancreas. But other than that, pretty accurate. Very accurate. In all the others. But it still doesn't, it tells me the functionality. And I can see some metals in there. But I can't see what else is disturbing it. And that's why I use the eyes. Because I can look in the eyes and say, my God, you've got so many poisons in there, that gland shouldn't be working. But then I look at the palms and I see it's functioning. So I can see that maybe the poisons are in the outer layers of that gland, but inside it's functioning fine. So I need as many tools as I can use to do it. So it's worked very well. You're welcome. Okay.

Q: Pleasure meeting you.

A: You ask these questions that take long answers.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, there aren't any.

Q: There aren't any.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, good. Thank you very much. It's called Right to Choose Healthy Food. Yeah, Right to Choose Healthy Food. That's the organization that's fighting. Well, right now it's under rawmilk.org.

Q: Yeah. He's got a reference in here for that. Rawmilk.org.

Q: Okay. Right?

A: Yes. Okay. Relax your thumbs. Lots of bile in your system. So you're not metabolizing your fats at all. Most people are water-retentive that have your kind of weight, but yours is lots of unprocessed, unutilized fats. It's like popcorn. When it's popped, it's blown up. Your fat cells are blown up many times, 50 times larger than their normal fat cell.

Q: Okay.

A: So you're not metabolizing your fats at all. So you're one of those that should be a strict, like me, strict raw fooder. Without a doubt. And your body is, even though you've got all this fat there, it hasn't bound with all of the toxins. So you've been using bile to bind with those toxins. Ovaries look good. Your adrenal glands are fine. In the pancreas, pretty edemic. On the right side, it's functioning. On the left side, so it's okay. Not great, but it's okay. Thyroid gland on both sides, very good functioning. Parathyroids are wonderful. The tonsil area looks great. Do you still have your tonsils?

Q: Kind of.

A: Kind of?

Q: The left one got a lot of scar tissue on it from infection.

A: See this right one? Huge. The left one, still good. So you have all your glandular functions. You just don't have any fat metabolism. And the liver is not well. I can't tell what's causing the problem. Probably have to find that in your iridology. Well, it looks like you could have some cysts in it, in the liver. Two of them. Lots of scar tissue. Did you eat a lot of chocolates? Alcohol?

Q: Not a lot. I had a few really rough years that I was on, that I did some drinking. Not heavy compared to social standards, but certainly heavier than what I had for a while. The doctors played med du jour with me for a while. They'd say, oh, that one didn't work, let's try this one.

A: It's damaged your liver. Whatever you took has damaged the liver pretty terrifically. Lots of metal poisoning in the brain, right near the ears especially.

Q: Near the ears?

A: Yeah, all throughout the ears. It causes infections all over in your throat. Lots of metals around the ear.

Q: Do x-rays do that?

A: Not unless you took the barium.

Q: We did the barium milkshake a few years ago.

A: It doesn't matter, it stays in the body.

Q: I had a car accident in February and they took me to the hospital.

A: Well, if you have the barium in your body, it has a hundred-year life. Every time you get an x-ray, it reactivates it. It's that much stronger in radiation. It also prevents cells from regenerating and healing. So you've got to get that out of there. Blueberries and blackberries are better for that, removing that. So I suggest you have four to five ounces by volume of berries once a day. You have the glandular activity of an athlete, but you don't have the functionality. So I'm going to say for you, eat two or three meat meals a day and you can alternate whatever you feel like for that day. If you're feeling a lot of energy for a day, more than normal, then you could have two meat meals a day. But if you're feeling under the weather, then you have three meat meals a day. And if you're feeling fine, you could do either. The juice I'm going to recommend is a plain celery, 80% celery, 10% parsley, and 10% summer squash. 

Q: Is there anything that can be substituted for the parsley? Parsley in Iowa is...

A: I know, nothing that can substitute for it. But I cut it down to 10%.

Q: That just means I grow it. I get a sun lamp and I grow it.

A: There's no way you're going to make enough with grow a lamp, unless you have a big [unintelligible]. But if all of you get together, you can get boxes of it sent in, because we get it all year round in California. All you have to do is go to your...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: But you can go to a health food store and you can say, get me organic parsley.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It doesn't grow very well. But you know, we pay $2.50 a bunch to sell parsley in California. $2.50 a bunch.

Q: Oh, I was going to ask, when you say 80% celery, 10% parsley, is that before you juice, or after you juice?

A: That's of your juice, the liquid. So if you have 10 ounces, it would be 1 ounce of parsley juice. It's 2 tablespoons. I recommend that you have 3 tablespoons of cream, 2 1⁄2 tablespoons of butter with each meat meal. I know you're not keen on the idea of raw eggs, but you need a lot of them.

Q: No, I eat raw eggs.

A: You need 12. Well, I had an asthmatic take 33 a day. She was going to die that weekend. Her doctor called me, her MD, and said, she said, I got an emphysemic patient. She's almost 70 years old. She had been, she said she had been diagnosed seven years ago with emphysema. She was on machines. If they turned off the machine, she would die. She's probably going to, this is a Thursday night, she's probably going to die this weekend. Is there anything I can do? This is what, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she said, well, I've got, you know, I'm an MD. I've got my license to protect. I've got my family's welfare. I said, well, that's your conscience. All I can suggest that you do is get her 10 to 12 dozen eggs, put them in her bedside, tell her to have one as often as she can, and there's never too much. So I get a call on Monday morning from this woman with her, you know, hoarse kind of light voice. She's thanking me. She'd been out of the bed for the first time in two years and walking around. She had 33 eggs a day over the weekend, so she had 66 eggs in two days. Is there anything else she could do? I said, now eat the raw meat, but keep up the eggs. 

Q: She was dying from?

A: Emphysema, fourth-stage emphysema. And she was off the machines. Off the machines and out of bed.

Q: Can the eggs be beat up with a little bit of honey?

A: No.

Q: Can't be beat up?

A: There are three enzymes in the egg white. When you beat it, unless it's with cream in it, it will oxidize those and destroy those enzymes. As long as those enzymes are high, cancer can't progress. And just whipping them, just like that, just a few times, you know, one, two, three, that's it, they're gone. They're destroyed. A doctor in Maine proved it to me. So, shot that. So, just sip the white and down the egg.

Q: My roommate will think I'm...

A: That's okay. Everybody thought I was freaky.

Q: She already knows. She's known me for 15 years.

A: Okay. So, I suggest up to 12 eggs a day and start pulling some of the stuff out of there.

Q: Can the cream be taken in the form [unintelligible]?

A: Your liver doesn't look like it's going to handle milk very well.

Q: Okay.

A: So, I suggest you stick with cream, coconut cream, and butter.

Q: Okay.

A: I mean, you can have, let's say, a glass of milk a day, but don't make it with extra cream. It might make you very nauseous.

Q: Don't make it with extra cream?

A: No.

Q: I should skim the cream off?

A: No.

Q: Okay.

A: As much cream as is with the milk already is okay.

Q: Okay.

A: If you want to, you could make a milkshake with the milk before you go to sleep. You'd have, let's say, six ounces of milk, three ounces of cream, and three eggs, and a tablespoon of honey. You know, kind of nurse that.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay?

Q: Eggnog.

A: Eggnog? It might cause her some gas and indigestion.

Q: Vanilla?

A: No, not for her. She can't take the alcohol. If the vegetable juice makes you very sleepy after eating it, I mean just wipes you out, you don't want to go to sleep, then you cut the juice in half.

Q: Okay. You said what percentages. You didn't say how much a day.

A: Well, I said follow the plan in the book.

Q: Oh, follow the plan in the book. Right.

A: Okay. Which means four cups a day. 

Q: Four cups a day. Okay.

A: Meat. Did I say what level of meat? No, I didn't.

Q: You said two to three. I could alternate two to three and say what percentages.

A: Yeah, but I mean the percentage. You need about 80% red meat and 20% white for about 15 years.

Q: Okay.

A: Maybe 16 years.

Q: All right.

A: And if the red meat makes you a little irritable, then have some white meat with it. That will temper especially seafood. 20% white meat and probably 15%, 18% fowl and 2% to 5% seafood.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay?

Q: Okie doke. I appreciate it. By the way, I'm the one that wrote you about the water a few weeks ago. Do you remember that at all?

A: I'd say answer so many.

Q: Be careful with the water. Drinking water?

A: Oh, yes, I do remember that.

Q: Okay. You were right.

A: Peggy? Peggy? I brought 38 of these and 12 of these.

[chatter]

A: This one also to Peggy?

Q: Yes.

A: Okay, William. How are you doing? Liam. As in the Neeson. Liam Neeson.

Q: That's right.

A: Do you have any skin problems?

Q: Yeah, my fingers crack.

A: Yeah, but I mean it's, yeah, it sounds [unintelligible]. Well, this is so young, he could go into psoriasis when he's 20. 

Q: He's had all the traditional vaccines.

A: Testes are developing fine, adrenal glands are starting to develop over, they're over already, but they're drying out, not getting good lubrication, reacts very badly to sugar. Almost diabetic tendencies here. Pancreas may be working at the best 20% if it works. The right thyroid's good, left thyroid is not. Left parathyroid's okay, the right parathyroid's not. Tonsil area is very scarred. Did he have his tonsils removed?

Q: No.

A: Probably all the mercury has dissolved the left one completely, the right one looks barely there and active. I don't have my glass to look down his throat, or else I'd take a look. His tendons are starting to dehydrate and draw up, so he really needs some good raw fats.

Q: He had surgery on his thumbs at birth, they said he had congenital trigger thumbs, so they had the tendons sliced to there, so he was born with the problem.

A: But it's all over, even in his legs. His spine on the left side is a little tight too, from his shoulder blade down to his waist. So if he has pain back there, just give him a hot water bottle, put it at that area, or two hot water bottles. Don't put it on top of the body, just next to an area. He's lying on his back, you can put it up against the side over here. He's lying on either side, you can put it up against, you know, this way. If he's having pain on the left, he's probably not going to be able to lie on his left, so he'll have to lie on his right. But even if the water bottles are here, it'll generate the heat up. Lots of bile in his system all over. He needs lots of cream. I'd say at least six ounces of cream a day, and four ounces of it should be with meat. A good lubrication formula once a day would be excellent. Juice, about two and a half cups a day. Just a straight 80% celery, 10% parsley, 10% summer squash. Pears, when they're in season, would be good in the afternoon with some whipped cream. No more than half a teaspoon of honey in it. You could chop the pears up.

Q: What kind of ratio with the meat?

A: That's a difficult one. When he has red meat, he's going to have to have some white meat with it, or at least a raw egg. See all these white spots all over the place? It shows his red blood cells aren't transporting oxygen well, and there's lymphatic congestion. He's awfully young, like I was. He's not as bad as I was, but he has a lot of symptoms like I had. 

Q: He used to have impetigo breakouts, and until I stopped giving him cooked meat, then it stopped. As soon as he'd get cooked meat, then it would come out right away. His immune system was pretty weak.

A: That's because his lymph system is all backed up. He's so young. I recommend 60% red meat and 40% white. 25% of that, no, make it 30% of the white meat should be fowl, if not all of it. A little bit of seafood once in a while. Do you like lemon meringue pie?

Q: I don't think he's ever had it.

A: Lemon meringue, the lubrication formula in the book, tastes like a lemon meringue drink.

Q: He used to eat lemons straight, too.

A: He could use that, you know, one of those a day in the evening, or any time of the day, actually. He should probably find, follow the, he's an in-betweener, so he could go either with two meat meals or three meat meals. But I would say probably, when he's in school, two meat meals, first thing in the morning, last thing at night. I mean, last thing, you know, about 6 o'clock in the evening, 5 o'clock in the evening, something like that.

Q: What about milk?

A: It's really difficult sometimes, milk. Patterns like this will cause toxic mold and yeast to get out, to throw out the skin. So milk would have to be more fermented, like kefir or yogurt, so you wouldn't have a reaction to it. Cold milk would be poison for an individual like this.

Q: Okay, so even if it was just warmed up milk for how many hours?

A: He needs the bacteria, yeah, to grow. Otherwise he's going to produce a yeast to deal with it. The yeast is not as good as a lactobacillus, I mean acidophilus.

Q: Okay.

Q: You're saying, Aajonus, that the body has created its own yeast to deal with the problem that it doesn't have the right bacteria?

A: Right.

Q: And why maybe that's an epidemic thing?

A: That's one reason the Hunzas, because they didn't eat enough meat, they fermented every bit of it. So it's well, very easy digestive, so they could utilize every bit of it. Yeah. They didn't eat any fresh milk. None.

Q: They didn't?

A: Nope. Never drank milk fresh. Always fermented it.

Q: And that's the Hunzas?

A: Kiefer, Hunzas, yeah.

Q: And that's the group that the vegans claim were 100% vegan. They've got it in their books. 

A: They even ate cooked goat once a month.

Q: Eva's a big shot in the vegan movement. She's going all over Chicago. She hosted David Wolfe here two summers ago. I didn't come, but...

Q: I almost brought him here.

Q: He came back into town in the spring and then told me about the diet and raw... And that's when I started having my problem.

A: And David Wolfe's only been on the diet for not even... He's only been on it six years and he's so young he has no idea what's going to happen.

Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: Lots of berries. Berries and cream. Lots of coconut cream. Do you like coconut? So I'd give him like two ounces of coconut cream with two ounces of raw cream. Not when he's having the pear, maybe pear once a week. And then berries the rest of the week with the coconut cream. His lymph system has to be clean before his skin's going to improve. And he's going to have brown spots all over his body when it starts coming out.

Q: Like moles?

A: No, no, no, like discoloration, blotches, yeah.

Q: You hear that?

A: But you can get better, a lot better than I do.

Q: No, my son's been on this diet since, well, almost a year.

Q: Come on, you're next, sweetheart.

Q: Water.

Q: Try getting a little closer.

Q: Come on.

A: Absolutely. Looks like your mommy. Let's get up closer because your arms are short. There's a little bit of daddy there, I can see that. But that smile is all mommy. It's shyness. What have you been playing with that's green? A little marker on you. Boy, your hands are so cold, sweetheart. Okay, she's got... You're pretty athletic. Because you've got the ovaries of an athlete. At this young age, that means you could be an athlete. You've got the adrenal glands. But you are also, both of them have terrible skin problems.

Q: I know, her hands are starting to get dry like mine. She's too young.

Q: Look how soft Aajonus' are.

A: Oh, mine used to be blistering. Bleeding. Terrible, yeah. She's very critical. Self-critical. Self-critical too. That just makes you drive harder. But don't take it out on other people. People will never be what you can be. So don't expect them to be what you want them to be. You just be who you need to be. You push yourself, don't push other people. But don't be too hard on yourself either. This looks pretty nasty. Lots of dryness everywhere. Lots of metal in those ovaries. So usually with this kind of metal poisoning this young, she'll be infertile. Won't be able to have children. But if she takes care of it before she matures, then it'll probably be fine. Otherwise, she'll be sterile. Pancreas is almost shot at this young age. She's moving to diabetic. Thyroid's okay. Parathyroid's are very good. Tonsils look like they're gone. She has tonsils?

Q: She's got them.

A: She has them?

Q: Yeah.

A: They're pretty poisoned. Yeah. Well, your bone marrow's pretty good in your head.  Means you're producing good red blood cells for your brain. But lots of bile all over the system. Not the proper kind of fats. Lots of vegetable oils. Lots of crystals. You might want to give her a tablespoon of olive oil with the evening meat meal once in a while. Like three days a week. Meat should be... Now, normally, when somebody's this athletically inclined, 50-50's good. But she has lots of signs of anemia, coldness, all throughout her system. I mean, they're responding to me right now. They're hot. Your sons didn't get hot like that from my touching them, so she's responding better. So she may only need about 70% red meat for maybe three, four years. And then you can cut her back to 50-50. Just help her build her glands and her liver. Liver is one of the glands. And her blood a little bit better. But she's responding very quickly, so she'll fly on this diet very well. She just needs lots of fats.

Q: She was my little vegetarian up until this spring, and she never wanted the cooked meat. And then when I gave her some raw meat, she likes it, so she'll ask me for it.

A: Well, I had a girl who was 14 years old, and her mother made her go on the diet, and she was a ballet dancer. And, you know, she was an okay dancer. And she was fighting it, fighting it. She was proper and all that, so she didn't put up an hour, but you could see that she did not want to do this diet. After a year being on the diet, she was doing dances and became the lead of the company in that year on the diet, so now she went 100. I just saw her last April at John Fox's. She will not do anything else but the diet. She likes that.

Q: Yeah, okay.

A: Yeah, everything.

Q: Wow. That's fabulous.

A: I've got one kid who went on the diet at six months old, and he's not quite two yet. He's in New Jersey.

Q: Oh, yeah, is that the [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah, right, yeah. Little Forrest, under two years old. The mother brought home this board with the alphabet, and the letters go in exact slots, you know, those square pegs in the square. And upside down. She brought it home, and he just started saying the alphabet out loud and putting them right in their place the first time.

Q: Oh, my.

A: And this is the way it is.

Q: This is all a part of the dumbing down, don't you think?

A: Oh, yeah.

Q: Food is a part of the programming.

A: Yes, it is.

Q: Dumb down our kids.

A: Absolutely. And his cousin, who was four years old, came over, and she had a similar puzzle, and she was trying to figure out where everything was, and he just came over, upside down. He did it for her.

Q: Wow.

A: Her mother went just bonkers and got really upset with him.

Q: Oh, my goodness.

A: And Father Ray says, It's the diet I'm telling you.

Q: Yes.

A: Just put the child on a good diet.

Q: Yes, it is.

A: Yeah. And I've got one little girl who was brought to me at a year old. She had oversized liver and severe anemia and retardation, and the doctors that treated her for three months gave her supplements and a formula, you know, to feed the child. She just got worse. Put her on the raw meat, raw butter, and raw cream. Two-and-a-half months later, her blood was completely normal. She was advanced. At two years old, she was playing the keyboards. And her sister, who was two-and-a-half, three years older than she was, wouldn't touch that raw meat or anything. She wasn't going to do it. But when she saw her sister excelling...
