A: I had a brother that was 18 months older than I and still in diapers when they brought me home three days after being born from the hospital. And he instantly started punishing me for being born because of course I took mom's attention away from him quickly. So he would push me on anything rusty, rake, rusty rake, nails, anything. So I'd have to be taken to the doctor and given a tetanus shot or something like that. And every time I got worse, so by the time I was 18 months old, when he pushed me on a rusty, you know, those old push lawnmowers, rusty lawnmower, I was a year and a half, 18 months old, and pushed me on my face so I cut my chin open. And of course the rust got into it. My mom's a nurse. My father's a scientist and inventor, so they think the medical way only. And so I went and had my third tetanus shot and the mercury, the formaldehyde, and detergent and aluminum went to the communication center in my brain so I could no longer talk or even think in a communication manner. So I became autistic, developmentally autistic, not congenitally, developmentally. And that went all through until I was 22 years old. My brother continued to hurt me until he went off to Vietnam when I was 15 1⁄2 years old. And then the torture stopped, except for my father. My father was pretty violent, put me in the hospital a few times, once he put a nine iron through my skull and into my brain. And they just said I fell down the steps. You know, how that kind of a wedge could happen from falling down the steps, I don't know. But, you know, that's the way they handled it, and that's what I had to survive. By the time I hit 12 years old, I had been spending three to five months a year bedridden with colds and flus. I was never allowed to go play with the other kids. I stayed home and cooked with mom and learned how to sew and do all that kind of stuff. And when I hit 12 years old, I developed a peritonitis that was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. So I went in to commit surgery, found the appendix in good shape, took it out anyway, just in case it caused me trouble in the future. And that's the way the medical profession thinks. Now, the appendix is a very important organ. It is a library of everything that's ever foreign that's entered the body. So when something foreign enters the body, the body has to go through a chemical analysis of it and decide how it's going to deal with it in the most propitious way. And if you don't have an appendix to have that library of information, it takes 36 hours to do that entire analysis. Instead of an hour, hour and a half if your appendix is operating properly. So a person will be much healthier if the appendix is there and working and functioning. So the appendix, just because the medical profession doesn't understand it or ignores it, doesn't mean that it's not an important part of the body.

Of course, after, you know, millions of years, you know, if you look at Lucy, the skeleton of Lucy, you know, 4 million years old almost, you know, so the Homo sapiens have been around a long time and developing so I can't imagine it all of a sudden has a gland that just pops out of nowhere and it has no value. But the medical profession, if they don't understand it, they look at it as no value. Tonsils are the same way, the tonsils protect the brain and if the tonsils are removed, the amount of toxicity that enters the brain is magnified. So tonsils are very important. So I had my appendix removed, the inflammation in my intestines progressed, bleeding inside, they packed me in ice because my fever was getting over 106. They were injecting me every two to three hours. So in five days, I was bloated, bruised, and just about to die. So then I rejected, I mean, I started knocking the injection trays out of the nurses' hands and doing what I had to to stop the onslaught of medication. And after 24 hours of rejecting anything violently, then I was able to get out of the hospital and was able to repair enough to get out of the hospital. And a body always left on its own will heal itself, especially if given the right nutrients. So from there, with all of that injection, of course, I had medication all those other years for everything. I still continued to get injured. I was called accident-prone, and it was all at the, most of it at the manipulation of my brother. But, you know, I was unable to speak and talk coherently, so I could not explain how my brother did this. And when, by the time I was eight years old, I learned to bounce back sounds like a parrot does, it was still pretty incoherent because I knew the words shut up, sit down, be quiet. And those were, if somebody would say something to me and if one syllable sounded like a phrase that preceded those words, I would throw that back to somebody, teachers and everything. So I was in trouble all the time. And I had not a clue why. So they just, because I didn't look, didn't look autistic, like congenital children are autistic, developmentally autistic, my parents wouldn't let me space out. And that was a common thing of autistic children just to go away because you're not, you don't understand the communication going out there. And most everybody lies and the children know this. And your children know that you are lying every time you lie up until they're about six or seven years old. And then something happens in the brain and then they, they don't trust it anymore. They have to believe to keep moving on in life. But up until they're six, seven years old, they know every time you lie. So lying is futile because you will lose their respect every day that you lie to them. So I was losing great respect for everybody and everything. So I would shut down, but my parents wouldn't let me shut down. Anytime I shut down, they'd slap me on the head or slap me on the back. My father would slap me, then my mother would slap me on the back or shoulder or arm or chest.

Just so I wouldn't go into that space out. Because they knew, they had a sense of what was happening, but they were not going to allow it. And rather than finding a different approach, it was violence. Back in those days, you know, you had to be strong and tough. You know, take, take the, take the abuse, take the punishment, you know, whatever their wish was. Punishment is how they arrived at it. And that was in my family. My mother was from a family of 13 children, so she was one of the oldest and had to take care. So she learned that she had to be tough and, and succinct and curt, you know, to get things done quickly to handle that many children. My father was pretty much isolated because he was raised on a farm. And his mother was from a very wealthy family. And all his sisters, which is all he had, were isolated. So they got to do, you know, all the pretty things and go shopping and buy antiques and stuff like that. And he had to do all the work around the farm. So he was unable to communicate socially very well, had no social skills, and just became a violent person because he didn't know how to communicate, very frustrated. So he was a very violent person. And that, you know, every day I was getting beaten in some way, either by my brother or my father, mother sometimes. So that was my whole life. I lived in fear. I didn't sleep at nights because I was afraid that there were other things. I was raised Catholic, and, you know, they told me about the devil and stuff like that. So, you know, I was afraid to look under the bed. I was afraid to go to sleep. So I rarely slept, maybe a few hours a day and a night, and was pretty much exhausted all the time. I had chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia, starting at about seven years old. If I tried to walk or do anything, I was lucky if I could walk a block at a time without winding and having to stop to rest. And then when I was 15 and a half, I developed juvenile diabetes. Runs in my family. I have eight cousins who are diabetic. By the time they were about 12 years old, some of them as young as eight years old, some of them born that way. And lots of aunts and uncles who are diabetic. So that was not unusual. But it came upon me, it started advancing after that 12-year-old experience of being in the hospital with all those injections. It just started getting worse and worse. Because after that, I became terribly addicted to sweets. And of course, my mother wouldn't allow that. She knew something. That's the only thing she knew, too much candy was bad for me or for anybody, any child, that makes them violent and angry. She could at least identify that. So I'd have to go out and steal a box of chocolate-covered cherries on a regular basis or Butterfingers or something, like Reese's Cups I loved. So I would down those.

And I mean, I could down a box of chocolate-covered cherries in about 40 minutes. So I got very obese and became diabetic, and all those injections just made my body starve for nutrients at 12 years old. So it came to a head at 15 and a half. So I developed diabetes, started taking insulin, and also developed angina pectoris. Now angina pectoris is something that old people get from congestive heart failure or blocked arteries. I had none of that. They put me through all kinds of tests, none of that, but I would have incredible chest cramps at the heart, and I'd even pass out. I had over 300 heart attacks from 15 and a half to 22. And they said it was all in my head, it was in my heart. It's just that all those chemicals that are in vaccines, and it followed, I had the polio vaccine at 15, 15 and a half, and the angina started about three days later. And in vaccines you have mercury, formaldehyde, aluminum, and detergents. You have to take a good look at this, and consciously in awareness, and never accept that you have to have a vaccine to prevent you from anything, because none of them are proven to work, and it is impossible to prove that vaccines work. All of the diseases that people had were all gone by the time the vaccine was produced. Polio is an example. There was only 1% of what had been the highest rate of polio that happened in people. So it was one out of about 600,000 people developed polio after 1958, in fact by the mid-1957. So the polio had already run its course when the vaccine came out in 58, but it was a big moneymaker, you know, they made about $3 billion that year on the polio vaccine, and that's good dough. And you have to take a look at the amount of mercury. Now we know that mercury is the most severe neurological poison on earth for any animal. If you go to Alberta University's website, well what you can do is on a search engine put Alberta University, neurons, mercury, or thimerosal, or both, and then you come up with their digital movie which shows neurons growing. They put a 2% solution of mercury, only a 2% solution of mercury in there, and you just watch the neurons just dissolve and disappear. So that's how dangerous mercury is. In my laboratory work, they say, well, first of all, the pharmaceutical industry says that they need mercury in there as an antiseptic and a preservative, and the same with the formaldehyde. Well, in my laboratory work, 3,000 molecules of mercury and about 400 molecules of formaldehyde will accomplish what they are saying that they put those things in to do, which is preserve and prevent bacteria from growing in it. They put, up until four years ago, 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury, 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury, not 3,000. In the new mercury-free ones, 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury. There's no mercury-free.

They're lying to you, and the FDA has approved it. And you wonder why children are weak and have problems. I remember when I was a child on my grandparents' farm, bales of hay used to be 90 pounds. And I watched the farm workers throw them up with each arm, one, 90 pounds, up into the loft. They didn't have forklifts back in those days. They heaved stuff up there. Now the bales are anywhere from 30 to 50 pounds, and they're forklifted, because nobody even can throw bales that are 30 and 40 pounds up into a high loft that's 12 to 15 feet high. You have to take a look at the weakening of the human race, of the population. Why is it happening, and is it intentional? And you must say that there's something very sinister about putting 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury in a vaccine when only 3,000 are necessary. Somebody is intent on harming you. And if it's a pharmaceutical industry, how do they win? Everybody gets sick, and everybody runs to a doctor, and everybody gets medication. Just like the tobacco industry. And the whistle was blown on them about 15 years ago. They were putting agents in the cigarette to cause addiction, to cause you to smoke more every day. The pharmaceutical industry is as sinister, if not worse. They want to make you sick. It is obvious. And it's obvious by that proof of the amount of poisons they're putting in vaccines and giving them to our children as soon as they're born, especially the hepatitis B vaccine. Absolutely absurd. And when we get into the workshop end, I will talk to you about virus and show you how sinister and evil all of that is because viruses are never contagious. They can't be. There's no nucleus. There's no respiratory system. And they are entirely a soap. And that's like saying your laundry soap is contagious because it occurs in all the households. Most absurd thing in the world. So I'll get into that in the workshop. So by the time, after having all those heart attacks, they couldn't find any congestive heart failure. They couldn't find any blocked arteries. So they said it was all in my head. So I would have heart attacks in class, fall on the floor, lie there for 20 minutes, wake up, get back in my chair. So good because they didn't treat me. If they had treated me, they would have given me all kinds of medication. So thankfully they didn't because I probably would have gotten worse and worse. Then about 16, 15 and a half years old, 16 at the same time, I met a girl who was one of the smartest girls in the school. I went to Catholic schools, and the nuns back in those days were very violent. And so were the Franciscan priests at the Catholic high school I went to, I mean, very violent. And they expelled me the first day of my sophomore year in high school because I was a disciplinary problem the year before. And because again, you know, I was autistic. So I threw back these shut up, sit down, you know, two priests, and you can't say that to them, you know, without getting badly damaged.

So I was badly damaged. That first year, my freshman year, Roger Bacon High School, I was given 45 days of detention, two weeks of shoveling coal, you know, on weekends. It was pretty bad because they didn't understand, they didn't have a clue about, you know, autism or learning disorders. So they put me in a public school, which was an absolute blessing for me because there the teachers and the dean were very interested in the person. So they listened, you know, they observed me and they tried to talk with me. Of course, they saw right away that there was a learning disorder, so they kept me in art classes and shop classes and things like that so there wasn't a lot of communication. And they gave me good grades because I was good at anything that they let me do, you know, on my own. So that helped a lot. And of course, I always picked the smartest, most sensitive girl in the class to sit next to, and I would copy her hieroglyphs because that's all they were, you know, just designs on a paper. And you know, I couldn't get that T was a letter and when it fell in combination with other letters, it was a word that made up a sentence, that made up phrases, that made up concepts. So there's no way that my brain worked in that way. So sometimes when I did the glance over and then, you know, a T would all of a sudden be not a T, you know. So the teachers were very confused because I was passing, and yet couldn't talk, you know. They'd ask me to stand up and read. And of course, I'd just stand there, you know. And then they'd yell at me and argue with me and think that I was just a wise guy, James Dean character, you know, who was too tough and too cool to talk. So but in the public school, they didn't discipline me for that. They just left me alone and told me that, you know, you'll never succeed unless you apply yourself. And that was that, you know. I didn't know what that meant, you know. But I could see that they were just letting me be, you know. So that was a good thing. So I, in this public school, I met this girl who was the second top student a year ahead of me. And she liked me a lot, you know. Fell in love with me. And then I fell in love with her, you know. So we got married when I was 16 years old. And you know, I had a child the first week of my senior year in high school. And then that was a bad thing because right immediately they were injecting the baby. He reacted terribly. He had colic, cried almost 24 hours a day. There were only a couple of hours in the day where he didn't cry. And that was between 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock. And that's when I got home from high school to have to take care of him until my wife got home from work. And then I went to work flipping hamburgers and making French fries and donuts and stuff like that at a fast food place in an Arlen's department store. So I had to work, go to school and take care of the baby. So all this love and attention that I had gotten from my wife was gone in a flash, just like that.

So I was raised with three brothers and my father and we were all macho assholes. So of course I didn't treat her well. And of course the marriage didn't make it. My uncle, who was matriculating for his doctorate in psychology in Los Angeles at UCLA, knew that there was a problem with me. So he helped me move out to Los Angeles and we lived together in a two-bedroom apartment. He was able to help me in odd ways. I mean he even took me to UCLA to experiment with LSD. That was back in those days, 1966 and 67, when they were exploring with those things to see how they affected the mind. Well I was immune to LSD, so it didn't help. I was immune to all those psychotropic drugs. Probably good because I'd be on them now, still probably, or actually be dead. So I became an alcoholic when the marriage was going bad. I started smoking when I was eight years old to be cool. Because if I had a cigarette in my mouth, I didn't have to talk. So I was being cool. The more I smoked, the less people expected me to answer them, because I would look like I was busy smoking. So by the time I hit 16 years old, I was smoking two packs of Lucky Strike non-filter a day. And I became an alcoholic because I was so unhappy. And I was drinking a fifth of gin or bourbon a night. And I was also very weak, and then I was getting Benzedrine to keep me awake and to drive me in the day, and drinking 11 cups of coffee. So all this started developing after my heart attack started and my diabetes started at 15 and a half. I started drinking the coffee, smoking more, taking uppers to help me function, because basically I would be unable to get out of the bed, literally unable to get out of the bed. So I would sneak down into and drink cold coffee just to help me get going. By the time I hit 19 years old, it ate a hole in my stomach, and I started vomiting blood. And this was in Los Angeles, after I'd been there for a few months. And well, I guess I'd been there a year when that started. The vomiting started, almost a year. And of course, I went to the doctors, and my uncle took me. And they said it was an ulcer, and I had to drink all this Maalox. And it's just chalk, you know, so it absorbs the acid, so it doesn't eat away at the ulcer. Of course, you don't digest anything anymore, you know, because it's absorbing all the acids and all the intestinal juices as it passes through the intestines. So you basically stop digesting. So I was getting skinnier and skinnier, even though I ate lots of powdered donuts and RC colas. And that was my diet. And cereals, I could go through two boxes of cereal a day, you know, with all the pasteurized skim milk, you know. So it was pretty bad, and I started having more and more pain. And then a tumor developed right next to the ulcer. So they said, oh, we have to go in and remove that. So of course, I didn't know what they were talking about, you know, you just do what the doctors say.

So I did what the doctors said, they performed a vagotomy pyeloplasty on me, which means they severed all the vagus nerves to my stomach so I'd never again secrete hydrochloric acid. So they put me in the group of octogenarians, 80-year-olds, who don't secrete hydrochloric acid again. And they say, are in danger of parasitical and bacterial invasion that would kill them. So they can no longer eat anything raw, not fruit, not banana, not an apple, nothing. So that's basically what they did to me at 20 years old. And then that incision turned tumorous and it got up to be about 3 quarters of an inch high at the highest point and up to 2 inches wide, mostly an inch and a quarter wide. So they said they had to irradiate that. So I went through 10 weeks of intense irradiation therapy. Within a few months after that, from that radiation therapy, it had cauterized my spine. So my back solidified, just like firing clay. You know, it's how it's malleable. Once it's fired, it is stone or pottery or porcelain, depending upon the cone that you fire it. So they had done that to my spine, so this was my movement. Very painful. Take me three to five minutes to sit, and it was always very painful. I could start getting down into position to sit, and then if the pain shot up to my back, I'd have to stand up again, let that ease, and then try to sit again. And it gave me blood and bone cancer, the radiation therapy. So then they said, oh, we have to give you chemotherapy to deal with that. You only have a 1% chance of living with multiple myeloma, cancer of the blood and bone, but we'll give you an extended life. What, two days? One day? You know? I mean, the logic. It was a 1% chance? Out of their frickin' minds. I still don't know anybody who's had the cancers that I've had and have lived over three months. I'm the only person alive who's had multiple myeloma, cancer of the blood and bone, stomach cancer, and lymphoma, and has survived. Only person. What am I doing differently to make a difference? That's what you're going to learn today. So I went through the chemotherapy for three months. Also the radiation dissolved all the bone around my teeth so that my teeth dangled in my gums. So when I bit down on my teeth, I would bleed a half a cup of blood at a time. So I was getting transfusions several times a week to replace the blood. And I'd drink everything through big straws. So my powdered doughnuts and my cereal would go in with the milk and the RC Cola, blend it up, and then I would drink it that way. And lots of sugar. Lots of sugar. So that was my diet. That and cigarettes. And coffee. Lots of coffee. Or else I couldn't move. But at this point, I was crippled. After the chemotherapy, three months of it, I had no hair.

What came out was very scraggly and it was all gray. I was 21 years old. And it left me completely crippled from the pectorals down. So I was crawling around on the floor like a worm. So I refused any more chemotherapy, just like, you know, after the five days in the hospital with the peritonitis. No more injections. That was it. Nobody was going to touch me again. So they wanted to put me in a hospice. This was one of the first hospices created to help people die with some kind of dignity. So I refused to go to the hospice because I didn't want to deal with people thinking that I was a hostile person or a person who was ignoring them, a know-it-all or anything like that. And because I still was autistic, people, you know, I would say things that were inappropriate. I would throw out, although I got quite a dialogue of different phrases that I could pop out, they weren't usually coherent, so people thought I was a wise guy all the time. So there's no way I was going in to go into a hospice. Another thing that I forgot to tell you was that after I got out of high school, by all my cheating, oh, when I cheated, it was never math. I, like a lot of autistic children, I had a gift for math. Look at a problem and write the answer. I didn't have to go through any stages of analysis or figures to get to the answer. I could just write the answer. So I was always accused of cheating in math, and that was the only place I didn't cheat. So my mother, when I graduated from high school, my mother took the older brother who used to hurt me to a new school that had opened, Cincinnati Institute of Technology, and they taught computer programming and wiring of unit record equipment, and for girls it was key punch. You know, everything was on cards in those days for computers. So I'm 60 years old, so it takes you back. So, you know, what fits in a little bitty memory nowadays used to fill this whole room with computer disks. So took me to that school, and they tested me. And not one question on comprehension. It was all designs, math, figures, everything that I understood. So I got top grades. So they took me into school. They understood. The professors understood. They were all pretty young. The oldest was probably 55 years old. And all of them, you know, no older, other than that, no older than probably 35. They had one woman who was 27, who was all of them were very bright people and genius. So they understood what they had with me. So they placed me with these big companies like Time DC, the third largest trucking company in the world, and Carte Blanche Corporation, you know, was a big credit card, one of the first credit card companies back in those days. And then Avco brought them, bought them, and bottomed them out. So they put me in as a systems analyst. I could write a program in an hour that would take them a year to write with no errors.

So I was making, I was an idiot in making a fortune, lots of money. So when I moved to California, I transferred with both companies and worked for both of them. And they had a house in Beverly Hills at 20 years old, a two bedroom house in Beverly Hills. So after the chemotherapy, I had nothing. And I was about to lose my house, because it was going back to the bank. It was almost paid off, and it was going back to the bank, because I couldn't afford to pay the last few thousand dollars. So I decided just to go home and spend my last few weeks in my home and die there. So two volunteers from the hospice agreed to come into the home two, three days a week. They would clean up all my mess, because like I said, I was living on the floor. I had to defecate and urinate into bottles and jars and pans. And most often I didn't make it. It was too painful. I couldn't sleep for more than 10 minutes at a time without excruciating back pain. So it was pretty miserable. So I was living in urine and fecal matter. So they'd come and clean it up. They also went shopping for me, prepared my food, my RC Cola and donut mixture, and bring my cigarettes. They were going to make me as comfortable as possible. And then one of the volunteers was an 18-year-old African-American black boy who was a great singer and worked for the Ford Motor Company as one of the going thing. It was a group of five kids, anywhere from 18 to 27 years old, who were musicians and singers. And they would sing, you know, like, you know, Up, Up and Away and stuff like that in the 60s, you know, for the motor company. And they were advertising, you know, the Mach 1 and stuff like that. Well, this kid, out of nowhere, said, you know, I think I know what can help you. There's this book on this woman who reversed her uterine cancer by drinking a gallon of carrot juice a day. I didn't know what he was talking about. I was still autistic. But I got the idea he was wanting me to drink this carrot juice. Now, the only thing I had ever had was cooked carrots, and they made me projectile vomit. My parents used to make me sit for an hour and a half to two hours at dinner every night. Because if I put any cooked vegetables in my body, and I didn't have anything but cooked vegetables ever, except lettuce was raw sometimes, I would projectile vomit. If she fed me Brussels sprouts or broccoli, I could hit that wall over there. So they would force me to sit every night and eat every bit. Now, it was only usually one portion of vegetables, and it took me two hours to eat it, eat that portion, because my body just wanted to vomit that. So I had to learn to take, mash it, shut off my taste buds, all sensitivity, take maybe a quarter of a teaspoon of honey and get it down, I mean of milk to get it down.

And then I had to wait two to three minutes to hold the vomit, because if I vomited, then they'd give me the amount that I vomited and put it on my plate and I had to eat it. So that went on for the entire time that I lived at home. So I was very anxious and eager to leave at 16. So it was fine that I got married young and got away from home. So when I was on the floor vomiting and defecating on myself and this guy's offering me this carrot juice, I didn't want anything to do with carrot juice. He said, you know, just take a sip. And finally, after a few days, he got me to sip it. And it was the only thing that had any taste, because after chemo and radiation, most people have no taste buds. They're gone. You know, sometimes the rest of their life, they are gone. They're poisoned out of their system. So this carrot juice had a flavor. So I started drinking a lot of it. In about 10 days, I woke one morning, and I had the communication center of my brain open. I said, oh, letters. Make words. Make phrases. Make concepts. Oh, OK. I got it. So I called my uncle. My uncle's saying, is this really you? I'm having this conversation with you. I said, yeah. I said, you know, it's incredible. And I think it's this carrot juice. And of course, you know, he's academic. Oh, carrot juice. Your brain finally just matured, and it opened up and developed. So you know, he was a doctor. So I certainly couldn't tell him that had anything to do with food. So I called Steve, the volunteer who turned me on to carrot juice. And I said, what can you tell me about diet and health? Because I think this carrot juice did that. He said, I'm sure it did. So he told me what he knew. And I said, can you take me to a get a wheelchair for me and take me to a bookstore? And I'd like to get as many books as I can on nutrition. So he said, sure. And I said, I don't have any more money. So would you loan me some money? And they were, you know, this is an 18-year-old boy back in 1969 that was making, 68 and 69 was making about 75 grand a year, you know. So he said, sure. So he loaned me $110. Well that's what the books came to. And back in 1969, that was a lot of books, you know. You could buy a softback for 25 cents, 49 cents. Hardback was $1.50 to, you know, $1.95. So I got a lot of books. A couple of them were on mind over matter. But everything I read contradicted everything else. These people said, oh, that was bad, oh no, this was good, and that's bad. So nobody agreed. Everybody had their own ideas, and nobody had any wisdom. It seemed that I didn't know where to find the wisdom, I didn't know where it lied. So it was experimenting to see what worked and what didn't work. But I had to go on principles that may be a little belief in this and that and the other. So experimenting with that, I wasn't doing that great. I started drinking lots of raw dairy, and my bones around my teeth grew back within a year. The pain in my back reduced by 50%. So I was only in half the pain for 24 hours rather than full pain for 24 hours.

I had to live in the bathtub. It was the only place that I could be in water and suspended by the water that would free me of pain. It was the only place I could sleep more than 10 minutes. I could sleep two hours until the bath water got freezing, and then I'd wake up in the freezing water, let a couple inches out, put some scalding hot water in, and then float for an hour and a half, two hours again in one of those old claw foot tubs, pretty big in there. They were cast iron, so they held the heat pretty well. So I could sleep an entire hour and a half to two hours, and that's the only place I could sleep more than 10 minutes. So by drinking all this dairy, I wasn't eating raw meat because after the vagotomy pyloroplasty, when they removed my ability to produce hydrochloric acid, if I ate meat, I had pustulations from my head to my knees, big old pustulations. Anybody see the movie Liar, Liar with Jimmy, James, whatever his name, Carrey? One of the law assistants got one of the big old pussy thing on the end of his nose, Jim Carrey was going like he wants to pop it, get rid of it. Well, I had those all over from my knees to my head. So it was pretty gross. So I stopped eating meat after the second time of that happening, and it happened within 24 hours of eating the meat. So meat was out. So I never got into meat at that time again. I just ate lots of raw dairy. And it was improving, and that went on for, and then I got to study those books. Also, like I said, I got a few books on mind over matter. My uncle told me one of the first books I should get was, there's a little book called Siddhartha. It's about this boy who grows up in a wealthy family, becomes a wayward child, goes out and whoremongers and spends money and drinks and does everything bad, then becomes a mystic and a prophet and then helps everybody. So I grew up with a bunch of macho mean guys. So that was my experience, except for my uncle and some of those people in the public high school. So it gave me a new concept about behavior, that it could be gentle, it could be compassionate, it could be kind, it could be respectful of human life or any life. So the way my uncle put it was, you're a diehard Republican asshole. Get the book Siddhartha and read it. So it did. It changed me. That was the first book I read, rather than the books on nutrition. It was about 80 pages long, and it took me the whole week to read it, because I was in the dictionary. I could read at that point, but I had no vocabulary and no understanding. So I was basically in that dictionary. And it took me 12 hours a day, seven days, to read that 80 pages with comprehension. Because I'd go to look up a word, and I'd look up the words within the definition, because really I had no vocabulary. So it was a very difficult thing. So the next four years, five years, I studied heavily nutrition, trying different things.

I got a tutor who tutored me, one of the probably the most intelligent nutritionists I'd ever met. And he was into 70% raw. He had a problem with fat. He was an Italian and had an overweight problem. So he was very much against eating much fat. He said fat was very important, and it had to be specific fat, but very little of it. But when I'd eat a lot of fat, like raw cream and raw butter, I'd feel so much better. I'd feel relaxed. I wouldn't be irritable. My back wouldn't hurt as much. All of my pains would go away. I'd have more energy. So after three and a half years, I said, nah, he's not right for me anymore. I got to go my own way. So I hopped on a bicycle. I got a Ligi touring bike and four saddlebags with physiology, anatomy, biochemistry books, and a little dog on the back and a little crate. And we went off traveling, and I was going to live in nature and live with the animals and primitive people to discover the true answers to health. So I did that. I bicycled to go with my bicycle and went all the way across the United States five times, up and down several times, all the way from Alaska down to the Yucatan, the bottom of Mexico, in almost a three-year period. So I lived with four Indian tribes, the Mayans in the woods, they still spoke Mayan, in the woods in the Yucatan, down in Oaxaca, in that area, and the Yaqui Indians in northern Mexico, the Sioux in the Dakotas, and the Inuit in Alaska. All of them told me, what you're missing is raw meat. Well, I understood, you know, when I started reading and got into communication, that you'll get parasites, brain flukes, from meat, raw meat.And I already knew that I broke out with pus from eating meat, so there was no way I was going to eat meat. You know, I had no hydrochloric acid, so I would definitely get a brain fluke. So I ignored those sayings, eat raw meat, all of that wisdom. I ignored it, blocked to it, adamantly against it. Also by the time I had become an avid vegetarian, you know, I loved animals more than I loved people, because they didn't expect me to talk to them. We could just be together, and that was it, like my wife and I, like my ex-wife and I. We never had to talk, we could just be together, and we just had so much affection for one another, until we weren't together anymore, because she was working, and I was working, and school, and everything, we didn't see each other. So we were frustrated. So at this point, after two and a half years of traveling, I was in Alaska with Inuit, and they have this festival every September, early September, mid-September, depending upon the weather. They dig up these hides that are wrapped around this moldy, black, green, patinaed, white, moldy stuff that reeks, stinks terribly, like a slaughterhouse that hasn't been cleaned in a month, and just collects, and collects, and collects. So they dug these out of the ground, and the kids smelled them, and it was like cotton candy.

I mean, they were just jumping up and down. They couldn't wait to eat it. And here I am about to puke every time I take a breath. And the adults were the same way. They weren't jumping up and down, but they were all happy smelling it. And then they had somebody call an eagle signal from about a half a mile away, and that eagle signal told them that it wasn't ready, it didn't smell half a mile downwind. So they had to bury it, another four days, dug it up, and it stunk a half mile downwind. By that time, I couldn't get within five feet of it without actually starting to vomit. So they were eating it, and all loving it, and happy, and wonderful. So I had some cotton balls with me, so put some musk oil in, shoved it up my nose, and I had about a golf ball, I mean a ping-pong ball sized amount of that stuff. Now I didn't think meat molded, I didn't know that gangrene was a mold, you know. In medicine, they don't teach you anything intelligent. They teach you everything has to do with drugs and everything wrong. So they didn't teach me about the nature of molds, or bacteria, or you know, parasites or anything, the good qualities of them. They just labeled them bad, labeled them pathogenic, that they cause disease, and that was the end of it. So I had no idea what gangrene was really, understanding it, how it works. So and I didn't realize that meat got gangrene. I just thought it even turned into beef jerky, or some animal ate it, or ants ate it. Some insects. And it just disappeared. You know, if it's human, you embalm it with formaldehyde and bury it, you know, so, with a poison. So that's, I didn't know, I thought they were lying to me when they said it was high meat. You know, high meaning it makes you happy, and it stinks. High stink. You know, they have two words that mean the same thing in high meat. So because I didn't understand that meat molded, I didn't really believe it was meat. I just thought they were trying to coerce me into eating raw meat. And I thought that this was, I'd seen many leaves and compost piles, those kind of molds all over, but I didn't know they occurred in meat. So I ate it thinking that they were just playing a game with me. And after I had that ping pong ball sized amount, I felt a lot better. Just a ping pong ball sized amount. That night, when I went into my sleeping bag and got out the next morning, it only took me 45 minutes to get out of the sleeping bag and about 20 minutes in the sun. Normally, when the temperature dropped below 50 degrees, and it was getting that at night in early September in Alaska, I was freezing. I would be so much in such pain in every joint, I was crippled. I could not move an inch, a budge, a fraction of an inch without severe pain. So I'd lie there until the sun baked my sleeping bag for a couple of hours. Well, this morning after eating that foul smelling stuff, it was very soft and just like melted in my mouth, so that wasn't a problem, it was the odor.

After that, you know, it only took me 20 minutes to bake in the sun after I got out of the sleeping bag and I was mobile, sure stiff and in pain, some pain, but I was able to get up and start functioning and that was incredible because it usually took me two hours inside the sleeping bag with the sun beating on it and 45 minutes out of the sleeping bag with the sun beating directly on me. So I tried to for the next few weeks to find out what herb solution that was so I could make those herbs. Said no, no, it's raw meat that we wrapped in the hinds and rotted in the ground. I thought they were just lying to me that they weren't going to tell this white man any, you know, good information, you know. We had taken over and we were in there in Alaska starting to screw up that place too. Now we're really doing it, you know, with this oil pipeline and everything and the Valdez spill and stuff like that. And they were already concerned back then and this was, you know, 1975, 76, summer of 76. So I got on a, you know, it was a multiple myeloma was getting worse except after that ping pong ball size amount. I realized they weren't going to tell me their secret, I thought. So I was too weak to bicycle back to California. So I started hopping freight trains. I mean, I bungee cord my bicycle up to the side of the boxcar and hang my hammock from one side of the boxcar to the other on the sides where the doors were open so I could see the beautiful scenery as we passed by. And you know, when I was passing over the borders, there were always the border patrol and the private dicks, you know, they called them railroad dicks, railroad detectives that caught the bums who were hopping the freight trains. And you know, at that time I was very religious and I dressed as Jesus did, had a robe, beard, long hair. So you know, when you jump on a freight train and you see this guy standing there like this against the wall and they've got a flashlight, you don't know if you're seeing an aberration or what it was. There was one time they had the guns pulled and just ready, you know, cocked. And I'm just standing there, you see the bungee corded, you know, bicycle against the side and they look at me and they just stood there for a whole almost three minutes, two, three minutes, dumbfounded and said, stay out of sight and then left. So I was always left alone because, you know, I looked like that. So it was very convenient and I almost always slept in graveyards and nobody ever bothers anybody who looks like that in a graveyard. So one time I was, a lot of times I'd be bicycling somewhere, you know, I was a hippie. So it was a matter of, you know, getting rid of me. In Mexico it was really bad because the federales would have, you know, five or six machine guns pointed on me and go through the entire bicycle, you know, to look for marijuana or some kind of drug because all hippies take drugs if they're from America, you know, so. And I was subjected to that a lot. 

But if I slept in graveyards nobody bothered me. So it was very convenient. So I got back to California by hopping freight trains and went to near Palm Springs, an old Indian burial ground, to fast myself to death because I hadn't found the answers. The multiple myeloma, the blood and bone cancer was getting worse. It was down, you know, 40, 50, 49, 50 degrees. I was completely crippled. And that's just too painful unless I were living in the tropics. Then it would have been OK, but it wasn't. So I decided to fast myself to death. And a group of coyotes lived up in the canyon. They'd come down every night about midnight, wake me up, sound like a bunch of crazy people. They played this game with me. I guess it was a sensory thing. I could get a point where I could sense where they were with one out there running around, jumping around and screaming like a crazy person to distract me. So after that happened, after about two weeks, they hunted and brought me a jackrabbit, about this tall with the ears that tall, you know, and about seven and a half pounds, probably only a year old because it was pretty tender. And they had ripped it open at the throat and put it on my feet as an offering. And I'd been a vegetarian at that point for almost six years, or a little bit more than six years. And I loved animals and, you know, here was this slimy rabbit, Easter bunny on my feet. And you know, they wanted me to eat this rabbit. And you know, my immediate thing was I don't want to, you know, I don't want to be disrespectful but I'm not going to eat this rabbit, you know. And then a whole sound bite drove back in my brain from when my uncle was telling my brother and cousins when they were going rabbit hunting that if they shot and killed a wild rabbit that they needed to cook it thoroughly, it had to be well done, it had to be burnt on the outside, you know, and turn it over the fire. Because there is a microbe in it that will cause a disease, an intestinal disease, where you will suffer 24 to 48 hours of excruciating cramps, stomach cramps, and you will die, without question you will die if you get it. So that went through my mind and I said, oh, okay. So I picked up the rabbit to eat it and I thought, well, I'll die in two days, two days of pain I can handle easily, you know. If I fast, it could take me 40, 60 days to fast. So I started eating the rabbit and, of course, it was coming right back up. It was not cooked. It was slimy. It was, you know, all the stuff you think about, raw meat. So I was pretty squeamish about it. So, you know, I had a few bites and it came back up, you know, within a few minutes. So I went back to the dinner table at my parents' house and I thought, I can do this. I can get it down. I want to die quickly. I don't want to prolong this thing. You know, you have to drink a lot of water when you're fasting and I was in the desert and the heat, you know, in the day and the cold at night, freezing cold at night. So, you know, I wanted to get it over with quickly. So I forced myself to eat this rabbit. It took me about five minutes to psych myself into it. 

So I ate about three and a half pounds of that rabbit. But after about 10, 12 bites, it started tasting good. So I started devouring it. So after about three and a half pounds, you know, about seven pound jackrabbit, seven and a half pounds, so the coyotes ate the rest. I went back to my sleeping bag to die, to have my stomach cramps and die. And I knew I was dying because I felt good. And the only times I ever felt good was in my three near-death experiences, two on the operating table and one was a drug experience where my blood pressure dropped and they revived me. So during that time, you know, I left the body and there was no pain because I wasn't attached to the body. And after eating all that rabbit, I was walking back to my sleeping bag and feeling less and less pain as I was going back to the sleeping bag. So I knew I was dying. Had to be. The only way. I was leaving the body. But I woke in my sleeping bag that next morning, same place. So I didn't go to heaven. I didn't go to the light. I didn't go to the tunnel of brightness and all of that. I was still stuck in my sleeping bag and in the body. But I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in 45 minutes. I was able to get out of the, after baking in the sun for only 10 minutes, I was able to function. So I waited two days, no cramps, still feeling better, more strength. Third day went, not a cramp, no diarrhea, no nothing. And I still felt better than I ever had in my life as far as energy goes. So I said, you know, can't be that stupid. The Indians were telling me raw meat, first raw meat I ever ate, pretty good, no cramping, no problem. And at that moment a sidewinder rattlesnake went past me. And I'd seen Indians go up and put their foot, you know, on the head and pick it up in front of the rattler and spin one around, many different kinds of rattlesnakes, snap its head off. So I was pretty hungry. It had been three days since I'd eaten a rabbit and only had water. So without even thinking instinctively, I went right up and put my foot on its head as it's, you know, swishing away or sashaying away. And then picked it up in front of the rattler and started spinning around. I said, oh shit, what are you doing? I'm afraid this thing is going to come around when I snap and come back and bite my nose or something. So I'm spinning and spinning and, you know, I got bone cancer, you know, and I'm getting sore. It's only a few minutes and I'm spinning this thing around trying to decide if I'm really going to die this way or, you know, it's going to die with its head off. So I kept switching arms and after a good four or five minutes, and I was in a lot of pain, I snapped the head off, it came right off, peeled it back, started eating and it does not taste like chicken. Raw, it tastes like fish. With all the bones, just like in fish. But it's in South and Central and Mexican Americas, the snake is the most medicinal food that you can eat. If you take a snake and you wind it in a glass jar and let it sit in a cave in a cool place or in a refrigerator, in about six months, all the oil leaves the snake and you have this oil in there. Snake oil, true thing.

You can take a tea, if you have arthritis, rheumatism or rheumatoid arthritis, even with huge swollen joints, eat a teaspoon and within several hours, your pain will be gone. The snake oil was a true thing, it's just that people were taking mineral oil, putting a little animal oil in it and calling it snake oil. Because snake oil, you have to be very patient, months for it to leave the snake and it has to be in a cold place so you need it in a cave. So it was very hard to get. So after I ate that snake, man, I was feeling pretty good. So I started trapping, you know, birds and eating chipmunks and there's no meat there. Scorpions and tarantulas, I'd break the poison gland off of it and eat it. There's just not enough food in the desert. So I bicycled to the farms around and started, made deals to shovel manure, milk cows, milk goats in exchange for meat and dairy, raw dairy. For two and a half months, I was a scaled down Schwarzenegger, put on about 50 pounds, went from 118 pounds up to about 160. So pretty good. And I felt great. I mean, I was able to work for the first time in my life without coffee, without cigarettes, without all the benzadrine, all the uppers. And I felt good. And almost all the pain was gone. My lower back's still a little bit of pain, and while I was bicycling, I'd have to stop bicycling every hour to get in yoga positions to stretch out my back because I'd be in excruciating pain. Well, after eating all this raw food, I had very little pain, very little pain. So I went back to Los Angeles to spread the word. Everybody says, raw meat? Are you crazy? You're going to get a brain fluke. You'll be an idiot and die. And I said, well, I've already been there and done that. So this is the only thing that makes me feel good, so I'm going to continue eating this raw meat. So I ate it for three years, two or three days a week, about three days a week on average. And that's all, one day, three days a week. So three raw meat meals a day. I'd probably have a pound, pound and a half at a time, and that was it. And then, you know, I kept getting stronger, I started working out, I was, I mean, as a child I couldn't even play with the other kids, you know, I had to bake cookies and cupcakes and cakes and sew and stuff like that, you know, not even sew by hand on a machine because my arms were too weak to do much sewing. So, you know, here I was having all this energy and I started running. I mean, the first time, the first day I decided to run, I just went a block and I was all winded. But within a month I was up to a mile, within three months I was up to five miles, within a year I was up to 13 miles a day. I was doing 250 pushups a day with my feet this high off the ground, and then I'd do 50 handstand pushups. Still I didn't have good balance, I had to, you know, fall into the wall to do those handstand pushups, so I was doing 50 a day. So I was all pumped up and beefy for the first time in my life, a real threat, you know, any guy who wanted to hurt me.

So I felt really good, and after three years of hearing every day, somebody who saw me or I talked about it, you know, was saying, gee, you will get a brain fluke, you will get a brain fluke, you're going to get parasites, you know. And I remember I had, I had no vagus nerve. So it's likely that what the medical profession said was true, I was susceptible to bacterial and parasitical invasion and death because I had no hydrochloric acid. So one time I had done a 42-day fast and I'd come off of it, I wanted to go 45 days, and I don't agree, I don't suggest anybody ever fast more than five hours, you know. I did 42 days and when I was to the point where I was getting headaches so badly and that I had to eat, I went down to 113 pounds. I went to find something to eat and it was a Sunday night, you know, like two o'clock in the morning, nothing was open except for junk food places. So I went to a couple of health food stores and looked in the garbage cans and couldn't find any meat. And then I went to a fish store and I found lots of, you know, fish thrown away. I thought, oh, this is great, so I ate about a pound right there in the, right outside the garbage can. And it was salmon, it was delicious. So I took another, you know, big slice of it home. I get home and pinworms running through it, just undulating. So I'd eaten all these pinworms and then I had another and I was still hungry and I ate the whole thing with all the pinworms and everything. So then when I became conscious the next day from all of the terrible hunger, I thought, oh shit, I've really done it. I'm in trouble. So I went and had my urine and feces and blood checked for 10 weeks afterwards. No parasites, not a one. So I started wondering, what's going on here, you know? Why not? Well, maybe it's the chemotherapy. They're eating chemotherapy in my cells and I'm going to die. So I went 10 more years. Every day, every time I eat meat worrying, is this the time I'm going to get parasites? Maybe the parasites, the pinworms that all I ate, ate tissue that had been poisoned with chemotherapy and they just died, they couldn't live in my body. So I ate meat for another 10 years, so it's 13 years, been worrying about it for that last 10 years every time I ate it. And in 1981 I accidentally ate the death cap mushroom, 15 times the amount that would kill me. Somebody had poisoned this property and it mutated the Amanita mushroom so it wasn't identifiable as an Amanita mushroom, so I ate it. So I got very, very sick. And I started eating meat on a daily basis twice a day to recover from it. And it was working. So I stuck to it. So I'd had all that raw meat all those years and never got a parasite. So I decided, okay, I'm going to go to the universities and see how they did those tests. So I went to UCLA, I went to USC, I went to Berkeley, I went to Yale, I went to Harvard, I went to Duke, and I went to Columbia.

Nobody had ever done a test feeding animals raw meat to see if they got parasites. It was all an invention of the mind of the medical profession. Somebody hypothesized it in some paper, and then people ran off and wrote more about it, and all of a sudden it became written in stone. There was a fact. You're going to get parasites if you eat raw meat. Absolute bull. Not true. I've been eating raw meat since 1976 with parasites, high bacterial meat, all kinds. And let me tell you, I only got one parasite, and that was two years ago, and I induced it by eating a high cereal diet, a high cereal-like compound. When you give donations to these kids in Africa, do you know where your donation goes? Your donation goes to a company that makes deals with Purina General Foods for the worst foods there is, boiled in oil, high-carbohydrate cereals, and powdered milk. And guess what creates the most disease in laboratory animals, according to Pottenger and Howell? Those processed foods are the worst, create the most severe chronic diseases. So we give them to these kids in Africa to help them and make them better, and what we do is poison them to death. And they get huge tapeworms. Now tapeworms don't feed on the tissue, they feed on high carbohydrates in the intestines. So I experimented by fermenting milk to a point where when I popped the top, the alcohol actually burned my sinuses and my eyes turned red for four hours, that's how bad it was. And I put a maca powder in it, which activates like cereals, but all raw, because I wanted to remove it from my system. And I forced a tapeworm. Now I had suffered constipation even as a raw fooder, but as a child I only went every two to five days. Can you imagine going once every two to five days? And the fecal matter came out like granite, literally like granite. It would be as scratchy as rock and it would just rip me to pieces. So by the time I was 19 years old, my rectum was an inch thick all the way around, fibroids from being ripped all those years. So when I got on a raw food diet, I went every day, many times a day sometimes, however the first one out was just like granite. After I forced myself to get that tapeworm, I haven't had constipation once and it stayed around for about six weeks and was gone and that was it. So I learned that all these things were good. Let's observe it, so I did experiments and testing. Now I am living testimony that I'm 60 years old, I should have been dead at 21, the only person who had survived with that many cancers, plus I had diabetes, psoriasis, angina pectoris and bursitis, all incurable and I don't have any symptoms of any of them. No insulin, nothing, I have no spells, no comas, no dizzy spells from standing up too fast with a sugar problem, I don't have any symptoms at all.

Four years ago I went to, I was asked by University of Washington Medical School in St. Louis to do a rundown, they wanted to check me, they were checking raw fooders, that had been at least five years as raw fooders and they wanted to check my arteries because I was eating tremendous amounts of fat and... Animal fats, I mean I could eat half a pound of butter a day, two to three pounds, one to three pounds of meat a day and raw cream and you know, I just keep eating all day long and that's an average diet of a day. So they wanted to check my arteries and my heart and so I agreed to go through their tests, there's only one thing I agreed to that would affect me poorly and that was I agreed to a glucose tolerance test to check my pancreas. They didn't find any congestion, they spent 20 minutes trying to find around my heart and in my heart all this congestion that they expect from somebody who ate so much butter and cream and animal fat, they couldn't find any in my heart. And the glucose tolerance test showed that I had the healthiest pancreas they'd ever seen, I created all five insulins and brought the sugar level down all the way from, it was something like 360 after eating the glucose and that was the first time I had had sugar since 1974, so I was just like I had a ton of coffee, you know, wired for that time, I was really shaking, I couldn't even write. So I had to sit there and have a blood drawn every half an hour to have it checked and it took it all the way down to 54 and I was making all five insulins even at the last test so they couldn't believe that I had been juvenile diabetic, they said it wasn't possible. Medical profession doesn't know anything about health, they just know diseases and drugs and surgeries and chemotherapies, that's all they know, so that's all you will learn from them and you're going to learn about disease and drugs or you want to learn about health? Don't go to a doctor, go to somebody else, you want diagnosis, go to a doctor and if the test isn't invasive and doesn't cause you problems, then fine, go to the doctor if you want to know what's wrong or maybe what's wrong because most of the time they won't be able to tell you. They're always going to look for some kind of congestion or malfunction in the body. They don't look to the point that their vaccines and their medications store in different parts of the body just like with my heart after the polio vaccine. They couldn't find any congestion, they didn't find any congenital problem in my heart, so they told me it was all in my head. They didn't look for any mercury, formaldehyde, aluminum or detergent that lodged in my heart from the vaccine. So they are not looking for anything that will cause them blame, period. And let me tell you, penicillin and vaccines cause 95% of all the digestive problems I find in children and adults. Penicillin belongs in a bird community, not in the human population and it grows unabated in most bodies and causes problems. 95% of the people I see still have penicillin growing in their body even if they haven't had a penicillin in 30, 40 years. 

It still grows in the brain and digestive tract and often in the lymphatic system. So you want to get healthy? Stay away from doctors. Stay in tune with your body and eat what's right. So I'm a living testimony of that. To give you an idea of what you can do at 60 years old, two months ago, 10 weeks ago as of yesterday, I was in Thailand and when I was a teenager, I owned some motorcycles. When I had all that money, I had three motorcycles. So I had ridden a motorcycle, ridden motorbikes, many motorbikes and motor scooters, but not a big old Harley. So I rented a Harley. Three hours later, I'm going on a business district and there's these five tourists, just like me, jump out onto the street. No intersection, no crosswalk and no driveway. This is an intersection. Jumped right into the street, 20 feet in front of me. I was only going 18 to 20 miles an hour, but I've got to bury the bike and me into the pavement or I have to take a chance on killing two of them and spending my life in jail in Thailand. So I hit the pavement and it didn't have one of those crossbars at the front. So when I hit the pavement, the blacktop, my butt was pulled this way and damaged my sciatica. And the bike, very heavy, a couple hundred pounds, 250, 300 pounds, took my leg the other way. So it just popped my leg apart. Didn't tear the skin, but it took the tendons and pulled this and ripped this one down, ripped this one up. And the pain was excruciating. I refused to go to the hospital. But an hour after I was able to move and get into an open truck bed. That's what they have in Thailand in this particular little town. It's a flatbed pickup truck with frames on it and seats in it. So that's the taxi. So I got in that, went back to the hotel, cleaned it with, I lost all the skin and muscle and bone, part of the bone here from the scraping. So this is completely gone. All of this was gone here. Scraped all the way down. Took off some of the bone. Same with my ankle. Put lime juice on it two times in two days. And right after I put the lime juice on it, I put coconut cream, honey. And on the spaces where there was no muscle, not just skin gone, I put very thin slices of meat. The other areas, I wet the gauze with coconut cream until it was very wet. Put butter on top of that so it wouldn't stick. And you can only see a few patches of scarring. A little scar here. Sealed in two weeks. I had two Thai ladies that I hired to take care of me 24-7 because the pain was excruciating. The pain was so bad and the leg looked so bad, I thought it was out of place. So I went to the hospital to have them put it back in place because I couldn't find a chiropractor anywhere in Thailand. So I went to the hospital. They refused to do anything unless I had x-rays. So I agreed to two x-rays, one this way and one this way. And found that the tibia, the big bone here, big as my fist, split in two down this way, down the leg.

And it was open in the back about a quarter of an inch. The tibia goes like this. It broke the pyramid off the top, split it in two and fragments of cartilage all through the knee. And they said there was no way I'd ever walk again without surgery. And I saw those x-rays. I have them and I will publish them next book. And I'm going to have x-rays done in about six or seven months when this is completely healed. And I refused surgery. I didn't let them put a cast on me. They wouldn't anyway without the surgery. Because when I was nine, my brother kicked a ladder out from under me and I hit the pavement in the garage, shattered my heel cap and pulled all the ligaments in my foot. So I wore a cast for about 12 weeks, itched, hot, you know, couldn't take a shower or a bath. The thing stunk all the time, you know. So I was not going to go through that again. So no cast. So that means that I pigeon holed myself in my hotel room for six and a half weeks. And when it moved, I had to have the girls move it very gently getting into the bathtub. Of course, any time you have severe pain like that and you can't get rid of it, you get into a bathtub. And it will alleviate the pain as long as you have, you know, I put two cups of coconut cream in my bathtub, you know. So I was lying there in oil floating, you know. And the pain would go away in minutes just in the water. And in the bed, I would be suffering fall asleep, wake up in an hour and a half, excruciating pain. I'd have to get with the crutches into the wheelchair to the bathroom, with the crutches back to the bathtub. The girls would have to pick up my leg, put it into the bathtub, and then just rub it, you know, rub it a lot. They would just rub it day and night, you know, just gently, you know, making it feel better. So I was walking with crutches and four and a half weeks, six and a half weeks no crutches, ten weeks as of yesterday, and I'm walking with almost no limp. And I still can't straighten the leg all the way, but that's how well you can heal if you're on a good diet. I'll just show you the difference in the knee size, because the body, I didn't put a cast on, so the body made its own cast. The body made its own cast, and the cast isn't gone yet. And it hardened. It hardened from here all the way down to the foot, and I broke the big toe and took quite a bit of skin off the leg. All this skin was gone. The muscle wasn't gone, but it was all gone. So there's very little redness and scarring there, just like in my hand.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I was in pain, and I was with two Thai girls who didn't know anything. I wish, you know. No, now it's pointless. So the body, what the body had done, see this muscle here. It's pretty good in my thigh. Well, within the four days after the accident, all the muscle disappeared. So I just had skin laying on top of this bone here, and it had taken all of that nutrients in the muscle and made this cast, cast from here all the way down to the foot, to the toes. I mean, a hard, if you touch this now, you'll see there's a cast still around the knee. It's hard, and I can't stretch it out completely. But it was like that from, from up here about, you know, five inches, six inches above the knee all the way down to the toes. It made its own cast. The body is amazing. And then as soon as I was able to, I went into a swimming pool. At four, four weeks, I started going into the swimming pool at the hotel and exercising the leg. And then I started getting earaches and sore throats and all kinds of headaches. And I realized, frick, it's the chlorine. So I stopped going into that, and the ocean was right across the street and down a, you know, a flight of stairs, stone stairs to the ocean. So I started, you know, crutching it to the, to the ocean and spent two, four hours a day, two in the morning, two in the evening, exercising my leg, you know, over a mile in the ocean, just exercising it. And that helped, you know, relieve it and started moving and started, you know, the whole thing getting better, quicker so that I could walk and it wouldn't be just so stiff when I started walking without crutches. So as you can see, I'm doing pretty well. They said I'd never walk again without surgery. The one thing I did to make sure that the bone dissolved, those pieces dissolved so they wouldn't be, see, they were afraid. Most people don't dissolve those bone fragments so they'll stab the nerves in the joint. And, you know, it's like that, you can't walk because you're being stabbed in the nerves. So they weren't, they didn't have the concept that a person could dissolve those bone fragments and mend that little, and mend that little pyramid at the top of the femur and put that tibia back together without pushing it back together and pinning it. That's what they wanted to do, screw a nut in there, a screw in there to put it back together. And I thought if I do that, I'm gonna spend two years repairing it from the surgery. If I let my body do it, I may spend a year at the most healing that. So my option was I'll see you in six weeks if I can't walk. Osteosurgeon kind of cringed a little bit, you know, and he said, okay, you're a doctor, you know. So I didn't do anything except just take care of it naturally and here I am today. You know, I still have a little pain. The leg doesn't stretch out but it's only been 10 weeks. It's pretty good. So that's what your body can do if you eat, you know, very well.

Now this is the end of the way over. I always go rambling because I want people to understand depth of things, the extremes and the nuances. So this is the end of the free lecture. We're going to go into the workshop. Now in the workshop, I'm going to tell you how your body works. We're going to go over the different body parts, the circulatory systems. So you'll see how simple it is to understand the body so you won't be afraid of it. So you don't run to a doctor every time something happens to you. Then I'm going to explain how food works in the body, how we digest and why we digest certain foods better than others. And then we're going to get into foods in general, how to combine, how to make a diet work for you to make you mentally, emotionally and physically the most productive of every day. So you won't have to rely upon anybody else other than your own instincts. Unless you're very diseased, you might want to come to me and get some help, individual help. Or if you're very confused, come and get some help from me. But I wrote these books so that everybody could be independent of the medical system. So they could be independently healthy. Not even have to use my help, but I will help you if you want. Now after the workshop, we'll run about five hours. Sometimes a little longer, but about five hours. Then I'm going to do mini consults where I look at the palms on the hands. The Chinese do it. I do it a little differently than the Chinese. I found it worked a little differently. And I will see how your glands are working, how your blood is working, how your lymph system is working. I can give you some ideas about what to do for your health. If you want a more extensive reading where I give you an exact diet, the amounts, everything, times of day and everything, then you come to me on one of the next following days up until Wednesday evening, I'll be here. And I think we're all, we only have four appointments left, something like that. And I shoot the irises with a digital camera and blow it up on the screen and I'll show you how the body is damaged and what toxins are in it and how to alleviate that by giving you a diet. So we can just zero in on your problems specifically and why you have them, which the medical profession can never and will never do because it's against their benefit. So there you have it. Thank you for coming. Those who are going to stay and do the workshop and haven't signed up to do it, see Sherry. And it's $80, right? $80. And if you want the mini consult, it's $30. And if you want the full consult, the mini consult lasts about 6 to 10 minutes. The full consult lasts about an hour and 15 minutes.

A: Printing and visit all 550 legislators in the House of Representatives and the Senate, all the Congress people. I formed an organization called Right to Choose Healthy Food and we're going to be lobbying for raw milk on a federal level. I sent a cease and desist order to the FDA and the CDC back in December to stop giving out the false information about raw milk in their brochure that wasn't based on any fact, and if they had the fact presented. So I didn't get any message back from them. I told them for each pamphlet that they hand out after December, it will cost them $10,000 a copy that they send out. Very few have been sent out since then. Patty Markle's friend made these bookmarks with Right to Choose Healthy Food on it and they're for a donation if you want to give to help us do more in Washington, D.C. because we have to pay for, you know, a condo, a three-bedroom condo for the three of us and do all of that. So if you'd like to make a donation and take one of these cards, that would be nice. If you can't, that's fine. Okay. So you just come and see Sherry. One of the breaks or at the end. Okay. All right. So let's get started on the workshop. I'm going to do more sitting this time because my leg's getting a little tired. Well, this leg's getting tired because all the weights, most of the weight is on the left. Okay. So first we're going to talk about the human body. Now we have three circulatory systems. We have the blood, the neurological system and the lymph. And they're all very, very simple. They each have jobs to do and they're crossing over because we're so toxic. The basic job of the bloodstream is to transport the red blood cells, transport oxygen. They also transport carbon dioxide out of the body. So do the white blood cells. The white blood cells are your defense mechanism. The white cells are mainly phagocytes, which are mainly fatty cells that eat toxicity in the system, in the bloodstream. Not anywhere else but in the bloodstream. So they keep the bloodstream clean. If you look at the research of some of the scientists out there, you'll see that when you eat a cooked meal, your body, your intestines will fill with white blood cells. Almost half of your white blood cells will invade the intestinal tract to deal with the toxins that are formed from cooking. It's called leukocytosis. If you eat some raw food with the cooked food, it won't happen. Showing that the raw food has enzymes and vitamins and everything else necessary to balance it, but still causes overall toxicity, eating cooked foods. So the blood is a very simple system. It transports oxygen, removes carbon dioxide, and protects the bloodstream from any kind of toxicity. The neurological system is also very simple. It transmits light and electricity for communication between the body parts, every cell even. And it does that mainly with metallic minerals. Everybody know what metallic minerals are? Lead, cadmium, iron, mercury, all those kinds of things. But it uses trace amounts, always in unit with other minerals, because those heavy metals all are acrid. 

They have a tendency to cause burning and dissolution of tissue, cause tissue to dissolve because of the over acidity. So your body always combines a lot of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium with any one molecule of those to make sure that it's a good, healthy balance for the human body. But because everybody eats cooked foods, it causes all of those heavy metals in the food to become free radicals. Free radicals do tremendous amount of damage. And they do the damage by burning it and causing irritation to cells. So the body, the brain and nervous system have the highest amount of free radicals heavy metals. Almost 80% of all the heavy metals in your body are in the brain and nervous system. That's a massive amount of toxicity. So why does man keep getting a larger and larger brain every year? Because he's a garbage can. And because you fathead, say thank you. Because that fat in your brain is the main reason that all those toxins are going there. Toxins are attracted to fat. When fat holds onto toxicity, it doesn't cause harm to surrounding cells. If you don't have fat, the toxins get into the cells and damage the RNA, the functionality and structure of cells. If we keep it all very simple and eat raw, you don't get any free radicals. There are no free radicals when you eat raw. The brain and nervous system are vacant of those free radicals. When you have them, they have to dump somewhere. And usually from the brain they dump out the sinuses, the tear ducts, the earwax, mainly the gums, the tongue and the salivary glands. So when one of those heavy metals like mercury from vaccines, let's say from certain herbs that are high in mercury, and you cook them, or vegetables are high in mercury, like poorly developed asparagus, those metals will leave the brain and then pass through the gums. Now the body will use a tremendous amount of the alkalinizing minerals to bind with those. Calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium are the main. And it will create plaque all around those heavy metals. If it doesn't create the plaque, that metal will damage the dentine immediately and cause a cavity. If the plaque gets on there, you have so many hours or so many days before that heavy metal will neutralize the alkalinity of the plaque and eat right into the dentine wall. So it is never bacteria that causes decay. It's the heavy metals that burn the dentine. Then your body develops bacteria to eat the decayed or damaged dentine. So your bacteria is your janitor. It's not the problem. The problem is the medical profession injecting you with all this heavy metal mercury and all the other garbage that leaves the brain and damages the teeth. Now a lot of years ago, people lost teeth because they didn't eat enough protein. They were living on carbohydrates. And that involves any country that lives mainly on carbohydrates, lives on potatoes and grains.

They all have a problem with their teeth starting in their 30s and most of them have completely deteriorated their teeth or lost them by their 50s. Asian community, that's heavy because 80% of their diet is rice, 10% is vegetables and only 5-7% is meat. And it's almost always cooked. Except in your more rural areas, they'll still use raw meat. But that percentage of the diet and meat is not enough to maintain teeth. And they aren't milk drinkers where they can get a heavy supply of those alkalinizing minerals to build the teeth. So, there are many reasons why the body deteriorates the teeth and deteriorates in general, but most of it's because our industrial progress. So, if we want to restrict the amount of heavy metals in the brain and nervous system, don't cook, stay away from pollution, airborne pollution because that's full of toxicity. But you're living in Chicago, right? Can't avoid it. I'm living in Los Angeles. Well, I don't live in Los Angeles. I live in the Malibus of- Mountains in Malibu. So, I'm way up there in the North End, and I'm surrounded by deers and trees and everything. So, not polluted where I am unless the military is dumping its chemtrails, which they do frequently. And that's another major source of pollution in the last seven years is the military dumping its waste on us overhead. See all that streaking in the sky? Purposely dumping military waste, no waste on you because they have nowhere else to put it. So, they dump it on the population everywhere in the United States, everywhere. The only place I haven't seen it is in Hawaii, but they do it everywhere. They even have Thailand doing it in certain areas. I was there last year and the military, U.S. military was there doing training exercises with the Navy and they started dumping chemtrails on the area where I was for the first time. So, it's spreading everywhere. But the military, all in Europe does it, England does it, they're doing it everywhere. Australia, everybody's dumping their industrial waste on their population and people. And that is, you know, it's full of aluminum, it's full of barium, it's full of fluoride, all of the things that are a product of making weapons, of steel manufacturing. So in order for you to have guns and ammunition, they're going to pour poisons on you. So where's our freedom? You know, we're all going to be sick. So the only way you can help prevent that is by eating raw foods, lots of fats to bind with that, but we're going to get into that later. Now the lymphatic system is the other circulatory system. The lymphatic system is probably, because of our toxic society, the most important system we have. It feeds every cell in the body, except for the red and white blood cells, once they enter the bloodstream. While they're in the bone marrow, that's where red and white blood cells breed, is in the bone marrow, and the way cells breed is they divide. 

There's one and all of a sudden there's two and then there's multiple. Just keep dividing like that, and that's how red and white blood cells reproduce. So they do not get fed once they're in the bloodstream from the lymphatic system, but every other cell in the body is fed from the lymphatic system. Also, all of the waste products are removed via the lymphatic system. Now the body is so, our bodies are so toxic with poor diets, poor food, chemicals, pollution in general, that the lymphatic system is so congested a lot of the, a lot of parts of our body are no longer being fed by the lymphatic system, being fed by the bloodstream. You've got compounds that don't belong in the blood being transported in the blood and through the blood. Compromises a lot of energy. The body cannot transport as much oxygen, cannot relieve as much carbon dioxide from the body. It weakens us. Like I said earlier, when I was a child, these farmers worked hard, 14, 16 hours a day, stopped for one meal in the afternoon, and very rarely drank water, and they were throwing big bales of hay and working very hard. You see farmers these days and they can barely get through three or four hours of work, and they can't do it without tractors and forklifts. We have a very different quality of health these days because of all the medical professions' poisons and industrial pollution that has magnified incredibly in the last hundred years. So the lymph system is so clogged that it cannot – blog, too much on the internet – so clogged that it can't do its job. It can't feed the cells properly. It involves itself in mainly removing toxins and waste. And it gets jammed. Every good thing gets jammed and disease sets in. But all of these systems have very simple jobs and they're not – and if you were healthy they wouldn't be crossing over and you'd have a lot of vitality and energy and strength and clarity of mind. Now we're walking zombies. I know, speak for yourself. I used to be a walking zombie. Now I'm just a crippled zombie. So let's move on to let's say the digestive tract. I'll get into the glands because usually covering the glands is part of the digestive tract. So we look in the mouth. A lot of your vegetarians will say oh we're supposed to be eating vegetation. But you look at any of the herbivores, what kind of teeth do they have? 100% molars. What do we have? One quarter, one fifth molars. We have mainly cutting and tearing teeth. We don't have all of the sharp teeth that a canine and feline do, but mainly we have cutting teeth and tearing teeth. We have four canines. If a doctor hasn't filed them down like they filed mine down, they don't want you to look like an animal. So your dentist will file them while you're a child. Some they don't, but most often canines, your canine teeth are filed from very young, and they'll slip it in. 

They'll slip it in and do the work while you're not thinking about it. Anyway, you have tearing teeth, cutting teeth mainly, and only a little bit of crunching teeth so you can swallow chunks of meat. Now the hunter tribes that eat raw, they will take raw meat, big chunks of it, crush it maybe two, three times only and swallow it. They don't chew meat. They'll chew fruit or they'll chew vegetation if they eat it. But when it comes to meat, they don't chew it. Now why? We have the ptyalin enzyme in the mouth. It's an alkalinizing mineral. I mean it's an alkalizing enzyme. It helps break down sugar. The horse is the only one to have it besides humans. It will neutralize some of the hydrochloric acid. So it makes it more difficult for you to digest meat if you chew your meat, raw. So don't chew your meat. Just enough to swallow it. It's not a good idea to chew your meat thoroughly. Just swallow it. Another reason for that is you got all this hydrochloric acid in the stomach. Unlike a dog and a cat, they have 15 times the hydrochloric acid in the stomach we do. But food passes through their system in 10 hours. It takes 24 to get through hours. But if you measure the amount of hydrochloric acid that our bodies produce all throughout the digestive tract, meaning the small intestine, not the large intestine, but the small intestine, we produce almost as much as a cation and feline. But we don't do it all in the stomach like they do. So we produce it all through the small intestine. So remember that when I talk about why not eat vegetation. So as we go down into the intestines, we have other alkalinized, I mean acidic bacteria to help eat and break down the molecules. Their excrement is our food. Their verotoxins in the medical profession label them verotoxin because it wants you to think that the bacteria that is living in you that excretes whatever it excretes is a toxin. It's a nutrient and food. How can that be proven? Well look at the work of the University of Toronto. For 38 years they've been using the verotoxin from E. coli to completely dissolve human brain tumors in two to four days and plus the vessels going to it. So the verotoxins are a definite agent of health for you, not a toxin. So they shouldn't be called verotoxins. But that's the way the medical profession wants you to think. So that's the way you will think every time you see the word verotoxin. Forget it. Name it something else in your mind or say, you know, that's a misnomer, which is exactly what it is. So these bacteria, you have about 2,300 varieties of salmonella in your small intestines. You have several varieties, a hundred varieties of E. coli in your large intestine. Now the E. coli is the most important for your brain and nervous system. And it's getting all this bad press. Then they'll use, oh, the 0157H7 is the big culprit. But it all stems from E. coli. If the E. coli didn't exist in your bowels, it would not digest the final stage of protein and fats in your system. 

Your brain and nervous systems would not be fed with that finite molecule that only the E. coli can render naturally in the body. I've told people how to do it in my recipe book, how to make high meat, and the bacteria will break down the same way that the E. coli will. And then you ingest that toxic meat, so-called high meat, the way the Eskimos do, and you become happy in 10 to 20 minutes because the brain and nervous system get a rush of protein and fats that are in the exact molecular size that feeds them. So that E. coli is so important. Now why would this E. coli business start about 10 years ago? What is in it that will profit somebody? Spinach was the last big phase. Now when you see Popeye in a coffin from eating spinach and you blame E. coli, there's a problem, isn't there? Why blame E. coli on spinach for anything? E. coli is part of manure. It's a major part of manure. Any manure uses fertilizer is going to have E. coli in it. It's a good thing. We find that it breaks down the nutrients and feeds earth, just like it does us. And it makes for good growth, great growth. But what industry is going to profit if fertilizer is outlawed, if organic manure is outlawed, if any kind of manure is outlawed? The chemical industry, Dow, Monsanto, Gulf and Western. They're going to say, oh, we have safe fertilizers and they're all chemical, no E. coli. And that's where it's headed. We're not going to be able to find anything organic or grown on manure, and you're not even going to be allowed to use it in your yard because you'll be a threat to the disease of the human race. This is how absurd it's getting. And children are indoctrinated by all this stuff on TV. And if you tell them differently, they don't know any better. They'll think that you're crazy. Your own children will think you're crazy because of what television has taught them. And that's a very, very bad thing because then the children are just the puppet and the human race is a puppet of whatever is discharged on TV and the media. And we know who controls and owns them. The same people who make the drugs and own the food companies and everything else in the military. It's all one big conglomeration of a few rich families in the world that own everything. The banks and everything. And they mean to make everybody slaves. It's very obvious. So take a look at the E. coli. It's a very major factor of everybody on the planet. Now what do you see happening every day? Everybody eats shit every day. All creatures will lick each other behind. A mother will eat the feces, a bird will eat the feces of her babies, cats, dogs eat the feces of the babies. Gosh, if E. coli were that bad and manure were that bad, everybody, every species would be dead. The only one that doesn't go around licking each other in the behind is the human. 

Everybody else gets their dose of E. coli every day several times a day. So if it's so harmful and so dangerous, why isn't everything extinct? Because it's not true, it is a lie. E. coli is so important for your brain and nervous system. Why would the big industry want you weak and stupid and incoherent and emotionally unstable? Maybe because you'll overeat and you'll go to the doctor all the time and make them more money. How much money do you need? I can't answer that for these people. I know it's a monopoly game to them and I know some of them. I know only one of the Rockefellers directly, but that whole family is nuts. So the Rothschilds, they're really nuts. If you look at Aaron Russo's film, Something to Fascism, Freedom to Fascism, he's buddy buddies with one of the elder Rockefellers and Rockefeller was bragging in a party one night to him about how they planned all this to make everybody sick and to do everything that's happening, purposefully. So you have to take a big look at that and see where we're going and protect yourself as soon as possible and you have to speak out and do what you can, not in a place where you'll get yourself harmed because I know that. I've been targeted for the last few months pretty heavily, the last six months. I found rat poison in my desk chair, a cup and a half of it, you know, three months ago. Rat poison in my desk. So every time I sat on it and wafted, well, thank God I had upholstered this chair myself ten years ago, I mean twenty years ago, it was an antique and I started getting sick every time I sat down and all of a sudden I started smelling the heaviness. So I looked down under the chair and it was just slight powder. So I took it out onto the porch, I mean I got myself covered in an Israeli gas mask, you know, a ski mask and covered my body completely and I ripped the bottom that I had put, the cloth that I had put on the bottom to seal up the works of the chair and there was a cup and a half of rat poison in it, in my house and no obvious break in and my, I kept buying, my computer shut down on me in November. I kept having, kept buying, you know, computers, like I would buy one every four weeks or two weeks because I would get a new computer, sometimes anywhere from three hundred, thirty six hundred dollars to forty seven hundred dollar computers from the top of the line and I'd get them and a message would come up in a few weeks saying severe hardware problem, can I contact, you know, the manufacturer and I wouldn't be able to use it so it'd be shut down for weeks while I tried to get them to return that much money, you know, and to get another computer and this went on and on and on. While I was in Bangkok, I had ordered another one just before I left, a Pro Star and, you know, almost a five thousand dollar machine and just a week, a few days before I went to Bangkok, when I got to Bangkok, it stopped working, just the same thing, hardware problem.

Who has a hardware problem on every time, you know, four computers in a few months, you know, unless it's sabotaged. So while I was in Bangkok, I got that one sent back, one of the two girls who was taking care of me took it back. I sent one of the girls in a taxi all the way to Bangkok, which is two and a half hours away from where I was staying in the hotel, to buy a computer from a specific mall that has over a thousand small shops for selling computers. So nobody knew, my name went on nothing, and I got a computer that works great. No problem. And it was half the price, you know, of something that I buy here, you know. So somebody's screwing with my life because when I'm on the internet, I get lots of activities done politically, you know, in the health industry. They want me shut down, you know. So it's a big problem. So make noise, but not too big a noise. So you're not a target. I am definitely a target, and I've been a target for about the last year. In fact, that accident that I had in Thailand where that car hit us, I mean, I was with this group of people that were showing me land to build my clinic. And they would not leave this restaurant. I kept saying, I'm ready to go. I'm ready to go. So I mean, they fed me the raw meat, and everything had steak tartare served to me, and they were doing the karaoke thing and all of this stuff. And I said, I'm not into partying. I don't drink. Let me go back to the hotel. Hours. They got me to get up there and sing in karaoke with them, and I played with them. But I kept saying I have to go. And then at 1 o'clock in the morning, I said, listen, I'm going to take a taxi back. I'll see you tomorrow. So they said, no, no, no, no, no. So they went and made a few calls. We get in the car going back, and I'm in the third back seat of a new Suzuki. The driver's here, and his brother's there, and there's a monk and another man here. And then the real estate agent and I are in the very back, the third seat, the passenger, the third, second passenger area. And we're going 15, 20 miles an hour, you know, in like a 40, 45 mile an hour zone. We go into an intersection. We're going this slow, and I look over, and I see a car, and all of a sudden it dawns on me that it's moving. And I look over, and there are no lights on. And here's this SUV that's twice the size of ours, slams us onto the side. We flip over three and four times. Now they had, everybody had belts on but me. I just had the one harness over. Everybody else had side harnesses. So nobody got hurt but me and the real estate agent, you know. She had her head split open. I had my head split open, broke the collarbone and the clavicle and two ribs, you know, because they hit us from this side. Of course, I was sitting over here. So of course, the harness didn't hold me in place. So I flew over this way and went through the window there and back into the car. And then when I awakened, I don't know how many minutes later, the car's upside down. I'm lying on top of the car. The belt had come undone.

And I'm on top of the ceiling of the car upside down. And everybody's getting out of the car. Everybody's out of the car, and the last one to get out is this real estate agent, and they drag her out. And all of a sudden, everything goes on flames, and there's a guy with a fire, you know, fire, you know, he's trying to break open the door. It seems that he is. Nobody's getting it open, and I realized that he's doing a show, that he's really not going to get me out. And he's taking this fire, you know, this ax, fire ax, and he's breaking glass and shatters all in my eyes and face, and I realized that he meant to hurt me. So even with all the severe pain I was in, I dragged myself with my legs out of the car just in time. So it looked like it was set up. This young person in this SUV driving with no lights on, and we're going that slow, you know, it was like very set up. And the next time I saw these people, I said, see, you can't kill me that easily, and they went red, red in the face. And then I stopped dealing with them. So I've been a target a while because I'm making noise, causing some problems, get too much information out there. So but I'm going to do it anyway, and I'll just deal with it as I go. So but you need to make noise, just not too much. You know, if I ask you to email, you know, your congressman, send an email, because it will work. Call them, fax them. Best thing to do is fax, always fax, jam their fax lines up. It works. They said that I would never get the law in California and Los Angeles changed to allow raw milk. There was a biological attorney that worked since 1968 to get that law changed and was unable to do it because he made it too complicated. He was a biological attorney. His report on dairy was 500 pages. Who the hell's going to read it? Not going to happen. So I wrote 132 pages with 20 pages of exhibits proving everything that I said in the report. And on the day before the vote in Los Angeles County, it was four against the raw milk one for. I wrote an executive legal document because I had studied law and I threatened them. I said, here's all the proof, all the evidence. You have none. Every time you've blamed raw milk for an incident of outbreak and disease, it's been on based on survey. You call the people and say, do you have raw milk or raw meat in your house? Does anybody eat raw milk or raw meat? That is the criteria that causes a disease, automatic. So there's no science behind it. So I proved that. Before I proved that exact thing, the head of the health department, Los Angeles County the health department, which is the strongest health department in the world, even more than London, London's health department, they sent out a letter accusing these different incidences of milk poisoning, including the death of this one little girl. This one little girl drowned in a lake. In a lake. Drowned in a lake. 

Not in a swimming pool, she drowned in a lake. So they found all this salmonella in her stomach. So the health department called the family and said, do you have any raw milk, does anybody eat raw meat in the family or undercooked or rare meat? Even that'll be blamed if you say yes. That's the criteria, that's it. So they marked it. So they blamed this little girl's death on raw milk. And Dr. Douglas and I investigated it, we found out the little girl didn't like milk. She was the only one in the family that didn't drink milk. Everybody drank raw milk but her. Yet her death was claimed on raw milk. So I showed that evidence to the board and guess what? That head of the health department was fired. Fired. Because he set the department up for a hell of a lawsuit to lose. So when I wrote that legal document and had two ex-senators, retired senators, hand deliver it to the board of supervisors, hand deliver it the morning before the vote and say you better read this, you're going to lose a lot of county, you're going to lose an awful lot of money. So they read it and guess what? It was voted 4 to 1 for. So we got raw milk in Los Angeles and California and any store where you can find it, it can be sold in any store. And they said it could never be done. It can be done. You just have to go at them and prove that they are false. Prove that their science is wrong and that there is no science behind what they claim about raw milk and any other raw product. So I've got all the research in the world to back all of that, so I'm going to Washington. And I'm going to be a little bit more delicate than I was with the Board of Supervisors because I'm sure they were part of the problem of me threatening to extol millions of dollars in a class action suit if they didn't vote the way I wanted them to vote. I mean, it was so touchy at the end. At the day of the vote, the new acting MD that was heading the health department sat down for questioning. The mayor, the Board of Supervisors' head is the mayor, and the mayor said, you know, we had raw milk here for so long and, you know, we're not allowing it anymore. Did we do something wrong? Baiting question. The head of the department sat there and babbled and didn't say a complete sentence for almost 90 seconds. The Board of Supervisors knew right away, if this guy were questioned in court, anybody was questioned in court, it was going to be the end of them. So then all the Supervisors started bombarding this guy with questions, and he couldn't support or substantiate anything. So the mayor sent his health deputy over to me way out in the audience and said, listen, you've got the vote. Do you need to speak this morning? Can we just end this? And I said, as long as I've got it written on paper, you know, you'll vote that way. So you go up there and get everybody to sign it and bring it to me, you know, I won't have to testify and we won't have these 80 people testify, you know, so, because we had 85 people there.

When you get 85 people at a, at a council meeting, you know, then they're impressed, you know, so we had to picket outside and we did a demonstration and everything. So we got the vote. Now is that it's been legal in California. And they also put a little blurb in there that when they passed the law, that there was going to be a year of observing and close watch on anybody who developed any kind of disease from the raw milk. Year went by, not one incident. They started to blame one again and it was survey oriented, so I stopped that in a flash. You know, so, but that's how they judge whether something was created by some natural thing. And remember, the medical profession is always going to judge and, and blame something natural. They are not going to blame the toxins in our environment. They're not going to blame themselves. They're not going to blame industry. That's where all the money is. 

Q: [unintelligible] the spinach.

A: Oh, absolutely. And you know, when I went looking for H50, I mean 0157H7 E. coli, couldn't find it anywhere. Even in slaughterhouses I couldn't find it in factory farms. I couldn't find it anywhere. The only place I was able to obtain it is a friend of mine in the laboratory. One of the universities gave me a sample. And when I put a fractionating enzyme on it, it did not splice into two, I mean it did not divide into five parts the way an E. coli will normally do. It kept splitting in two. It kept, so it had to be spliced to man-made E. coli. So it's all set up in a false incident, you know. And this outlawing our raw juices, outlawing raw juices. We can't even have raw carrot juice unless you're right out of a juice bar getting a juice right then and there. But any pre-made juice cannot be raw, it has to be pasteurized. You know how they slip that in? They blame that death on that little girl on one E. coli from orange or apple juice. I think it was apple juice. One E. coli in it. They found one E. coli in one of the juices set up, of course. And Coca-Cola was behind all of this. And guess what Coca-Cola did? Coca-Cola paid this woman, this mother, that was told that this E. coli in this vegetable juice, I mean fruit juice, killed her daughter. She doesn't know any better. So she goes on a rampage, goes before Congress. Coca-Cola paid for all of it through a little, through a trust fund where they hid their name, involvement with it. And guess who bought Odwalla juice? Coca-Cola at an incredibly inexpensive price. 

Q: Who owns Coca-Cola, Rothschild?

A: Well, it all links back to a whole network of them, a group of the rich ones. So you have to take a look at what's going on. It's all just a monopoly game to them, but it's our lives and our livelihood. Okay, so let's get back to the body. You've been warned about what's going on. And the only way you're going to be able to take care of yourself is to support small farmers. Because the only thing that's going to be available in your stores is garbage processed, cloned, and genetically modified foods that are full of chemicals. That is all you're going to be able to get in the supermarkets, including Whole Foods. Whole Foods is part of that network. They're buying up all the chains. And when I found out 10 years ago about Whole Foods, and they just bought out wild oats. Whole Foods, you know, years ago, I started investigating them. You know, I said, okay, what are you feeding your cows? You're saying this is all natural meat. Well, we don't feed them any hormones or antibiotics, you know. I said, okay, but what do you feed them? And they said, well, we have different ranches that supply us, you know. So, I said, well, who handles it all? So, I got back to that person, found that they were feeding their beef 15% bakery waste, stale donuts. So, I called the head office of Whole Foods, and I says, you can't call those animals natural. You can't call that all natural beef. You're feeding them bakery waste. And he says, yeah, but it's made of grains, what they eat. I said, where do you see a cow going out and boiling grains in oil and eating it? That's how donuts are made, you know. They don't eat donuts. That's not natural. Yeah, but the grains that make it up are, so it's natural. The mentality of it, you have to understand, they don't give a damn about your health. They are out to sell you and take all of the money they can. And people who think they're buying organic and better foods are maybe a little bit better, but it's still from the same thinking of, let's get the most we can out of the least. And with lots of lies. And, you know, as Whole Foods, if you go in and look at them, they go, go organic, go organic, go organic, you look at how much produce they carry that's organic, 2%, in the whole store, 2%. Go into Wild Oats and your other local small health food stores that aren't just peddling vitamins and supplements, they'll have 50% or more organic foods. Something is wrong there with the Whole Food mentality and executive branch. So you have to take a look at that. We need to support the local farmers who will take care of us. Because that's the only way you're going to get pure food. And we found out, Max found that the guy who was selling him sheep's milk and all of that, an Amish farmer was buying GMO corn and feeding his sheep GMO corn. So the last batch of milk, the last two batch of milk, they're getting it back, getting a refund on it and shut that farmer out, you know. And we have to go on. 

We have to find out what these farmers are doing because they want it easy. They want it just as easy. Farming is not easy, especially with all the, you know, the pollution and the bad foods out there and they're starting to buy it too for convenience instead of the old ways. So they get into the trap too. So we just have to be very careful about, you know, our farmers and our food. So support your local farmer. Buy here less, you know, and get this food from your farmers more. I'm sure they don't like that, me talking like that in this store, but I'm going to have to tell the truth. And Whole Foods just bought this chain out, Wild Oats, so you know where it's going. You know, so that's why I say think about shopping elsewhere like at Sherry's Co-op where we can get better foods. More expensive, yes, but it's better than eating poisons, you know.

Q: What about Trader Joe's?

A: You know, Trader Joe's is just like Whole Foods. Yeah. If you have any questions, save them to the very end because if I get interrupted, I babble now, you know, so you can imagine how late it will go. So we've gone down the digestive track, and where most people get constipated as in the sigmoid colon where the body's trying to absorb the last bit because when that fecal matter gets down to the last point, that's where most of the E. coli is, has done its job, and the body's trying to absorb as much as it can out of the sigmoid colon. And what happens, it dries up and hardens. So eating a raw diet usually takes care of it, but for me it didn't. I had to get the parasite to do it to help me, but there's another way that you can do it also. You can take two tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons of dairy cream, two tablespoons of coconut cream with about a quarter teaspoon of honey, put it in a four-ounce jelly jar, shake it, put it in a bowl of hot water, not hot, as hot as it can burn your hand, but enough to heat that mixture until it's body temperature or a little bit more than body temperature. Take an enema bulb syringe and insert it in you as a suppository before you go to sleep and leave it there. That mixture will coat the feces and the sigmoid colon. The rest of it will pass up into the colon and feed the E. coli, so it makes them stronger. So initially that night the body's going to be a little bit more deficient in the nutrients from E. coli because it's going to be coated, but the next two nights or days and nights, your body's going to get even more than it lost from having it coated. And usually you only have to do that every three days to take care of constipation if you have it. But even constipation is the body's response to trying to get the most it can out of your fecal matter before it leaves the body because E. coli has worked so hard. And with all the poisons we have in the system, we don't even have trichinosis anymore. The human, like the pig, had trichinosis for millions of years. Every time we find a, you know, a body that's been not mummified because then formaldehyde was put in or some kind of chemical that destroyed the parasites, and then they dissolve. There's no trace of them. But in all the creature, all the humans that have been found, you know, in pits or, you know, dead of natural deaths that's on the ground or just under the ground without some ceremony, have had trichinosis in their small intestines. So trichinosis, what is one of the main things that everybody's been told not to get? Trichinosis. Cook your pig. Eat pork and, you know, unless it's very well done, you know, or else you get trichinosis. So take a look at Joel Weinstock, who's a gastroenterologist at the University of Iowa.

About 15 years ago, he noticed that he came from a farming community in Iowa, and he became a doctor and chose the intestinal tract as his specialty and found that the pigs at the university, when he began to teach, were very sick. And the pigs that were wallowing in the slop on the farms were good and healthy. So he examined their intestinal tracts and did many different tests with them and found that they lacked trichinosis. That was the only difference he could find in their chemistry. So he got trichinosis from the pigs on the farm and gave it to the pigs at the school, and they all got well, they all got healthy. So he decided to see, since humans were normally, and all of your tribe's people have trichinosis. All of your primitive people have trichinosis. So he decided he wanted to give it to some humans who had inflammatory bowel syndrome. And anybody knows inflammatory bowel syndrome, when it's chronic, you get cramps and diarrhea or vomit just from drinking water. It can be that bad. So he took six of his worst clients, got permission from the FDA, and the FDA said, yes, but you have to follow these laws. The patients have to have been treated medically for at least 10 years, and the medical help failed, then you can use alternatives. There is a law that you have to, a doctor has to give you medication, surgeries, and all that for 10 years before they can allow you to, or they have to treat you along with alternatives. But if they want to use alternatives, they have to wait 10 years until you have had no success with the medical profession, or you can use them only together. You have to use the medical profession system and the alternative together. So you are law, at law, to suffer under medical profession's supervision, their drugs, their medications, their surgeries, before you're allowed to do something alternatively. Doctors lose their license if they do, lose their license if they give you an alternative without using the regular chemical methods. So, Weinstock agreed, he found one patient that suffered for a little over 10 years, and he had five others that had suffered up to 32 years, no, I think 36 years, suffered with this disease. So, he took the intestines from a pig, he filtered out the eggs, put it in Gatorade and gave it to his patients, his six patients. In one week, five of them had no symptoms. They were asymptomatic, no symptoms. Suffered all those years, and then they get trichinosis and no problem. All the problems resolved. The one had no reaction, no side effects, but no good response from it. Didn't change his system. But the other five did, and they were back knocking at his door five months later for more, because they didn't change their diet. So, trichinosis is good for you. E. coli is important for you. All of those things that we are told are bad are good. All these things that we're told are good, like medications, all of that stuff, are bad. Just listen to the TV commercials. 

I don't watch TV, but when I'm in Thailand, everybody's got a TV. I mean, these guys, people in huts, grass huts, wearing skirts and everything, and out playing with balls that they made out of twine, and running around with chickens, and they make 50 cents a day. How are they affording a TV that costs $200 to $300 to buy, and then electricity that costs them at least 50 cents a day to run it? Who's paying for that? General Electric. Why? Because General Electric has assets in everything, including pharmaceuticals. So what do they run? There are 10 commercials a half an hour in Thailand, and half of them are pharmaceuticals. The other half are garbage foods like McDonald's and, you know, Kentucky Fried and stuff like that. These are in grass huts. They have nothing, no cars, no nothing, maybe a bicycle in the town, and they've got TVs and electricity to run the TV, and that's all they have the electricity for, except the store has a refrigerator and a freezer in the town, and that's it. Who pays for it? Why? You have to take a look at how sinister all of this is, and they're selling these people on taking medications. You have, what, six commercials an hour to talk about drugs, drugs, and drugs take drugs. You have a headache, take a drug, and in this country you see one, and it says side effects may be, you know, you've got a little female cramping, but if you take this drug, you know, your cramps will go away maybe, and you're also going to risk a headache, diarrhea, you know, vomiting, what is it, kidney infections, and when you listen to these commercials, you say, who in their right mind is going to get this stuff? I mean, if you have any mind at all, you're not going to go run to get the drug. You're going to say, these guys are out of their fricking minds. I'm going to take a chance on getting all these maladies when I'm just dealing with some intestinal cramp from menstrual cramps. You know, you take a look at that, and you say, how stupid do they think we are? Well, when children are educated on that level with TV at a very young age, they become that stupid. They become that stupid, and it's frightening. It's frightening. So, all of those good things are, all the bad things are good, and all the good things are bad that you're told from TV and the media, so forget all of it. I know it's a big leap. It's a big step, and it rips at your heart and your mind and your conscience and everything else in your whole being, but it is fact, and you may be, you know, upset and angry. I don't you to tell me that crap. I don't want to know that crap. I'm here to learn about health. This is part of it, because in five years, you're not going to have any opportunity to change it unless you stop it now, because it's happening now heavily. FDA just went in and put some rules out, new rules out. All herbs, even vegetable juice is going to be considered medication, so you can only get vegetable juice for a disease if it comes from the medical profession, and they prescribe it. Just past these so-called, what do they call them?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, no. Codex is trying to make it a law, but this, they were calling it suggested principles for better health, suggested principles for better health. And they wanted to turn every medical, I mean every naturopathic device into a medical instrument, so then you'd have to be licensed by a medical doctor to be able to use it. And that includes a Stairmaster, if it's suggested by a health professional to get you well, if it's a crystal, if you believe in crystals. Anything like that can be ruled medical equipment. And if you use it and prescribe it, you're practicing medicine without a license. Now, it can very easily go that way. Why would they be setting it up that way? Why don't they just leave it the way it is? Because they're greedy and they're playing a game with us. So, okay, then we're going to get into the different organs and glands in the body. Now, let's take a look at the glands. We have the pituitary and the pineal gland in the brain. Now, the pituitary regulates, so we are told, regulates growth mainly. And the regulation of the other, of the functionality of the other glands. True, it does that. The pineal gland, nobody knows what it is. A lot of people say it's the seat of consciousness. It's the bridge between the other world and this one. Who knows? I even, you know, to do examination with brains, you have to be, you know, you have to really be in to high money, big money, because brains are hard to get. And, you know, human brains are even harder. So, it's rather impossible for me to do that kind of research. The, then we go down, the next gland are the tonsils, and I've talked about those, protecting the brain. We go down to the thyroid and parathyroid. Now, the thyroid regulates the heartbeat and the muscle function. Heartbeat and muscle function, those go all day long. So, you have about six to seven thyroxins that are developed by the thyroid gland that help the lung and the heart and the liver work 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Parathyroids there, these two little gland, tiny little glands on either sides of the thyroid are there in case the thyroid has a problem, shuts down for some reason. These two little bitty ones on each side can produce as much as the whole thyroid can in the same amount of time. And they are the backup, they're like the adrenals. They can kick in a lot in a short period. But we very, most of the time they're supposed to be rarely used, but even in children today, I see that they're very well developed and they're working as much if not more than the thyroid glands because of our toxicity and problems. Then we go down to the thymus and the thymus helps protect the lungs too and the esophagus and the digestive tract and helps the lower area in the intestinal region. Then we go down further to the adrenals and the adrenals sit on top of the kidneys a little above the waist or at the waist for some people depending upon how somebody's physiologically built.

If you're built like me with a long torso like a gorilla, they're a little bit lower than the waist. If somebody has a short waist, those adrenal glands are a little bit above the waist. So, and those adrenal glands are what help you produce physiological energy for muscles. So, they help pump your muscles. They help give you physical energy for your muscles. Now, all of the glands, the body can substitute hormones and convert them. It can take thyroxine and make it into an adrenal. It's a little complicated process, but many times the body is so fatigued and damaged that it does that. It substitutes one hormone or transforms it into another, transmogrifies it into another. So, all of these things go on when the body is very simple. If we just take it at face value, take care of it with raw foods and stay healthy, each little system does its own thing and excellently. When you start crossing over, you have all these things that they're not used to doing and the chemicals they do, they lack that can ultimately finish the process that is normally done by another system. Like the blood transporting nutrients for the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is built to handle any kind of waste, even while it's distributing the nutrients. The bloodstream is not. Those white cells are protecting the bloodstream and the intestinal tract. If it has to protect all the other cells around that it feeds, it's all too much, it's all too complicated and a lot of toxicity remains in the body. A lot of waste products do not get removed. Okay, let's take a look at the organs. So, we know that the lungs absorb oxygen and release carbon dioxide as the cells in the body utilize them. If it utilizes them well, it doesn't, you're going to have poor lungs and poor functionality, chronic fatigue, inability to take full breaths, not feel like you're getting enough oxygen. It also protects, you know, the area around that, the heart. The heart is mainly muscle with a huge fat storage on top in case there's any danger. And the heart pumps the blood through to keep things moving in the blood. And we have the liver, and what does the liver do? The liver is mainly protein, contains quite a bit of fat but only about 20, 22 to 25 percent maximum depending upon how you eat. But your average slender person, the liver is only about 12 to 15 percent fat. And people who are overweight, it can get up to 27, 30 percent fat. That's a better, better thing to have. But what does the liver do? The liver makes bile, 60 varieties that help you design 60 varieties of cholesterol. A third of them are to give you energy. And fat gives you 2 1⁄2 times more energy per calorie than carbohydrate or protein, 2 1⁄2 times more energy, pretty, pretty efficient nutrient, fat. It also makes a third of them into cholesterols that make fats to lubricate and protect the body. Then it makes another third to cleanse the body.

Now, again, would the liver be spending a third of its career, its activity on building something that it doesn't need to do? All this cleansing, all this solvent if we were taking care of ourselves and we weren't inundated by the pollution. Think if the liver had another third the amount of energy just to handle making fats for lubrication, protection, and as fuel. Even simpler, you'd have a lot more energy, the liver would be a lot more alive. Now, we have the gallbladder to which it's attached. Now, the gallbladder makes nothing. It's just a slug, right? Oh, you had a gallbladder problem? Let's remove it, you don't need it. Well, a couple hundred years ago, a couple thousand years ago, you know, every homo sapien, every primate needed a gallbladder. Why? Because a gallbladder stores bile. So, you kill an animal, maybe you ate 10 pounds of fat in 24 hours. The liver can make enough to digest about a pound of liver, I mean a pound of fat a day. A pound of fat a day. So, let's say you eat 10 pounds in a 24-hour period during the hunt and kill. How are you going to digest all that fat? What's going to prevent you from suffering diarrhea for a week from eating 10 pounds of fat in 24 hours? The storage of bile in that gallbladder. So, you've got the reserve to handle it. Sure, we're eating every hour, a few hours nowadays. So, the gallbladder isn't so important unless you're like me, you eat an awful lot of fat. You know, maybe a pound and a half, two pounds a day. You know, a fat counting what's in the meat and what's in my cream and butter and everything else I eat. So, I eat a lot of fat. So, I need a gallbladder. So, I have one. Thank God I have that. I don't have the hydrochloric acid for the stomach and I don't have the appendix and I don't have the tonsils, but at least I have a useless gallbladder, you know. So, the gallbladder is important in that way. Then we have the pancreas. Now, the pancreas, the medical profession wants you to understand that it does very little. It handles sugar. It makes insulin to convert carbohydrates into glycogen for utilization as nerve fuel and any other kind of fuel that the body may need, the blood, whatever it needs to power itself. The pancreas is a very, very complex organ or gland because it does secrete insulin. So, it's a gland and an organ. And what it does, every time you eat a food, the pancreas takes the body, delivers the enzymes and a certain amount of the vitamins and all the nutrients and the fluid in that food, once it enters the duodenum, delivers it to the pancreas and the pancreas realigns it for the human body so that it puts out the plan for the conversion of that food for the best use in the human body. The pancreas has to measure what is needed all over the system. Very complex job to do. It has to analyze it. Then if you eat cooked foods where you're lacking all those vitamins and enzymes and non-cauterized nutrients, the pancreas has to make a hormone that goes to every cell in the body and said, like a couple of mugs, thugs, and say, I need some pennies of your vitamins, enzymes, minerals, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, anything you got that's pure, I need. Takes it to the digestive tract and then helps you digest your cooked food to utilize it the best it can.

Now, the medical community and the FDA and USDA says, oh, you can eat cooked food because the body will just produce the enzymes. Money grows on trees, too. You believe that? No. The body is leeching it from every cell, spending your bank account. So, what happens, what happens when people get old? I'm not getting old, I'm getting younger. Why? Because I'm not doing what they suggest. I'm not listening to that crap. But other people get older, older and more feeble because they're spending all their nutrients as they get older. They're utilizing their bank account and they get weaker and weaker. The cells die. Usually, when people die, their body is down to 20% body life in old age. Can you imagine 22% not healthy, supporting the weight and the energy that needs to be produced and the chores that need to be done for 100% of the weight of the body? Hell, I'd want to get out too. Oh, let's leave this body. This one, it's over. We've had enough of this, too hard, too difficult. So, the body usually drops away. And we don't have to do that. You know, if you eat raw foods, you're getting all those enzymes. And guess who doesn't have to work hard? The pancreas. It doesn't have to do all that. What happens if you eat a cooked meal and go to sleep? You don't sleep well. You wake up with sometimes headaches, indigestion, terrible thirst. If you go to bed eating this diet, a heavy meal, you wake up the next day and you didn't even know that you had a problem, because you didn't. The body didn't have to leach anything. The pancreas didn't have to work hard. The liver didn't have to work hard. None of your body had to work hard to digest that food. And I tell people to wake up during the night and eat something. Why? Because if you go five hours without eating, the protein level in the blood bottoms out, completely bottoms out. So what happens? The red blood cells become cannibalistic. They start eating each other. That causes over acidity and toxicity. Extremely acidic. It's ketosis in its worst form. All these ketones, all these toxic byproducts of protein are left in the blood, irritating the system, the bloodstream and the nervous system. So people wake up the next day and they can't move. They can't get out of the body. So they go for caffeine or theobromine, chocolate, sodas, coffee, cigarettes, anything to pick them up and stimulate them. Let me give you an example. For two years, I had been going to this place in Northern California and giving lectures. This was the third year there, well, the third time in two-year period because it was this time, then a year, and then a year, so that's only two years. So I'm going to give my third workshop at this place and the people who had invited me into their home to stay and where I give the workshop were very nice. They were all vegetarians. We're talking 18 to 22 years vegetarians. Raised their children that way and their children were all unruly, very unruly.

And, you know, they were like the man, 46 years old and like this. He thought he was 79, 80 years old and not in good health. And, you know, his whole spine was deteriorating being vegetarian. And that's the thing that I find with long-term vegetarians, no matter what age, had one 57 years vegetarian hygienist and on his 50, he was 72 when it happened and his spine went in one year, 50% of his spine disappeared. He used to heckle me, you know, when I would speak at these health food conventions about raw meat, he used to heckle me. I've never eaten meat raw nor cooked and, you know, I'm this way and I'm that way. I've got all this energy and I wake up at 5 o'clock in the morning. I only need 6, 5, 6 hours sleep a day and I do all this workout every day. And I mean, he's big, the only man that I'd ever seen that kept a big large body like a bodybuilder, you know. But he was hyperactive, not a nice person, didn't have a good personality. And guess what diet he went on when his spine went? This diet. He started chowing down the raw meat. And the only reason I knew that because his assistant was on my diet in the closet, you know. She's getting healthier every day and he's starting to deteriorate, you know. So, she tells me he's eating the raw meat but not telling anybody else that's how he's recovering. And it only took him two years to recover. But this one fellow where I was giving the workshop said, you know, I got there on Friday evening and he said, Aajonus, he says, I just don't get it, you know. This diet has just changed my, because he's standing up, you know, straight, full body now. He's got some muscle here, not all that skinny frail thing. And he said, you know, this diet is so great. It's just, it saved my life. It saved my marriage. It saved everything, you know, with my children. He said, but I have no energy till 10 noon, you know, 10 o'clock in the morning. Until noon, that's when my energy picks up. And I said, are you eating during the night? Are you going five hours without eating? And he said, yeah. I said, well, everybody has to come to these workshops to hear everything every year because you can only absorb so much of that information. You can only relate to so much of it. So I tell people to come back every year or every six months to hear my lectures because you're going to get so much out of it each time and it will be different each time. So he said, no. I said, well, five hours, the bloodstream loses its protein, red blood cells eat each other, causes fatigue. Wake up tonight, see what happens in the morning. He woke up, he would set his alarm, awoken during the night, had an egg and some milk, about three quarters of a cup of milk and one egg. And guess what? He woke with complete energy in the morning. That's simple. Changes his life. All these little things are important. Now, if you were the Maasai, the Samburu, the Fulani tribes that eat all raw foods that are meat and milk and blood and it's all raw, you don't have that problem. If your body eats itself, it's okay because you're built with good cells. And it's not a problem.

But we are toxic. We go eating our own cells and we're going to be very polluted more so and toxic. So you have to look at the differences and forget all the stuff that says, you need eight hours sleep all together. No. Some people will set their alarm for five hours, wake up, eat and can't go back to sleep. Well set your alarm for three hours and then sleep five hours. Easy. Who feels well rested after three hours and doesn't want to go back to sleep? Only me because I've been doing it, you know. I've been on this diet for so long, I wake up every three hours and I'm ready to go. And I usually only sleep three and a half, four hours a day. That's in a 24-hour period. I may sleep only an hour and a half at a time and I go. There's one time I went 21 days only sleeping 10 minutes at a time, an hour and a half a day. And I was suing the city of Los Angeles and the police department. I'm the only non-attorney to ever sue, get into federal court, the LA Police Department and the city of Los Angeles for harassing the runaways on Venice Beach. They're out there just doing hair wraps, doing artistic stuff, singing. And the police are running them off and throwing them into the drug trade and prostitution. So I fought them for five years on it and they attacked me and beat me up, an undercover cop, and I caught them, caught the relationship. So I had them in federal court. I had to prepare, it was only me, and I had two stacks of documents that I had written over that five-year period to get them into court. So I had to have everything. I had 22 police officers on that stand in that two-week period. I cost them millions of dollars in processing through that court. And I had captains and, I mean, lieutenants and sergeants galore and detectives that are paid a lot of money off the L.A. Police Department and in that courtroom costing them fortunes and scheduling problems. And I was only sleeping 10 minutes at a time, an hour and a half a day. And when it was all over, I slept four hours the next night, and that was it. Didn't get tired. I ate all the way through the court, you know. You're not allowed to bring food in. I told them I had been diagnosed as diabetic, so I had to eat every hour. So they would see me drink my raw milk, honey and butter, sometimes suck a raw egg right there in the courtroom, you know. So I put them through it, you know. I put them through it, but, you know, and sometimes I'd fall asleep right there. One time I was at the podium because I was mostly doing the questioning, you know. I'd have the officers up there, and I had to get them to the point of admitting, you know. So sometimes it would take hours, hours. I'd be up there six hours a day, seven, sometimes eight hours a day, getting testimony, standing at the podium. And one time I fell asleep for ten minutes, you know, but staring at the paper, you know. I had to have my nap right then and there. So several times the judge had said, you know, we need to pick this up a little bit, and, you know, I heard this in the background. I said, screw them, you know. So I stayed asleep. I needed my ten minutes.

Woke up every ten minutes and went at it again, just like that. So, you know, usually I said I needed a ten minute break or something like that, and then go sleep ten minutes and then back at it, you know. But one time I did fall asleep. Several times I fell asleep while the prosecutor, I mean, while the defendants, the officers were being questioned, you know. I just fell asleep because I knew what they were going to say anyway. So I didn't win. You know why? They, after the jury went to deliberate, they took a woman who had been on the police department for ten years and put her on the jury without ever going to the court system. And then the jurors came, three of the jurors came to me after and said, she kept us from, you know, giving you the award and everything. She said that because certain evidence was missing, there was no smoking gun. And all there was was a smoking gun. It was terrible. I had all the information, but she had made them unsure enough. But I cost them millions of dollars for those two and a half weeks, you know, in federal court, because it cost, in order for this county and state to run and the U.S. government to run a federal, it cost them $100,000 a day just to one run, one trial, $100,000 a day. That's like the motion picture industry, you know. $100,000 a day to make a movie, you know. So it was worth it. It was worth it, you know. And it worked. But I only needed an hour and a half sleep a day, 10 minutes at a time. So you have to wake up. People need to wake and eat before five hours passes. If you're in your waking state, you better eat every five hours. I suggest you eat every two to three hours. Something, drink some milk, do something to ingest to keep the system working. You're full of pollution. Your body needs help all the time, nutrients immediately all the time because we're so toxic. So we have the kidneys. Well, wait a minute. I forgot the spleen. The spleen is right next to the pancreas. So the pancreas job is very, very complex and intricate. The spleen, what does the spleen do? The spleen doesn't produce anything. It holds red blood cells. Well, where's your red and white blood cells made? Remember I said it's made in the bone marrow. They divide in the bone marrow and then they get into the bloodstream. And then the spleen will draw some of it out. Why does it draw it out? Why would it draw red blood cells out of the bloodstream? To thin the blood if you're too hot. It cools the body. It also works in conjunction with the kidneys, which pulls H2O out of the bloodstream. I mean, allows H2O to stay in the bloodstream. The kidneys will stop pulling H2O out of the bloodstream to keep it thinner. So you can cool the body. More water, cooler, but it leaches out of the system. If you have a question, write it down and I'll answer it at the question and answer stage. Okay?

I usually will answer everything that's everybody's written down, but there are one or two questions that I usually don't answer and then I need to answer those by you asking at the Q&A if I haven't answered it earlier. So, also, let's say the blood is very, you're very cold, then the spleen will dump a lot of red blood cells into the bloodstream and thicken it to keep you warm. And the kidneys will pull the H2O out to thicken the blood even more to make you warmer. What happens when you get cold? You find yourself peeing a lot. You urinate a lot because your body wants to get rid of the water so your blood can thicken and stay warm. Now, if you do all that and you still aren't warm, you've got a fat utilization problem in your body. You're not making fuel. And the body makes fuel on this principle. Eighty percent fat, 15 percent protein in the form of pyruvate, which is protein sugar, and five percent carbohydrate or vitamin C in real vitamin C form from a food and not ascorbic acid. And that is a proportion of the highest quality of fuel that your body can produce for energy. Eighty percent fat, 15 percent pyruvate protein, which is protein, and five percent carbohydrate. And the carbohydrate or vitamin C is used in the citric acid cycle. It combines with the protein, sugar, and allows the fat to be utilized as energy. And it isn't at all like burning like a car. It's like burn some energy. Do we eat something and burn it? No, we eat something and break it apart and use the energy of that food. And we spread it out throughout the body to give it more energy. And if you're doing raw foods, of course, you're giving the body a lot of energy, a lot of electrical charges, a lot of proton, a lot of neutron charges everywhere in the system to build it. If you're not and you're eating cooked foods, guess what the body has to produce a lot of for you have a lot of energy, hormones like adrenaline, and that's a false energy. That's not a pure burning, that's not a pure utilizing energy. So the spleen is very important. Let's say you were a caveman and swinging from the tree and you fell and cut your arm open and lost a cup, a cup and a half of blood. You would be deficient by a cup and a cup and a half of blood and you would be anemic for 45, 60 days. At the most, if you were healthy. The spleen has a reserve of about two pints depending upon the size of the spleen. So what happens? The body throws the cup and a half right back in the bloodstream, no anemia. And a person can survive in a dangerous situation. Animals are going to have a harder time eating them. You know, you can go back to swinging in the trees as soon as he gets the blood stopped from flowing, bleeding stopped, you know. So the body is built incredibly well to do everything you need it to do, even to be primitive monkeys from trees, you know. Now, a lot of people say, well, look at the other primates. You know, most of the primates eat a lot of fruit.

Yeah, but did you ever live with a monkey? They are emotional, hyperactive, and absolutely nuts. They masturbate all day long. They squeak, they jitter, they fidget. And I mean, they're so hyperactive and nervous because of all that sugar. Now, you look at your gorillas. They don't do that. They'll eat green bananas. Have you ever tried to eat a green banana? It's completely hard green. And it's alamine. You can't even chew it. You can't even get the saliva to chew them. Yet that's what they eat. They eat the peel and all green. And they eat leaves. And every 28 days about, they slaughter an antelope. And each of them will eat 14 to 28 pounds in about a 72 hour period. So they have their gallbladders for all with all the, you know, the the bile to digest the fat. They also eat onions when they eat meat to stimulate digestion. I know the Chinese think that the onion is a poisonous thing, but as in small amounts as a digestive aid, when you need the help, it's a beneficial thing. If you cook them, it's also an acrid substance. But onions in their raw form, especially the red onion in small amounts to stimulate digestion are very favorable. So if you want to be like a monkey, eat lots of fruit. You'll be hyperactive, wired. You're not going to have great relationships because you're not going to have you're going to have ADD and you're not going to be able to listen well. You're not going to be able to react well. You're just going to be a monkey, you know. And I remember a neighbor who had a monkey and, you know, and it was just nuts all over the place all the time. And they had two cats and the cats, you know, cats are usually lazy and easy going. But these cats lay around like this, you know. And one day they got home or I went over there and I peeked in the window because I like the craziness of the monkey. It had energy and I had no energy. I was sick so I envied that monkey, that kind of energy. I masturbated five times a day because that's the only thing I had the energy to do. That's the only thing that I ever produced, hormone that I ever produced for any kind of activity. So that's the activity I did. So I was basically like a monkey without the physical energy. And I saw this monkey raping the cats, raping the, he would screw those cats every day. And they were just, poor cats are like this. And I mean it did not rape them nicely either. It grabbed them, held them down and pumped them hard. It was awful. They were screaming. Nobody's home. They're at work. They have no idea. The monkey knew how to get out of the cage and just do what it wanted to do in that house, you know. When they found that out, that monkey's got a lock on its cage and then those nice cats became, you know, alive again. But that, I don't know how many times those monkeys were doing those cats, that monkey was doing those cats every day. But those cats were like dead, dead, emotionally, physically in every way because they were raped badly.

So I don't see how emulating a primate's diet that is, has that behavior is a good thing. Now your killer monkeys, they go on a fermentation binge 24 hours before they go out and kill. They'll eat fermented figs and, and fermented berries that are high in alcohol and they inundate themselves with all this alcohol before they go off in this killing spree. Who wants to do that, you know? I know some military people would like to do that, but most people don't want to, you know, behave like that or be like that, you know. I know that the nomads did it. They would eat, you know, moldy bread that had, you know, rye bread or corn bread that had lysergic acid in it, you know, LSD, and it would make them crazy and they could just go off in a killing spree. So they were known for that. They would breed this black mold on the bread and they would eat it before they went out on a kill, a march, you know, a raid, a pillage. So man has been using its food to manipulate its own body and environment for a long time, but what does the USDA, the FDA, and the government tell you and the medical profession? Food has no bearing on your behavior or anything. Only drugs do. Yeah, well drugs have a pretty bad influence because all the guys who were involved in all those school massacres, they were all on a psychotropic drug for depression, schizophrenia. Every one of them had been off their medication for, what was it, 7 to 10 days before they did it. And in the medical reports, I mean the pharmaceutical reports, guess what they leave out that when you withdraw animals, rats, mice, frogs, anything from, they use the frogs because they're so sensitive, they just put it on their skin. Any of those, did you ever see a frog get in a fight? Frogs don't fight, but when they withdraw from these psychotropic drugs, they start killing each other. The rats, the mice would all kill each other. So you have to wonder, they know this and they are putting these children on this kind of medication. And then what happens when they come off of it? They have slaughters like we did in Columbine and the other, in the tech school, and every one of them. And now I got this information from MDs, they sent it to me. They were sitting on this and this and this medication, this causes this, here's the research on this. So I went and looked at it and it was true. Every one of them had stopped taking their medication, was on withdrawal, and they were not warned about violence. None of them were warned that if you withdraw from this medication, you will likely get violent. Homicidal and suicidal. These chemicals is what they want you to live on. They want you to be confused, a fearful society that does everything they wish you to do. Okay, so we talked about the digestive tract and all the organs, the kidneys and the glands. Talked about everything.

You have the muscles, I had to go into that, muscles power you, you know, give you the ability to move about your bones, keep everything together and structural. Connective tissue keeps all of those different layers together. Connective tissue combines with the blood streams or all the fluid systems, keep them connected to the muscles, to the skin, to the bones. The cartilage is what buffers the impact of joint movement. So it's kind of hard, rubberish kind of idea. Cartilage, the way it's built is that it's not hardened and brittle and not swollen with toxicity. You have the tendons that connect the muscles to the bones. You have ligaments that hold bone together. You have ligaments like in the knee and your ankles that hold the bone together, and the tendons usually just hold the muscles to the bone. So the body is very simple. It would work very simply if we take care of it and not poison it. So we're going to take a break now, about a 15-minute break, so people can relieve themselves, because I can ramble for five hours without stopping. And I know everybody's pretty alert, but I saw a few people ready to doze out, some of the younger ones. So let's take a break, and then we'll pick up on food when we return.

[break]

A: Well, the most important food right now in our toxic environment is fat. I mentioned a few things about it already. The body protects itself with it, gives us the greatest amount of energy, and cleans, helps clean the system, the body. Now, if the body weren't highly toxic, like I said, the body wouldn't have to use a third of its nutrients, fat nutrients, to dissolve and get rid of poisons. It'd be used for our energy and used for making us look beautiful, lubricating our skin, moisturizing us, you know. Instead, it gets all dried out. We get all dried out because it's used to deal with toxicity, especially if you're a smoker. You know, it'll dry out the insides a lot because those tars are cooked at anywhere from 750 degrees to 1250 degrees. Those tars are thick. It takes a lot of fat to bind with that and arrest it and keep it from causing a tremendous amount of dryness in the system. And there are very few smokers that I've seen where tar does not store in the body. And I've seen grandchildren with tars and the parents never smoked, but the grandparents smoked. So the parents were around the grandparents who had smoked. They got it in their bodies and they passed it on to their children. So it's a very complex handed down toxicity. And it's not genetic handing down. It's poisons being handed down that causes the damage. Sure, I mean, it's not likely you're going to have a blonde person pop out of two people with dark hair, right? Well, I did. I was toe white. My dad's got black hair. My mom has dark brown hair. Dark as this. My father's pitch black hair. I came out a toe white kid. Toe white. Was I the milkman's kid? No, I look a lot like my father. So no, that wasn't. But genetics is a concept that has no bearing upon reality. It has some influence, but it doesn't have the properties that the medical profession, the scientific community wants you to believe, because then you'll blame your baldness or whatever problem you have, not on what's going in your body and what's in your body, so you'll blame your parents' genes. You can't do anything with genes, right? They don't want you tampering with your diet, so. And that's where it all comes from, your diet and toxicity and smoking is a diet of smoke tars, you know? It's part of the element that goes into your body that your body has to deal with and eat and utilize and try to utilize this as a fat, and it's very difficult because it's very thick. So these fats, and let me give you an example. You look at your weightlifters, when they're out there pumping iron and they'll display 7, 9% fat in their tissues. That's all, 7 to 9%. Very little strength. When Schwarzenegger was performing, out there exhibiting, showing off his muscles, he went from lifting 400 to 500 pounds to lifting 250 to 275 when his fat got way down. So you get weaker without fat. Take a look at your weightlifters. All of them are fat. You never see a skinny weightlifter. They're all fat. All of your wrestlers are fat.

You don't see a trim wrestler anywhere. And that's probably the hardest profession there is, is wrestling. I mean, if they really were out to hurt each other and not just do a dance and exhibit and a show, they could kill each other in a second. One blow with the elbow in the throat or in the temple, and the guy would be out. That's over. But they're out there to exhibit. And when you're throwing your body around 10 feet in the air and bouncing on top of somebody, you better have a lot of fat and a lot of muscle to hold fat. And these guys are brutal. They're brutal acrobats. It's a tremendous profession. And boy, you don't see a skinny one out there. Not even the women who wrestle are skinny. You can't be. You have to have all that fat as protection. Now, to see how it happens on a biological level for protection, I go to Asheville, North Carolina, usually once a year. And I do a workshop and see a lot of people there. And when I first went there, it was an unusual area. And they were called Earth Haven. It was a community of vegetarians. We're talking long-term vegetarians, some of them 37-year vegetarians. And they were the unhealthiest people I'd ever seen. And one of them was so sick. He was only 36 years old. And he looked like a raccoon, actually had black circles in his skin. And the rest of his skin was very gray. And he was chronically fatigued, had fibromyalgia. So he was searching for it, all the herbalists, everybody who helped him, energy workers, all of that, none of it helped. So he ran into my diet on the internet, started doing it in the closet, you know, taking meat onto the property, you know, having it in, you know, coolers, you know, so nobody saw it, eating it at night or eating it in the bathroom, you know, so nobody saw him eating this way. And he started changing radically and everybody says, what are you doing? Are you going to a certain kind of healer? What are you doing? He said, ah, you don't want to know. We're still in the experimentation era, you know, so. And after a year, he went from this depressed, anxious, lethargic individual and sagging and despondent individual to this vibrant, healthy, energetic, working person and functional person. And everybody said, okay, they cornered him and said, you've got to tell us what you're doing. He said, okay, get prepared. He said, but you cannot kick me off the property. I've invested a lot, 10 years of my life, into this community, so you cannot kick me off the property because you don't like what I do, and it works. And if it's what I have to do, it's what I have to do. You guys can do whatever you want to do, but it's what I have to do. So he told them. Three months later, 80% of the community was growing pigs, goats, chickens, doing the whole thing because of the reaction that happened to him. So this is my third year there. And you know, these hippies, you know, I was a hippie, you know. 

They look like hippies. They dress like hippies, they're slovenly, you know, not as neat, and that's cool, you know. And then this guy that looks like he came right out of a motorcycle gang came for a private consultation. Very out of place with all these vegetarians, you know, because he abused drugs and everything. So do a private consultation for him, photograph his eyes, and he's maybe about 20, 15 to 25 pounds overweight, you know, as according to the medical profession's guidelines. And not mine, but their guidelines. And his organs and glands were clean. He's about 53, 54 years old, something like that. But yet, he had the resilience and the cleanliness in his organs and glands like somebody in their mid to late 20s. So I said, you know, I've never seen anything like this before. You know, your body is in great shape, and I can see by your skin that you abused drugs and alcohol for at least 25 years. He said 30. And I said, see there, and I said, your insides are clean. I said, you just don't have enough fat on you to justify that. I said, are you from this planet? He said, yeah. He says, well, four months ago before I went on your diet, I was 300 pounds. So even the bad fats protect the body. Even the bad fats. Harder to get rid of them, and they're a lot larger, so you look huge. But they still protect you. So people who are fat are much better in health than anybody who is thin. And it's just the opposite of everything you hear, isn't it? If you're thin, you're healthier. Well, take a look at it. If you have no fats on your body to protect you from the poisons, where are the poisons gonna go? They're gonna go into your cell and damage your cell. They're gonna destroy the RNA. They're gonna alter it. They're gonna mutate it. They go into fat, who gives a damn? Fat cell just slovenly and lays there and doesn't do anything but accept fat, I mean toxins. Easy. No problem. So fat is very, very important. Now, you say, Aajonus, but you're not fat. You're awfully thin. I say, well, how do you know how fat I am? What's my body fat? Take a guess. What's my body fat? Usually somebody that's my size, muscles like this, what do you think? Most people would say 10, 12% most. I'm 22% body fat. Why do I look like this? Because I've been eating raw fats since 1972. All the fat molecules in my body are small and energy-packed. When you cook a fat, it swells 10 to 50 times its normal size, 10 to 50 times its normal size, 50 times its normal size. It's like taking a little grain of popcorn and popping it, and you have this big bloated thing. You take pig fat, pig rind, and you boil in oil, and what happens? It'll go from this thin little bacon-looking thing to this big swollen fat. 

Crispy and delicious though, right? But that's the kind of fat you're putting in your body, this tremendously large thing that can't be utilized in the cells, but can be used outside of them. So you have all this fat in your tissues. It's protective, but it sure makes the body sluggish and slovenly. It doesn't have to be. It'll protect you, but it doesn't make your body functions easy, easy at all. So fat is so important, and of course if it's raw, better. So then we have, like I say, the body uses fats to make solvents. Most of your viruses are made from fat, solvents. All of your hormones are 60, 50 to 60% fat, 15 to 25% protein. A lot of people are diagnosed with thyroid problems or diabetes. They say, you know, you don't have enough insulin, or you don't have T3 or T4, T5 or T6 or any of the... Thyroxins. You're not producing them. How do you know I'm not producing them? You're just looking at the blood. You're not testing how much is in my blood every 15 minutes or every hour. You're testing one time. One time in a year, maybe. What can you tell from one time in a year? If I give you a million dollars to spend a day, and you spend every bit out of it, are you poor? Are you poor? No. You're not poor. You spend it. So let's say you produce thyroxin, and you produce insulin, but you use it all. Does that mean you're deficient? Not at all. Not at all. So a lot of these people who are diabetics, who are told they are diabetics, aren't diabetics. A lot of the people who are told that they have thyroid problems do not have thyroid problems. But also remember that if one gland is down and the body doesn't have one hormone, it can use another hormone as a substitute. So you'll be constantly using all of your hormones if your body is having a problem under heavy detoxification, or it's dealing with an inundation of toxins at the time that your body is using your hormones to arrest those toxins. Fats are always involved in arresting toxins, and if you don't have the fats, it's going to go into your cells, mainly the nervous system, and pull the fats out of the myelin. That's the sheath on the nerves. It's going to get into a cell and try to pull the fats out of a cell. It's going to bind with the fats in the cell, and then you've got a mutated cell. You've got a damaged cell that cannot function properly. Being fat is a very wonderful thing. When people first start on the diet, she is my ideal. There's a protected body, head, toe, emotionally, and everything. I was that big, and let me tell you, I functioned like a train when I was eating like that and on a farm. When I was that big, I still liked to get bigger than this, but I lost 20 pounds with this leg thing. I was in so much pain, I couldn't eat to keep up with it, and I didn't have all the foods that I needed in Thailand that I wanted all the time. I lost some weight, but I go from a 30-inch waist up to a 37-inch waist. I have three wardrobes to fit into those, a 30 to a 33, a 34 to a 35, and then a 36 to a 37. A 36 gets me into 37s.

I just wet the waistband and stretch it out a little bit, and then when I'm on the thinner side, I put it in the dryer a little longer, and it shrinks in. That's my wardrobe, three wardrobes for three different sizes. Sometimes I'll interchange. If you want the baggy look, then I'll put the baggy clothes on when I'm thinner. I can be in style if I'm going to that particular kind of place. Three wardrobes is a good thing. Being fat is good. In the book, in the recipe book, I say, every six months get fat, lose the weight. That's only because so many people are paranoid of fat. I get fat like this, I'm never going to lose it. Oh, God, I'm going to be fat the rest of my life. Usually on this diet, it's very easy to lose fat unless you smoke or have another problem. Then it can be very difficult for you to lose weight because the body wants to eat and eat and eat and eat and eat to get rid of the toxicity. It's very difficult to lose weight. I don't know many people who is very difficult to lose the weight. Maybe two out of 500 have difficulty losing the weight even with my help because their system is just so damaged. I like people to stay fat for two and a half years and let the body take it off when it has a flu or a cold or some kind of detoxification where you lose it or you break your fricking leg. You know, just think if I didn't have that weight. Now when I broke the leg, my waist was 36. When I finished, my waist was 29 and a half. You know, now I'm up to a 32, almost a 33 again, you know, but I don't look that big. But I'm wearing my 34 pants right now, just a little loose. So I wear a belt. So I like, just think if I hadn't had the fat on me when this accident happened, I wouldn't be walking today probably. I wouldn't have repaired as quickly. So fat is so important. Get fat and happy. A lot of women say, oh, but I won't be beautiful. What's beautiful, unrestful, irritable woman that has no fat on her body and it's always cranky. You know, men are the same way if they're skinny a lot. I mean, we're talking about 90% of all thin people are easily aggravated. They're much more irritable. They are much more volatile. They have triggers that blast off very quickly. People who are fat, no, doesn't happen. Take a look at 100 years ago, 200 years ago, what was beautiful? Women who were fat and robust. Women who could have children, still stay vital and strong and make it through a winter. Can you imagine not having central heating and central air and living primitively? You know, and maybe what you have is a coal-burning stove in your house or a wood-burning stove, all those fumes in the house. You don't want to burn it too much. So you get into bed with several kids in a, you know, several kids together to keep each other warm in one bed. You know, the husband and wife sleeping very close together. Now everything is so regulated by temperature, you find the husband and wife on two ends of the bed.

No camaraderie anymore, you know, unless you chill the house. Honey, let's be close tonight. Let me turn the heat down. In fact, let me turn the air conditioning on. It's 30 degrees outside, but let's put some air conditioning on, or let's open some windows. Then we'll cuddle and be happy about cuddling, you know. If you're like me, body heat, I mean, Jesus, they want to stay far away from me because I produce so much heat, you know. So it's good in a cold environment, then they, you know, then somebody might want to sleep with me. Otherwise, I'm a pretty hot person, you know. So you take a look at all these variables. Fat was beautiful. Fat was important. A woman had to make it through childbirth and winter at the same time, raising many children. She had to cook. She had to clean. She had to do so many things in a very difficult way, washing like this, a lot of energy. Now women flip on a washer, dryer, dishwasher, and they're exhausted. Something's very wrong with that picture. Very wrong with that picture. And the thinner they are, the worse, unless they're hyperactive. Then those are the worst. The worst. I had one date with Twiggy and I never called her again. Because I was so sick, I couldn't work easily and I didn't want to work for the corporations anymore. So I worked for a different kind of corporation, in the motion picture industry. So the first show I got on to was Medical Center. General Hospital. I mean, all of these things, you know, I was always involved in some kind of, you know, medical show. You know, it was like, plagued me. So, you know, I was on General Hospital for five and a half years, you know. I was on Medical Center for about a year. I played a doctor in, on One Life to Live for a year, you know. So all these things. I got into that because I was so ill and so sick. The only thing I could do was repeat words, which were sound bites to me still. And just emote, you know, just, it was easy. And I could go lie down and vegetate for the rest of the time. And you sit around all day going, you know, I had somebody always say the words in a tape recorder. And then I played them back till I could get, because I couldn't, I still had a problem with memorizing the written word. It was still very difficult for me to take that in, even though I could read at that point. Yeah, I mean, because, you know, everything that was, it didn't make any sense to me. It was all just garble. It didn't have to do with my life. So it was good because, you know, if you have no emotion behind what you're saying, then you're doing the method like, you know, Marlon Brando, you know, what you're feeling has nothing to do with what you're saying, and it really works. So they used me, but never for a leading character because I couldn't memorize, you know, 10 to 50 pages a day. Some of those people, 60 pages a day, my God, that was out of the question for me. But it paid me a lot of money.

So my publicity agent says, listen, I need a date for Twiggy, you know, he was the head of MGM publicity department, and he said, I need a date for Twiggy tonight, you know, and she's in town with Timey Toon, and they just did that movie, and wants you to take her to the opening of Butterflies Are Free in the new multi-complex theater, and back then that was the first one, and it was only three theaters. Now they have 15, 18, and 20 theaters, you know, in one group. So that was the first one, it was in Westwood. So you know, she's ultra skinny, so we go into the show, we watch it, and I still was very ill, so the flashes, you know, bothered my eyes. So I said, I'm not going to go out to the paparazzi, let's go out to the back, we'll have to send somebody out to have the limo meet us on the side. So we went over to the side, we went out the back, and there was still construction going on in the halls, so they had all these building materials. And I just thought, no, maybe the way is blocked, you know, and then I looked behind me, and I said, why don't you catch that door in case it locks? Well nobody caught it. So Twiggy starts screaming at the top of her lungs, I'm stuck in here, nobody is going to find us, we'll die in here, you know, screaming and going on and on like this, and I mean for five minutes. And Justin, her manager, and I started shaking her, literally slapped her to bring her out of it. And, you know, I wasn't going to call Twiggy again, that was the last time I dated a skinny girl, you know. It's hysterical, you know. So you have to think about that. When you're that thin, you have no protection. Any kind of irritation that goes in the body is going to cause you to be likely to be volatile. Now like I say, that happens not all men and all women who are skinny. I know 10% who are just as calm as anybody who's fat. But predominantly it is a problem. A lack of fat is a big problem emotionally, mentally, psychologically, and in relationships. Let me give you an example. I had one woman, 52 years old when she was on a diet. She had a child when she was, no, 51 when she was on a diet, had a child, got pregnant, 49 years old. She was one of the executives for ABC Films, a producer. And she was very skinny. After the baby, she was chronically fatigued and had fibromyalgia, pain in many places in her body. So she went on the diet, put the baby on the diet. By the way, the child is now 20 years old and just graduated from Yale with top honors. So, incredible. We just had another child who reached five years old who was born with his mother on the diet three months before he was born. His mother was on the diet three months before he was born. He just entered the fourth grade and he's five years old. Another kid that's been on the diet for six years, he even went to the Los Angeles Board of Supervisors hearing and spoke before the council and said, you know, he's eight years old at the time.

He said, I'm asthmatic and the only relief I have is with raw milk. Don't take my raw milk away. You know, I have that on tape, you know. And this kid just came out last week in the LA Times, number two in tennis championships in high school over the entire United States. This was a kid that couldn't lift his finger because he had asthma. Couldn't play sports. Now he's number two in tennis. Pretty incredible what this diet can do, you know. So all of the children who are on this diet exceed unless they were raised vegetarians first. Then it takes a lot more time and it's more difficult. The ones who don't, who are even on a bad diet but not a vegetarian diet, those children do fared a lot better. I don't have one that was a vegetarian at a young age that fared well mentally and emotionally. That doesn't mean that just because I haven't met that many born and raised as partial vegetarians or all vegetarians, none of them will fare well psychologically and emotionally quickly on the diet. But it's been my experience that emotionally those are more difficult children that were raised vegetarian even when they get on the diet. Their brothers and sisters that are raised on the diet are different kinds of children completely. So the diet works for children in an amazing way. Now when the, before the child was, or after the child was born, the mother wanted to work. We're talking about the five-year-old who entered the fourth grade. And the mother and father asked me what kind of diet the child should have because she wanted to wean herself off of breastfeeding. And I said, well, it's better anyway because I always think that a mother should not breastfeed unless she was raised and lived as a raw fooder. Because a cow's been on a raw diet all of its life, a goat's been on a raw diet all of its life, its milk's going to be much better than the mother's. And a lot of mothers have a difficulty with that because they want to feel connected with their babies. So it was very difficult for, you know, convincing a lot of mothers to that the cow's milk or the goat's milk was better than her milk. But it just makes common sense and it always works that way. There are women who had the babies start crying and are whining all the time. So as you go into cow's milk or the goat's milk, raw, all the allergies go away. And when they eat the mother's milk again, it has that problem. There's one baby I know that only did well on the mother's milk and it was the opposite. But the mother was eating a good diet and she was producing good enough milk that the baby did better on the mother's milk than any other milk, than the other milks. But mainly it's better if they eat the other animal's milk that's been on a raw diet. So they asked me what I thought their babies should be fed. And I said, all babies just eat milk. You know, the primitive tribes, they just eat milk for four to seven years. They'll suckle for up to seven years, you know. That's not, after four years, it isn't all that they drink. But they maybe suckle just once a day from that time on to seven years. 

And they keep a connection on an emotional level and a physical level too with that child. And then it makes for a much more cohesive tribe. You know, they're not so independent. They realize where life comes from. Life comes from life. Life comes from the parents, from food, from life in general. So I said, it depends. What kind of a child do you want? Do you want a physically active child? Do you want a brainy child? Do you want both? Now, both of these parents are highly physical. And they aren't, they're average people. The father and mother have good insight and they're thoughtful people. But they said, you know, they always, they want for their children what they want for themselves. I want them to be a genius. I said, you want a genius? Feed them 50% liver and 50% milk with a little honey in it. You blend it all together, snip a big hole in the nipple, because it's got to be big for him to get it out of there. So that's what he's been eating. He still eats that as his main food at five years old, liver and milk, liver and milk. And he doesn't have a lot of muscle because he doesn't eat muscle meat. Although the liver is mainly protein, but it's protein that has been structured to deal with bile and fats. So it has a leaner characteristic. So this kid is lean and brilliant. He will, at two and a half years old, he would pick up a book and read it to his preschool friends. You know, anywhere from two years old, two year old material. I mean, second grade material at two and a half years old. I remember the first time we realized that he'd reached his genius, I was giving a workshop and I was staying at their house, and the mother brought home a new toy for her son who was five months away, four and a half months away from his second birthday. And he had a cousin, seven years old, that was sitting next to him and they were playing together. And his mother brought in a new board and what it was, was this wooden board with the alphabet pegs. So the alphabet peg fit into its proper shape, just like square and round and triangle would fit into their respective shape pegs, holes in the board. So the little girl, the seven-year-old, took it, you know, she was going to do it. After about seven minutes, she got so frustrated she didn't get one of them, she threw a couple of the letters down and stormed away. Old little Forest, P, Q, S, A, all of them and said every letter. We had not a clue that he was that bright. So Nicole said, okay, tell us the alphabet, sing the alphabet song. He probably heard it only once from a videotape or something like that, you know, on Sesame Street or something, and he said it without missing a beat, the whole alphabet, not even two years old. And I said, okay, sing it backwards. Without missing a beat, he sang the whole thing backwards. And two years later, he knew 187 countries, what kind of political system it had, was a monarchy, a democratic monarchy, or a communist, he knew all that, who ran the country, and what country was next to it, and all the countries surrounding it. All on his own, he'd just pick up a book and just absorb it like that.

So the children who are on this diet are all exceptional children. That is a danger to the people in power, a big danger to the people in power. They don't want people so smart. You have to ask yourself, why did all, why have all of the greatest scientists disappeared and died in the last 10 years? 50% of the major scientists that come up with cures and chemical relief and new systems of air travel, I had one patient who was a doctor, had this system of air travel that had nothing to do with the way we travel. It was almost like time travel. They killed him in a year. He had no problems and then they started poisoning him with radar, radiation. And the only way I found out was because I visited him and the electromagnetic fields that I'm very sensitive to were extremely high. And I said, you have to move. And when he decided to move, he was so ill by that time, he couldn't move and he was dead a week later. So they are out to make everybody stupid. So we have to do differently. We have to make some very smart people. So it's best if you feed your children that way. Let me give you an example of a teenager that came to me. Not a vegetarian, but she was 14 and a half years old. Her mother made her go on the diet. The mother and father broke up, they were going through a divorce and the mother was not well. She was having a lot of trouble with the breakup and because of her husband was a doctor and wanted everything and greedy as hell. And you know, they just had one daughter and she was going through all of this emotional stuff and physical stuff, started getting sick, went on the diet, made her daughter go on the diet. So made her come and have a full consult with me. The little girl stared daggers at me during the whole consult, daggers, I mean, just nasty looks. And, you know, anytime her mother wasn't watching, she let me know that she was not happy about this, you know. So it was almost, it was almost funny, but she was serious, you know. And guess what happened? Students who came to see me voluntarily the next year, the 15-and-a-half-year-old girl who had been 14-and-a-half. She was a B student, went from a B student to the second in the class, A-plus student. She wanted to be a ballet dancer, and she was a mediocre dancer. She evolved in that one year to become the best in the class and got a scholarship at Juilliard for ballet in one year. She was able to do what she wanted to do, gained a lot of weight, and was still able to be a dancer. I have a model from Canada that came to me 11 years ago, and as skinny as skinny could be and as sick as—I mean, she was as skinny as Twiggy, but she was six foot tall and had breasts where Twiggy had no breasts. This girl had huge breasts. That was the only big thing on her.

And she'd been on the diet—she'd been on the diet 11 years now, and she's a champion tennis player now at 31 years old. Champion tennis player, 31 years old, just starting out a year and a half ago playing. She's in competition—you know, we're talking about on a small level in Canada, but, you know, semi-professional, that's a big step up, starting at 30 years old, playing tennis. And she's a big girl. We're not talking about a little girl. This is a big girl, and she's big all over, big and strong. So it's amazing what you can do on this diet if you do it and apply yourself. Sure, it took her all those years to get well, because she was so sick and so skinny for all of her life and so much damage, but 11 years is a small part of your life if you get to live it with a phenomenal amount of energy and happiness for the rest of it. It's a way of getting well instead of worse. So sometimes you have to be patient. Getting well takes a long time. You know, according to Pottenger and Howell, who both did experiments with animals on raw and cooked diets and processed foods, found that when an animal was thoroughly diseased, that it took five generations to reverse to become optimally healthy. Well, five generations of cells in us takes us seven to seven and a half years per generation to get all, to replace every cell to the bone, to the bones. So five times that is what, 147 years. Five times 21. All the other animals live five times, I mean, seven times the time it takes them to finish maturation. So we should be living to seven times 21, 147 years. We should be living to 147 years, and it may take you 40 years to get to optimal health. That's okay. I'm not there. I started eating raw meat on a daily basis in December of 82, twice a day on a daily basis I started eating meat, about a pound a day. Now if I count from that date, I have how many years already in, 34, right? So I have, no, 24, so I have two from seven, so it's 25 years. So what do I have? I have 15 years left to go. I'm already satisfied, and I still have 15 years to go. So you don't get well all at once, it's gradual things. You get healthier every day, and I do get healthier every day. I don't feel worse. Even with this accident, recuperating from it, I still feel now as of today as healthy as I did before I broke my leg, and I've just gone through a major, major trauma, but I'm still as vital and as healthy. I'm standing up here, I'm doing mostly walking around like I normally do, and I've got a broken leg. It's not finished fusing itself together, and I'm here walking up and talking to you, spending lots of energy, and I'm in no pain, except for a little gas from that too much cream I had at once. I've been on the diet so long, if I drink too much cream, sometimes it causes me some diarrhea. I used to be able to suck down a whole quart in a day, you know, and I can't do that anymore. So that I have to be careful about. 

I can suck down the butter all day, not cause a problem with that. Cream is a little difficult to eat. So there are lots of assets going on in the diet, and we're talking about fats, and I tell you all these stories so they'll impress upon you the value of the diet and fats. So what fats are good? Animal fats are always the best. We're built to digest animal fats. We're told though that animal fats cause hardening of the arteries and heart disease. Well if you take a look at the tribes that only eat cooked meats and cooked fats from animals, they have no heart disease, no arteriosclerosis. They have a little gout. They have some arthritis and rheumatism, have a little bit of osteoporosis, but they have no hardening of the arteries. They have no congestive heart failure. They have no heart disease at all. So who's telling these stories? When did they start? When did they begin? When margarine and vegetable oils became marketed in the 60s, late 50s they started thinking about it, cooking up the whole garbage about animal fats are bad. Animal fats are bad, and it isn't. What happens if you eat a vegetable oil? A vegetable oil in a human body will crystallize, turn hard. So that's what causes hardening of the arteries and heart. Vegetable oils, margarines, Crisco, safflower oil, that kind of garbage. An herbivore, an animal that eats vegetation, has a body temperature of 102 to 105 degrees. Ours is 98.6 and lower, except in a fever, and that's not long enough to keep that vegetable oil fluid. We've got to keep it fluid or else it starts crystallizing in our bodies. So that's why most people have a congested lymphatic system. That's why it doesn't feed the body well. That's why it doesn't clean out the garbage, and they have caking all in the lymphatic system in their irises. So they don't feed the body well, they don't cleanse the body well. How do you remove that? In we want to live, I talk about lymphatic congestion and lymphatic baths. That means you sit in a hot bath every three to four days, and you cook yourself at no more than 105 degrees, from 102 to 105, for an hour to an hour and a half. It takes 45 minutes to get your body heated deeply enough to get to the lymphatic system. Then another 10 minutes to about an hour, till you're actually getting some of it, just like having a jar with butter in it. You put it in warm water, just the outside starts melting a little bit. The inside is still hard and cold, but just around the glass, we've got it to melt a little bit, it's a little fluid. Well that's what happens in the lymph system. We melt a little at a time, and you can only melt just a little bit in an hour and a half, in there, but it's enough to get it fluid. Then I suggest that you eat or drink a mixture of pineapple, coconut cream, a tiny bit of butter, tiny bit of dairy cream, blend it together, or however you want to mix it together, and you eat it right before you get in the bath, or as soon as you get in the bathtub.

And you wait that long, and then when you get out of the bathtub, you get on to the toilet seat or another chair in the bathroom, and you pat yourself dry for about 10 minutes, because you're going to still perspire, and you want to keep up the perspiring. Then you bundle up like it's winter, even if it's the heat of summer, and you take a 45-minute walk. By that time, that pineapple and coconut cream mixture is getting into the lymphatic system from the digestive tract. It will help keep that lymphatic fluid from hardening as your body cools itself after your walk. If you're too fatigued, you can't take a walk, then get under the covers with some hot water bottles and keep perspiring. But you've got to have cotton long underwear on to absorb the poisons, because they will damage your skin if they stay on your skin, because some of them will be highly toxic. And that gets the lymph system moving. Let me give you an example of what can happen. Seventy-two-year-old man, well, he was 70 at the time, and he was having a lot of fatigue, a lot of problems, and he couldn't get his energy level up, got on to the diet, was improving and improving. And I don't like to put anybody on those lymphatic baths until they've got enough fat on them, until they've got enough weight. And he was on the very slim side, about to go vegetarian. So he went on the diet, started putting on weight, and after two years, he put on enough weight. So I suggested he start doing the lymphatic baths. So he did them for three months. He did short baths every day, you know, 35, 40 minutes, but not to get to the lymphatic system. He did that two days a week, three days apart and four days apart, the same day every week. So he made a hot tub to do that, and had his pineapple drink before. And he did his walk, gruesomely, and I mean, it was like this, going along the fence, and you know. After three months, he was a different man. This is a man who had retired, made a lot of money, very wealthy. He started a new business, a stem cell company that takes adult stem cells from the blood, your own blood, incubates them in a laboratory in Israel with your own blood serum, then infuses them back into the heart. The doctors do all that, but he's the one who runs the company and made and developed the company. This is a 72-year-old man, works 15 hours a day. He's on the diet now for six years. And 72 years old, and he outdoes his son, who's 46, 47. Because he's on the diet, his son does the diet a little bit here and a little bit there. But this guy is a 99 percenter. The only thing he has is his one glass, one bottle of beer a week and a cup of wine a week. And he does like the French do, pigs down on some fat before, you know, he has the alcohol so it doesn't damage his liver or brain system. So that gives you an idea of how well the lymphatic system can work.

This is an incredible company he's built, and he's the one who runs it and developed it. 70 was, 70 years old he started, 71 years old he started the company, incredible. What the body can do with the right nutrients, and if you know how to clean the body properly. It can take care of itself. You need that lymphatic system working, if you've got a congested lymphatic system, you need to do something about it as soon as you have the weight. If you don't have the weight, don't do it. If you have that kind of congestion coming out of your system, and you don't have the fat in the connective tissue to prevent damage in the connective tissue, then you will deteriorate the connective tissue and you have lupus. And that's a very difficult disease to reverse. So wait until you have enough fat on your body, and that's usually 25 pounds overweight, as the normal medical viewpoint. Okay we talked a lot about fat, now let's go into protein. Now a lot of people say, oh beans have protein, nuts have protein, a lot of your vegetarians will say, claim that all of these foods have enough protein for us. But they all lack B12, they all lack some of the amino acids that you can only find in meat. So they're all deficient. And I've only met now nine people who've been long-term vegetarians that do fairly well with it. Very well. I told you about the one guy who was 57 years doing it, and then all of a sudden his spine went. All of those people, all eight of the nine people were men. Only knew one woman, and at 37 her spine started deteriorating. She went on the diet, two years later she's fine. So, I don't see many people who can handle a vegetarian diet. If you can and it's for you, do it. It's great. Fine. It doesn't matter. I'm not attached to any kind of a diet as long as it works for you. But I'm giving you the information that works for everybody who's done this diet. Everybody. Everybody who does the diet and doesn't become afraid, you know, of bacteria, and E.coli, and the raw meats, do excellently on the diet. And I can't see anybody in here being any different. So, protein's the only place where in my experiments that I found that animals increased growth hormone outside of adolescence and finish of maturity at the state of maturation was when they ate raw meat. Cats, dogs, and humans. Even pigs. When they eat raw meat, even beyond their stages of producing a lot of growth hormones, they continue producing them if they're eating raw meat. Not eating nuts, and I'm talking about omnivores, whether it's chickens, ducks, pigs, cats, dogs, all of them in my experiments produced a lot of hormones for reproducing cells. And only with raw meat, all of those species. So, raw meat was very important. Nuts, beans, usually cooked grains, all of that. Now, the birds have a gizzard, and they're meant to break down the proteins in grains. They're built for it. But certain ones like the vulture and the ravens and crows and owls are meat eaters. And they will not produce growth hormones without raw meat. They won't do it.

And neither have I found anybody... I used to eat seven, when I was a vegetarian, I ate seven pounds of nuts a day and would wake up a quarter of a pound lighter the next day. And I was eating good because I was picking them off the trees and eating them, breaking. I'd spend my whole day eating and never be nourished and get skinnier and skinnier. When you live outdoors, that's strenuous. You've got temperature changes of, you know, 80 degrees sometimes. It can be 90 degrees in the day in the desert and turn out to be 20 degrees at night, 10 degrees at night, can be that extreme. And that kind of extreme exposure to the human body is very stressful. And people talk, oh, you know, I'm in a stressful job. I've got a boss who calls me every hour or every two or every day and expresses that he needs this. Big stress, ha, live outdoors. You've got the wind. You've got the sun. You've got the cold. You've got the heat pressing on you every moment of every day. That's stress. Your boss calling you once a day to say, listen, I really need you to get this done is just emotional stuff, not real stress. So outdoors, the nutrients were tremendous that I needed. Seven pounds of nuts, 12 pounds of fruit, but I never gained any weight from it. So raw meat is very, very important if you want to get younger and stronger and produce more cells at a quicker rate. Now, carbohydrates, everybody's told, if you're an athlete, you have to have high carbs, lots of starches. Hello? What happens to people who eat lots of carbs? What happened to McEnroe? What happened to all of them? They burn out and dry out in their 30s, dry out in their 30s. Billie Jean King, all of those people got dry. Now you look at Billie Jean, she's fat. She went the other way because now she feels healthy, fat. I don't know what diet she's on, but at least she's allowed herself to be fat. Now, McEnroe, he's also allowed himself to put on a tremendous amount of weight. But when he was skinny and under the coachship of Paul Cohen, who was in his day an Olympic contester and champion back in the 50s. By the way, Paul Cohen's on the diet, been on the diet for about 11 years. He said, only if I knew this diet back when I was playing or coaching McEnroe, we'd have been the best champions of ever. And this guy's on the diet for 11 years now, so he knows, and he's in his 70s. And he runs a business, he won't retire, he's got two businesses going now, you know, so he's got all this energy. And he's old, according to, you know, chronological age. And both of those old men are not old, because they're taking care of themselves properly. And they have the energy to keep going in life, thrusting forward with a lot of energy.

So the cooked starches, according to what they say, you've got to have a lot of energy, you know, if you want to be in a marathon, if you want to be a high performance athlete, lots of carbs. Well, carbs cause what? A retention of advanced glycation end products. University of Columbia in New York City found that the body, the human body stores advanced glycation end products at a rate of 70 to 90%. That means every time you eat a high carbohydrate and your body makes it into glycogen, which is probably 80% of all the carbs that you eat turn into glycogen, the advanced glycation end products store 70 to 90%. In a healthy body, 70%. In an unhealthy body, like with a compromised kidney or diabetes, they store 90% of every advanced glycation end product that is ever produced in your body stores. That's a waste product that makes everything very sticky in the system. So if that's true, then what are we doing eating high carbohydrates? It's not meant for the human body. What does it do? It causes thickness in the neurological fluids, in the lymphatic fluids in the blood. When you see that happening in the nervous system, what happens? You got a synapse that misfires, it goes, it's meant to go for that particular brain center, and it shoots off to the side, but you got to get stuck on the way out. In the bloodstream, you see it sticking to each other, so nothing's flowing very well. So you don't think as well, it gets spacey. So if you want to have a clear mind and clear blood and function with as much fluidity and clarity as possible, you stay away from carbs. But how can the body make glycogen without carbohydrates? That's where they get you. They say, your body can't produce it, but it does. It makes pyruvate, which is a protein sugar from proteins. And that is so efficient that when the body uses glucagon to combine to make a glycogen, the pyruvate to make a glycogen, there is only 7 to 12% byproduct or 7 to 8% byproduct. Yeah, 7 to 8% advanced glycation byproduct. We can handle 12% in a day easily. So we don't store any advanced glycation end product. Not one molecule of advanced glycation end product. So we stay younger and fluid. We don't dry out and harden inside. So carbohydrates are not something that we really need. Apes eat very little carbohydrate, mainly what they get out of the vegetable juice when they chew the leaves and spit out the pulp. They eat bananas that are unripe. Very little carbohydrate in that. Lots of enzymes, very few, very little carbohydrate. Lots of starches. And that helps them be calm and relaxed. Starches in the human body are very important to bind with, for psychotropic chemicals. And you go through a trauma or anxiety or anger, any kind of an emotional trauma.

You produce hormones during that period to release that kind of energy. And that causes physiological changes, which incorporates all of these toxins that remain. And all those toxins store just like any other toxin. And if you want to know a lot about them thoroughly, I could go into it, but I'm not going to. You can look on the internet for Elnora Van Winkle. Two words, Van Winkle, W-I-N-K-L-E, E-L-N-O-R-A, and look for the biology of emotions. Now she's done a technical paper and a layman's paper. And she shows, she was responsible for all of the cataloging, for the identification and cataloging of every chemical in the brain and nervous system. She worked at Milhouse Laboratories in Columbia University and cataloged for 47 to 50 years. That was her whole life. She went on the diet and said it was the best thing she ever did. And then two years later, she got turned on to Instincto diet, which is 60% carbohydrates and sugars. She liked the idea of you eat it if it appealed to you. So she was into lots of sugars and she died a year later. Because the sugars, she was skinny anyway. You know, and I helped her put on about 18 pounds, and I mean, she was as skinny as Twiggy. And then when she put on the 18 pounds, she was better. But when she went back on to the Instincto, or went on to the Instincto diet, then 60% of her diet was sweet fruit, ripe fruit. It just disintegrated her and she was dead in a year. So those sugars are a problem. But anyway, she found that in people who exhibited anxiety and depression, when there was nothing in their life happening to cause it, she found high levels of those byproducts, those psychotropic hormones, waste products, in the blood. So she said there were several ways to release it. She found it on the diet with the cooked starch and the raw fat. It helped to pull it out of the body. And that's why when I, in the first writing of We Want to Live, I had people eat cooked starch and raw fat. However, over the next seven years, before I rewrote the book and presented the edition of 2005, I found that when I looked in the eyes of people who would take it to an extreme, they'd say, oh, I can eat bread and butter. I can eat baked potato and butter. So they start doing it every day instead of when they, just when they need it. I found that they were storing a lot of advanced glycation products in acrylamides in the intestines. So I needed to find a raw way to handle that. So I came up with somebody else's help with the nut formula. Now, the reason we didn't, mainly when we eat nuts, we digest the starches in them, not the protein and not the fat. Very difficult for us to digest those two things in nuts. We don't have a long digestive tract. An herbivore has a digestive tract 30 times the length of its torso, has two to four stomachs in sub-compartments of those stomachs. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule than we do, and it takes 48 hours for food to pass through their entire system.

They will chew, regurgitate, chew it again, swallow, regurgitate, chew it again, swallow, sometimes seven times. So it's a very complex digestive tract required for digesting vegetation. We don't have it. We have a digestive tract two and a half times less than that. We have one stomach that has two compartments. Takes 24 hours for food to move from the mouth to the anus through our bodies and not 48. So we don't handle it well. So for us to eat a cooked starch, or any kind of a starch, it will cause problems in our system. Nuts are the same way. It takes a squirrel or a bird or a vegetarian animal to digest a nut to get the fats and the proteins. We as human beings can't do it, but we can get the starch out of it. So I was out to get the starch because the starch would combine, would bind with the psychotropic hormones that would float in our systems from trauma, whether present or past and detoxifying. So the nut formula, I needed to find a way to neutralize the phytic acid in it that's in any seeds and nuts, beans, that prevents certain minerals in our bodies from being utilized, prevents proteins from being processed and utilized, and basically makes us protein deficient and interferes with digestion tremendously. And those minerals are high that it blocks in the digestive tract. So when I combined egg, honey, and butter or some other fat with the nuts, put the, made the, blended the nuts until they became a flour, and then added those other ingredients, it neutralized the phytic acid, still don't digest the fats or the protein from the nuts, but we do get the carbohydrates from it. And the butter and the honey and the egg also help the digestion and utilization and the arresting of those hormones. So the combination works for 99% of the people. So like I say in the present edition of We Want to Live, the primal diet on the cover, I say try the nut formula, it doesn't work for 10 days, then you eat a cooked starch and a little of it with lots of raw fat, but try the nut formula first. And if it doesn't work for you this time, after you're on the diet for a while, three or four months, try the nut formula again for a couple of weeks. It only takes one a week to keep up with that kind of toxicity unless you're under a lot of stress and emotionally wrought, then you may need it every other day or half of one every other day. So you can experiment with it, but don't eat one every day. It causes a neurological detoxification. It can throw you into the thing that you're trying to ease and prevent from causing too much stress in your life. It can cause the very detoxification that makes your life miserable emotionally and psychologically. So be discreet with that. There's somebody over here that's violated that. I know, every day. So be careful with the nut formula. That's the only thing you have to really be careful for. But eat a balanced diet. Now we're going to get into what is a balanced diet. Now what I found is you have to look at what the body is doing. That's how we determine what is a balanced diet.

So when I analyze the body, find out in the morning that the bloodstream is highly acidic. People have a tendency to have lethargy, fatigue, irritability, unwillingness to want to mix, most people when they wake in the morning. It's a high acrid bloodstream. Acrid means acidic. Eat a vegetable juice with high greens in it. Not too much chlorophyll because that can be too much. Celery juice is a very good juice as your base. Now celery does not have enough carbohydrates even to digest celery. So it's a negative. It's a minus carbohydrate food. Now we put some parsley or comfrey in there. And what happens? It raises the sugar level to a small amount, no more than 5% of the juice. If you've got a bile problem, some liver problems, you might want to throw 5-10% carrot in there. And you need that much extra sugar because you need a 5% higher ratio than the average person. So you need a 10% carbohydrate level rather than a 5% carbohydrate level. People with diabetes need a little bit more carbohydrate so they could put that little bit of extra of carrot juice in their juice. I rarely use carrot juice, even though I was diabetic. I use celery, zucchini, parsley, or comfrey, or cucumber. And those are low carbohydrate level foods because I like to keep my carbohydrate very low. And I like my fruit meal in the afternoon every two days. So I don't want to give that up. So I'll eat lower carbohydrate all the time so I can have a fruit meal once every other day. Now I recommend that most people eat a fruit meal every day once a day because they need more carbohydrates. I've been doing this a long time. I don't need many carbohydrates anymore. I have plenty of energy. If I have too much carbohydrates, I'm wired. I remember in Chicago, I mean in Omaha a few weeks ago, you know, I had had a whole papaya instead of a half of a papaya. And it rained that night so the ions were full in the air. I had so much energy. I worked all night and I had a full day of consults to do. I had just done, you know, the workshop like this all day long. And then I had a full day from 8 o'clock in the morning or 8.15 in the morning till 11 o'clock at night, 11.30. And I said, you got to go to sleep. You know, this is, you know, all this energy is good, but I need to take a nap. So I took a two-hour nap, made it through the day wonderfully, you know. But having too much carbohydrate can cause your body to throw it out of balance. So you have to find your level. Now what I suggest isn't always perfect, but it's very, very close. So you find your own level, you just work with it. And it changes from day to day sometimes. But if you stay on a rigid schedule, you will always stay more balanced than not. Don't ever play with it too much, just a little bit. So you have a vegetable juice the first thing in the morning. And if you want guidelines on how much, pick up the recipe book and look and it tells you your size and all of that, how much it recommends for you. Then about 45, 50 minutes later, eat a meat meal.

Now this is the most important meal of your day. Why? Because whatever you eat at this meal is going to start the basis for what runs your brain and nervous system for the entire day. The first six to seven hours that you're awake is crucial to that, to what you use as fuel for your brain and nervous system. But that first meal will help balance you. If you go have a fruit or lots of carrot juice or some high carbohydrate food in the morning, your body's going to have all those advanced glycation end products, even if you're eating all raw, it's going to have all those advanced glycation end products and make your brain and nervous system and your bloodstream and your lymphatic system all sticky. So you're going to be sluggish for the whole day. If you eat a meat meal, you're going to get all the protein to make what? The pyruvate protein sugar and with the glucagon that forms the proper glycogen for the brain and nervous system without all that sticky toxin advanced glycation end product, which are called AGEs. So always have a piece of, I mean you have about a tablespoon to two, tablespoon and a half to two tablespoons of butter with every meat meal. The reason for that is if your body's lacking fat and you don't eat fat with that meat meal, your body's going to make that fat into a, I mean that protein into an acetate. Your body can turn anything into a fat, it can take a carbohydrate, turn it into a fat, not a well-utilizing one for energy, but it can turn it into an acetate, an acetone, a fat that we use for energy. However, a fat, an acetone made from carbohydrate or protein only has a small amount of energy ability to produce fat that is from fats that the animals have made, and animal fat is two and a half times more energy per calorie than an acetone and acetates that are made from carbohydrates or protein. So those are very inefficient fats. So your body can take protein and make it into a fat also, an acetate, lots of acetates than acetones, so again, it won't be high energy producing. So why waste your meat that way? You want it to be made into hormones and building blocks for reproducing cells. You want to grow stronger. So you eat butter with it, and supplying the butter with it, and honey if you like, allows your body to use the butter as the fuel and keep the meat for building your body and strengthening it to heal itself and to grow for children and for you to even grow, no matter what age you are. So that, you know, you can always have honey with any meal if you have digestive problems, it'll help digest. Honey is basically the, you know, the female fluid of a flower. And the bees eat that, they swallow it, they produce an enzyme that's very similar to insulin and hormones that are very similar to insulin, and then we get back to the hive, they vomit. And that's what honey is, bee vomit, delicious bee vomit. So, and again, if you think about that, oh, it's been in the stomach and it's bacteria and all this, you can become paranoid. Honey is an incredible substance.

Why do you think that they're bombing the place and making the bees go away? Because honey, even a Navy doctor in Costa Rica found in the mid-70s that any kind of a wound or injury or disease that they treated with honey healed three to five times faster. This was a Navy medical doctor in Costa Rica in the 70s, reported this. You know how much publicity it got? It got one paragraph in the L.A. Times, but in the L.A. Weekly, which is a little bit more progressive paper, they gave it a whole page. And a page that papers about like this per page, not like a newspaper, but smaller paper. So it gave it a whole page, and it went into the research and the giving some of the examples and using honey and not using honey for the same kind of injuries or disease and how well it changed with the honey. So why are the honeybees dying now? Good old chemo, I mean chemtrails, they're bombing the military poisons on us, and all of the cell phone towers, they emit so much radiation that they're getting weak from not finding their way back to the hives, and they're dying, and the pollution from the chemtrails, the military poisons they're dumping. Now that seems to exist only with the bees that are being fed syrup, because most of your beekeepers will take all of the honey from the bees and then give them sugar, corn syrup for the winter. They get weak, they don't do well. Those are the bees that seem to be most harmed. My beekeeper doesn't have any change, and he lets them only have honey. They get honey all year round, even in the winter. He doesn't take everything from them, so those bees stay very healthy, but they are intending for you not to have something that will allow you to get well quickly. They want to eliminate the honey crops and get rid of the bees. So honey is a phenomenal thing, a phenomenal food for us. Even in the Bible, if you believe in the Bible, the land of milk and honey, and it even has some excerpts in there where it talks about butter and honey together. And this is stuff that I experimented with, came up with, and didn't even know. I didn't read the Bible at that time, you know. But some people who had read the Bible and came back and said, look, this is in there, honey and butter, milk and honey, you know, should be our basis for living a life, livelihood. So honey is a very important food. You can have it with anything to help digestion and help healing. After that meat meal, you wait two to three hours, you can have some milk in between. It's always good to have milk in between. Not much water. We'll get into that in a few minutes. And about two, three hours later, have a milkshake.

Now that calms the body. Now milkshake does not mean fruit in it. That's a smoothie. But egg, milk, dairy cream, coconut cream and a little honey or a lot of honey. If you're a person that needs a lot of honey, it's poor digestion. And then quantities, it'll give you examples in the recipe book on how much to have for your size and weight. Then after a milkshake, you let two to three hours pass and you have another vegetable juice. And again, low in carbs, the same vegetable juice. And then what? You're six to seven hours over that period now. So now you don't have to be as concerned about a high carbohydrate level. I mean, if you go out and pig down on a lot of fruits, you're going to affect that and you're going to create a lot of sugar that needs to be utilized and burned right away. You'll be hyperactive like most fruitarians are, and you have to burn it off in physical activity or emotional anxiety. And that's a choice for everybody to make, anxiety or activity. How do you want to release that excess energy that you have? Anxiety or energy? Well, if you choose the anxiety, you're not going to have very good relationships. Activity, your body may get a little tired, but still you have relationships. So choose it from that perspective. So you have another vegetable juice, then guess what? If you're diabetic or you have a blood sugar problem, eat another meat meal. Let's say your person is supposed to have a pound of meat a day. If you've got a blood sugar problem like diabetes, then you'd split your pound of meat up into three portions a day, which is about almost three quarters of a cup, three times a day. Depending upon, you know, the weight of the meat, it could be a cup. If you ground the meat, it's like three cups a day, a cup at a time to make a pound. When you grind meat, it swells, so there's a lot more volume to it. So three cups will make a pound if it's ground meat. So have another meat meal at that time. If you don't have a sugar problem, if you're normally a medium to high-energy person, then you only have two meat meals. What you'll have next, no matter what you are, you have your fruit meal next. It's always best to use unripe fruit. Ripe fruit has more sugar in it. You don't need that concentrated amount of sugar, and you always want to eat fat with it. Now, this is a good time to cleanse. The morning determines how your body will run for the day. Evening is how you will rest for the night. So if you eat fruit in the evening, you're likely not to sleep well, because your body's going to go into detoxification. It's always best to eat the fruit in the afternoon. So by the time night comes, you know, anywhere around eight, nine o'clock, even in the winter, when it gets dark earlier, your body will be finished, that detoxification with that fruit. Now, how does fruit become cleansing? How is it detoxifying?

It has carbohydrates in it that turn alcoholic in the stomach, and the body uses fats and alcohol together to make soaps, exactly what viruses are, only viruses have a concentrated amount of protein in them, but they are solvents, they are soaps, they are body soaps made by the individual cells. That's what I'm going to go into next after we get through this diet. So eat a small amount of fruit, eat lots of fat. If you want the best fat, coconut cream is it for cleansing. If I take a lid like this and I remove this enamel, this painted enamel that's on top of this, and I put a patch of butter, a patch of olive oil, a patch of coconut cream, a patch of flax oil on there, and dairy cream. All those others will take hours, days, a week to start dissolving that metal. Coconut cream can do it in an hour as long as that enamel, the painted enamel on here is removed, that sealer. And that sealer gets into your food, so it's always better to have a white bottom. This isn't a white bottom. Your ball jars all have white enamel on them. It's a plastic enamel, but it's not like this is. This stuff gets into your food within a week of using it. So it's always better to get the white enamel tops. I don't know if there's any here. I know that this has, this is sealed all the way over with that kind of enamel. And you'll notice that your lids do not, like this one, see this one's got the white lid. And you'll notice that these don't rust as quickly as the ones that don't have the white enameled sealer on it, on them. So it's always, now ball, all ball jars, ball lids are all sealed on top, all have the white sealing. Kerr, they have, they don't have that. They don't have the patent on it, yet if you call Kerr, they say, oh, we use the same thing on it. Hello? The chemical structure of that compared to the white, I mean, you have to be an idiot to believe that. And some people believe it, and some people are idiots. So if you have any idea about chemistry, you don't look at one and say, oh, that's the same, when they have nothing to do with the same chemistry and development. So have a, have coconut cream, could be the main fat at that time, anywhere from three to seven tablespoons, depending upon your size. Only a little butter is necessary, maybe a teaspoon, maybe a tablespoon if you're eating a lot of coconut cream, and you're a big person, a big guy or a big girl, and I mean this way or this way, doesn't matter. The bigger you are, the more coconut cream you need and can handle. And then a little bit of dairy cream. You need those animal fats to protect you from the toxins that that coconut cream is going to dissolve and arrest. You need that protection. So eat a little bit of the animal fats along with that. You don't need honey unless you want it, unless you have problem digesting. So eat that somewhere between 1.30 and 4.30. Then let two, three hours pass. 

That's usually going to be a heavy meal for most people who've been on, who've done the diet for at least 30 days. First 30 days you can be famished and just pig out and pig out and pig out and pig out. Some people won't have that effect on them, but a lot of people it does. And then after 30 days, everything calms and then things digest slower, especially if they have a lot of coconut cream in it. So wait a good two to three hours after that fruit meal and have another vegetable juice. If after the vegetable juice, you can have a, you know, four ounces to 12 ounces, 16 ounces, depends upon your size. But if you can't eat meat and you feel like you can't digest for another three hours, four hours after that, then cut out the vegetable juice or cut it down for the next day. And the next day, probably for a week, then try the higher amount again the next week. If you have problems digesting that evening with your next meal, which is a meat meal, then just cut out the juice altogether, unless you become too acidic. So your mouth is getting burning or getting sores on it, the tongue. That means you're getting too acidic and you need more vegetable juice. So then have the next as a meat meal. You could wait an hour and a half, two hours after your vegetable juice to have that second or third of your last meat meals of the day. And again, you want at least a tablespoon and a half to two tablespoons of butter with that. Then the evening before you go to bed, if that doesn't fall at bedtime, have some milk or another milkshake. If it's a milkshake, have half of it then and half of it during the night. Remember I talked about don't go five hours without eating? Well, wake and then have some kind of food during the night. Now the lubrication, the moisturizing lubrication formula is one of the most important formulas that I have. I needed, even on this diet, people's skin was drying out. Eating all this fat, can you imagine skin drying? All of this fat, yeah, it was happening on at least 50% of my patients. And the other 50%, you know, was fine. But on 50% of them, it did not get to the skin. There was like an orphanage, you know, the big, stronger kids who were closest to the food ate all and most of it. And then the weak kids behind got the, you know, the stragglers got a little less food and smaller amounts, you know, ate less often and less food. So they stayed weak. The body is the same way. The organs and the glands are going to take all that fat they've been starved with for all of those years. And like me, if you had chemotherapy and a lot of drugs and vaccines, you're going to be dry for 20 years. I mean, I had to eat tremendous amounts of fat and have that moisturizing formula for about 22 years. For the last three years, I haven't had to have it as often. But I had to eat it every day or else my skin dried. And my hair got very dry. So that lubrication formula is a very important substance.

It helps the body digest the fat so rapidly that the glands and organs can't consume it as quickly as it spreads to every area of the body. So it gets to the bones, it gets to the connective tissue, it gets to the skin, it gets to the lymph system. Thoroughly from the outside, from extra-tissually. So that's what we want. And that formula is the only one I know that can do it. And that's egg, butter, preferably butter. You can use another fat, but preferably butter. Lemon, and just a tiny bit of honey. Now it gives that formula in the recipe book and refers to it in We Want to Live. And in the recipe book, it's called the moisturizing lubrication formula. The reason I made it a complicated name, because women are really turned on by moisturizing, and men are really turned on by lubrication. So, you know, so that's why I make it. I want it appealing to both because it's a very important formula. It tastes like lemon meringue drink. And if you like lemon meringue, you're going to love that drink. If you hate lemon meringue, you'll get used to it. So that's the best lubrication thing, and I advise everybody to have it every day. And if you have problems digesting a lot at once, it makes you nauseous, then I suggest you split it up into three times a day or two times a day. You're going to have half of it with each meat meal. That would be your butter. Instead of having a tablespoon, tablespoon and a half, or two tablespoons of butter, you have your moisturizing lubrication formula. And that takes care of it with your meat meal. So you'd have half of the lubrication, moisturizing lubrication formula with each meat meal, or you could cut it into three. Have a third with each meat meal, if you're having two meat meals a day. And then a third during the night, to make sure you stay supple and things stay lubricated, and you're not going 12 hours where the skin may get deficient. And that's a much more sound approach. And it's a little bit easier to digest that way. But for those people who love lemon meringue, when they get a hold of that drink, they have to often just chug it down. That's a heavy, still, even though you got the lemon in there, the liver doesn't have to work as hard with the lemon. That's why the liver can process it quickly with the bile and get it into the system rapidly. The lemon juice helps break down that fat. Now, cream is a very difficult fat to break down. The liver has to make three times more enzymes to utilize cream as fat. But that cream is the only thing that can completely soothe and nurture and protect the nervous system and brain. Cream is very important for that. If you find yourself hyperactive and anxious, go drink two, three ounces of cream, half a cup a cup if you're going crazy, and you'll calm down pretty quickly, even though it takes a long time to digest.

So butter is very simple, and it's even simpler when it's mixed with the egg and lemon juice. Cream is very difficult, so that should be sparingly used. And I've also observed that people who have poor digestion and that they mix cream with meat, the meat comes out in their feces undigested and coated like it has a pearlized finish on it. So it coats it. People aren't digesting their meat. So if you see that in your feces, do not have cream with your meat unless it's in a sauce like with onion that helps break it down a little quicker. And I have 82 sauces that can be made in three to five different ways each in this recipe book. So that's about 400 sauces, plenty of sauces. And you find the ones that you like and that you digest best with. So if you have trouble with meat, go ahead, down it. Now, I usually eat meat like children. I like my meat, empty meat they call it. I don't know why children have that thought about empty meat. It means you don't have anything with it, it's just plain. Ninety percent, 99% of the meat I eat is plain. I just eat my meat and then have my butter and honey with or following it but not as a sauce. But about every two and a half months, I get bored out of my mind with the meat and I can't stand taking another bite of it without a sauce. So I'll make a sauce and I'll use it for three or four days and then I don't want it for another two and a half, three months. So just go with the flow but make it work for you. However, I know that when I eat a sauce with my meat, I can sure put down a lot of it quickly. Very quickly because it just slides down, you know. So be careful and if you have problems digesting, be careful how much a sauce that you pick if it has too much cream in it for your particular system, your particular body. Now let's get into this bacteria, well let me do the salt and the water first, okay. It's a very bad thing to drink water but you're told that you drink at least eight glasses a day, right? When did they start saying drink eight glasses of water a day? Remember in the 50s and 60s, you went to the fountain at school and you took three sips a day, that's all. You drank milk when you got home, if your parents were not very conscious they were feeding you soda pop, you know 7 Up or RC Cola or something like that instead of milk. And you never drank water except for a sip here and there at school. And then all of a sudden they started bottling water in 62, a year later eight glasses a day, eight glasses a day, eight glasses a day. Marketing, again marketing, it's about buying their bottled water, it's got nothing to do with your health. The only animals that do well like I said are camels, elephants and birds that can drink a lot of water. And the elephant doesn't have to drink water for 30 days, it can drink 55 gallons and never touch water again for 55 days. It has a system that only lets a little bit of the water out every day, a very small amount. If we had a gallon a day, that's about what they use, a gallon in a day, gallon and a half. So 55 gallons will keep them 30 days.

The camel can drink 25 gallons, 22 to 25 gallons at a time and they won't need water for 20, 30 days. Different animals, different creatures. Birds they need a lot of water because they eat a lot of dried seed. We eat everything with fluids in them, lots of water. Milk 82% water, fruit 90% water, meat 55% water. All of these things have water until you cook them, cook out the water and you don't utilize you don't have this combination of minerals and vitamins to utilize the water in its proper form. So it causes dehydration. You want more water and more water. So the more water you drink, the more water you need. And if you look at an archeological book, what is the first thing under solvent on the earth? Water. When it rains, the rain dissolves rock, the earth, plants get to eat. It's a solvent. It dissolves the stuff in the body. It does not belong in the human body. It leaches from your digestive tract, it'll break down your mucous lining, it'll cause all kinds of problems. Now do we need any water? Some of us do. We have so many toxins in the body, we need some solvent to help dissolve it, but usually no more than a half a cup. If you're a small person, no more than three cups if you're a larger person. You need milk. You need tomatoes. You need foods that have low carbohydrate and high mineral and vitamin content. You need foods with nutrients. If you have to juice a cucumber and blend some tomato in it, it's one of the best drinks there is. A lot of my athletes mix that one. What I tell them to do is they make two quarts a day. Can you imagine these people exercising six to seven hours a day and living on two quarts of fluid a day? McEnroe would go through two and a half gallons a day just for his sports time and then drink more water off the court. All these athletes drink tremendous amounts of water, but they dry out and become brittle and then they lose their ability to be athletes. So you want foods that have lots of nutrients in it. So one person who's a runner only drinks one quart a day. And it's about a third cucumber juice, a third blended tomato, about a half a teaspoon of vinegar, about two tablespoons of honey, about four tablespoons of coconut cream, two tablespoons of dairy cream. Provides everything you need for good fuel and cooling the body so you don't have to perspire as much. You don't need as much fluid and it works tremendously. I mean, that girl who's six foot tall and big, she's about 160 pounds, six foot, that's not that big. But for a woman who's a model, that's a big girl when you compare to her when she was skinny and thin. And she only drinks two quarts of that a day. And that takes care of all fluid needs besides a quarter, quart and a half of milk a day. Get all your fluids from your foods. You don't need them from a solvent that's going to damage your body. You need nutrients with your H2O. Not H2O is going to dissolve and irritate your body and system. Okay, how much water have I had? I've had three ounces of water in the past month.

Three ounces of water in the past month, that's all the water I've had. I'll drink two quarts of milk a day. I don't eat much fruit and that's all I need. Two quarts of milk a day, sometimes a little bit more than two quarts. And here you see how little I've gone to, I came here with this and you know when yacking people expel a lot of fluids out the mouth, a lot of evaporation of H2O. But this is all I've had to drink in that whole time. And three eggs. And I'm not dehydrated. I'm getting a little cakey up here from the eggs but you know, but I'm not getting cotton mouth and not having a problem. So foods that are foods that have nutrient in it, water is not a food. It's food for the earth to feed the plants but not for us to dissolve the rock, the earth. Salt. Boy, what a misconception about salt. You take a look at Vilhjalmur Stefansson's work, you know, in Alaska with the Eskimos. They went, you know, years without salt and that was the thing, he loved salt. He dreamed of salt every time he ate that raw meat, especially when it was high. Because the Eskimos will fish and they keep a lot of meat and when it gets a few weeks old it's pretty rank and stinky. And he said, once you're eating that you realize that the bacteria has broken it down and it gives you a lot more energy and you prefer the rotten stuff, the rotten stinky stuff, so-called rotten stinky stuff, to the fresh stuff. Because you feel better, you have more strength, you can deal with the cold better in the Arctic like that. So the high meat was preferable, the stinky fish was preferable over the other. And he said salt, when he finally got the salt six months later, he ate it and he got sick from it. He loved it during the meal, but he got very sick from it. And he said, I don't need salt, and that was it. And this is an archeologist working for the U.S. government, mainly military, giving them information on diets and the Eskimos. And he wrote a book called, Cancer, Disease of Civilization?, and it goes into a lot about the Eskimos and their raw meats and how they developed. But you know, they cook a lot now, even the primitive ones, because the Germans brought in cauldrons that they can cook in. Before cauldrons, there was no way to cook out in the Arctic. This is no way. You could keep a fire going to cook anything. There was no vessel that wouldn't break. So there was no cooking until the late 1800s, mid-1800s, when the Germans brought cauldrons to Alaska. The first dental caries among the Eskimos was 1886, first cavity. And that was in a man who had lived in the German and British colony there in Alaska, eating their breads and sugars and their cakes for 50 years before he got a cavity. The first case of cancer was in 1936. It's a civilization that has lived 100 years in an Arctic environment, eating raw meat.

No cancer, no cavities. Pretty amazing. How many of you would let your babies crawl butt-naked on ice, roll around on an ice floor? You'd be absolutely terrified out of your gourds. You'd be absolutely insane with fear. And that's what these Eskimos kids do, butt-naked, rolling around on an igloo floor, ice, ice, naked, a few days old, rolling around on an ice floor. I'd say that's pretty freaking healthy. So you have to take a look at all of these things, everything you're afraid of, everywhere you've been and where you're going, and make smart choices from now on. Don't listen to the media. Don't listen to the medical profession. Don't listen to the FDA and the USDA. Don't listen to any of them. Listen to your body. Listen to common sense, because they make none. If you ask them for the science, they will spout out incoherent babble. And I've caught them many times. Oh, you'll get parasites from all that meat. You're going to get a brain fluke. Well, show me the research. Show me the tests that do that. Well, I don't know of any, but I'm sure they've been done. Show them to me. Go find them. I looked. I couldn't find any. Not one university fed animals parasite-infested meat or raw meat to see if they got parasites. Their test has never been done. I did them, but they didn't do them. And then the tests that I do with the animals, I fed them lots of parasitically infested meat, and none of them got parasites. And I used 12 to 16-year-old animals that were feeble and old because I wanted to know if old people, like they say, are more in danger, you know, children and old people were more in danger of death from bacterial and parasitical, you know, invasion. And if you read any of those raw milk warnings, they say pregnant women and children and elderly people are more subjected to disease from raw milk. Hello, where did you do this research? Show me that old people and young people and pregnant women would have a problem. It doesn't exist. In fact, you can find research that shows just the opposite. The children who were sick thrived. St. Paul's Hospital, you know, right in Chicago in the 20s and 30s, a particular doctor said, you know, we have a very high rate of infant mortality in this hospital. We're going to change it all to drinking raw milk. They went from like 83 to 85 average a year down to 5 or 6, 4 for the next succeeding years. And then in 1947, they outlawed it. No feeding infants raw milk anymore, anywhere, and no doctor could prescribe it. Why? Because the science showed that it was bad? Nope, because the food industry wanted to package things and keep things a shelf longer and make a lot more money and force people to buy their products. Simple mathematics. That's what it was and is.

So bacteria is a big worry for everybody. But like I said, when I talked about the dentine on the teeth, bacteria results as a janitor to clean up the system. It is not the problem of disease. It didn't damage the tissue. They don't cause disease, although they're called pathogenic. They do not cause disease. Contamination, chemicals in the body cause damaged tissue. Bacteria result as janitors. Do you go around blaming the janitors for all the mess from the party? They didn't create the mess, they're just there cleaning it up. So you don't look at it that way. Parasites, they're the best of all. Why? Because they can eat 100 times their weight in 24 hours. And the amount of excretion and secretion is about 1 to 2%. Can you imagine eating 100 pounds of food in a day and having a 1 to 2 bound bowel movement the next day? That's pretty efficient. I want a tapeworm in there eating all the garbage in my body. Give me the parasites. But I had been so poisoned with chemotherapy and radiation, it took me 38 years before I was able to get a parasite. And boy was I happy when I got that tapeworm. And I made them, I created them by mixing certain foods to force it. And then what happened? I was in Hanoi, you know, after this, I had hives all over the place. And I got this, you know, so I had to deal with all of that, the hives from that mixture that I took. And I had to go on the plane, go into the bathroom, and I had, you know, refrigerated tomato slices and cucumber slices. And I'd go into the bathroom, strip down. I had the hives from here to here all over the back from that mixture of fermented milk and maca powder, which is a root that acts like. And I was a cereal eater, that's why I did it, lots of cereal with, you know, two boxes a day. If I eat sugar crisp, four tablespoons of sugar with my sugar crisp, and it's already heavily sweetened. It wasn't as bad as Hitler. I didn't put four tablespoons of sugar per wine glass and put sugar on top of icing this thick like he did. He'd pour a whole cup of sugar on top of a cake that was full of icing that was that thick. No wonder he had a, he was a basket case, you know. But the Bush family was responsible for financing him. The Bush family financed him. Prescott Bush ran a bank that financed Hitler. And you want to look that up, do. So in fact, the father to Prescott Bush, great great grandfather, he also was involved in the Nazi party. And helped, you know, do the Reichstag and all that and set that up. Basically Hitler was a nobody, an idiot, he was a house painter. You cannot get a man like that in office and power without a lot of money and press behind him. There is no way. He was a puppet, a crazy puppet, and that's just what they wanted, a person who was out of his mind. So that's what they did, they manipulated him.

And the Attorney General of the United States investigated and found out and closed the bank down. Prescott Bush says, okay, you stepped on the wrong toes this time. My son's going to become a very powerful man in this country, and that's George Bush Senior. He was the head of CIA for 30 years, you can't get more powerful than that. You can kill presidents, you can do anything. You can invade countries, you can traffic cocaine, you can do anything you want because they have an unlimited secret budget and they don't have to tell you a thing. So that's how powerful the Bush family is and they're in with the Rothschilds and the Rockefellers and all of those big powerful people. And the Bush legacy goes a long way and if you don't believe me, just research it. There's documentation, records kept on it. So we have another maniac in office putting us in war. And what do they gain from it? The Bush family owns the Carlyle Group. Do you know what the Carlyle Group, how the Carlyle Group makes billions of dollars a year? It sells war weapons. For every tank it sells to Iraq, and they sell to Iraq, they make $3 million. For every gun, they make $1,000. And as they're arming every military body in every country, the Carlyle Group is making a fortune. So it is good business to stay in war. So it behooves the Bushes to stay in war. That's why every time a Bush gets in office, we go to war. So we have to take a look at what's going on in the world in all ways and know how we're being manipulated. Okay, salt. What happens to salt in the body? Molecules clump together. Sodium is one of the largest molecules there is. We have of all the mineral elements. And when you have a salt come into the body as rock salt, as dried salt, four to five molecules attached together, a very large substance. So normally, minerals in the body will be many fold. You may have one sodium molecule to maybe 10 of calcium, five of magnesium, couple of potassium and sulfur and phosphorus. All these other minerals in a complete smorgasbord environment of food, of nutrients for a cell. And when a cell goes to eat, the cell opens and there's one or two molecules in there and it attracts the food in and the cell eats. When the molecules are clumped from salt, it can't get into the cell to eat. So it rips the ion molecules, the ions out of the cell so the cell can never again eat. And that cell will shrivel like a grape to a raisin and that's it, it's dead. So one little bitty grain of salt can kill one million red blood cells. It can fit on a pinhead. But when you have a lot of salt, take a shake of salt, you're killing about 100 million red blood cells. Sure, that'll fit in just a, you know, just a small part the size of a BB. But you're still destroying that many cells. You're also causing dehydration in the system because the H2O cannot be utilized properly. The sodium molecules hold on to a lot of the H2O. So it's floating in serum and not absorbed into the cell.

It hangs on to that, those large molecules of salt. So salt is bad in any form. There's a lot of information out there about ketones. That's drinking ocean water. And this guy claims that he lives a long time and he's doing great on drinking diluted ocean water. Well, look at the records on ocean water. The reports go back to the time of Galileo. People who were in the ships drinking just a tablespoon or less of seawater, ocean water a day to keep from getting dehydrated would go insane. Those that refused to drink it and would just take their ration of one tablespoon of fresh water or rainwater a day never went insane. It disturbs the fluid balance in the brain and nervous system. Salt is not a good substance to use. Now I say in my book, some people need a little bit of salt, only if you have adrenal exhaustion. And adrenal exhaustion means you can't even get out of the bed to move. You need salt. Or if you've been a vegetarian a very long time, maybe 30 years, and you've got adrenal exhaustion on top of that and you've got all kinds of psychological problems, three, four grains of salt a week is all that's necessary to help bring that level up a bit. So salt is a medicine in a very limited situation. Very small perspective. Okay. Back to bacteria. Now I talked about the parasites eating a hundred times their weight in 24 hours, having one to two percent fecal release the next day, which are called verotoxins, verotoxins. And bacteria eats about 50 times its weight in 24 hours and it has about two to five percent waste product, which also feeds our body. It's not a verotoxin again. So that's pretty efficient, isn't it? I want bacteria and I want parasites to clean my system. They're very efficient janitors. It's like taking a vacuum cleaner and sucking everything up. But what if you got a janitor that went in with a tub of cleansing water and you had dust and dirt all over and he just diluted everything with the water in the compound so you got mud all over the place. That's basically what happens with virus. Virus are not alive. They are protein structure that has no nucleus and it has no respiratory system. It is a structure that basically breaks down tissue just like a solvent we have to clean the grease off of the garage floor leaked from the car. You put that on there and what do you have at the end? You've got what? A gallon, a gallon and a half, two gallons of water with grease in the solvent. Nothing's reduced. None of that poison, none of that toxin is reduced. It is spread out in this fluid so you've got this toxic fluid that's all over the body. Viruses are made in the cells, made in the cells. Like I say, you don't say that laundry soap is contagious because you find it in all the laundry rooms in Chicago and that's basically how virus should be presented.

They are soaps, they are solvents. When they dissolve something, it takes a lot of dissolution, it takes a lot of fluid, a lot of H2O and then your body has to neutralize that and remove it from the body, sweat it out and that is very toxic substances. Cause allergies, all kinds of problems. You notice when they talk about meningitis, whether it's spinal or cerebral, the doctors are not afraid of bacterial meningitis because there's not a great deal of swelling. But in viral meningitis, a massive amount of swelling because of all this diluted toxic solvent and tissue that is in the body causing massive swelling that causes ripping in the brain and nervous system and can cause coma and lesions and strokes. So they're very afraid of viral meningitis for that reason. So we want bacteria, we want parasites. We can't use bacteria and parasites or fungus. Fungus does the same thing. A little bit more fluids are needed with that. You have a lot more waste product as a result when mycelium from the fungus does its job. There's a creamy dissolved substance not as diluted as water but thick as cream and it holds the substances a little bit better, a lot better than water does because water makes everything, you know, it's like you have a hot sauce and you drink water, it makes it worse because water takes the mucus off of the tongue and off of the throat. So then your tongue and throat are more exposed to the pepper, the hot sauce, whatever it is you're eating. So that's what happens with water but the mycelium which is a milky substance which dissolves tissue which is fungus, it's mold, it's whatever you want to call it but it's of the fungus family, is a milky substance that's a little bit heavier in weight and does not cause as much damage as water concentrated. So the best choice is parasites, the next best is bacteria, the next best is fungus. After that, if any part of the tissue is so contaminated with toxins that it will kill any bacteria, parasites or fungus that eats that tissue, the only thing left is virus. So it's a highly toxic way to detoxify, a very brutal way to detoxify and with all of our antibacterials and penicillin and antibiotics and antibacterial sprays and soaps and even body soaps, antibacterial, hello, antibacterial body soaps, you have to take a look at that. The only thing left that can clear us and all the chemicals that are in our bodies, only thing left that can clean us is mainly virus. And virus is not contagious. Cells make it. When you spike a petri dish, a fertilized petri dish where cells can live, you put virus in it, not one more viral structure will be found even a week later under all the proper environments where cells grow. However, when you have cells in that, to that cell, toxic environment, because it is not like the blood, it is not like the tissues, it is what man has made that environment, but the cell can still reproduce and breathe and function in there. 

But it is relatively the same environment that creates a virus. So the only way the cell can clean itself, it can't use bacteria, it can't use parasites, because it is an artificial fertilized environment. So that cell will start making virus to clean itself, because that is its only option. And then the scientists say, see, it is contagious, as soon as you put cells in there with virus, they multiply. Hello? I mean, you have to really be stupid to come to that conclusion, or you have to be mean. And I think it's mean, because they know the truth. It's very obvious, if you experiment and see it, it's sinister, what they're doing. So enjoy bacteria, enjoy parasites, eat shit and live. I mean, that's how absurd you have to think about it. There are tribes that eat fecal matter that have no meat. So they go around to the cow patties and eat the cow patties, because the cow or the buffalo has predigested 75% of all those nutrients in that cow patty. So if they go eat it, we have the digestive tract to finish it. So then we can become semi-vegetarian. And there are tribes that thrive on that. And there are also tribes that thrive on the bugs grown in fecal matter. There's a beetle in Thailand that grows in the buffalo dung a few hours after it drops. And the beetle will lay eggs in there, or several beetles will lay eggs in there, and each one of them can drop about 300, 400 eggs. So you have about 1,000 insects, beetles, that come out of this fecal matter in about five days. So they go in there and hatch them before they can fly. And then they, sometimes they'll sauté them in water or eat them raw. And it's a good protein and nutrients if that's all you have. So you can't be squeamish about nature. You should be squeamish about all the soaps and all the antibacterials and all the chemicals in your environment. That's what you need to be alarmed with. That's what you need to be careful with. If you're eating dirt, hey, good. If you're eating a chemical solution, watch out. Okay. I think I've covered just about everything. Are there any questions? Yes? Okay.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Good. Okay. Cheese. Very, very important food for digestion and detoxification for handling toxicity. Now cheese, when it's raw, is not assimilated in the human body as a nutrient. It acts as a sponge, a magnet in the sponge. So as it passes, even in the mouth, down your throat, stomach, everywhere it passes, the minerals in it act as a magnet and will pull the poisons out of the neurological system, the blood and the lymph, as they weave their way through the intestinal tract and all the digestive tract, even in the throat. It will lock onto them and not release them. It passes out through the feces, undigested. The only way you can get raw cheese to digest is to eat honey at the same time in your mouth with it. And it is an excellent, excellent mineral supplement. You take, you know, you take a pill and it's a mineral supplement, oh, high calcium and magnesium. You're eating rock. Do you eat rock? Do we survive on rock? No. Rock is for plants to eat. Any kind of dried mine minerals is a fertilizer for plant, plants, not for us. We need it in a biological form. Cheese is an excellent, as long as you're eating it with honey. Release a tremendous concentration of minerals into the system. I've had people with their teeth falling out because there was gum rotted away. I didn't discover this until later, but cheese was one of the things that helped me and I discovered helped me. But when I was working with somebody, it's got the idea, well, eat lots and lots of cheese with honey and sure enough, he replaced the bone in about a month, bone in a month from eating cheese, you know, two tablespoons of cheese twice a day with two and a half teaspoons of honey after a meat meal, 30, 35 minutes after a meat meal and eating lots of cheese before everything he ate, just a little sugar cube sized amount to absorb the poisons that were using up his minerals and he was eating his bones to provide the minerals to attach with those toxins. So if you don't eat the honey with the cheese, it will act as that magnet, it'll use the minerals itself in the cheese to attract those poisons out so that you'll have your minerals that are already in your bones and in your food, your fresh food to be utilized intracellularly in your body. Cheese with honey also provides intracellular minerals, intracellularly utilizable minerals. Some of this stuff's tongue twisters and I actually got it out. Yes? Pardon?

Q: What about yogurt?

A: Okay. Yogurts, whenever you have a milk that's predigested, it's always a better thing because it will provide more protein, more carbohydrates, more fats. Predigested and you'll absorb them easier. Not a problem. You can even drink those things cold and because they're predigested, there's no problem. You drink cold milk fresh and it contracts the stomach. The stomach does not secrete hydrochloric acid and then the milk moves into the duodenum relatively undigested. What happens then? Casein and lactate and other elements get into the blood undigested and cause problems. So don't drink milk cold unless it's a few sips at a time to cool yourself. Few sips isn't going to cause the whole stomach to contract and shrink. No more than probably three, four tablespoons which is about two ounces at a time cold in the hot summer. But don't drink a half a cup or a whole cup. You're asking for trouble. Now I don't prefer kefir grains or yogurt grains for making milk because they are very different from the kefir grains and yogurt bacteria in your system. I like the fresh bacteria in milk. We've all put one to two tablespoons of honey per quart of milk and let that act as a starter to make kefir and yogurt. It usually takes, you know, if it's a warm house, anywhere from 24 to 48 hours after you put the honey in it. If you don't put the honey in it, you know, sometimes it just doesn't make kefir except for many, many days. And then all of a sudden when it goes, you have the curdling, you know, and you have the whey and the curds separated. When you put the honey in it, what I do is I'll take about six ounces of the milk out of the bottle and then put two tablespoons of the honey in that milk. I'll blend it and then pour it back into the bottle. If you put the honey in there when it's cold or even room temperature, it's not going to dissolve easily. So it won't make kefir or yogurt quickly. So when you blend it in there and put it back in the jar with the rest of the milk, it will do that fairly quickly. So it's best to make your own yogurt and kefir from the natural bacteria in the milk, fresh. Yes. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, I'm saying that when you eat raw cheese without honey, it won't digest. You can't use the minerals in it. You can't use the fat except to pull toxins out of the, those fluid systems that are running through the digestive tract and hold onto it. That's a very important asset.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, it pulls out the toxic stuff. It allows your minerals to be utilized from your food because it's pulling the poisons and the heavy metals out that would normally attach with your minerals from food. When you eat honey with it, then you will be able to absorb all of the various nutrients in your cheese, especially the minerals intercellularly.

Q: How does cottage cheese do that?

A: Well cottage cheese is just not as dry, has more water in it, more fluids in it. That's the only difference. And you can use cottage cheese as that, as that lock, as that binder. It's fine.

Q: What about making cheese out of nuts or seeds? Soaking the seeds overnight, rinsing them to get the enzyme inhibitors off?

A: Well what happens with that is that you have a high carbohydrate food. What did I talk about the high carbohydrate food? Advanced glycation end products, the acrylamides, all that stuff that becomes highly reactive and sticky in the body. Milk doesn't do that. Yes?

Q: Any reason to not eat that cheese?

A: Well if you're too constipated, you might take a break or you do use that earlier, you know, suppository I suggested with the two tablespoons of coconut cream, two tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons of dairy cream, quarter tablespoon of honey and you insert that up your butt and leave it there and it'll soothe you and take care of constipation. But the cheese is a very important thing, very important, especially children who, well adults, all of us who've had vaccines, most of it stores in the stomach lining and dumps into your food every time you eat.

Q: I thought you were supposed to stay away from cheese if you've got glaucoma.

A: Well that's, if you've got glaucoma, that's actually developed from the signs of glaucoma. I know a lot of people who are diagnosed with glaucoma, but they don't have the logical symptoms of it. But that's only for six months. But if you've got a contradiction to that, you better eat cheese anyway. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, because they interfere with your own bacteria in your body. The natural bacteria that's in the milk, if you incubate it with the honey in the milk, it encourages your own bacteria. When you eat those supplemental grains that are from a cow or a goat or a pig, they are different from ours. So they do all the work, and then our body doesn't do anything. And that's why we don't eat any of the other grains that are in the milk, because we don't want to eat that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You know, it's not that kind of a situation anymore.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, sometimes you can make a kefir grain out of grains. You can cause a bacteria fermentation to grow from grains. But that's not a good one. A lot of times they say, well, if you germinate grains and you germinate nuts and beans, it destroys the phytic acid. But there are three other enzymes that act the same, so they don't take it to the next level and the next step. And those three act proportionally greater than the phytic acid. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you feed a bird only sprouts, it will die. In about five days. It will die in five days.

Q: You can see the sprout when it's actually starting to poke out the seeds?

A: Yeah, at any time it starts that sprout, whether you see it or not, within 10 hours of soaking it, that sprout has already begun inside. Because it's poking out doesn't mean it isn't a sprout.

Q: Is it good to soak it for any short amount of time?

A: For detoxification, yes. If you want to detoxify all the cooked grains that you've eaten in your life, ferment them and eat that rejuvelac, they call it. And it isn't rejuvelac at all, it is detoxification time. It won't rejuvenate you, it'll tear you apart. It'll tear those sugar molecules apart in your body that came from cooked grains. And I used to do it a lot to detoxify myself. Soak those things. Fermented vegetable juice from all those vegetables my parents made me sit and eat, all those cooked vegetables, I will ferment my juice sometimes and drink that to force that stuff out of my system. So those are good, those fermentations are good to cause detoxification. But I don't think that people should start experimenting with that too much unless you've got enough weight on you to protect yourself and you know what kind of a diet that will really rejuvenate after you do it. So that's when I get the detoxification book done, hopefully next year. It'll have all of those key things to watch for when you're using those things for detoxification. But don't do something stupid like I did. When I fermented that milk and maca, I drank three cups in an hour. Let me tell you, I suffered for weeks. You know, I got the tapeworm I wanted, but I certainly was miserable with hives that were itching like crazy and it drove me nuts. One advantage was I was going, the next day I was heading for Hanoi. So by the time I got to Hanoi, I had the hives all over the place. So I was stuck in the hotel room for three days dealing with the hives, you know, the cold tomato and the cucumber and then in a cold bath with vinegar and the tomatoes squished in it, cold bath, cools down because I refused to scratch it. I wanted to see what happened as it comes to the skin if I didn't scratch it. So it came, it actually scabbed just as if I had scraped it. That's how toxic that stuff was. So I took the scrapings and I took it to a lab in Hanoi and they analyzed it. It was very high in advanced glycation enzymes, I mean very high in advanced glycation toxins and acrylamides, all those things that come from cereals and all that high carbohydrate stuff. It was inundated with that. So I got rid of a lot of tissue in these two areas from that fermenting that and causing that to happen. But I did it too radically and even for me it was frightfully uncomfortable. You know if I were to do it again, if I had needed to do it again, I would have only had maybe half a cup at a time rather than three cups at a time. I would have been more smart instead of overly excited. Yes?

Q: Are you saying it's dangerous to eat raw meat if you eat carbohydrates with it?

A: No, not dangerous. No, you just won't digest your meat very well. You won't digest your meat very well. If you eat raw vegetables with your meat, you're not going to digest either well at all because the meat needs alkalinizing fluids, including the hydrochloric acid, and the vegetables need an alkalinizing enzyme so they neutralize each other and neither of them digest well. Now, a raw vegetable salad with a cooked meat meal is a great thing because meat will just sit there once it's cooked and it will putrefy in the intestines. You eat a raw substance with it like salad, it provides the vitamins and enzymes to get peristalsis going. So that's a balance. But when you eat raw meat, you don't want vegetable juice and you don't want vegetables with that meal. Yes?

Q: I have two questions. Do you eat as much raw fish as you eat raw meat?

A: It depends upon your acid nature of your blood. If you're a very hyperactive person, have a lot of energy, easily irritable, you want to eat very little red meat.

Q: Very little red meat?

A: Yeah.

Q: So more fish?

A: Yeah, more fish or poultry, seafood, wild ocean caught seafood is the best, because our lakes and streams and rivers are very polluted, like 35 to 40 percent polluted.

Q: Does coconut meat have the same effect as coconut cream?

A: What about it?

Q: Does coconut meat have the same effect as coconut cream?

A: No.

Q: No?

A: No, because you have so much cellulose in the coconut meat that your body is going to spend a lot of the nutrients from the coconut cream that's in it while you're chewing it to digest that pulp, so. 

Q: What about people in areas that grow coconuts? Do they eat a lot of coconuts?

A: They eat a lot of coconut cream. You go into Asia and everywhere you can buy coconut cream. The restaurants use it. 

Q: How do they take it if you don't have [unintelligible]?

A: Well, what they do is they take it and they grate it and then wring it. That's when I was in Vietnam in the jungle, that's the way they made it for me. Yeah, yeah. And they crush it that way and then squeeze it out. Yes?

Q: What's your opinion on [unintelligible]?

A: Well, they affect everybody in some way. And let me give you an example. The city of Los Angeles in 1992 issued a brochure and it said, if you use an electric blanket, turn it on before you get into bed, turn it off when you get into bed and do not have it on while you're in the bed. We have discovered that EMFs alter the molecular structure of cells. We don't know if that's good or bad, but we're warning you. They would not give that warning unless there was something terribly wrong with it. Terribly wrong with it. So they were protecting themselves. The city of Los Angeles protects themselves very well except against guys like me. So that is a very toxic substance or energy system of EMFs everywhere. Everything had the EMFs. The first time I became very conscious about it, about the extent of the EMFs was I'd heard all the years, oh, the EMFs doesn't come from the electrical appliances and it does not cause carpal tunnel syndrome. So in 1994, I think it was, I moved into a new house in Venice, California. And I also got a, my first laptop computer at the same time. So I was in the new house and I was typing away on the computer and I started getting carpal tunnel syndrome. It felt like cancer, bone cancer again. And it was going up in my elbow and up into my shoulder. And this was going on for about 12 days. So I thought, oh, maybe I got radon in this house. I should have had it checked before I moved in. So we got in the Yellow Pages and I called an environmental specialist. He came in with all of his gadgets and checked everything and only found one light socket in the bedroom that wasn't near my bed. That wasn't a problem. So I grounded it myself the next day. That was fine. But he said, turn on your laptop. So I turned on the laptop, put the EMF field with the tri-meter over it. Things shot up, 35 to 75 gauss. Three is supposed to be okay. I won't even get near three. I'll get near a half of a gauss. But this was 35 to 75 gauss coming off of that computer. He said, you need a separate keyboard. Plug it in. And he took the gauge and he said it was six inches, six and a half inches away from the computer before the EMFs went to zero. So, that's why I put the keyboard six inches away from the bottom of the computer, the top of the keyboard to the bottom of the computer. So, I was not in that EMF field. The carpal tunnel went away in 24 hours. Just like that, never returned. So, they are lying through their teeth when they say EMFs do not cause carpal tunnel. It does. You remember the old punch typewriters? You ever type with one of those? You know how much energy it takes to push down on those freaking keys? I used one of those for years to play with and I never got carpal tunnel. My ex-wife was top secretary, you know, at the electrical company in Cincinnati and she wanted to use one of those and never got carpal tunnel. It wasn't until the electric typewriter came out and was used that carpal tunnels started coming in and now that we have the, you know, the computer, especially the laptop, it's tremendous, tremendous.

Q: What about electric motors? Like on power tools?

A: Absolutely. Big problem.

Q: That happens to me constantly.

A: Yep. You know how your hand goes numb? Yep. Numb. Yep. EMF field.

Q: What do you do to protect yourself if you're, I know, driving a car is really, I mean, you're surrounded by your automobile?

A: Well, yeah, but I took my Trimeter and went and tested all kinds of cars before about my car and I got a Prius and it was only eight to thirteen gauss. Everything else, you know, the Hondas, I forget what they call it, yes, the Insight, it was like in the backseat alone it was seventy-five gauss where the battery was. The front seat and the passenger and the driver, it was like fifty gauss and higher as you, you know, as the car was in motion. For my Prius, it's down to a low level, anywhere from four to eight at a standstill and then when it's moving, only thirteen gauss. So I can be in that environment for like six, seven hours without much problems and then my legs, my right leg will start hurting and then I have to stop and get away from it for a while, you know, but I don't drive any trips with it anymore, you know. And also in a plane, I take my tri-field meter with me because I sat in business class and first class going across to Asia and, you know, that's nineteen hours of flight time and, you know, by the time I got there, I was a nervous freaking wreck. So the next time I brought my tri-field meter with me and the electromagnetic field from the computers in the cockpit all the way back, thirty-five to fifty-five gals. So I had way to the back of the plane where it's only three to five. When you're flying, it comes down to about three. And so unless you're way up front around the computers, then it's very high.

Q: Why is it that when you're in the Prius, when you're driving the Prius or when you're actually moving in the plane, it's lower?

A: Don't know.

Q: Okay.

A: Don't know. Now, most of this all could be taken care of, and they know it, by using transistors instead of capacitors. Fifty cents more per computer and probably five dollars more per car, and there would be no EMF field. They purposely make them dangerous. Toyota is the only one that moves in the right direction. Of the computer companies, NEC is the only one that moves in the right direction to lower the EMF field. Everybody else wants to make sure you're sick. Who owns these companies that makes those decisions that would rather save 50 cents per computer and let you have lots of EMF field problems, or molecular structure of your cells damaged. Okay, any other? Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I've tested those, and you'll see I have one on my cell phone, but it only lowered it a half a gauss, so I always use an earbud. I won't, you know, put that, in fact, when that phone is receiving a call, or emitting a call, I don't touch it. It's on a, it's away from me on a table, or on a, on the dash of the car, or in a sleeve in the car that I have for it. I will not touch that cell phone while it's in use, because that's when it broadcasts the EMFs. And the animal tests that came back about a year and a half ago from Switzerland showed that the laboratory, the rats, who had had 45 minutes of the cell phone exposure a day at their ear and head, 36 to 38 percent of them, I forgot which it was, developed brain tumors in the area where the cell phone was. Eye tumors, ear tumors. 

Q: And the Bluetooth thing, probably it's the same problem?

A: Oh yeah. It emits about, not as much, but it will emit anywhere up to eight to 14 gauss, not 30 to 35. 

Q: So what about a wire earpiece?

A: I've gauged the wire earpiece and I couldn't even get a half a gauss out of it. So, you know, that's not scientifics, the malarkeys that's going on about, because that's a, you know, a copper wire that goes up to your ear, that it's a conductor of the EMF field. I've used many very sensitive gauges on the ear bud, and I don't find any reading on the ear bud.

Q: Yeah, that's pretty much what I thought.

A: Yeah. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I haven't found it. I've looked at, you know, those magnets that Nikken and all those people use, and I haven't found it to do anything. Found them to do anything. Except lower, maybe half of a gauss. I'll take that half of a gauss for my telephone. I definitely will, and I do. You know, I use the bio shield, you know. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Terrible thing, worst thing you can do besides massage for a lymphatic system. You have to remember, a clogged lymphatic system is drying. If you go in and break the veins and the arteries in the lymphatic system, you're going to release all of that lymphatic fluid into your connective tissue, and you're going to end up with lupus, or deteriorating more fibromyalgia, more fatigue, all kinds of problems. That rebounder is good for somebody who has a healthy lymphatic system, but not an unhealthy lymphatic system. And if you're going to get a massage, you go in there and you break those channels, you're going to leak all into your tissue. So, the right massage for somebody who has a lymphatic problem, is a tickle massage, very light. You see how that stimulates everything? That's what you need, just that stimulation. And let me tell you, tickling just sends, you know, vibrations all through the body. And that's what your body needs, electrical stimulation to stimulate that lymphatic system, not crunching and grinding and breaking of the lymphatic system. Same thing happens if you have arteriosclerosis. You go in there with a deep massage and you start breaking those veins and arteries. You're going to have blood in the connective tissue. You're going to have bruising all internally, whether you see it or not. It's going to be there. Yes? 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Lupus is a dissolution of connective tissue. Pardon? 

Q: [unintelligible] 

A: I always take cheese, honey, and butter. Always. Because I can get, I'm usually a man, I can milk and meat and eggs everywhere I go.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I take everything with me. I'll even take 30 pounds of butter, but I have to go through hell to get it through. And I have a doctor's letter that said, I've been diagnosed with diabetes and in cancers of the blood and bone. And if I don't have this food, I'll get very sick. And his food is his medicine. And then I carry the TSA thing that says medicine can be taken aboard, milk or not. So I took that, I took a whole quart of milk along with me. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well honey and cheese and butter. But make sure your butter is cold. You know, you take it to the airport with you cold, because if it's spreadable, they won't let it on. And they said to me, oh, butter's spreadable. I said, you spread that and I won't take it on. Couldn't spread it. It was too cold. So he didn't win. So, yeah.

Q: [unintelligible] is with the jars.

A: Never have had a problem with the glass. Never have had the problem. Yeah, well, I've never been faced with that. And that's the most logical thing. I take everything in glass. And that, I mean, I could make that into a tool very quickly for cutting throats, you know, but they never questioned me about the glass. You know, just all of that letters saying blood cancer, bone cancer, diabetes, you know, oh my God, what do we have here? If I tell him he can't take the food on and he, something goes wrong with them, we're going to be sued and then I'll lose my job. So they're so confused. They don't think about the glass issue is what I think, you know. Yes?

Q: Is it okay to put the food through?

A: Most of the time I leave Los Angeles, I have to put it through.

Q: And it doesn't work?

A: Yeah, it does, but it's very, what I do is when I put the food through, everything else has gone through. I put it in by itself. Because if you have a suitcase that's in front of or behind it, that's, they're looking at heavily and they're taking their time with and yours is right next to it. It's going to get bombarded for minutes, sometimes three or four minutes. So I let that food pass through on its own. And then, you know, it's at least two and a half feet behind anything that's gone in prior to it. And I put my bags in and then let the two feet, the two and a half feet go by. Then I put my food, then I will let two and a half feet go by before I put my next item in. So it's under there. They just spins through because there's nothing to see in food except for the metal lids. And that's a very quick scan and it's gone through. So there's very little EMFs. I've noticed that if I put it through twice, I had a problem. But once, no problem. It does make my milk sting a little bit in my tongue, even going through once. But at least I'm able to eat it to some extent. Yes.

Q: What sort of energetic feeling do you get in your body? When I eat food, if it's not raw food, I feel like somebody turned off the light, you know?

A: Well, they have. Yeah, you've turned off a lot of the good electromagnetic minerals that can no longer conduct a pure light. So what happens is, it bounces and doesn't go very far. So basically you have put out the light.

Q: Is there also like a psychological or spiritual effect? I mean, you've probably experienced things that are like, wow, that never happened before.

A: I've experienced everything. But I stopped eating all cooked foods and experimented with it in 74. I mean, I'll eat a baked potato or some rice with lots of raw butter maybe two times a year, and that's it.

Q: But the raw food brings so much... 

A: Life, energy, everything. Yes?

Q: Is there any benefits to eating vegetables?

A: I talked about that already. For detoxification, yeah. For all the cooked vegetables you ate. Pardon? Yes, and make sure you have plenty of fats. Yes. Well, this will be the last question because we're going to have to get moving on. Yes?

Q: Can you just go over for a minute how to [unintelligible]?

A: Well, I say any time that you have a raw food, don't worry about bacteria from it, no matter how old it is. You don't have to wash your hands. You don't have to do any of that. You know, they'll say, you know, you need this Clorox. You walk into this store down there in the meat department, it smells like Clorox. You know, because in the fumes, the chloroform is poisoning every customer and every employee down there. That's not a safe thing. That's not sanitary. That's poisoning stupidity. You know, so when it's raw food, not a problem. Chemicals, you want to wash your hands. You want to get the chemical off so you don't put it in your food. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Just remember, by the time the detoxification leaves the body, it is not a danger. It is already arrested, broken down and neutralized or else it would have never made it out of the body.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The chemicals are the worst thing in there. And you know, I mean, the person's own perspiration can cause irritation. So they need to have some kind of a bath to help get those poisons off because most of them are acrid and they'll dry the skin and cause sores. But it's not like a bacteria is going to invade the body from it. It's that you've got a chemical substance that came out of the body and now it can burn the skin and cause more damage if you don't remove it from the skin. So, but it's always about removing the chemicals, not the bacteria.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, yeah, some of those chemicals are not natural. Most of them are not that are causing severe damage. Okay, last one.

Q: In the hunter gatherer period, [unintelligible].

A: That is an absolute falsity. That's a lie. Absolute lie. They said the same thing about the Eskimos. And Vilhjalmur Stefansson went around and got all the records from all the towns in Alaska and the villages. And they were living just as long as we were 105, 110 years old. So it was a lie. And just have to take a look at it. People lived short lives only when they lived in metropolitan cities. No fresh food. They were dumping their food into the streets. The pigs were eating the slop in the streets. They were burning coals in wood fireplaces in their homes without proper ventilation. Coal is a mercury vapor byproduct. Why do you think the Black Plague happened in Europe? Coal was the thing to burn. And they were using all of this mercury vapor that was in their homes destroying their lungs. So the whole population in there exposed to it for a couple of hundred years came down with the Black Plague. But none of the farmers got it. They used wood for burning stoves. So you have to take a look at this bullshit that comes out of history. It's written to confuse you. And they, you know, they talk about, well, in South America and in Hawaii, whole civilizations were devastated because the white man came in there with certain kinds of flu, horse manure. They were putting formaldehyde in their water sources. This is documented by, I forgot his name, he wrote savages. And he was talking about civilized man being the savages when the civilized man was calling the primitive man savage. It was the other way around. He documented in Brazil in the jungles that Coca-Cola and the mining companies were going in and paying, they'd go into bars in Brazil and then pay, you know, this is in the 50s and 60s, and pay a person $1,500 to take a machine gun and poisons and go in and kill natives. Because, you know, the jungles would grow over the roadways and they couldn't get in there to mine, you know, and Coca-Cola was involved in diamond mining and all the jewel mining, big investor in mining, jewel mining. So, they would go in and kill the natives because if you came in to build a road in the jungles, the natives would come with blow darts and stuff like that and prevent you from destroying their habitat. So, they went in and just would slaughter the natives with poisons and machine guns. Same thing they did in Hawaii. Same thing they did here. You know, eventually, when they couldn't poison them anymore, they put the Indians in a desert where nothing grows, with high uranium. So, basically, it devastated the Indian population. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: 56 million. Absolute malarkey. They were slaughtering them by the millions. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, those are cooked foods. Those are cooked and processed foods.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: What raw? You can't get soy raw.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You mean lactose intolerance from milk? I haven't found anybody that's lactose intolerant to raw milk. I found that a few people, out of all the people who are allergic to the pasteurized dairy, I found that there's a few people who will detoxify all their casein and lactate from past dairy use, and they may have an allergy reaction for about three to four months, and then it goes away. And, like I say in the book, they eat a half a cup a day only, drink a half a cup a day of the raw milk only, warm. And then, within three, four months, the allergy, the reaction that seems like an allergy is gone. But, it's an allergy to those stored compounds from the pasteurized dairy that they had before, not the raw dairy that they're eating now.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, I said that it's okay to eat gluten. You don't want the whole grain because you want it released, but you have to eat a lot of butter with it. You have to eat an equal amount of butter to the starch, so that it doesn't get into your system. It's there, like I use the cheese, as a magnet, not to digest. And, you won't digest with that much fat. You cannot digest the starch.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You can't absorb it. With that much fat, you cannot digest it to absorb it. Impossible. It just passes through. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Just remember, dairy never goes bad. It only turns into cheeses. It can get as stinky as the German cheeses. And, man, that's stinky. And, you think that stuff is really bad. It's never bad. It's just, can you tolerate the odor?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Mold on cheese is fine, as long as you don't have too much of a detoxification. Okay, that's it. We're going to have to move on. I don't know. Thank you.

[applause]

Q: We have fresh-made coconut cream samples available for everyone to shop up here.
