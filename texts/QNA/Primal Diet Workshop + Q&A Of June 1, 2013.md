A: My name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz and I got into health because I was a very sickly individual. I had a brother who was 18 months older than I and was still in diapers, so he was very upset that I took mother's attention away when I got home from the hospital. So he tortured me a lot. He learned by the age, by the time I was six months old, if he pushed me on something rusty. My mother, who was a nurse, would panic. She was terribly fearful of lockjaw. And she heard about it and said he would be locked up and never have seen one, but that's the way the medical profession works. So he would push me on rusty things. My mother would panic, take me for a tetanus shot. And the back in those days, a tetanus shot was supposed to last five years, but I was getting one every six months. So at eight months, eighteen months, I got my third tetanus shot and it turned me autistic. The mercury, I don't know if all of you know what's in a vaccine. Vaccines all have five basic ingredients. Liquid mercury, liquid aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, and detergent. If you put those in a blender jar with a rotten egg, would you eat it? Injecting it right into your blood, right into your system. No vaccine is safe. No vaccine has ever been proved effective. In fact, about 20% of the people who get injections get the very disease that they're supposed to immunize themselves from. So, not a good practice. So that mercury and probably formaldehyde went to my communication center. I was unable to relate a comprehension of dialogue of interest other than physical motion. So by the time I was 8 years old, I had learned to parrot sound bites. And I could repeat sentences. I had an overall understanding of what they were. But if I was asked to look at a word and define it, there's no way. Impossible. So, I was getting injections. I was very sick. I was bedridden 3 to 5 months a year. And lots of medication, lots and lots of more injections and some other vaccines as they came into existence. And it was quite trying really. I was never able to play sports or be like other children, like other males. So I had to learn to cook and to sew. And I was a good artist because I learned to mimic sound and everything. So I could look at objects and draw them and paint them very well. So those were my talents. When I hit 12 years old, I had a case of peritonitis that was misdiagnosed as an appendicitis. So it was... in excruciating pain. I was doubled up like an infant in a fetus and unable to get out of that position. And it lasted for about five days all together. But they were going to [unintelligible], put me under ether. It took me 17, 19 seconds to black out with ether. And then they went in and took the appendix out, found it in good condition, but took it out anyway just in case it caused problems in the future. That's the medical profession. And they said that the pancreas has no value because they didn't understand it. So it's okay if we take it out. No problem.

So I went through injections of that every two to three hours for four days. So I was black and blue and puffy all over. And I mean majorly puffy. I bloated, swelled with almost two inches of fluid in my tissues. And white as a ghost, except for I had had injections. It was black and blue, brown, bubbled with the injection spots in them. And I had injection spots all over my body. I think I had seven in this arm, eight in this arm, nine in this cheek, and ten in this cheek. So that's how many injections I had gotten over a four day period. Came to the point where when the nurse came in the next time, I just knocked her tray off. There was no way I was going to accept it other than she got me when I was asleep. And then I went into a rage and tore the whole room apart. So they didn't inject me anymore. That was it. I was able to get out of there in 24 hours. I mean, I really tore the room apart for that nurse injecting me while I was asleep. Because that was it. I started vomiting, defecating, urinating all over myself in the bed. And I wouldn't let them come in and change it, and I threw the matter at them as they came into the room. So they decided, you know, if the kid's going to die, let him die, and we're not going to inject him anymore. So, of course, you know, they got everything backwards, exactly backwards. Whenever I'm asked in an interview, whether it's TV or film, I've had to look at this. I'm always asked, what's the most important thing that you can relay to people? And I said, whatever the medical profession tells you to do, do the exact opposite. And 99 times out of 100, you will be right. Because they are in business to make money. If you're well, they don't make money. That's the whole object of vaccines. Start you off from birth very sick and very ill and poisoned. So you will be decrepit to an extent throughout your entire life. Take a look at the kids from my generation and younger, who didn't have vaccines until about 1958. For me, that was 11 years old, except for tetanus. But I got a lot of the tetanus, so that caused a problem with me. And of course, the smallpox vaccine. That's mostly scratched onto the skin and not injected under the skin. So that's intradermal. But vaccines cause everybody to start off in a bad progression. Mercury, can you imagine? It's the most toxic neurotoxin. I will show you a video on how it works. In a test tube and how it affects other animals at Alberta University when they did experiments with it. And that toxicity doesn't just have to go to, even though it's the most toxic neurotoxin, it doesn't just go to the nerves, it goes to other areas of the body. And wherever it stays, it stays and breaks down the tissue in that area. Now they put the aluminum in it because aluminum is difficult to get out of the body. So when they put aluminum in a vaccine, it's supposed to hold the toxins into your body. It locks them in. So these are very formidable, nasty people in the pharmaceutical industry. And of course the medical industry are dupes, most of them. Most of them don't understand what they're doing. They are absolute dupes. 

They are not taken into a laboratory. They're not shown the effects. They don't study toxicology unless that's their specialty. And the ones who want to learn toxicology go against medicine. Almost all the 60 MDs that are on this diet were toxicologists. Who are renegades from the medical profession. So after that particular episode I was even sicker. I was unable to lift my arm more than this without severe pain. I was unable to practically do anything. I was mostly bedridden for five, six months a year. I was completely unable to have the energy to do anything by the time I was about seven or eight years old. I had fibromyalgia. Every joint and every muscle in my body ached. My glands didn't ache, but my muscles and bones and skin were always aching, my joints. So, I would fall asleep in school. I was unable to sleep at night because one brother I told you about would come in the middle of the night and punch me in the stomach while I was asleep. I'd wake and unable to breathe, pass out. My heart would stop. So, he would do that, so I was afraid to sleep at night. All of a sudden, you know, they had lots of horror films that were coming into being at that time. TV was, you know, TV was pretty good, but we weren't allowed to watch TV. Only my parents and people who were smart in my family, and that was not me because I was autistic. And so, I was always being punished. I would vomit with any cooked vegetable. So, if I was fed cooked Brussels sprouts, I could hit that wall with my vomit. If it was peas, I could hit you. If it was carrots, I could hit you. So, depending upon the particular cooked vegetable would measure the greatness of the projection of my vomit. It was not psychological. It wasn't a matter of taste or anything. That food would hit my stomach and it would come out as vomit. So, my parents used to make me sit at the table one and a half hours longer than everybody else to get my food down. So, what I had to do was I had to mash the vegetable and cut off my sense of taste, take a little bit of milk, swallow it. That would take about two minutes per bite. And then the hardest part came, preventing myself from vomiting. And that would take three to five minutes per bite. So, it was pretty traumatic. When I was eight years old, I saw my, it dawned on me, my parents drank coffee every morning to get you to watch them be a little bit more hyperactive every few minutes as they were drinking their coffee. And I thought, oh, I'm going to do that. So, at eight years old, I was eight years and three months old. It was like July of my eighth year. And, um, I poured myself a cup of coffee, I had a cup of coffee, my parents freaked out. Again, hypocrisy, you know. I, when I was a child, because you're autistic, you can't communicate. So you're much more perceptive and you listen, you don't talk. And you, because you're not involved in communicating, not thinking about what you're saying, you're receiving everything. 95% of what came out of my parents' mouth was lie. Lie, lie, lie. And I found that all parents did that.

So, it was a difficult world for me to be in from that perspective. And I think most children up to the age of 7 realize how much their parents lie. It's all based on, it's for the good of your child that we lie. And it's an absolute wrong doing. Because that child learns they have to lie all throughout the rest of their lives. Now some people don't go into that state, but when it comes to their children, they do. They won't lie in many, many other ways, but when it comes to their children, they will lie unequivocally. So, know that when you're dealing with your children and grandchildren. They know. Absolutely. But they just accept that as part of being on this planet, at this era. So, I lost, you know, great respect. When I was an infant, my parents were gods. And at my third birthday, they took me to have my tonsils out. And, again, I was autistic, but I couldn't understand. They were saying, this is good for you. We're taking you to the doctor. You're going to have a sore throat. What all that meant, I wasn't quite sure until I got back from the doctor's office. My throat was inflamed. I had a headache. I had swelling. My brain almost went into cerebral meningitis. And it went on for days. I lost trust in my parents at three years old. I no longer idolized them as gods. You have to understand what you do. So I came up with a distrust of adults. So I was not good with authority. I was always thinking way before I'd act. So I'd always get in trouble. And I was raised by nuns and priests. And they were very violent in those days. Very violent. I would take the words that I'd receive at home that were said with a laugh. You know, you're stupid, you're an idiot, sit down, shut up. Words like that. Attitudes like that. So I thought that that's what you say to everybody. So I said those words to the nuns. And I was getting beat. I mean, they were taking the ruler with the metal strip in it and were hitting me on the hands till I bled, or taking my comb and hitting me on the back till I bled in spots. And the priests, you know, most of them were Franciscan priests, so they'd belch you and they'd cuss and swear. And it was a very violent group of people in those days. I understand it's different now. But back then, that's how tough it was. The most unchristian and unloving people were nuns and priests. So, more trauma. And I was always in detention. I was always having to write out all these one-sentence lines, that I won't do this, write, you know, something like that. Didn't have a clue what I was writing. They were just hieroglyphs for me. And to get to schools, I picked the smartest, most sensitive girl in the class to sit next to. But the girl had to be both. And sometimes the smartest girl wasn't the nicest girl. So, I would get the smartest, but the most sensitive. And I would copy her hieroglyphs off of her paper. And that's all it was to me, hieroglyphs. Well, it got to when I was in high school, I was so good at it, that I would actually do the same handwriting of the person I was cheating on. So, the teacher would go... you know, like this. So, I was getting a nail for cheating. Math, I was... you know, everybody who's an autistic person has a particular superior or incredibly... incredible gift that other people have. Like the rain man, you saw a rain man, I could do math, easily. Didn't have to figure out the problem. If you give me a math problem, I just write out the answer.

How I got it? Not at a qlue. But I just write the answer. No division problem where you have to... you know, in the bracket here, with all the... all the figures going down for adding and subtracting to implement the vision answer. Write down the answer. So they thought I was cheating for that. So they isolated me and threw me through a test. And then I was accused of breaking in the heart of the school and getting the answer out of the teacher's desk. So finally, the principal of the school, the dean, not the principal, the dean, made out a test. Well, I'm sitting in an isolated inner room, made out a math test, and then took it to me. Told there were two people involved in making that test. And so I thought it was because I was doing it too fast. They were upset because I was doing it... I didn't know what they were having problems with. So I delayed. I waited 15 minutes to do the test. And it would have taken anybody else probably 45 minutes to do the test. I could do it in five minutes or less. So I waited for one answer to add. I sat and waited a few minutes, and then put another answer in. So I thought, OK, I'm OK. 15 minutes went by. So I took out the test, and they flipped out. Then they thought because I had absolutely zero comprehension, any time I had to read, I couldn't read. I couldn't even articulate. I couldn't make thought into a sound. There was no way my brain worked to look at that and say, that's a sound. My brain didn't work that way. So I was unable to read, so I was always getting disciplined for standing up and not reading. They just thought I was defiant. And after this math episode, they knew I was defiant. So that freshman year in high school, I got 45 days of detention, two weeks of standing proof. 45 days of detention, detention is an hour after school, writing the same thing over and over, a hundred times. Or until the, if you did write at least a hundred times, you had to stay until you [unintelligible]. Sanding crew was two hours after school, standing desks, where kids had written into the desks and done some naughty things. And then, shoveling coal on Saturdays was the worst attempt. You came in and shoveled eight hours. In those days, Roger Bacon High School ran its heater, heating system on coal. So, you know, mercury vapor from the coal. And I was so weak anyway. So they had, they pushed me and pushed me, and a priest would hit me if, you know, each time I was delayed shoveling the coal. So it was a pretty bad three days of shoveling coal for me. So I got expelled from that school the first day of my sophomore year. They had told me not to come back. I was autistic, I didn't know what to do. So they, when I went in for class, they sent me by schedule and everything. So my parents sent me off to the school, and then I get there and [unintelligible]. They're gone. Best thing that ever happened to me as far as school goes. Because they put me into a preppy school in a poor town. I mean, in this town, there weren't even black people. There weren't any colored people at all. This was a wealthy neighborhood. My father invented the first bearing computer.

My mother was from a family of 13, and every one of them got a college education. So these were smart people, and I wasn't any of them. But they put me into school. But the teachers understood that I had learning disorders. It's the first time. So they put me in art schools. They put teachers that dealt with special education children. So it's the first time that I started learning something, even though I didn't understand language. There would be a sense with the teacher that it was just a bonding. So I was able to, psychically, or intuitively, instinctively, get more out of them than I was anyone else in my life. So I was delighted with that. Then at 15 and a half, I had my third polio vaccine. Now, I went from two days after that vaccine, I went from hating pasta, hating breads, except with two pieces of bread on an egg sandwich where there's lots of butter on it, but it was margarine, really, and the soft yolk, the runny yolk, spread that all over. That's the only way I could eat bread. I hated pizza crust. I hated pasta. I hated any kind of grain carbohydrate, like cooked vegetables. I just didn't like them. After that third polio vaccine, I started craving them. I went into the school cafeteria, and I ate a whole plate of spaghetti with four slices of rye bread with lots of margarine on top of that, coated with margarine. I also turned diabetic that same day. That's when I started shooting up insulin. That was the day that my whole diet changed. I craved it. So I was craving all this carb, this starch combined with these poisons that I was now injecting into myself. And it also gave me angina pectoris. It's an old person's disease, right? You have muscle spasms in the heart. So that means heart attacks. I was having two to three heart attacks a week. I'd go into a cramp in my chest. And it would get so bad I couldn't breathe. My whole arm here would go into pain. And I'd cave over in my desk, fall over on my desk or on the floor. So I was getting taken to the hospital because, you know, they could see me gripping. And it wasn't a psychological thing. This was actual pain. I went through EKGs, EEGs, everything. And the doctor said, oh, it's all in his head. Again, the doctors are not looking for the poisons from the mercury, formaldehyde, ether, and detergent, and the other toxins, and the aluminum, that were in the vaccine because they're in total denial about the effects of vaccines. That's their whole process. And the pharmaceutical houses have to make sure they're geared that way. And they do that through FDA. Do you know that after the first polio vaccine in 1958, three states kept records? One county, Los Angeles County, kept records of the rate of polio. If you read my We Want to Live and Appendix D, it talks about those states, it went up to some, one of the states went up to 432% more cancer. 432% more, not cancer, more polio. So it's creating polio, not getting rid of it. When the polio vaccine came out, there was only 1% remaining of the high point that was getting polio. So there were very few, maybe two or three cases, four cases, five cases per state. 

When the vaccine came out, it shot up to 35, 75, 90 some, in those states that kept record. There you go, that's the telling tale. What did the FDA do in 1959? They had to dictate that no state could keep records. To this day, no state's allowed to keep records of vaccine toxicity. They'll take reports, but they don't keep the statistics on it. And they don't ask for it. They want to deter you from knowing what it does. So from the age of 15 and a half to the age of 22, I had 300 heart attacks. Because I was autistic, I did not die. The reason for that is when people have a heart attack, their heart stops because of the cramp. It's like a charley horse in your leg. You get a charley horse in your leg, you cramp up with it, you try to move it out, it gets worse. So you have to calmly go through it. Leave the pain. And as an autistic child, I've been through so much pain from the nuns, the priests, my brother, and father. My father was a very violent man at the meeting because I was an idiot. Here's a man that invented the first bearing computer when he was in college at Purdue. And here he had an idiot son. It infuriated him. He had no patience. So he put me in the hospital three times, broke my eardrums once. Pretty bad shape. So violent people all around me. So when I get into pain, I always learn, you just got to relax. Let the pain pass through. No matter how long it took, you have to let the pain pass through. [unintelligible] what happens when heart attacks would happen. After I do the first, dealing with the initial cramp, spasm, I would just go in. That's the only thing you could do. And then I would pass out, and of course my body would get the thyroid hormones going, get the heart going again, and the breathing going again. And that's what thyroid is for, I'll go into that later. So I never died from it. But I'll continue what I was saying before. My parents wouldn't let me drink the coffee when I was eight. So they always left a half to three quarters of the cup. Nobody would drink that last bit through the pot. So I'd go in the middle of the night, between midnight and two o'clock, put it in a jar, put a lid on it, put it under my bed. Because I was getting belted to get up in the morning. I mean, I was just so achy, and so much in pain, and I had no energy. They'd come in with a belt to get me out of bed. Every morning. So I got the coffee out, went in the bed, drank that, and within five minutes I was wired and, you know, chipped with coffee, I could really. It was good. I had energy. It was nervous energy, but I still had jittery energy, but at least I had energy. And then by the time I was, you know, around 11 o'clock in the classroom, I was going to sleep again, especially after eight. Went right to sleep. So I learned that in between classes, I'd go out and smoke cigarettes. So I would smoke, you know, a third of a cigarette, put it, you know, in this little [unintelligible]. I'd put the pine needles over it so nobody would find it. And I would go out there in the woods every, between almost every class, and smoke a few pumps of the cigarette to get the nicotine to wire me up. So that's how I spent my life.

And by the time I was 16 years old, I was smoking two packs of Lucky Strike non-filter a day, and drinking about nine cups of coffee. So then I met, you know, a girl at the new school that I was in, the second year. And she was a grade above being me and older than I. And we had a communication that was phenomenal. We didn't have to say words. We just liked each other, and we'd smile and laugh. Just being together, we didn't even talk. And of course, when I talked, by that time, I learned all the cool words from watching some TV shows, but mostly going on Saturdays to the matinees and watching an Elvis Presley movie, or a James Dean movie, or a Paul Newman movie. And I learned how cool they were. I got to learn how to be cool. Hold my cigarette right in my mouth. And that got me accepted, because before that, I would go off into my stare, trying to find somewhere in my brain to understand what was being communicated to me, or the situation that I was in. And when my parents caught me doing that, they'd slap me on the back. My mother would slap me on the back of the head, but they'd slap me on the back. Don't look like that, you look like an idiot. I was. So, they just didn't let me go off in that autistic stare. So I learned to, when I went into that, I would go into my Paul Newman, mostly my Paul Newman stand. And people started leaving me alone, you know. Except that I was still bringing those naughty, you know, sit down, shut up, you're an idiot, taking those to kids in school. And when I was [unintelligible], I'd say those things. And I was getting beat up. Every year I'd get beat up. So what I learned to do, by the time I was in seventh grade, I learned to pick the biggest kid in the school and beat the piss out of him the first day of school, the first week. And I'd pick a fight. And by that time, my instincts had told me deadly places to hit. So it was an elbow always in the throat first. Hit somebody in the throat, they're not gonna move for two or three minutes. And then I pounded them until they hit the ground and it didn't move. So people left me alone. I wasn't getting beat up all the time. And I was getting beat up at least five or six times a year, pretty bad. So that ended that. So that's how I survived. I did not ever want to hurt people. In fact, when I got those people to the ground and I knew they weren't gonna move, I could have kept beating them. I just stopped and kept going. And when they hit the ground, they didn't move, you know. I mean, they weren't knocked out, but they didn't move. They were just so in shock. You know, it's this little kid. I did, in my junior year, I picked a guy they called the Jolly Green Giant. And he was 6'3 and about 270 pounds. And, you know, he was the guy I picked that year. And he went down fast. When you hit somebody in the throat, you know, they can't breathe. It just stops them, you know? And I punched him enough and kicked him in the knees. He went down. And when I was on his knees, I could see he was not gonna do anything. And I pushed him into the fight.

[unintelligible] just to placate me and everybody else around us. He was new at the school. So, you know, he hit his knees and I stopped. And then he hugged me. That was the last fight I ever had. It was nice, the last fight. He seemed to protect me after that. He knew that I had problems. He came from a family where his parents were both psychologists. So he had more understanding of that. So, I hooked up with this woman who was older than, this girl, who was older than I and a grade above me. So, we really didn't spend a lot of time communicating. So she didn't know my psychology. She just knew I was a nice soul and I wasn't challenged. And we got married when I was 16 years old, she was 17. Had a baby, you know, my first day of, first week in senior year of high school. And she had to be undercover with the pregnancy in her senior year because no married students were allowed to participate in extracurricular activities. So basically, she would have been expelled from the school. So she wouldn't have finished her senior year. She was the number two smartest girl in the whole school. So, then when we had to live together, she realized she had married an idiot. And then everything changed. Plus, postpartum was horrendous for her. She couldn't stand to be touched. Sure, it was partially because she realized who she had married, you know, I don't know, too late. So, that ended in divorce. After I graduated, my mother took me to a tech school to see if I had any aptitude at all. She knew I was a very bad student, and took me to this new tech school, this new computer programming school, in unit record, whatever you call it. And they didn't give you any comprehension. There was no language, it was only geometry, physics, and algebra, and systems. Get the highest marks that they'd ever seen. Didn't get one problem wrong. Every one was correct. So, they called my mother and said, you know, this guy is phenomenal. And she said, well, he doesn't communicate too well, so understand that. And they said, we don't care how he communicates, and he can do things like this, we wanna see what we can do with him. So, and he may be teaching us, was the words they were using. So, I went in there, and I could write a program in two hours, and it would take them six months to a year to write it. And back then, it was on punch cards. They had to write the program and punch it out on the card, run those cards to the computer, and then run the data behind that. And then we had these red wiring boards called unit record wiring equipment, and you had to plug those in to make sure that the computer addressed the program properly, and addressed the data properly. So, I was excellent at that. But they realized I had a problem, so they picked a 25-year-old fellow who graduated top of his class in learning disordered children, special ed children. So, they put him with me.

He wrote all the English, explained everything, and I did all that, plus making 80 grand a year as an idiot. I could have made more if I had understood what was going on. I could have made a million dollars a year, because they hooked me up with Time DC, the third largest trucking company in the world, IBM, and Carte Blanche Corporation, which was the only big credit card company at that time. Diners, and what was it, MasterCard.  Pardon, Diana? [unintelligible], but there was another.

Q: American Express?

A: American Express. Yeah, those were the three. And Carte Blanche was the top. So, I mean, I was on the 10th floor in the executive office with all the junior vice presidents on the president's floor. Well, my office was in there, and I was an idiot. I couldn't even really communicate or relate. So, making a lot of money, I transferred out to Los Angeles because I had an uncle who was getting his doctorate of psychology at UCLA, and they had all these new ways to treat autistic people. So, they put me through shock therapy, LSD therapy, mushroom therapy, any therapies that they could, you know, the CIA was experimenting with them, too. And they put me through all of those. LSD, they gave you 732 micrograms, didn't even take off. So, I got expelled from that test just the first day. And so, I was immune to LSD. And they thought, that may be why, you know, his brain doesn't work. So, they subjected me to all these kinds of things for a year, nothing worked. By that time, I started vomiting blood. I was smoking two to two and a half packs of non-filtered Lucky Strike or Camels a day. I was smoking, I was drinking 11 cups of coffee minimum a day. And I was drinking at least a fifth of alcohol to sleep at night, because I was so wired I couldn't sleep. So, that made a hole in my stomach, I started vomiting blood. The treatment for that was Maalox, which is what? Is Dolomite, it's rock, it's calcium-based rock. So, you're avoiding anything that could allow you to digest, so you stop digesting anything. How's that gonna heal an ulcer? Stupidity. So, what it did was, it created all these minerals built up and started killing my stomach cells, so that created a tumor next to the ulcer. So, the tumor was causing me a lot of difficulty. It was cutting off my esophagus. At one point, I was unable to breathe, I was still vomiting blood, so they said, we have to do a vagotomy pyloroplasty. So, they went in, cut out the tumor, tried to seal up the ulcer, and stretched the duodenum three times its size. What happens is, if you take a rubber band, you stretch it over, when it's fresh, it gets all these lesions and tears in it. So, my stomach had all these lesions and tears. So, now I didn't have one ulcer, I had 500 mini ulcers in my stomach, plus the incision from here to here went tumorous. So, I had a tumor all the way from my stomach to the surface skin. That was, and it was highest about 3 quarters of an inch, and up to an inch and a half wide. So, I said, oh, we have to irradiate that. So, I went through 10 weeks of intense radiation therapy. And, you know, when you get a bolt for an x-ray, it's like 1,000ths of a second, or a millisecond, where that, you hit that x-ray beam, any of that can do damage to your body. They had the beam going like this. Turn off, cock it back, and then do it again. Five to 10 times per session for 10 weeks. So, what they do is they cauterize my spine, turn it into, like taking clay, malleable clay, and firing it at cone 10, you got rock. So, and it made it like granite, so when I move this way, all the nerves in between got scraped like sandpaper, coarse sandpaper.

So, I was in excruciating pain, 24 hours a day, I'd just sleep for 10 minutes, and wake up in excruciating pain, screaming, so I never got any rest for a year and a half. Plus, the radiation therapy deteriorated all the bone around my teeth, so my teeth dangled in my gums. So, if I bit down on anything, including my own teeth, I bled a half a cup of blood in an hour. And I was getting two, one to two, but sometimes three transfusions for those next 10 weeks. And it didn't stop. They would give me shots of vitamin K. It still didn't stop. So, I had to suck everything through straws. My diet was powdered donuts, which I love, RC Cola, Sprite, put those in the blender, blend them together, and that was my meal. You know, lots of cereal. I liked sugar crisp. Well, yeah, you know what sweet sugar crisp is. Do they still have sugar crisp? Okay. I put four tablespoons of sugar with sugar crisp. And blend that with, you know, skimmed, pasteurized, denatured milk. I blend that, suck that through a straw. So, that was my diet. Also, the radiation therapy gave me cancer of the bone and blood. Blood and bone with multiple myeloma. That's how bad that kind of therapy, chemo, I mean, radiation therapy is not therapy. Chemotherapy is not therapy. It's radiation treatment and chemo treatment. It is not therapy at all. So, with the blood and bone cancer, they told me, now, I'm not going through this. I'm just going through this because I'm told to do these things. My uncle was handling it with my doctor. [unintelligible] Oh, they severed all the vagus through my stomach so I'd never secrete hydrochloric acid again. So, they basically made it so I would never digest protein again. So, I'd have to have it made into a protein powder to be able to assimilate it. But they would make me vomit instantly. So, I couldn't hold those down. So, my uncle explained that when I had the vagotomy, they said I'd never be able to eat raw food again, not even an apple. And if I wanted to eat fruit or anything, I had to at least steam it for five minutes to get rid of all of the parasites and bacteria that occur naturally in foods. What a crock of crap. All I ate was cooked foods and no apples and bananas unless they were steamed. And I was just getting sicker and sicker. Then after the chemotherapy, they told me that I had a 1% chance of living if I took the chemo. Hello, 1% chance of living? And you want me to eat this poison which destroys five million healthy cells to every one cancer cell? Not very smart, is it? So, I had the chemo, I stopped it after a few weeks because all my hair completely fell out. And I was defecating, vomiting, urinating all over myself. I was not able to sit. I was not able to lie down in bed, couch, anything. I lived on a hardwood floor. And I was getting evicted from the medical profession, taking my $80,000 of savings. Because when I was working at Time DC as a systems analyst, I had to be a member of the Teamsters, so they took care of half the medical bills. So here I was in my small two-bedroom house in Beverly Hills, in the slums of Beverly Hills. Like, this is considered the slums of your absolute neighborhood here.

And I was living, I had to take all the furniture out of the house, all the drapes, put up plastic curtains, you know, like they'd go up in a bathroom for shower curtains, and live on the hardwood floor. And my dining room and living room were about probably another 10 feet longer than here to here, and probably another five feet in length this way, in width. So I would just go and defecate and urinate in the room in different places, and just crawl, I could only move my elbows, and move around the floor. And two volunteers came from the hospice every week, because I refused to do anything in the hospice. These people were dying, in bad shape already. I was still autistic, saying the wrong things. There's no way I was going to be in that environment. So my uncle told the bank he was going to be dead in a few weeks, and they would take the house back. So these two volunteers, one was an elderly Mexican woman, and the other was an African-American from Watts. 18-year-old boy, making 80 grand a year also, but singing for the Ford Motor Company, one of the goings-on for the new Mach Mustang that was out. And they traveled all over the world, singing. He was a volunteer, and he knew about diet. 18-years-old, coming from Watts, which is a slum area, a black slum area, many, many years ago when he was a child. And he turned me on to raw milk and raw carrot juice and a little raw honey. So he put equal portions of carrot juice and raw milk together with a tiny bit of honey. And if you've ever had chemo or radiation, your taste buds are gone. Everything tastes like postage stamp glue or cardboard. So nothing is enjoyable. No food is enjoyable. All my donuts and RC Cola and Sprite that used to thrill me now tasted awful. But when he gave me this carrot juice and raw milk, especially in combination, everything was so rich and tasty. I drank it, not because I understood what he was talking about, but because it was the only thing that gave me pleasure. I was in pain all the time. So I'm facing just a few weeks, and I'm getting better. A few weeks of life to death. And I start getting better. And after about 12 days drinking this stuff, my autism clicked off. I awoke, and I said, oh, that's a preposition. That's a verb. That's a conjunction. That's a prepositional phrase. All of those data that I'd locked in and [unintelligible] all of a sudden made sense. So I called my uncle, and I had a conversation with him about 25 minutes. And he said, OK, Robert, the gag's over. I know it's you. And I said, no, Andy, this is me. This is really me. So I told him an incident on the day that I arrived in Los Angeles that was of no great significance, but I knew that only he would know about it. He said, it's really you? He had a friend of his who was a comedian who did voices incredibly well, so that's who Robert was. He thought he was the one who was doing a gag on him. And so I said, it's this carrot juice in this raw milk. Maybe the honey in it. 

Maybe the honey was just a sweetener. My uncle, trained by the medical profession now in the universities, said, oh, no, no. It's all a lot of work, finally coming to fruition. The shock therapy, the chemistry therapy, the brain chemistry, psycho drugs, that did the stuff. So I mean, that could have been possible, and he did. But when I didn't drink those things, I didn't feel as good. I had more vomit and diarrhea. I had more nausea. I had more pain, and the pain was excruciating anyway. But I could tell that it was the food and not their medical treatments. So I decided that the pain was so great, I was going to die. So I got myself really, really tired and sleepy, which is normal anyway. [unintelligible] sleep for 10 minutes at a time for two days, got into a very, very hot bath to drown myself. So I woke up two hours later floating in cold water, alive. And I had put Epsom salt in the water to make sure I relaxed. It caused me to be buoyant. So my head didn't go underwater and I didn't drown. But I had no pain. And I thought, ah, hot bath, water, buoyant. I had no pressure on my back. I'm floating. So I lived in a bath 14, 16 hours a day, where I got my sleep. And I would drink this caribou and raw milk a lot, like a gallon a day, because I was perspiring so much by being in a warm bath. I had to wake every two hours, of course, to let some water out, or some of the water out, and put hot water in, because I'd wake up just freezing. I was in pain badly. But at least my back was not in excruciating pain. So over the next year and a half, I started getting better. Of course, I was kicked out from the house. Got an apartment. Wasn't able to work, so I became an actor. Actor who doesn't, who can't comprehend, but I had no short-term memory. So the dialogue for me was a very difficult thing, but it was lots of fun. And when I also, when the autism shut down, my idiot savant side of the math shut down. I mean, I could still do systems analysis like nobody's business, but it wasn't like this anymore. I had to sit down and work it out. Plus, then I had to write, you know, because I still worked for Carte Blanche Corporation, Avco Corporation, when they bought that. They ruined it. They killed [unintelligible], and I had increased, in three months working through them, I had increased their profits by 500,000 in the first year. It's the third month, over a million dollars. And then they just brought in these other analysts who screwed it up, didn't make any sense. So they killed Carte Blanche, the best credit card company in those days. So anyway, I lost that talent, but I was able to make a little bit of money doing that, and active. So then I started earning more money and experimenting, got lots of books and read and read and read nutritional books and trying to learn everything contradicted. One book contradicted everything in every other book, and it was like, who can make sense of this? So I knew that I just had to do it by experience.

You know, my own system of mastership was apprenticeship, and my body was gonna be my master. My body was gonna tell me what worked and what didn't. So I experimented diets and everything. At 27 years old, I was well enough to get on a bicycle. I only suffered pain about two hours a day in my back. So I would do yoga positions when it would start, you know, after about five minutes of pain. I was doing yoga positions, the plow and the spinal twist, to make sure my back was, the vertebrae were stretched and the tendons on them and the muscles were all relaxed and stretched, so it wouldn't grind on the [unintelligible]. So I was able to get off my bicycle, and I traveled on my bicycle for three years, all the way down to Yucatan, you know, South Mexico, all the way up to Alaska, across the United States about five times, and in that three years. So I lived outdoors, and I wanted to, I lived with all kinds of animals, observing them, what they did. Nobody in the wild cooked anything, and they were incredibly healthy. Only around toxic dump sites and pollution were animals sick and diseased. Out in the wild, they were all healthy. You couldn't tell an old one from a young one unless they were less than a year old. The old ones had just as clean as [unintelligible] as the old one. Maybe in the eyes you could tell that they were a little older. But otherwise, no health deterioration. But I was a vegetarian, fruitarian, raw fooder at that point. And by living outdoors, I stopped eating the raw dairy, the raw cottage cheese, the raw eggs, and all of that. I went to a pure, pure... religious, you know, metaphysically higher plane. Yeah, I was dying, I had to put myself on the other side, of course. So I got multiple myeloma again, at this time a little bit worse. And I was in Alaska at the time, and I'd been with a tribe in Yucatan, and then the Yaquis in northern Mexico, the Sioux in North Dakota, and then the Inuit in Alaska. And they all told me to eat raw meat, that's what I needed. And you know, I had believed everything but raw meat, the parasites. I didn't wanna be an idiot again. So I completely shunned the raw meat issue. And I just thought the Indian tribes had a big smoke signal, they reached up thousands of miles and said, here comes the white boy, tell him he can eat raw meat and kill him. And we'll get him back this way. So I'm up there with the Eskimos at the end of the, this is August of 1976. And I'm in Alaska, it's getting cold. They had like one month of warm weather, and that's it. And then at night, the temperature starts dropping. So I had gone down to about 118 pounds. Right now I'm 180, so you can imagine what that was. 119, 118 pounds. Every joint in my body, ached and ached, as the temperature dropped below 15. So I was gonna take my bike and get the hell out of there. And they told me to eat raw meat, so that would solve my problem. Again, I thought, they wanna kill the white boy.

So I was leaving, I packed my saddlebags on my bicycle, and saw this one Eskimo digging up this hide out of the ground, buried about six to 12 inches out of the ground, unwrapped it, and it was this green, black, patinaed, white, moldy material inside. And I was curious what they were gonna do with it. So I got, it wasn't about 10 feet of it, it was like, you know, a slaughterhouse that had been abandoned and not cleaned after about seven days. [unintelligible] I was getting a headache just smelling it, and the kids were around, jumping up and down like it's cotton candy or something. So, and I thought, wow, this is something. And they wrapped, there was a bird signal that came from downwind, and they wrapped it up and buried it again. And I said, what's going on, what are you doing? He said, well, it didn't stink a half mile downwind, so it's not ready. They buried it for another five days. So I unpacked my saddlebags, I had to watch this, what they were gonna do with this, because from all of my high society conditioning, this could kill people. This was mold, fungus, gangrene, who knows what it was, on this matter. They were going to eat it. And I thought it was just one pouch of it. On the day, like five days later, they dug it up. And no signal, so, and it wasn't the same one, they dug up another one. And it reeked a half mile downwind, so they started digging, there was a whole acre of these. And we only, you know, quite a few of these tribes gathered together every year for this, eating this stuff. So there were about 40, I think there were 46 people all together, and they had an acre of this stuff in there, probably, you know, four and a half feet apart, buried, in each direction, so that was a lot of them. In a 36 hour period, they ate all of it. And they didn't sleep, they had all this energy, and they danced for 36 hours, didn't stop, they all danced and sang, and drummed for 36 hours. They got me to eat a ping pong ball sized amount, and, you know, they had to put... I had some cotton balls with me, so they put musk oil on them and stuck them on my nose, so I could get them down. You know, the texture was fine, it was like, you know, soft candy or braised in brandy lamb, you know, just melted in your mouth, but the odor was horrific, which made me want to vomit. And after it was done, you know, five days it was worse. Five feet from it I was dry heaving, you know, so that's why I put the cotton balls in there. So I went back to my campsite, you know, get my sleeping bag, I was gonna leave the next day, I had seen it, then it went on for 36 hours, you know. So I would wake, go in and out of sleep, but when it came to get up, you know, there's only two hours of really slight darkness in Alaska at that time of the year. Well, about three hours at that point. So I'd have to let the sun beat on my sleeping bag for two hours, and then get out of the sleeping bag naked in the sun for 10 minutes to 30, I mean for 25 to 35, even 45 minutes, before I could move, before my joints didn't ache so bad.

And after having that ping pong ball sized amount of that rotten stuff, I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in like 30 minutes, and then in the sun for only 10 minutes naked, and diminished the pain that much. So I went back to the chief, and I said, what was that herbal mixture that they all had and had me take a little bit? He said, no, that was a caribou that we beat, you know, into a mush. The mixture was, it was either whale or seal water, I don't remember which, and then we buried it to let the earth's creatures, that's what they call them, pre-digestive forms, same way that happens with that. That happens fast, because we're going into winter, we need to stock up on those organisms before the winter comes, so we can make it to the new health [unintelligible]. So, that was the reason for eating so much at that time, of the year, before winter came, it got very cold. So, I didn't [unintelligible] because to me, the only thing I saw that decayed like that was in a compost bine, leaves and food, like peels and vegetables and things, molded like that. I never saw meat like that, of course, gangrene, but I wasn't thinking gangrene, that green and their patina was gangrene. So, I thought they were lying to me, they wouldn't tell me the truth. So, I left the next day, and I was so weak at that point, I hopped on freight trains going back to California because I wanted to die. I wanted to go fast myself to death in an old Indian burial ground. So, I get back to California, and I start fasting myself to death, drinking about two gallons of water a day so I didn't get too bad of headaches. And I got down to about 96 pounds, and a den of coyotes, and I picked a foothill in the canyon where the coyotes lived up in the canyon, just my luck. So, then, the den of coyotes came down every night, waking me up at midnight, barking at me like crazy things. And, I mean, it sounds like they're actually crazy people going off and having a party or something, so screaming and yelping and all of that. And then, when they get down to about 50 feet from me, they'd all go silent except for one, and that was like a distraction, so those would go in washes in front and behind me. So, after about 10 days of this, 10 or 11 days of this, that was the point where I could feel them. Because when you're dying, and I was dying, fasting myself to death, my body's eating itself, you go into another state of perception. So I was able to feel where those animals were as they were going to. And I counted 11 of them. The next night, they caught a jackrabbit and offered it to me. Probably [unintelligible] degree, and no dairy for about four and a half years, at that point, down to 96 pounds. They were offering me this rabbit, and they had ripped it open, one had held the head, and ripped it open at the stomach, so it was open here. And they put it on my foot, and put it on my sandal feet, my bare feet at that time, and bleeding all over me. The rabbits don't have a lot of blood, but it still felt warm.

And one of the reasons I became a vegetarian was because I wanted to reach a higher spiritual level and not kill animals, and I loved animals. So I put this Easter bunny on my feet, and it repulsed me. And then this dialogue that my uncle had had with my cousins, his children, and my brothers, who were going rabbit hunting. Of course, I couldn't go rabbit hunting, because I was [unintelligible]. So they were going rabbit hunting with their .22 rifles. And my uncle said to them, and this just came back [unintelligible], I think. And he said, now, when you shoot a wild rabbit, they have an organism in their intestines, or microbe, whatever he said, that will take over your intestines. And 24 to 48 hours, you will die a very painful, miserable death. So you have to cook it completely through until it's brown inside. There is no pink or white meat. It has to be brown inside. So you can cut it both ways. When you skewer it, and rotate it so it's open, so the heat gets inside. So that went through my mind. I said, 48 hours of intense stomach pain, I can do that. And I'll be dead in 48 hours. Put it away. So I thought the coyotes were trying to help me die quickly, so I didn't have to suffer so much. It's like getting into the hot bath. You're going to drown, I thought. So I started eating the rabbit. Came right back up, you know, yuck, raw, warm kind of flesh. And then I went back to those times I had to sit and eat those vegetables without vomiting. So I got back into that state. Five minutes to psych myself into that spot. Started eating the rabbit. After about, I believe, three to five bites, it was delicious. I was eating it ravenously. And I ate three and a half pounds of the seven-pound jackrabbit. I shared the rest. God, can you imagine? They didn't eat the fur, the hide, the bones. They ate absolutely everything. Wouldn't you like to have teeth like that? Eskimos do, they ate bones. Those bones, they'd sit and chew on them in the evening and suck on them in the morning and actually digest them. But I'd never seen anybody else besides dogs and cats and other animals and things like that, pigs. So I thought I was going to die. So I went back to my campsite to die. And I knew I was dying because I felt good. I felt really good. And the only times I had felt like that was when I had near-death experiences where, like, two times on the operating table before they revived me, my body, my consciousness left the body and I hovered over it. No pain came with my consciousness. Pain stayed in the body. So that's the way I felt as I was walking back to my campsite after eating the rabbit. So I knew I was dying because I must be leaving my body because I have no pain. I was walking, and I have no pain. 

And I feel energetic, so I feel light as I walk. So I'm definitely leaving my body. So I get in my sleeping bag, go to sleep. Wait until the next morning, I'm still in my sleeping bag. I didn't die. But it was like after that ping-pong ball size amount decayed, whatever it was, the Eskimos fed me. I had the same experience. I was able to get out of the sleeping bag with the sun beating on it for about 30 minutes, out of the direct sunlight with my naked body for 10 minutes. And I was functional, more functional than I was before. So I waited for the time to come where the microbes would take from the rabbit, would take over my intestines. 24 hours went by, nothing. 48 hours went by, nothing. 72 hours went by, nothing. And I thought, more crock of shit from the medical. Here I am, energetic. I feel better than I ever have in my entire life. And I just ate something that was supposed to absolutely kill me, and here I am. And they told me that after the vagotomy, I would surely, if I ate any raw food, be sick. But yet, for all those years, I ate all those raw foods. And felt better and got better. But when I cut out the dairy and cooked meats along with all the foods, I started just deteriorating and going back into disease. So I got on my bicycle, before I lost energy, and went to three farms and made deals. Shoveled manure, milked goats, milked cows, did whatever I could to exchange my labor for raw chickens, raw beef, eggs, lots of dairy, butter, cheese, everything, fresh milk. So in two and a half months, I gained 55 pounds. First time in my life I was able to dig, and shovel, and milk, and do physical things eight, 10 hours a day, and enjoy it. Once in a struggle, my father put me in the hospital many times because I couldn't even sweep the porch. I was aching in pain. I had no energy. And he just thought I was being lazy. So here I was, thriving. So I went back to Los Angeles, spread the word. Raw meat is the answer. Raw dairy and the raw meat was the ultimate energy food. And everybody said, are you crazy? You're gonna get a brain parasite to be an idiot. I said, I've been there and done that a long time. So I just continued eating, and only three days a week. One meal, three days a week, plus three meals a week of raw meat. But it was like a pound, pound and a half at a time. And then my life went on, and I got very sick eating a poison mushroom. And I had to start eating meat twice a day to recover from that. Took a long time to recover from that. It was a death cap. And you'll read about that in a new book if you haven't already. And so I learned to eat raw meat twice daily at that point. And that made a huge difference also. Huge difference. So over the years, I just continued experimenting. I made lots of money as an actor, $13,000 for two hours of work. And that's what my agent got me.

And when I was doing commercials, sometimes I could do one commercial and I made $50,000 out of it. Every time it ran, I got paid. It ran in the United States or countries, or depending on the locale, I got more money. So I was also an artist. I did motif, trompe-l'oeil, murals in very wealthy people's homes. Even the Nakagami family, billionaires from Japan. I even got to do their home. So I was making $200 an hour doing that. So I put $3 million into renting out labs and doing lab experiments with animals to find out what was quality and what wasn't, what was true and what wasn't. So I spent all that money and went down to nothing again. So finally in 19, excuse me, 2001, I finally started saving money for the first time in my life. And I've spent all that, you saw that, from the porch of my house, where was it up there? Porch of my house in the Philippines, I have a farm there. Are you going to, that's, whoop, I just got rid of it. So that's, are you going to begin? Oh, it's off. So that's from the porch of my house, that's the North View, that's Vietnam right across there. A couple hundred miles across. From an island in the Philippines, so. And that's just the view over there, then you've got another 180, two hundred, two, complete 180 view, so I still, I'm living from hand to mouth. But that's okay, I have a farm that I really love. And so I'm here today to share my knowledge with you. And we're going to, I used to do a format where it was all about the food, the body, and how to understand and comprehend, and then what to eat and how to combine foods. I'm not gonna go in, I'm gonna go into that only for about two hours today. Then we're gonna take two and a half hours, and I'm gonna tell you what detoxification is. I'm gonna show you how people and you may detoxify so you won't be afraid of it. So you'll never be afraid of your body again. You will be afraid of doctors' terrorism. You will understand that you will never listen to a doctor again about all of their tests, medical tests, the crap that they trap you in, to twisting your mind into following their inane, stupid treatments that never heal. If you look in the, you know, the pharmaceutical houses write the medical procedures for doctors. Merck's this big, the word cure does not exist in those thousands of pages. The word cure, excuse me, the word cure does not exist. The word heal happens 53 times, always in conjunction with a wound or an incision from surgery, it is not about healing your body from disease. They want you to be hooked on medication, that's where they make the money. That's what it's all about. So by the end of today, you should be completely trustful of your body and endure some of the crap you have to go through, and on the other side, you stay away, you have to go through it so you don't panic and do something that will be harmful to your system.

So let's take a break, there's food in there, and anybody who hasn't signed up for the workshop that we're going to endure. Your work is to stay awake and stay...

[audio cut]

A: ...other food company specialists, and the health department will tell you, the way I derived that what worked was what I ate and what digested properly. Then to prove that, I got a friend who was a, I did a TV show with him, a game show, where you had to figure out who was who, and it's personal, because [unintelligible]. Anyway, he was a forensic specialist. And I was a nutritious, and everybody claimed that I wasn't a nutritionist. I was the wrong, nobody believed I was a nutritionist for some reason. Even though one girl stood up and said, I've taken nutrition in school, and I know how to expose you right away. How many amino acids are there? And I said, you mean the eight essential or all 22 amino acids? Her jaw dropped. That should include everybody in there. Almost everybody on the panel thought that I was the false guy that I wasn't a real nutritionist. Anyway, this forensic guy, he won the show because nobody guessed he was the one. Well, not actually, because everybody else lost on me. And, don't I look like a nutritionist? Actually, no, I didn't get it. So, anyway, he's a forensic specialist. He did autopsies for private people, sometimes for the county and state of Los Angeles. And he let me have access to 22 courses to autopsy with him. Now, some of them had died of disease, so I didn't want to choose those. I wanted to choose those who died of so-called natural causes. So I chose eight. And I took the livers, the gallbladders, the stomach and intestines, and the salivary glands of these people. And I had a network of 12 foods. I had vegetables, leaf stalks and roots. I had nuts, soft and hard. I had fish. I had chicken, and I had beef. No, I used lamb, I think it was lamb. And I took the enzymes from the salivary glands, put them on each food, break it up. So we had eight of each different item exposed to the salivary glands. So there's eight of all these 12 categories. So you know how many, that's 92 specimens that I studied. So I put the salivary glands, I put the bile, I put the hydrochloric acid from the stomach lining, I put the enzymes from the intestinal tract, small intestinal tract on there, and bacterial environment. None of them had been [unintelligible]. And these were given to science, but I got to get them first, because I was assigned it, so that forensic specialist was able to let me have first dibs on those eight bodies. He was going to give me dibs on all 22, but a diseased person, you don't know how everything is changed. So the exposure of all of these on the vegetation, it was from 2% to 4% etching in and digesting the vegetation. 2% to 4%, that's all. In the nuts, 6% to 7% only. It was mainly the starch in the nuts that was broken down and could be absorbed and digested by bacteria. Then, the salivary glands, the bile, the stomach, secretions like the hydrochloric acid in the intestines, other enzymes.

But mainly the intestines just repeat with the stomach, which is first hydrochloric acid, and then at the bottom of the duodenum, bile, which comes from the gallbladder. So the etching in the meat and dairy was anywhere from 90% to 100%. Raw meat and raw dairy, it etched 90% to 100%. That means that we are built and made to eat dairy and raw meat, and eggs also. So all three of those digested 90% to 100%. That's pretty amazing, 90% to 100%. Maybe that's why those guys did better. They didn't have disease when they died, because they could digest that much of their food if they ate those food combinations. Now, I had no idea what they ate in their lifetime. But their enzymes and their hydrochloric acid for bile was proved to me that we are mainly meat and dairy and egg eaters. The fruit was etched by about, oh, 60%. But they ate a lot of alcohol. And not all the enzymes in the intestine destroyed certain digestive bacteria. And it was put in the intestinal tract. So I had to come to the conclusion that fruit is a medicinal thing we should have. And of course, with me, and most people who eat a lot of sweets and alcohol, I think it's going to be a problem. Yeast infections, illnesses, stuff like that. And more viral detoxifications. So that's how I arrived at the proper foods that we suggest for our anatomy, physiology, and biochemistry. So when the food goes into the mouth, you chew. The bacteria, and now we've got more bacteria in the salivary glands than any other animal, including dogs and cats. But not more than the fly. The fly will spit on its food, its hydrochloric acid, actually, is in its saliva. So it spits on its organism that's going to eat, and it starts dissolving it before it even sucks it up. So its stomach is right there, exposed to the remaining civilization and the whole world. But next to the fly, and all fly species, we have more bacteria than any other creature. That starts our digestion with all this bacteria, and it's acidic bacteria. We have an enzyme, which is ptyalin. Only the horse has that, and that's to break down carbohydrate. Now, it's such a small amount, it's probably something we adapted over time by eating all the grain and the other high-carbohydrate foods. But it was low and not common in our salivary glands. And not all people have it, just some people. So then the food goes down the esophagus, down to the stomach, down to the stomach. The stomach lining forms hydrochloric acid. Remember, I had my vagus nerve severed, so I don't supply hydrochloric acid in the stomach much. Backs up into my mouth, so I've had teeth problems all of my life since I was 20 years old, had the vagotomy. So I have high hydrochloric acid in my salivary gland. If my stomach couldn't do it here, it's done it up here. So I dump lots of hydrochloric acid. And I usually have a lot of bad breath because of it, but I have [unintelligible] Which the doctors did to me when they severed the vagus nerve. So I suggest, like, the fly a lot going through my mouth. So I'm more like a fly than any of you. And one of the reasons is because the fly eats more than any other animal.

So it needs to dissolve it and absorb it quickly, or else it won't be able to fly. So that's one reason they have to pre-digest its food outside of its body. Because they do eat so much. The rabbits, they just seem like mad, wild dogs that have been hungry all week. So when it gets down to the lower duodenum, the bile is from the gallbladder. Now, the gallbladder doesn't manufacture bile. It's only a storage tank. The liver makes bile. The liver's exclusive job is to make bile, to digest fat. It's to fractionate fat molecules to recombine them after bacteria eats those fats. And they're recombined in the digestive tract, in the lymphatic, in the lacteal system, and the limb system. Now, the lacteal system is a web network that comes off of the intestines where all food is absorbed. Whether you're eating blackberries, blueberries, dark red meat like seal is black. Every food, when it's properly digested, is milk. Milk. And it looks like milk. That's why the lacteal system that absorbs those nutrients from your digestive tract is called the lacteal system. Lacteal means milk in Latin and Greek. So, it's milk. White as white can be. White, or off white, as milk can be. And that's what is absorbed. All food, no matter what color it is, is properly broken down by bacteria. And bacteria is 90% or more of digestion. Your digestive juices are only necessary when you have large particles of food that need to be broken down into small molecules so that bacteria can eat them and digest them. So, bacteria and good parasites like trichinosis, we're told that's bad, trichinosis exists in all primitive creatures of the porcine and humanoid species. And they are digestive parasites. Just like our bacteria is a parasite. It lives on our food and releases its waste, its urine, its feces, and its sweat as our food. So we live on shit, piss, and sweat. And when you think about that, they're going to get rid of all of your fears about all that garbage. I've got to wash my hands after touching my penis and my vagina. You know, that's all nonsense. Because the wastes that we discard are not supposed to be toxic. They feed the earth, they feed beetles, they feed worms, all kinds of creatures eat fecal matter. In urine, what does it do? It's high in nitrogen. It's a fertilizer. Your urine is nothing other than your blood without red and white blood cells. With some ammonia. Why does it have ammonia? Because the kidneys form the ammonia to keep you from discarding red and white blood cells out your urine. You'd be anemic. You'd be leukemic. If you urinated your red and white blood cells every time you urinated. So the kidney produces ammonia and the red and white blood cells are repulsed by ammonia. So they won't go past into the kidney with the other fluids. So really, all of the environment of your red and white blood cells and what urine is, was [unintelligible] ammonia.

There are many tribes and even your astronauts in India, people drink their urine. Our astronauts, that's what they drink, their urine. They don't have a water supply up there. They have a urine that passes through a filter. It shouldn't be passing through a filter because they're getting rid of some of the good protein by doing that. And that's why Indians in India, they eat a lot of, a lot of them drink their urine because they're vegetarians. And they need to reprocess their protein. And it's very effectual for them. When I was a vegetarian, fruitarian, I drank almost all of my urine to recycle the proteins. Otherwise, I'd lose twice the amount of weight. And I was eating 7 to 13 pounds of food a day. But all that fruit was just ripping my body apart. And a lot of it would end up in the urine. So I'd recycle my proteins by drinking it. But with the belief that I was going through detoxification, I came out through the other side better, instead of whittling down to 96 pounds, which I did. So the urine is not supposed to be toxic. Your feces, your sweat is not supposed to be toxic. You're just getting rid of byproducts, which other creatures can eat. Just like the feces, the urine, and the sweat of bacteria is our food. And when it comes out of them, it's all white, like milk. So it's absorbed into the lacteal system and goes to the lymphatic system. Now the lymphatic system reconstructs it into nutrients for the whole body. The lymph system is responsible for feeding every cell in the body, as well as cleaning out all of the waste, all of the byproducts. The lymphatic system has a big job. The blood has one job, to deliver oxygen to the cells so that we can have energy. But when the lymphatic system is blocked, what happens? The body tries to use blood to transport nutrients. So what's that going to do to your energy level? It's going to drop dramatically. Now when I was a child and looked at my grandparents' workers on their farm, there were men in their late 40s to their mid-50s still working on this farm, they'd spend their whole lives on that farm, throwing bales of hay over 30 to 50 pounds heavy up into a loft, 15 feet up into a 12-foot loft. You've got young guys, 20, 30 years old, they're using a forklift. They can't get up there and do that. The amount of energy that has been lost by our diets is tremendous. By the chemicals in the food, the processing in the food is astounding. We have 80,000 chemicals that didn't exist 100 years ago that are now in food and manufacturing. Manufacturing of food and then agriculture to grow the food. So, poisons everywhere. The bowel is different from the small intestine. The small intestine takes their waste from the bacteria and feeds the entire body but not completely the nervous system and brain.

The bowel, that's why we have a separate intestinal tract, the bowel, which is not anywhere near as long as the small intestines. The small intestines is very long. The bowel is very short. The bacteria, especially E. coli, in the colon, breaks down their waste, becomes food for the brain and the nervous system. So if you have depression, you've got no bacteria. Or you're not eating enough fats and proteins to feed the bacteria in the colon. And people on skinny diets, their small intestines are going to digest everything. There's going to be nothing left for the colon. So people's brains and nervous systems are lowering in ability to function because they are not getting fed. So, and then most of the nutrients are absorbed in the sigmoid colon, and that's where, you know, if you get very dry fecal matter, that's a good thing, although it's not comfortable because it shows you're absorbing every bit of nutrients that went into the [unintelligible]. So constipation, real constipation, is a blocked intestine. But having hard fecal matter that's very dry is a good sign. Only vegetarians poop liquid. All of your carnivores discard very dry matter if they've been eating raw meats their whole lives. It will always be hard and dry. When I lived outdoors, the wolves, the coyotes, the foxes, the cats, whether they were mountain lions or bigger cats or smaller cats, in the wild, they always produce hard, dry fecal matter. But they don't have a problem moving it because they have enough mucus. We have so many toxins in our rectum and the sigmoid colon, we know so much scar tissue and dead cells. We don't produce enough mucus to help that dry matter slide out easily. So you need to put butter. If you've got very dry fecal matter and it has a hard time coming out, put some butter up there. Put some raw cream up there and help it. If you have depression, you need to feed yourself, your brain and nervous system, from the other end. And treat this like a mouth too. And put raw cream, raw butter, coconut cream, equal portions, three tablespoons of each, and just a quarter teaspoon of honey. Put it in a four ounce jelly jar. Shake it. Put it in a bowl of hot water. Hot enough to make your hand uncomfortable after six or seven seconds, but not harm or burn your hand. Leave it in there for four minutes. Do this before you go to sleep. And if you want a better brain, you want a better nervous system, do it even if you don't have depression. Do it once every two weeks, once a month, to feed the brain and the nervous system. It will stabilize it. You take a bulb syringe, preferably a four ounce one. You can absorb it all. And you don't have a lot of air in it, but squeeze it in. And when you do that, you do that before you go to sleep. And when you do that, then you're on all fours. You bark like a dog.

You get a lot of great entertainment. You go like this. Some people do it this way. Some people do it this way. I prefer this way. This isn't comfortable because I can't go down and do it. But then once it's in there, and if you have a larger bulb, let's say a six or eight ounce bulb, when you squeeze it, don't open it until, you know, stop. Don't open it beyond where all the fluid is up in there, in the bulb. If you do open it, you're going to have tons of air in there, and then you're going to have pain from having air squeezed into your [unintelligible]. Not comfortable. So once you get it squeezed in, you put your face down on your hands on the floor. Then you roll your stomach like a belly dancer. It could be fast or slow, up to you, for about four minutes. Then lie on your right side, because now the matter is here. You want it to get both over your transverse colon and down your ascending colon. So you lift your left leg and roll your stomach again. And you don't have to roll it... I'm a good belly dancer. I didn't realize. So when I was a kid, I saw a belly dancer. When I was three years old, I was a good belly dancer. And I still am able to do this. You don't have to be adept at it. Just in and out, probably. But I can roll it, you see. And that makes it move faster.

Q: I just want to mention an easier way. I mean, I've tried doing it. But if you do a shoulder stand... 

A: Yes, you can do it that way.

Q: Put your back against the kitchen cabinet. Then you're upside down, and then you can get in.

A: Yeah. Some people can't get up on their shoulders. They can't stay up there. They'll get headaches, neck aches, and stuff like that. So, you can get in a shoulder stand and do it. But then while you're up there, you know, you're up in this position. Here, on the shoulder stand. Okay. It's not easy to measure up against a cabinet or wall. So, trying to manipulate getting in and getting this ball, you know, in the right position. She must have it all worked out in a way that made it easier for her. For me, it's not easier. But, for some people, like her, it definitely is easy. So, do it whatever works.

Q: Be creative.

A: Yes, be creative. And get it up in there. Feed the brain the nervous system. And it will stabilize your brain and nervous system. Because your brain and nervous system are always getting the leftovers. So, it's like an orphanage. The little kids stay scrawny because the big kids take all the good stuff first. Okay? So, you feed the brain and the nervous system. You'll stabilize and get it stronger. Because it will be getting fresh back for the first time in their lives. And it makes a huge difference. So, do that once every two weeks. So, once in a month minimum. And people who have depression should be doing that every three days. Until the depression passes.

Q: Butter, butter, and coconut cream.

A: Three tablespoons of each. Cream, coconut cream, and dairy cream. Quarter teaspoon of honey. Three tablespoons of each. Butter, coconut cream, and dairy cream.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Warm water. It's all it takes is warm water. Pardon?

Q: What's a bulb?

A: Bulb syringe. You're on the internet. You see those little baby ones that are two ounce where you clean out their ears? Just get a bigger one. They used to sell them in your, you know, [unintelligible] stores and drugstores for years and years. Now you can only find the two ounce. You have to go online. It's like that... Carro has one. C-A-R-R-O has one. And they have a four, six, and an eight. They only manufacture one at a time. When it runs out, sometimes they'll do the four, sometimes they'll do the six, and sometimes the eight. It's a crapshoot which one you're going to get. You want four ounce because that's all you're putting up in there is four ounces. So that′s the half.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you do it twice, that means you have to stick it in twice.

[laughter]

A: So I call that a suppository. Fat suppository. It feeds the brain and the nervous system. Now, the liver has one job. Its job is to make bile to digest fat. The storage of bile goes into the gallbladder. Now, the gallbladder, like I said, doesn′t make bile. It just holds it, stores it. The gallbladder holds enough fat, I mean it holds enough bile to digest how much fat? About 30 pounds of fat. Why do we need a reserve of 30 pounds of fat, of bile for 30 pounds of fat? When we were hunters, our ancestors, in fact the American Indians and even the tribes in Africa, they eat the fat first. Every animal will come for the fat. You have to eat it first. So nobody else gets it. So they may eat 20, 25 pounds in 24, 48 hours. They need that reserve to do it. If you have your gallbladder removed, that means you can only eat enough fat every hour that the bile is produced by the liver. So that means a tablespoon of fat an hour. You can't sit down to a quart of ice cream without taking a chance of going into cramps in your intestines and diarrhea. So that gallbladder is an important element if you want to enjoy raw ice cream. Lots of pig fat. I'll sit down to, you know... So one time I was in China. I found this little feral pig. And it was the most delicious fat I ever tasted. I ate three pounds in one night. And it went back to [unintelligible] the next day. It was so delicious. If I didn't have my gallbladder, I would have had diarrhea or vomit from eating it. So you need that bile. And it's all produced by the liver. Now the liver is not supposed to be a filter for toxins. And the medical profession says, oh, your liver is a filter for toxins. It's not designed to be that way. But your body is going to throw toxins wherever it can. The liver is a good thing. Pancreas is a good thing. That's why we have so many diabetics. Remember, it's always industrial chemicals that cause disease. Bacteria, microbes never cause disease. Now, how do they come up with and convince you that bacteria and microbes cause disease? By brainwashing you into believing that. And the science that they use is, they think [unintelligible]. They'll put some human cells in this chemical that keeps them alive, but doesn't promote, you know, thriving cells. They're basically cells that just lie there in a suit and live and breathe, but they're non-functional. You put liver cells in there, it'll produce bile, and that's what the liver does. If you have pancreatic cells in there, it'll produce insulin. So you've got cells lying in a soup that keeps them alive, but non-functional, and decaying, gradually decaying. So then they injure certain bacteria, strep, salmonella, campylobacter, never E. coli. 157H7 is a man-made, genetically modified, toxic E. coli. It does not exist in nature naturally. It's a lie. There are certain bacteria which are janitorial. They go down and eat... They go in and eat dead human cells.

Whether it's liver, pancreas, intestinal tract, stomach, lungs, no matter what it is. So if you have a so-called bacterial infection, like say you have salmonella infection in your gut, that's a result of the contamination in there and the chemicals that have damaged the stomach cells or the intestinal cells. They are there recycling those dead human cells. They are janitors. The janitors didn't cause the debris, the waste and the damage. They're just cleaning it up. So they put these microbes in this Petri dish with these human cells and what's to be expected? You put janitors in human tissue, human cells that are decaying and dying because they're not in the right environment, and they start eating them. And the pharmaceutical medical community says, see, they're eating human cells. Their byproducts create all this waste and that can create cancer. It can cause, you know, vomiting, diarrhea. It can cause arthritis and rheumatism. They have all of these wild things that they tell you that come off of this false test. Those salmonella, you remember a hundred years ago, you used to read about it a hundred years ago? They took a bath in June? That's why a lot of people got married in June, because they were clean. You never took a bath since the fall and winter. In early spring, why? Because you would expose your body to a lot of ill health. They didn't have a lot of fats. Well, there were some people who did. They'd have their dairies, they'd have their cream and butter and all of that, but they didn't make a lot of cream and butter unless you were rich, because that meant throwing away a lot of the milk. So there was not a lot of butter and cream sold 100 years ago. Only to the rich. The rich could afford to buy a lot of milk and separate it or pay the farmer to do it, but it meant a great deal of waste and a high price. So unless you had additional cows that afforded you to be able to pay for your livelihood and your farm, you couldn't even afford to use your milk for butter and cream as a separate item. So people weren't getting that amount of fat. So if you cleaned the fat off of your skin, you became very vulnerable to dry skin and also to becoming very cold. So what did we have on the skin? So we didn't peel away like snakes, you know, every few months. We had salmonella. 6,000 varieties of salmonella that were eating the dead cells so the layers of dead skin wouldn't get too thick like a snake. Right now, if you take a laboratory test, you're going to find about 200 varieties of salmonella in your nose, in your eyes, in your ears, in your rectum, in your armpits, in your crotch. [unintelligible] got rid of those. Even if you bathe every day, you will still find them. Was that Penn & Teller, you know, that thing? What did they call that show? Something bullshit?

Q: Bullshit.

A: This is bullshit? Not some other names? Okay. Well, they did a laboratory test. It was interesting. They took a swab of a rectum. Maybe of several rectums. And then they took swabs of the nose, the mouth, and the ears. And they found that there were five times more salmonella in these places than the rectum was relatively clean of salmonella. So they said the asshole was the cleanest part of the body. That's bullshit. That's about the only thing they get right. Otherwise, they're just parroting everything else that the industry wants them to say. I mean, I've watched five of their shows and can't even stand watching it because they parrot whatever the industry wants them to say. Mostly [unintelligible]. Better than the medical profession. Maybe they're right 5% of the time. The medical profession is only right 1% of the time. So, let's talk about the neurological fluids. The neurological fluids, of course, transport a lot of metals throughout the body because the nervous system and brain function off of transmission of light and electricity. Electromagnetic, kinetic energy goes through the body. So, you're going to find a lot more metals in the brain than the nervous system. If you're eating food that's been cooked, you've taken the bonds of calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium that makes those metals non-acrid. It keeps them balanced so it doesn't dissolve tissue. So, it makes them free radicals, which will do damage. So, we're going to have brain and neurological transmissions, but they won't be efficient, and they can be wrong. A lot of people are wrong. Why? Why? The brains aren't functioning well. Even cooking your food is an industrial process that has 32 by-products. The 32 by-products I list in the second part of, the last 50 pages of this book. The three main ones which are getting press and attention are acrylamides... Have you ever heard about acrylamides? That's a carbohydrate by-product that causes cancer. The state of New York City is outlawing high acrylamide food, which means you can't manufacture donuts with trans-fatty acids because a lot of trans-fatty acids are plastic oils. When you hydrogenate an oil, you turn it into trans-fatty acids, and that's plastic. So you've got liquid plastic. So New York City is outlawing trans-fatty acids. A lot of your acrylamides, or four high acrylamide content foods, are processed in those plastic oils. And often, they're not even food oils, they're mineral oils. Even clean petroleum oil that's been bleached and cleaned to the hilt, and they'll mix that, they'll hydrogenate it, they get it in plastic. 1,000, 10,000 year shelf life. They never have a loss. But what does it do to your body? It turns into plastic. Then, you feed your body the plastic. Then what happens? As it dries in your body, it turns into little beads of plastic. Finite, almost nanoparticle plastic balls, or different shapes. They become crystallized. Because crystals, it might try to use crystals to break them down to minerals. The minerals, like salt, is an explosive. Salt fractionates food, fractionates anything it touches.

You know, you have substances like the body, we use substances like that to try to break it down. But, ultimately, it jams your skin, your lymphatic system, everything. So, you stop respiring your waste. 90% of waste is supposed to leave through the skin and perspiration. Now, with all this trans-fatty acids, since margarine came out of Crisco, 90% of lymphatic systems do not secrete. 90%. I mean, 90% of you don't respire properly. You're blocked with these plastic molecules in your pores, in your lymphatic system. So, you can't clean the waste. So, if the lymphatic system gets jammed, guess what? It can't spend its time feeding every cell in the body, because it can't even get the lymphatic system to move. So, then the bloodstream takes it on. And that's what I talked about a few minutes ago. You lose energy if the red blood cells can't deliver oxygen to your cells. Now, there's no burning. You know, oh, I burn fat or I burn carbohydrates as fuel. That is a misnomer. They want you to get the idea that burning things is a natural thing, and cooking your food is natural. It's all worked into their systems, [unintelligible]. Your body doesn't burn anything. It takes fat. It uses oxygen along with vitamin C or citric acid. Citric acid isn't vitamin C in the body. Citric acid and vitamin C are not the same thing. They do the same thing a lot of the time, but they are not the same. So, [unintelligible] citric acid is not true vitamin C. But it will oxidize fat. It will help utilize and convert fat into energy, but not in a good way. A by-product of citric acid, a non-natural citric acid that they make in the laboratory, like vitamin C, 99.9% of all the vitamin C out there is citric acid. 99.9% of it. So, that citric acid has a lot of toxic by-products. With Linus Pauling, all that vitamin C would happen to him. He went from a guy looking as healthy as me, down to a skinny, scrawny, angry, you know, volatile person. He had no fat left in his body, nothing to buffer the nervous system. No fat that was violent to buffer the amount of information that would travel to his brain. So he was overreacting from all that vitamin C. Now I'm telling you the psychological effects of that. The [unintelligible] fat, and everybody gets skinny because fat's bad. That's the rhetoric everybody's given. And this is the exact opposite of what you should be doing. Everybody should be getting fat in a toxic world. No one should be skinny in a toxic world. Anybody tells you, any research you go to, the 1% that's right is that the body uses fats and fats to harness toxins. You'll always find the greatest amount of toxins in fat. Where will that be in people who aren't fat? The brain, nervous system, and bone marrow. Only time, only place that you will find fat in a skinny person. So the brain, the nervous system, and the bone marrow gets contaminated. 

Now what's the bone marrow? The bone marrow is where red and white blood cells divide, mature, and when they mature they enter the bloodstream. So if you have toxic bone marrow, what happens to the breeding and the maturing of the blood cells when they're in that contamination? When they leave the bone marrow and enter the blood, they're only going to be able to carry so much oxygen, the white blood cells are only going to be able to get rid of so much carbon dioxide, and eat so many red blood cells, dead red blood cells. The white blood cells are called phagocytes. In Greek, phago means eat. White blood cells are sharks. They eat dead red blood cells. In our bodies, dead cells go into the lymphatic system if the natural bacterial level isn't high. You're taking antibiotics, you're taking a lot of chemicals, a lot of your janitorial bacteria that are intracellular will be killed. Just like your intestinal bacteria will be killed if you take antibiotics. So the natural janitorial bacteria that takes a dead cell and eats it up, and your body gets to use 75% of it if you're non-toxic, 75% of that dead cell, it can reuse. If you cook your foods, if you eat processed nutrients, toxins, 2-7% can be recycled. That's a huge amount of waste your body has to get rid of. Every day, every minute of the day. So if you're not perspiring properly, because you're jammed with plastic oil, plastic little beads, if the cells can't discard, because they're nanoparticles, so it blocks the cell's ability to respire. It's compounded, it happens on a micro and a macro level. You contaminate the whole body. So, if your cells don't have the bacteria to bring it down, and recycle it there, it has to go into the lymph system. Then the lymph system has to use fat, make it into a solvent with like alcohols from fruit, and create virus to clean the body. Virus are not alive, virus are solvents. Intercellular solvents made to dissolve human animal cells, so that they can be recycled, knocked out of the body, cleansed out of the system, made into a liquid. Hopefully neutralized before it passes to the skin, so you don't have rashes and acne. How many people have rashes and acne? Almost everybody. Because plastic fats, our system, chemicals that are additives, agricultural chemicals, all of those poisons cannot be neutralized in a very suppressed and damaged body. All disease comes from industrial toxins, including the 32 that I mentioned, which are from cooked food. Just 32. But the higher temperature you go, you have a lot more of that. But at pasteurization temperature, you create 32. High pasteurization temperature. You create the acrylamides, which I mentioned. The heterocyclic amines, which are damaged proteins, are also carcinogenic when they collect into a concentrated amount. And you have lipid peroxides, which are the fat toxins that store and collect.

All three of those have already been identified, have been identified as carcinogenic, cancer-causing. The other 29, they don't study enough to see what happens. They don't want you to know. They want you to keep it as is. You eat food that's denatured and full of poisons. It doesn't satisfy you. So most people will keep eating and eating and eating. Other people get anorexia and die because they can't eat, or they stay skinny and very radical and very sensitive and also prone to heart disease because of drying of the heart, drying of the system, MS, multiple sclerosis, MS, multiple sclerosis, muscular dystrophy. A lot of diseases come from all of these poisons, not from bacteria, not from microbes. So understand that if you get a microbe, hey, rejoice. That's going to help clean your system. If you get a viral detoxification, it's a rough one. Viruses are not alive. If you have bacteria, fungus, or parasites eating dead cells in your body, those janitors, they consume waste. They reduce that waste to a small amount. A parasite can eat 100 times its weight in 24 hours, and its byproduct is 1 to 5%. I want a janitor who reduces my waste to 1 to 5%. I only have to deal with 1 to 5%. That's pretty terrific. Bacteria can eat 50 times their weight in 24 hours, and they reduce the waste to 1 to 5%. A great janitor that doesn't work half as fast or works half as fast as a parasite, but still they're both good janitors. Then you have fungus eats about 20, 25 times its weight in 24 hours, but its wastes are highly dry. That's why when you have a fungus, you have lots of itching. It goes through the skin and dries the skin out. The fungus waste will try to pull the fats out of your cells, leaves the cells dry, the epidermis of the cells dry, and that causes itching. But it's still a good detoxification. You just have to bear more symptoms, more rashes, more itching, more irritation, more seepage of fluids out of the skin. If you have a viral detoxification, there is no reduction of waste. It's like taking muriatic acid, going and cleaning the oil from your car off of the concrete, and you mix it in water to dilute it to make it work. So now you've got 2 1⁄2 gallons to 3 gallons of waste with muriatic acid, the solvent, along with the petroleum, dirty, toxic, metal-filled petroleum in this fluid. So when your body uses virus solvents to clean it out, those solvents, again, are produced by the cells. They are not alive. It's just a solid, it's a cleaning fluid. I can make cleaning fluid by going and taking lye and putting lye with some lard, you know, actual lye with pig fat. That's how they used to make soap. Lye and pig fat. And that would just completely clean the body. But they do it in the sun. You know, unless you live in the tropics or in the deep south in the city of Florida. So they take more baths than showers, and they use lye and lard to clean.

Your cells take fats, and they take alcohol from fermenting either milk or fruits, and they'll mix it with that fat, and they've got the solvent. But there's no reduction in waste. In fact, there's a great increase in waste because now you've diluted it. It's in this mass amount of water, fluid, and your body has to discard that. Take, for example, the difference between bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis. Whenever a doctor sees viral meningitis, they panic. Why? Because there's a great deal of swelling. Often people will become paralyzed because of the swelling that tears the nerve tissues in the spinal cord or in the brain, the cerebrum, because of the mass amount of pollutants that are involved. Bacteria, all of that swelling is being reduced, so there's very little chance of them pumping you with antibiotics, and they often do, to cause swelling in the spinal cord, to cause tearing in the spinal cord and the brain, creating lesions. So, the virus is still a good thing, but it's not alive. All these little pictures that you're now seeing of virus, they're all animated. They are generated in animation programs, like Walt Disney creates cartoons. They are not real. Sixty years ago, it was understood virus was not alive. You don't give antibiotics for a virus. It makes no sense. But then, 58 years ago, the pharmaceutical industry said, hey, why don't we change the idea that virus are alive and then prescribe antibiotics? And it took 30 years to wipe out the old doctors who knew that it wasn't alive and they wouldn't prescribe antibiotics. And the new generation come up that were now indoctrinated in a different mindset. And this is the pharmaceutical industry. This is the medical industry. These are corrupt, immoral minds doing this for profit. They want you to be sick so they can earn money. Okay, so we have the lymphatic system. [unintelligible]. We're using the blood to transport nutrients which reduces our energy level by 50% or more in strength and endurance. And the only people that are pumping out lots of energy are those people that have overactive adrenals and ovaries. They're pumping out a lot of testosterone, estrogen and adrenaline. Those are the people that are athletes today. Everybody else is weak. Fatigued because of all the poor nutrition and the debilitation and the corrupting of the human body and its natural functions. So now you know how the body works. So, if you've got an infection going on in there, it's cleaning out your dead cells, then if they collect it, you would become cancerous. Cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve your dead cells and remove them from your body. So your body collects them. First there's fibroids all over the body, then there's tumors.

Women have it lucky because they have a vagina and a uteral area where they can collect a lot of dead cells. So you get fibroids down there. Sure, they don't work as well as down there. They don't [unintelligible] like they used to, but the cancer's not going to their heart or their lungs or their breasts or their neck or their throats or their brains. It's staying down in their area where there's less damage. So, when you get a bacterial infection, when you get a viral detoxification, when you get a parasitical detoxification, are you going to run to antibiotics to stop it? You're going to increase your chances of cancer 5% every time you take antibiotics. One 5%, one 5-day of use, one 5-day of consumption of an antibiotic or one injection will destroy 1% of the bacteria in the body. 1%. On this diet, you can only recover 2.5% a year. On a regular diet, you don't recover at all. So, every time you take an antibiotic, you destroy 1% of your body's functionality. How can that be? You are 260 bacterial genes to every one human gene. You are 99%, 99.9% bacteria. You can't call yourself human, you're bacteria. And what happens with antibiotics? They do not discriminate. They kill everything. They don't just go after bacterial, you know, the bacterial janitors. They go after all bacteria. Five day use, 1% of your entire body. Unless you eat raw meat, raw dairy, you will never recover. That's one more notch down. So you see these old people taking a lot of antibiotics in their life, and you see them going across the street like this. They maybe have 25% of the cells alive in their body carrying 100% of the weight and functionality. And you say, there's a person like that, come on, get across the street. They can't move any faster. There is no way. It's like expecting an elephant on a mouse to be an elephant. It is not possible for them to move faster. They are full of dead bacteria and dead cells, human cells. It's like bricks in the wall. They have very little functionality. And that's what will happen every time you take an antibiotic. When you talk to those people who walk like this, you find out how many antibiotics they've taken in their lifetime. Absolutely astounding. And I've interviewed over 200 of them while my parents were in the retirement community. All those who walked like this took enormous amounts of antibiotics in their lifetime. Others did not. So that is a way clearly to cancer or to complete non-functionality or minimal functionality. So you don't want to stop them. You want to endure them. Now I'm going to show you pictures of different people who've gone through very radical detoxifications.

So when they come upon you, if they come upon you, you're not going to panic and go to some doctor who's going to give you antibiotics or surgeries or radiation or whatever to stop your detoxification. The recipes that I have in this book and some in this book tell you how to endure, to eat the foods that you need to get you through that particular kind of detoxification. And there are over 200 common diseases addressed in here. With over 2,000 raw food recipes and only 2 cooked food recipes. So, we're going to go through those so you get an understanding so you're not going to panic. Now, I mentioned salt as an explosive. Salt is the worst thing next to cooking. If you isolate sodium molecules, they are more volatile than nitroglycerin. If you took one crystal of pure sodium this big, that is a football. And it will take out New York City. Put in New York City, it will take out all the buildings. Or just take out the Twin Towers. It will take out the whole five square miles. Five square miles of all these buildings. My father was one of the inventors for the War Department. The military was working for General Electric to make salt into a weapon. Sodium into a weapon. It was so volatile, one and a half degree temperature change. When it was isolated, it would set it off. They could not control that constant. They could not control it to make it into a weapon. Our government spent two billion dollars trying to make salt into a weapon. It was unfeasible. Couldn't do it. Safely. So, when you take salt, concentrate the sodium into your body, your body isolates the sodium because it's not in food. There are no ion bonds in the salt crystal. You've got other minerals besides sodium, but in small quantities and concentrations of sodium. In your body, those are free radicals. They separate in your blood, and then they start going off. It does two things. It rips the ions out of the cells so they can no longer eat, like a grape to a raisin, they shrivel up and die. Or, the molecules of fat, the smorgasbords of fat, I mean smorgasbords of nutrients that cells eat, is a smorgasbord. You have 93 to 117 nutrients that the cell will eat in its natural form, in nature. So you've got these floating smorgasbords. When the cell's hungry, it opens. One or two ions that are inside will attract those nutrients to it and eat it. A complete, full, balanced diet, 93 to 117 nutrients. Vitamins, enzymes, proteins, you name it, they're all in there. Salt blows them apart. So then when the cell opens to eat, it gets 25 of 117 nutrients, possible of 117 nutrients. Always malnourished. Your cells will always be malnourished when you put salt on any of your food. It will give you a charge because those explosions in the blood will cause you to secrete a lot of adrenaline to deal with the aftermath, the byproduct of those explosions. 

Plus the electromagnetic energy, the kinetic energy, is going to drive the nervous system to increase circulation. Blood circulation. Lymphatic circulation. It's going to increase everything. But it does it in a destructive manner. It's like you can take a child and you can encourage them to be smart or you can beat the shit out of them to be smart. What's going to be the result most often? If you beat a kid, what is that kid going to develop to be? He's going to be violent too. Nine out of ten kids that are raised with violence continue violence throughout their lifetime. If you have a question, it's better that you ask it at the end because when I... One time I started answering all the questions that were asked. I didn't finish till one o'clock in the morning. Because when you ask specific questions, I get into very detailed answers. And it's not good. Okay? If you have a question, write it. And we will get to Q&A period. And that's when we'll deal with answers. But most of the answers I will deal... have gotten to by the end of the workshop. Okay? In your workshop, just stay awake. Pay attention as much as possible. And I will give you a break every hour and 45 minutes. I have gone 10 hours without stopping, but it doesn't work for you. It works for me, but it doesn't work for you. Okay, so... I need somebody to tell me when we've been going an hour and 45 minutes. 

Q: I forgot to ask. When do you want to start the clock?

A: Back when we started. So we've been going about an hour and 45 minutes. An hour and five minutes. Okay, so we have 40 more minutes, so hang in there. Okay, so... Salt is very, very damaging, very poisonous to the body. Now, who would like to debilitate people and make them weaker and in control and have less mental control? Anybody who's ruling here? Governor. Who went before that? King, Queen of England. They basically run the world with 200,000 trusts. They own 70% of all food manufacturing in the world. They own 35% of the land mass. They are wealthier than the Catholic Church. They fund the Catholic Church. They used to fund the Catholic Church. The Catholic Church is deeply indebted to the King, Queen of England and that royal family. The King and Queen of England started the salt. They took over India, took over salt manufacturing. If a native Indian in India went and made salt out of the ocean, they could be put to death. King and Queen's order. That's what Gandhi went against. As an attorney, he was a highly educated, brilliant attorney who became a humanist. And in 1947, they had a demonstration on the beaches. And he had, I think it was one million or more, one or one and a half million Indians out there making their own salt. And you had all these British soldiers out there beating these people to death. 20,000 beaten to death. With billy clubs over their head. Because they were making salt out of the ocean. It was such a disgrace to the King and Queen of England that they gave, so-called gave independence, just like they so-called gave us independence. But who was running the country? Monetarily. King and Queen of England run the world monetarily. And they still do. So, they give India their independence with the form of parliament. Parliament that they buy. Our senators and congresspersons, House of Representatives, all bought and paid for it. You can find 5 out of 535 that aren't bought and paid for. And most of those just go along with it to play the political game, so they can stay in office. All purchased and bought. So, King and Queen of England have been distributed since 1100 and marketed the salt industry on the whole planet. They did the same thing in the 1300s with coal. In fact, it was a health law in London, in Paris, that anybody who used wood in their house for cooking or heating was breaking the law. It was that if you cooked and heated your house with wood, it was more toxic and caused more problems. The exact opposite is true because what is the by-product of burning coal? Mercury vapors. 62% of our mercury in the outer atmosphere is created from burning coal to generate energy, power plants. Black plague. The rats caused the black plague.

Rats, for example, take a hundred trillion cell and it's a hundred trillion, hundred trillion bacteria, I mean high bacteria, the lower, higher levels of bacteria, and then they have bacteria within that. So you've got about a hundred quadrillion molecules of different levels of bacteria in your body. So a little bitty rat that puts out a few bacteria that can take over your body, absolute nonsense. What happened? When did black plague happen? Early 1400s. So from 1310, when the King and Queen of England started selling coal to the English, and look how many of your chimney sweeps were getting cancer at very young ages, dying off at 13 and 15 years old. They were the ones who climbed down the chimney, the chimney hole. So they were using children to clean the chimney stacks. They were dying of cancer by the age of 20, 21. None of them lived beyond 21 years old. Think about that. So what happens? You got a black plague, and the black plague is in the lung. What creates plague in your lungs? Not even wood. Wood will create tars in your lungs, like smoking. So they won't create black lungs, that takes coal and the mercury. So we got 100 years after it started, we have the black plague. So with the King and Queen England, they knew it was their responsibility. Then you had to have chimneys. You had to have ducts where if you, you know, cooked with coal or heated wood, they didn't identify it. For everybody to be healthy and cleaner, you've got to have some kind of ventilation in your house or apartment. So all of a sudden, black plague stopped because there was ventilation. It required ventilation. But they should have been getting rid of the coal in the first place. Gone back to wood if you're going to burn it. Or even healthier, King and Queen of England, they've been mainly raw meat and raw dairy people. There isn't any pasteurized dairy in the entire royal family. They've got some of the best cows in the world. They produce 22 gallons of milk a day, 11 each of two milkings. The reason I know is because my grandparents bought cows at their auction. Every year, they auction off some of their cows. Well, in 1882, my great-grandparents went over, because they were royalty, they were orators to the czars of Russia and Prussia, of Germany, and so they went over and met with the King and Queen's people, not directly the King and Queen, but their people, and bought some of their cows to give to my grandfather and grandmother and my father's son for breeding. These cows were as big as Clydesdale horses. There were others that were this big, around 11 gallons, for milking Clydesdale. And they're pure jerseys, so they're fattened, incredibly delicious, and full.

That's what the King and Queen of England eats. Yet, they've outlawed raw milk in the UK. You can still get it. My patients still get it in London, because they have [unintelligible] on the farm that brings them to London and delivers them. But, take a look at that. The King and Queen of England eat mainly raw foods and lots of raw dairy from their own farm. They do not eat one food. They never eat food in a restaurant. Unless they're using a restaurant caterer and food. They have their own gardeners. They don't eat any processed food. And they own 70% of food processing. This doesn't tell you that they won't even eat the food that they manufacture. Every food they consume is grown on their property and flown to them. Every day. Or every two days. Reagan did the same thing. Ronald Reagan, when he was in office, we spent $1 million every year to fly in food from his ranch in California to Washington, D.C. every week. Think about that. Why won't these presidents and all of these elitists eat toxic food? They'll pick restaurants that produce fresh food. Nothing canned. No canned sauces. Everything is made by hand in the restaurants they go to. And those restaurants in Washington, D.C. are predominant. And those are the ones they solicit. There is no other city in all of the world besides London that has so many restaurants that make everything fresh from fresh food. Even though they cook. Why is that? There are 80,000 chemicals in food. They get into processing, or as additives, or as preservatives. Some way to make it shelf life forever so there is very little profit loss from expenditure, from expiry dates. So, that pretty much gives you the background. Oh, water. Let's talk about water. Water, if you take an archeological class and you look in 101, book 101, up at the top in solvents, what is the first solvent? Water. When we have a soap, we use muriatic acid. We always put diluted in salt because salt, I mean good water, dilute it in water because water dissolves things. So, drinking water, a lot of water, is not a good thing. It dilutes your nutrients, it will thin your mucous coating, the protection of... your mucous membranes, your intestinal tract, it will thin your mucus so your body starts eating away at your intestinal lining. It causes gas. It causes indigestion. It causes lots of many, many problems. And it thins your blood so much that your concentration of nutrients in your blood is [unintelligible]. All animals, and I've collected urine from over 100 animals and 50 different species, every one of their urines were orange and dark black. Every one. No matter if they were vegetarian, herbivorous, or carnivorous, omnivorous, it doesn't matter. They all had dark urine. And then you have these doctors and these so-called naturopaths that go around and say, your urine has to be cleaner, it has to be cleaner, it has to be cleaner. And it's clear, you're in trouble. You've diluted all of your nutrients. Your urine should be dark always. 

Water dilutes, water melts your body, dissolves your system. A certain amount of that is necessary because of the amount of kinds of poisons that you have. You need to make some virus. Virus has to be utilized with water. So let's say half a cup of water a day, if you're an average-sized person. If you're 6'2", 6'3", or whatever, you're going to need a cup a day. Never have it all at one time. Tablespoon at a time, ounce at a time only.  Tablespoon is good. So you sip it throughout the day. Make water that you need to be nutrified. When the body carries nutrients to the cells from the digestive tract, from the... Are you getting very warm? Do you need this on higher? Everybody's fine? You're just overheating.

[laughter]

A: I'm too I'm boiling. I love it. I'm perspiring so much. So, your body needs a certain amount of good water. Now, when the water naturally is combined with your nutrients, you're feeding water to your cells, always concentrated with nutrients. When you're drinking pure water, only water is getting to that cell. Did you know that the cell cannot absorb the water unless it's ionically bound? So, all that water stays in the blood, makes your urine clear, but it's doing nothing beneficial. It's diluting and breaking down your blood. It's taking those smorgasbords along with the salt, the sodium, and it's breaking those down, it's dissolving those smorgasbords. So, you've got two things going on, water and salt. Now, when you have milk, milk's 86 to 90% water. 86 to 90% water. With water that's bound to nutrients, every ionic molecule in that milk has H2O accompanying it, attached to it. So, when it goes into a cell, the cell gets their H2O. When you drink water, it is only to dissolve poisons in your body, not to nutrify yourself. Water is non-nutritious. The amount of minerals in the water are minute and they're not ionically charged. You know, you get these people, Oh, you've got this ionically charged water. You put it into this machine and, you know, now it's ionically charged. Where are the other nutrients? So, the cell gets some dry minerals with no nutrients and water. What's your cell going to do with that? It can't burn it. I mean, it can't utilize as energy. You can't use it to do anything but maybe clean some toxins out of the cell. But, ultimately, it will dry out. What happens when you put water constantly on your arm or leg? It dries out. What happens when you put fat? You put milk on your skin. You put butter. You put cream. You take fat and you put it on your skin. It will never dry. It nutrifies the cells. Water will dry you out. All day long. Salt and water will dry you out. And damage your system. So you have to eat small amounts of that. Now, any time you cook a food, you separate the ionic bonds with the H2O, evaporate some of the water in the cooking, but you fractionate it. So the water that no longer carries with the nutrients to the cells, gets chucked out the kidney. So, meat. Meat is 55-70% water. But, all of that water is bound to the proteins and the vitamins and the fats and all of the ion... It's ionic charge. We don't need water. I drink about a cup of water a month. I used to drink up to a cup of water a day. When I was out there living in the wild and when I was a fruitarian, I drank two gallons of water a day. Down to 96 pounds. Two gallons of water a day. Wiping and drying out my body. Putting me back into leukemia and blood and bone cancer. So, it doesn't work. 

And if you can get clear about it, anybody see Trading Places? Okay, remember that story [unintelligible] where they can take this black bug off the street and make him into a stock trader that's better than their best? Which one's his name? Dan Aykroyd. So, they take a lot of Murphy, Eddie Murphy, off the street, put him into this job, educate him, and he becomes a phenomenon. Now, the bet is, the two heads of this stock firm bet one dollar. One dollar. It's what they bet on these two people's lives. And they ruined Dan Aykroyd, the character of Dan Aykroyd's life, because they threw him out and put in this Eddie Murphy character. Well, in 1960, that was taken off of, that story was taken off of, a bet that was made between the owners of Coca-Cola. One bet the other one that he could sell water for more than he could Coca-Cola. There's no time frame on it. What is water now [unintelligible]. Gerolsteiner, good drinking water, the absolute best drinking water, or, you know, Apollinaris, or any of those fine waters that were not owned by Nestle. Nestle have bought quite a few of those water companies. And they're trying to buy up all of them. So they can process them. So, we're paying $2.59 for a liter? No, it's a quart. They move it from a liter to a quart. So, we're paying $2.59 for a liter. How much is Coca-Cola? $2.50 a half gallon. Double. We're paying double for water over Coca-Cola. The guy won his bet. It took 40 years, but he won the bet. So how did they get you to start drinking water and believing to drink water? So now you'll pay a fortune for it. Now that they put fluoride and chlorine and all the [unintelligible] water, you can't drink it. You have to buy a bottle of water to get the same water. So, how did they do that? They hired doctors to say everybody needs eight glasses of water a day. Which is absolute bullshit. It's not based on any science or any experience. They just started advertising it. Doctors say this and they put the ad in the paper. On TV. On that. And they had these so-called philanthropic organizations that put out those ads. Drink eight glasses of water a day. Who paid for those? Coca-Cola, through some company that they created. Like I created the Right to Choose Healthy Food and I'm really out for Right to Choose Healthy Food. These people were out to sell water. But say it's back and behind some trust that they created that says it's for your health and they care for your health. So it's the stint. So you got all these people believing out of it the need to drink eight glasses of water a day. There's no value to water except as a solvent. And that's minor. Half cup to a cup a day. Me, a cup a week, I mean a cup a month.

That's about what I drink, a cup a month. I drink up to three quarts of milk a day. I have a sport formula, if I have a sport formula, I'll have two quarts of it a day. So everything that I eat is predominantly water. Like probably on the average I'm eating 90% of my foods contain, 90% of my food is water. Because it's all raw and enzymatically and ionically bound and charged. So I can get up here, I can sleep three hours, three and a half, four hours a night, and can go on and on and on and on, work 21 hours a day, 20 hours a day. And I do it every day, day and night. I don't even get jet lag. But I work it and I carry it on in my container. If I don't exercise, when I exercise it may be different. When I go to my farm, for some reason when I get on a farm, I like to be active. So I'll be out there, you know, working with my farmers, you know, digging. You know, whatever it is, I'm out there helping them. And I will sleep about five hours on those days when I'm actually active. But that's only because I only do it about, you know, ten days at a time. And, you know, maybe once every three months. I'll sleep five, sometimes six hours on those days. But if I were doing it every day, I doubt that my body would be used to getting rid of the toxins faster, so I wouldn't have to sleep as much. That's to be seen. When I live there full time, I'll be able to tell you truly what that is, but right now it's theoretical. But I sleep very little, I drink very little water, but get lots of water in my [unintelligible]. And if I drink a lot less, little plain water. To neutralize the body. Okay, how far are we into it? We're going to start getting into...

Q: One hour and twenty-seven minutes.

A: Okay, we're just going to go ahead and break now. Because I was getting into showing pictures, and I didn't want to stop.

Q: Are you going to take any questions during the break?

A: We're going to take a 10 minute break.

Q: You need a break.

A: I don't need a break.

[break]

A: We're going to get into, we're going to see how the body detoxifies. First, I'm going to show you the first pictures. For a detoxification that I went through three years ago. That was in 2009 when they were about to release the swine flu vaccine. The swine flu hoax. So, I did a show in February 2009. International radio show. Where I wasn't planning to talk about the swine flu. But that's what I was asked. About five minutes into the show. So, the whole show ended up being about the swine flu hoax. I had been through the swine flu hoax in 1976. Where Ford was in office. Went on this television and took the swine flu shot. And it's interesting that Mr. Rockefeller, our Vice President, didn't. Because it was his pharmaceutical house that we made him take the swine flu vaccine. Rockefeller. So, in that I was working with Ida Honorof, a consumer advocate, that was just syndicated on 3,200 stations across the world. And she was, she along with Dr. Eleanor McBean from San Diego, California, were campaigning against the swine flu hoax. They had all kinds of documentation, because Ida Honorof was a world-renowned consumer advocate. She got the press, and back then the press was, a lot of the press was still owned by families, and not by big corporations. So they still listened. They were interested. So they carried, you know, when Ida Honorof and Dr. McBean talked about people dying from those swine flu shots, they got the press there watching. In the first three, the first six weeks, 3,232 people died. Children, mainly children and the elderly. And they died of the swine flu. So if they got immunized for it, why were they getting the swine flu? Why were only people who were immunized getting the swine flu? Because the only way you can get swine flu is to be injected with pig [unintelligible]. That is the only way you can get it. You have to be a pig to have swine flu. So it has to be injected. So I had all that documentation and I had a few other minor shows, radio shows, spots, internet shows about the swine flu. But this one threw me because it was an international show and that is all we talked about for 50 minutes. In that 50 minutes I told people there are books to read, where to get the documentation. One of the callers, him, said that the FDA shows only 46 people died of the swine flu shot. I said no, 2,332 in the first six weeks. And then they pulled it off. They put it in vaults and that is what they are going to release is the swine flu this time. They are going to put a little extra ingredient in it and ship it out there. It is the same thing. It is a hoax. So after that show, I got death threats for five weeks. Then I brought a rap group in the UK, heard that show, and they spent a million dollars on a video called Just Say No to the Vaccine. Seven minutes and 32 seconds. A million dollars.

I mean the shots, kids being shot and screaming and their arms blistering. In a Vietnamese town back during the Vietnam War, missionaries were coming in giving them vaccines, and the grandparents would come in and chop their arms off. Because they knew it would poison the children. This is what they knew psychically and intuitively. They'd chop the child's arm off and put it in a pile. So there's a whole pile of arms. And I think they still have those shots in there. But that one is still on there. You can see it. Say No to the Vaccine song. YouTube. And you'll come up with it. Thirteen seconds into it, you hear my voice from that show, the only way you can get swine flu is to be injected with it. You are not a pig. So they have my voice going throughout that. And I'm the only broadcasting voice speaking in that. So I became a national threat, an international threat. So I left L.A., went off to the Philippines, started hiding out on small islands until it was all over. I figured it would be all over by August or September. The hoax would be over and everybody would know. And I'd be safe. And in April, just a few months later, April 5th, I was in a little town on a little island, Leyte, in Tacloban City in a small, nice hotel. I woke up in the middle of the night. This hotel had brick, glass blocks as the windows all the way across. So lots of light coming in from the porch. And these two thugs are on either side of me. I'm half sitting up when I awaken, cloth is falling down my face, hypodermic hanging from my arm. Two of them are on the bed beside me. And these two, you know, American or, you know, European-looking characters, they weren't Filipino. I was in the Philippines. Standing next to me were liked CIA agents. And the one to my right, they were shocked, I was shocked. And the one on my right grabbed the cloth, put it over my face. I was out in a split second. Like I said, I had had ether several times in my lifetime. And it took 15 to 17 seconds, even 19 seconds for me at one time. This had me out in a split second. Odorless. So it had to be a high-grade anesthesia, that was probably military-grade or something like that. That they used clandestinely. Because all medication is supposed to have an odor. So you could detect it, so you're not driving in a hospital and it's outgassing and you start falling over, you know, on yourself. So it all has to be odorized. This was absolutely no odor. So I woke the next morning and I just thought it was a bad dream. And I started rolling over. I ached in every joint. I was so nauseous. I started vomiting. I looked at my arm. I had three lumps with a puncture hole in it. No evidence. No hypodermics. No evidence of foul play. No jam, door jam broken. Nothing. They obviously got in. They had high-tech equipment. So they had injected me with something.

I didn't know what it was, but I knew I was very, very sick. If I was standing for five minutes, I'd blackout while standing. So I had to get on my knees fast and fall to the floor so I didn't hurt myself. What's going on? If I was standing for five minutes, that would happen. So I called the hotel desk and I said, I need a driver right away. And I mean right away, as quickly as they can get here. And I said, I can tell that driver I need to go to a wharf. I need to find either shark or stingray. So the driver got there about 35 minutes later. I passed out multiple times in that time. And I told him, you're going to have to help me to the van. You've got five minutes to the van before I'm likely to blackout. So he said, do you want me to take you to the hospital? I said, no, please. This, you know, this house is the hospital. And I said, no, no hospital. I need to take care of my sickness on my own. So I just told him I had chemotherapy and I was vomiting and all this. So if I went to the police like this, They said, well, you're just shooting up with drugs. There was no evidence. So I knew what I was going to do. And the whole wild story of how they come after you with a swine flu and all that. But the fact of it is, six countries have sued [unintelligible] for the swine flu. We're telling them and the World Health Organization along with them. They sued them all. Those six countries sued that organization, the World Health Organization, and the vaccine companies for marketing, saying, Oh, the whole world is going to get the swine flu. There are going to be 200 million and more people die. Maybe 300, 500 million people. You need to buy this vaccine. So these countries put hundreds of millions of dollars. And we put $8 billion. The United States pushed that $8 billion to its buddies in the pharmaceutical industry. And yet last year as an office, he gave them a waiver over any vaccine harm done to any citizen. It means you can no longer sue any of the pharmaceutical companies for any vaccine damage to you or your children. Think about that. Think about that. They're all tied up. So I was sick. I got to the wharf. One wharf didn't have any shark or stingray. And that was unusual. Because they go fishing every day and usually get a shark. The shark sells pretty fast. So I went to the second wharf and found... I couldn't walk around. He went and went around. Found a baby stingray. Two and a half days old already. The reason I want sharks, one of the sharks or a stingray, is because every day they double in ammonia. All meat will get, you know, starts smelling like ammonia as it ages. Because ammonia starts being produced by the meat as the bacteria breaks it down. Just the way the kidneys create it. So I got this baby stingray. Chopped it up as finely as I could. Ate it. Vomited many times to get the poisons out. But like the kidneys, they use the ammonia to keep the blood cells from entering the kidney. 

Natural ammonia that's in food as it's aged, like in high fish or in high meat, it will cause the red blood cells not to absorb poisons. [unintelligible] the mercury and aluminum, squalene, they can put in that vaccine. I'm still going through heavy pain all through here. You can see one of the scars. There's another scar in the middle.

Q: Did you put the rotten fish on you?

A: No. Didn't need it. It was already in my body. Oh, well. My blood, my body started exploding. So the actual, the blood, the body would in slow motion open up. Cells would fall off and just drop off. So I had, looks like I was in a shrapnel... Looks like I was in the Vietnam War and got shrapnel. Got them all over here, here. Looks like bullets went through, or shrapnel. This was the worst spot here. You can see it. Whole thing exploded. Up here too and here. So, and down here also. This was the worst area. It also went to the foot. Lasted for seven months.

Q: Like ulcerations? It was like ulcerations?

A: Yeah, ulcerations, yeah. But I mean, actually, just, you could just watch it. In an hour one would open up. Completely open up. So you knew it was a chemical explosion. So, you know, and aluminum not only stays in your body for indefinite times unless you know how to get rid of it. Your whole life it will stay in your body. But also aluminum is an added explosive. When you add 7% aluminum powder to gunpowder, it makes it five times more explosive. So, you've got salt, and also [unintelligible], along with the aluminum. And then the mercury dissolves the cells and you have the exploding point. So, it would happen every anniversary in April and it would last from five to seven months. The second year, in 2010, it was this way. It started exploding. This arm here instead of up here to here. So, quite a bit of it all around here. Every year, a lot of it around here. It's like all these scars all over here. And then, in this lower arm, you can see all these scars. Quite big scars. This one's a real big one. So, just exploding. And they would go on and seep, you know, these poisons for months, up to seven months. And usually it ends by September. So, this year ended in, excuse me, last year it ended, in 2012. It ended in July, and the first part of August. But then it came back in September. And I've been going through it. And this arm, this far, as far as I can take it without pain. But once I get it beyond that point, still, there I can do this. With a little pain. But right in this area, right here, the pain is excruciating. And for four months, this arm was so bad that I couldn't even use it. A lot of the time. And just barely moving, it was excruciating. Not moving, it was excruciating. To the bone and the muscles. And this arm is smaller than this one. You can see the deterioration. And this arm was bigger than this one before those injections. So they got me pretty badly. But I prevented the red blood cells with the ammonia from absorbing those poisons. Because if the blood hadn't absorbed it, I would be dead today. I would have been dead within probably three days. But I got the ammonia on the same day, within about 12 hours of those injections. It was enough to save myself. But all I can say is they wanted me to die of swine flu. They wanted to find swine flu in my blood to say, see, he said that only if you have swine flu... But I [unintelligible]. So I not only knew what to do to defend myself, but also, you know, reveal what they had done. I waited a year before I told anybody about it because I didn't want somebody throwing me in a hospital. And people have a tendency to want to do that. So I avoided death. Now the reason I now know that they gave me the swine flu shot was because from January through April, I had this smell of rotten pork coming out of my skin all over my body. And I hadn't eaten pork at that point in three months. And during that whole time, I did not eat pork. Yet I was reeking of it.

So my body was finally to the point where it was actually throwing off the pork cells that were in the swine flu vaccine. So we're going to take you through some of this and show you. I think this is the first. Now these would show up in like two hours. This was the second year, I guess. That was a scar. This was from last year. And there's the leg. This is the second year. I don't know if I... Yeah, I took pictures. I just don't know where they are. It's all over. You can see it's graduating and getting worse and worse every day. And this was the second year. This is the left foot. First year it was the right leg and foot. And you can see this is April 17th, my birthday, 2011. And you can see what it did to my nails. I had... Anything in my body I could say was good looking was my feet. Everybody said I had, you know, the David statue, the Michelangelo. Everybody said I had his feet. And I did. I had gorgeous feet. You see what they did to my nail? Yellow and gray and brown and green. And that's what it did to my feet. My feet are almost back. Nails are almost back. This is a three-year process. This is after soaking it. There's a little fly in between [unintelligible]. After soaking it in water, it gets the swelling down and more of the poison down to the skin faster.

Q: Did you have any of the effluvia analyzed?

A: Yes, I had that analyzed several times. It was high in mercury and aluminum. I still have gray skin. Some of you may remember beyond three years ago, I used to have gorgeous color and gorgeous skin. My eyes were completely blue. They went gray, and I'll show you those pictures too. In the intestines, I got all these metal spots after it. That was after cleaning it and letting it dry a little bit. But you can see all the green and gray stuff coming out of the skin. And that turned into a cancer. That turned into a tumor that lasted about three months. You can see how it's developing here. It's quite big, quite hard. And I got it to go away pretty quickly. That was the beginning. I don't know where I got those from 2010. This was 2012. This was here. Now you can see all the wrinkled skin, how old it looks. All of this is wrinkled like an old man. I never had wrinkled skin in my life. My buttock in here just all wrinkles up. Still a little bit that way right now, but that was here. And as I threw more and more of the poisons off, the skin is revitalizing. So I thought this was a mild one for 2012. But then it came on heavily in September in the arm. And with inside pain you can't photograph it. And I didn't even scratch that. So it came right out of the skin and stripes several places in my arm. I'm just going to take you to, I'll go down the list here. This was also, this started coming out, and this was a tumor that formed on my chest. It started off as one of the explosions and also turned into a tumor. And it took about four months to completely dissolve and go away. Now it's all scar tissue. See all these scars? All those places where it exploded. See this big one here? Big one here. Big one here. I got them all over my back. It was just big. Especially up in the shoulders. It looks like bullets have gone through the [unintelligible] and come out of my back. And I refused to go to the Vietnam War, so it wasn't that. Okay, this was a mercury detox that came out of my face. This was in... I have to look at the... That was... 2002. This is a mercury spot. Okay, so you can see the mercury coming out of the jaw. I had 16 amalgams. I had them removed in 1978. Now the mercury is coming out of the nerves and all over the jaw in this area. 

Q: Are you sure that's you? [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: And that is not pus. Pus is dead as white blood cells. If your body is in trouble and you have white blood cells or phagocytes, they eat dead human cells. But mostly just red blood cells. When your body is in trouble, the white blood cells can migrate into the intestines or anywhere else. So when you have pus, that pus is 90-99% white blood cells. Good thing. With just 1-10% poisons in that fluid. That's why your dogs and cats will lick the pus. They're not going to let those white blood cells go to waste. And we look at it as contamination because the pharmaceutical industry, medical industry, keeps you believing that pus is awful and dangerous and ugly. And you shouldn't be pussing. This is not pus. That's dead cells, killed cells.  A lot of people think it's pus. That's not pus. It's all dead cells killed by the mercury coming through the skin. And I had that... It was tested. It was 90% mercury and 10% of the toxins that were in it, 10% aluminum. This was a finger detox that I had one time. This was the finger, I cut it off when I was three years old. I took meat from here, skin from here, and sewed it on the top. [unintelligible], and after a year of eating raw, this tissue that they took from here and put here turned into steel like rock. I could put that thing through, fingers through glass and not even hurt. I could use it as a weapon and hit somebody. And I've done it, and I did it when I was a kid. You find all those fights that I got. I could hit somebody right here really hard or right here, and it could really hurt them badly. Well, a year after I started eating raw meat, it got infected all around here and it fell off. Fell off. And I had no finger print there, no pattern. It fell off, and now I've got the full fingerprint and no sign of having that graft except for this. Well, when that happened, I was three years old. I grabbed a lawnmower and just chopped a finger off. And they had injected it with penicillin and tetanus shot all around the finger. Well, this is that coming out years later, 50 years later, 60 years later, 60-some years later. As you can see, I've got a finger pattern now. That dead skin is all here. Just a little bit of a scar here. You can see what it's doing, it's killing the cells all around there, turning yellow and white. The body's throwing those dead cells off the skin. This is swelling and circulation. White blood cells are filling this area right here, eating some of that. It starts leaking out of this area too. I didn't catch it when it was leaking. I didn't force it at once, and I didn't have a camera at that time. You can see it's filling up here with white blood cells too, eating the damaged cells here. So that was at its worst. And we're back to the decay. What you can see here is the decay. It started bleeding a little bit, not much. And that's after it was almost all over. You can see what it did to the nail. See the shape of that nail? It just put a pit. So you put a pit in there. Deep, deep groove. And that's why it's dented in there. It took six months for that to grow out.

So let's kind of see other things that can happen. Now this is a woman who came to me with cancer of the nose. She was a singer, a nightclub singer, breathing all that smoke, theatrical smoke. They used to use dry ice, safe. It should have robbed oxygen from the air and you have less oxygen. But this new stuff that they have is vaporized, hydrogenated oils. Plastic vapor oil, artificial smoke. So I will show you two of my musicians, one's a singer and one's a singer and a guitarist. And I'll show you their cancers from that. This was in a later stage, I didn't open it up at the earlier stage. But I said, Barbara, you're only going to lose your nose. The medical profession, the week she came to me, somebody told her about my work. She came to me, but a week before she came to me, they told her they wanted to go in and cut all the bone out. All around here and put the plastic bone all in here. And they would have to peel all the skin, put it back in, put the skin back over. Her chances of surviving were, they said 75%, that operation, which is absolute bullshit. An operation like that, you've got a 75% chance of dying. So I said, Barbara, it's so far advanced before you came to me, you've had treatment, I'm not going to be able to stop it before it takes your nose off. So you'll have to be a person without a nose. I said, okay. She said, yeah, but they're telling me it's going to go into the brain within days, and it's going to take my brain away. I said, no, we can stop that. I'm sure we can stop it. I can't promise you, I'm not God, but I'm sure we can stop it. So this is seven years I worked with her, and that's the nose she lost, her nose. Didn't even lose the whole nose, but she died. But she was 70... I think she was 78 when she came to me. So her daughters thought she was going to die that week that she came to me. So at her funeral, her three daughters came up and said, thank you for the seven years that you gave us with her, because she realized we were going to die, she was going to die, we realized she was going to die, so we became very close. We knew each other better in those seven years. It was a wonderful seven years. And they cried and hugged me, which was great. But I'll just take you through some of the pictures so you can see how... Now this is about when she first came to me. This is how much of the nose is gone. Pardon?

Q: How did you treat it?

A: Well, it's just a matter of diet and what I had her eat. So you can see, this is the early stage when she first came to me. That's how it was bleeding when she came to me. And I got the bleeding to stop. That was lots of dry blood at that time. So you can see her nose was... And you can see coming out of her face all the poisons coming out of her face all over. We got that under control. This was the actual first... I don't know, she came to me in 2000. So this was two years after. So it was about... Well, she went in and out of this. But we got the skin under control, except for the nose, pretty quickly. And it wasn't that painful once she got on the diet for about a month. Can you imagine not being painful? But before she went on the diet, she had headaches all day long. Day and night couldn't sleep. You know, was taking morphine and all kinds of drugs. Aspirin and everything that blocked the system. So she stopped taking those and doing the diet after 30 days. Very little pain. Just when she would clean it. And I told her not to clean it for three or four days. But then it would get so clogged up she couldn't breathe through her nose. So she would clean it anyway. About every day, every other day. So... I'm giving you some of the worst case scenarios. So you don't freak out. If anything minor happens to you, compare. Okay. This is a bladder stone. Now, when I was a child, I started getting those tetanus shots at six months old. When I was 18 months old, I had my third one. Remember, they're full of aluminum, which holds the mercury and the other poisons into the body. They started collecting in my bladder. So by the time I can remember, I can remember the day I was born. I remember coming out of my mother's womb, [unintelligible]. The sun coming up right to the venetian blinds over the horizon. I was born at 6.17 in the morning. When I told my mother that I remembered being born in that hospital, because then it was just a room like a bedroom. Venetian blinds, there wasn't some operating room environment. She said, oh, stop telling stories. So I described the room, and the light coming in, and that was at the foot of the bed where she was having the baby. Her jaw hit the floor. I actually remembered. So I have a pretty good memory. But I don't remember a wedding or diapers in my bed when I was 10 years old. But I used to have a problem urinating. My mother started taking me out, you know, having me go to the toilet instead of in my diaper at about 3 years old. I couldn't move fast. It would take a long time before the stream would start, and it would be a very slow stream. She'd get angry and hit me in the back. She'd say, why do you take so long? It would take me 5 minutes to urinate. Most people go in there and flip their penis out. Be urinating in seconds. For me, it would take a full 2 to 3 minutes. Before I get a stream. And it would take 2 minutes for this wild stream to go into the swamp. So that would indicate that I started forming bladder stones when I was 3 years old or younger. So, this was in 2006. So I was 59 years old when this was detected. All of a sudden, you know, it's been like that all my life. I had to wait a long time to pee and take a long time to pee. Just natural. But all of a sudden here, in August of 2006, I couldn't pee. And I was getting pain in my penis. Couldn't figure out what was going on. I had to pee like a dog. 

I had to lift this and then pee like that. And I thought, I've got something blocking it. So I went to a urologist that used ultrasound instead of x-rays. And found the stones. The longest, largest stone in history. And I won't even put it in the... Guinness. Yeah, Guinness. Yeah, they show. And it's the largest. You can see how large it is. The whole thing. Huge. And this was a bladder that was blown up with water. So you can see it better. You know, this whole thing is normally flat when there's no fluid in it. So you can see how big that is. The largest tumor that they had ever seen. This was a huge urology clinic in Los Angeles. And they had five doctors look at it there. My urologist. All these nurses. And they couldn't believe it was that size. They couldn't believe that I only had pain for a week before I went to them. So it was quite large. And they said, there's no way you can pass that out. There's no way. That was too large. So they wanted me to go in with a tube up my penis. And I had those four thread pipes in there. One for a camera. One to flush it out. One as a laser beam that would blast it apart. And one other, I don't remember what it was. But three main ones. And they wanted to go ahead and blast the stone apart. And they said it would take about 45 minutes. Because it was so big. It's almost two hours. When he got to the center of it, the whole center was mercury. With aluminum and calcium, solid, as hard as a bowling ball. So he kept pointing the laser at it and blasting it. It would barely chip it. Usually it just explodes with it all over. So his nurse said, I thought he was going to pass out and faint. While he was doing this. Because if you miss, and the laser beam hits the bladder wall, it cuts it right in two. Causes a deep laceration hole. So he had to be very diligent. Shoot it and watch it ricochet off. Take just a chip out of it. So he's perspiring, she said. He went to at least half a gallon of water. You know, every 30 minutes. You know, as he was blasting it apart. And all of it, the bucket, was five times more water than they'd ever used. They had one person with seven kidney stones, bladder stones. And it had a fifth of that much water. And the water was all gray. Completely gray. With mercury and tin and other metals that had collected for 60 years. Almost 60 years. There's a close view of the same thing. This is it before he started blasting it apart. The outer of it looked like a normal bladder stone, a kidney stone. It looks like barnacles under the water... Coral. Looks like coral. But once he got through that top layer, it became that metal stone inside. So that's how big it was, that huge. And boy, when I got out of there, I went to the toilet. After I woke up, I did let them put me out because they were putting a pipe that big up my penis. There was no way I was going to be awake. All the way up to the bladder. So when I woke, I said, I've got to go to the toilet. I've got to pee. So they had to give me so much anesthetic because I was out so long. I was dizzy and nauseous, wanted to vomit. Took me to the toilet and it was like a horse. I was peeing like a horse for the first time in my life. I peed instantly. It was like two seconds that I was peeing. And it took me five seconds to finish peeing. This whole glob, a whole bunch of water for peeing.

You know, dark and thick like it should be. And then I was able to piss it out in five seconds. It was fabulous. I still don't have any trouble peeing. That's great. I just thought maybe at first it was because it opened my penis so widely. You know, I'm getting [unintelligible]. I still pee like a horse. Now this is a woman with breast cancer. She came to me at this stage. And I was able to get it to stop breaking the skin so much. But that was all one tumor. And she just decided to go for chemotherapy and she was dead a week later. But the whole breast was hard as rock. Now this was a, she was in her mid-forties with three children in Omaha, Nebraska. Now, she had woke one morning and there was a burn. She had been having a lot of back pain back there, a kidney pain in her lower back. So she was putting hot water bottles on like I suggested. Always put heat on the wound, never put ice unless it's just for a few seconds to numb it. If you put cold on a wound, what happens? The swelling lowers. The body has swelling for a purpose. To bring more nutrients into the area to get rid of the damage. If you put ice on that, you restrict the healing, you have more scarring. Look at all the athletes, they go out there and get a cortisone shot, stick ice on it and go back out there and play football. And they should be off the field for two weeks. While their knees and their legs or whatever is mending, with hot water on it every day and eating a good diet to mend it. So when you put cold on something, it shrinks and the area will be damaged. And then you have to get surgery to clean that out. And they're blown out in their late 30s. And they should be able to go on to be athletes until their late 40s and early 50s. If they're on a healthy diet. I have one 68-year-old who is a world competitor in martial arts. 68 years old. And he started the diet about 11 years ago. He came in 35th to 50th place every year competing with people in his weight group who were 15 years younger than he was. Now he's competed with people up to 25 and 30 years younger than he is and he came in 3rd place in the last three years. The first year on the diet, the first year after being on the diet, he came in 5th place. Next year 3rd place, next year 4th place, next year 2nd place. In the last 5 years, 1st place. And he had to go to a lower class, you know, that were younger, even younger, to fight people, fight people who were 30 years younger than he was and he still came in 1st place.

Q: What sport?

A: Pardon me?

Q: What sport?

A: Martial arts. His name is Pem Wall.

Q: What about [unintelligible]?

A: The what?

Q: Marathon.

A: I got 2 marathon runners. They're doing great. Still coming in, you know, about almost an hour earlier than they did when they started the diet. An hour sooner. Tremendous. So you can see her... It actually burned a hole in her skin. So, you know, that looks like sulfur burn to me. So she had a hole in her skin. Most of them have sulfur antibiotics, a lot of them, so for bladder and kidney. So when she sent me these pictures, I said, you have a lot of bladder or, you know, kidney, urinary tract infections. She said a bunch when I was a kid. Also, I had respiratory, so I was constantly taking sulfur based antibiotics. And I said, well, that just burned a hole in you, because in some people, that sulfur will mix with certain chemistry, so when it hits the oxygen, it goes into flames. And actually causes instant burn. Whenever you hear about the people that go into the, you know, spontaneous combustion, it's mainly because of the sulfur antibiotics that they've taken for so many years. So, this is what some people have to look forward to. But it was, it got, it was pretty bad, pretty painful. This is when it started getting better. Reducing in burn. This is when it was at its worst. And that's butter and coconut cream on there. See how big that was when it was at its worst. It actually burned holes right through her skin. Three, four major holes.

Q: Coming out the kidney?

A: That was from that right kidney. It was just out, so this is the kidney right here. Underneath the skin. 

Q: If that's on the skin, that's what you can see. I wonder what's going on underneath that skin that you can't see.

A: Pardon?

Q: If that's what you can see on the surface.

A: What happened to the kidney. Exactly. So good you got it out because if it started going into that kind of poison release, it could have just ruined her whole kidney. Turned it into complete scar tissue. So, she put a hot water bottle on it. I had her put gauze over it during the night so she can tear it open more. And in that gauze she had coconut cream mixed with clay and butter. So the clay would keep drawing out, the butter would protect the cells. So there were a lot of things going on. Now she has scars back there, but they make a nice dragon pattern. So she's got scarification in the shape of a dragon. So it's pretty cool. Now this little girl, she was brought to me at nine years old. This was a year and a half later. At nine years old, this was her life. After vaccines. Father worked for a pharmaceutical company. Making vaccines. So it went right to his family. So this is a year and a half after she was on the diet. She's feeding herself. She still can't talk. This is four years later. She still doesn't talk, but she's entirely functional. Sits herself up, doesn't have to be held anymore. Not spacing out, having no seizures. But this was only a year and a half after being on the diet. Changed her that much in a year and a half. I just got an email from a woman in Switzerland. She had a three-year-old who was completely non-functional like her. He talks. He's got great grades. And she's six years old now. Been on the diet for three years. Completely normal. She was an autistic, just like her. Completely non-functional. And one weekend she contacted me. She says, I'm contacting you because after all this getting well, the doctors want to do the battery of tests. Her bacteria levels are high. All of the indicators, 100% of the indicators, say the child is getting worse and is going to die. And I said, remember in appendix D when I said, only the woman that I was working with who had polio, only when she had the high bacterial and all the bad signs did she improve and help. When they gave her antibiotics before I started working with her, all of her markers were good, yet she wasn't improving. So I explained that to her and reminded her to go back and look at appendix D in We Want To Live. And she said, I know, I know that's what it is. These doctors are threatening me that my child's going to be harmed. I said, my child has been improving with you for the first three years. He didn't improve at all. He just kept getting worse. Now he's normal, going to school, getting excellent grades, and even above all the other kids, and you're saying he's not doing well? Sweden is a little bit... Did I say which one? Sweden. And her husband is still working at the pharmacy. Figure that one out.

Okay, this is a person that has a rash. And you see the bubbles, it looks like impetigo. Now impetigo is when you have a certain kind of bacterial fungal... You [unintelligible] bacterial. There's all this equal bacterial and fungal detoxification. And you see it popping out of the skin all over. Very, very, very painful. Now the red in there is iodine and salt. And he took a liquid iodine supplement. And the iodine is the yellow and the salt is the red. So iodine and salt mixed together coming out of the skin. So the backside, side, close view. Take a look at this. See how the skin is just throwing it out? When it hits the surface it hasn't been neutralized enough with good fats and minerals like calcium, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium. Normally when you have toxins that are broken down by the lymphatic system it will use calcium, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium to neutralize the acid compounds of industrial contamination. Even our own body waste is highly acrid. And the body uses those minerals to balance it. But you can see it's not being accomplished properly or fully. When it comes out of the skin it's causing all the damage as it comes to the skin. Now taking hot baths is very important to speed up perspiration so it doesn't get locked up in the skin. And you've got some rash, you get in that hot tub. A hot tub is preferable because it stays at a steady temperature for an hour and a half, [unintelligible]. Perspire that out, you'll have less rash. Considerably less rash.

Q: Remember I had that I showed you? I still have those little bumps, but I'm wondering if it's locked into the skin I showed you.

A: It is locked into the skin if you're not perspiring it out. The hot water will let it out.

Q: It feels a little bubbly.

A: Yeah. Then it's just the skin turns into scarring. Then it's locked into the skin. So, you perspire it out.

Q: In this situation, would you, like, [unintelligible] that?

A: No, you don't want to do that. Because then what you do is the oxygen gets into the very weak damaged cells, hardens them. And it seals them, can't eat anymore, and they die and become tumor, you know, dead cells. So, you never want to do that. You want the body to open naturally. Heat will allow it to do that. So, by the time you get out of the bath, you know, the water has coated and prevented oxygen and neutralized to an extent. Water is very, very healing when you're bathing in it and not when you're drinking it.

Q: So, that dynamic of, like, scratching that away is not good?

A: No. Well, the dryness, see, this is a fluid where the body is trying to prevent, take the toxin, put it into a liquid, neutralize it, and keep it from burning the cells. But you can see the cells are already bleeding. When you tear that away, oxygen gets in and they solidify. They dry and harden. They die.

Q: It seems like the fluid that holds the toxin can then be torn away.

A: Yes, but you need to do it in a 30-minute period. Get it into the hot water. Let those things dissolve. The good water with milk in it. I suggest people put milk and vinegar. The formula's in this book.

Q: It will open.

A: Yes, it will open and drain. But it will do it without oxygen in it. In the water, there's no oxygen. Very little oxygen. So it won't dry out the cell and cause it to die and become a dead cell. It doesn't dissolve. That's what tumors are. Tumors are dead cells the body can't dissolve. And that's what she has is lumps. Because it didn't get out of the skin.

Q: [unintelligible] eradicating?

A: You put pineapples and pineapple on it. You know, fresh slice of pineapple. Papaya on it. Over a year, it will dissolve. Sometimes it will dissolve in a month. Sometimes it takes six months. Sometimes it takes 12. But you can get rid of the scar true. So this right here, this is a huge fish hook. The shape. I was pushing on a Garrett aquarium when I was 17 years old. Working in a department store in Cincinnati. And I pushed on the aquarium to push it back on the shelf. And something was keeping it from moving. So my hand went right through the glass. I cut it. Blood was shooting because it cut right to a major vein, an artery. Blood was actually shooting ten feet away. So I just grabbed and wrapped a cloth around it and stopped it. But this turned into a huge tumor. You know, a big scar. And I open it over the years once in a while and I think about it once a month. I'll just take a piece of pineapple and rub that over the papaya. It keeps getting smaller and smaller. You know, in fact, it's very flat right now. So it's not really that noticeable.

Q: Actually, you said that was caused by liquid iodine supplements?

A: Iodine and salt, sodium, isolated together. Iodine supplement, liquid iodine supplement. But it crosses sodium in his body. When it came out of the skin, it was a cross between sodium and the iodine. Remember, iodine is an antiseptic, it's a poison. Iodine is a poison. The iodine that the thyroid used has nothing to do with the iodine that is rock, that's mined. And iodine is highly contaminated, just like tin is. And tin is usually only 10% of an amalgam of metals. But tin is, they don't only use tin as an antibacterial. They use tin to harden the metal, like take an aluminum can. 10% of it will be tin to harden it, so that it's harder to crush. If they use pure aluminum, you could just take it like paper and just crush it like that. 10% of tin gives it 70% more strength. But, it is anti-fungal, antibacterial in the body. Tin will poison your body like penicillin. So, many people are full of tin. Because they use the tin in tin cans, of all types, to prevent botulism. Not only in the food, but in you. So you can't blame them. I'm going to have to suck an egg. I lost that thought. And this is how you suck an egg. So you don't have to clean a glass every time. You've got a fatter end of an egg. And I hit that on the eye tooth on the flat area. So I don't make a hole. You just break the integrity of the shell. If I break a hole there, it's going to be leaking out the bottom. And I don't want it to leak out the bottom. See how it's cracked to about the size of a dime? You've seen this before. [unintelligible] Let's turn it on right now. There you go. So you can see, that's not only cracked here. It's cracked on that whole area.

Q: I've seen that about 10,000 times.

A: [unintelligible] I break it down on the eye tooth to make a hole. So now I've got a little happy smile. And I want to suck the egg white out first. The egg white will go right to the liver to give the liver the protein it needs to make a better bile. Now eggs are the only food in the world that contains every nutrient on the planet. Absolutely every nutrient. Even if the chicken doesn't get it, it's in an egg, or in a bird's egg. All birds have every nutrient in their eggs that's on the planet. Only food in the world that has that. So the egg white goes in and feeds to the liver. The liver makes a better quality of bile to get all the nutrients out of the egg yolk. And other than that, the protein is mainly in the egg white. 90% of the protein is in the egg white. 90% of all the vitamins and other nutrients are in the egg yolk. So I suck out and set gently upward. I don't turn it upside down because then the heavy yolk is going to come to the front. So I gently suck out about a teaspoon at a time, tablespoon. Get the saliva in it. No longer slimy. Water, just tastes like slightly salty water. You know that taste when you get out of the ocean after swimming in it? You got that salty taste? That's all it tastes like. There's no taste other than the salty taste in the egg white. It's the slime that people don't like. My throat never developed because of all the injections I got. So my throat never developed to a full... That's why I've got a deeper voice. I've got a smaller cage in there, a diameter in my throat. So if I try to take that whole egg like Rocky style, I will vomit. So I just suck it out this way. I like the taste. I like the whole texture. It's a sensation. Now, sometimes the egg yolk will lock into the egg white. So you shake it like this and set it loose.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I do. Already my mind's back. When you're glycogen's low in the brain, the quickest way to pick it up is with an egg. I had a lot of teenagers that were getting C's and D's in their grades. They weren't on the diet, but their parents were doing some of the diet. And I said, well, if you just want to improve your grades, just go into the toilet. Before you go into that class, suck one or two eggs, and you'll ace the test. And sure enough, 100% of them that do it do that. They'll go into the toilet, suck their eggs, go back to the classroom, and ace the test. It's the best brain food you can have. A little bit of yolk can...

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Why do you need to separate it?

A: You'll digest it faster and quicker. See that? See how that membrane just collapsed down in there? I was able to get everything out of it. Because I had fractured the integrity of the shell here. So the sack in there that holds the yolk and the white just all collapsed. I was able to suck everything out of it. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: This was where I had the hole. This was in the air there. I just ripped the shell down with the membrane.

[chatter]

Q: Well, it's a website that's not run by him, but it has his information on it. It's called We Want to Live.

Q: Oh, it's called We Want to Live. I have both of his books.

A: I just experiment and discover things and I let you do my discoveries. Sometimes I can't explain why, she asks me why [unintelligible]. And when you put it in the shake it doesn't do the same. It doesn't all go into glycogen for the brain and nervous system. It goes into building the whole body. When you eat them alone, it will first go to the brain and nervous system. When the brain and nervous system is satisfied, then allow the body to use it for something else. But God did that, I didn't do that.

Q: That's why it works so well.

A: Yes. Okay, so... Okay, this is another cancer patient from New Zealand. She came to me with cancer already. She did the diet for about 7 years. I told her that she would probably lose her breast, the one breast at the most, and that would be it. Probably wouldn't lose all of it. Certainly, very low stage compared to the other woman. It was completely, the whole breast was tumor. This was just this area of tumor. And the nipple eventually collapsed inside. Right there. That was the end of it. This was the end of her cancer. She went home. That was when it was bleeding at the end. A little bit. I would suggest that she drink a half a cup of green cabbage juice. About every 3 or 4 days, and that would stop the bleeding. This green cabbage juice would stop the bleeding. I'll give you an example. There was a very popular movie star out of Sweden. I mean Switzerland. And about 2002, she flew over to this country after being treated for a year there, in Switzerland, and all over Europe. Paris, everywhere. The Pfizer [unintelligible], Frankfurt, Germany. All those supposed to be the advanced knowledge in medicine. And she was bleeding. She was a vegetarian, long-term vegetarian, and had cancer of the cervix. And they cut what they could out, you know, her ovaries and everything. And they couldn't get the bleeding to stop. So they sent her to America, the U.S., UCLA, and thought maybe they had a way to help her. So they had cauterized her, which means they burned the tissue, trying to get it to fuse so it wouldn't bleed. They did all kinds of injections so that they could get vitamin K and other things to stop bleeding. Nothing worked. So she was in a store called Erewhon in Los Angeles. And one of my patients who was just like Jeff, got down to skin and bones, and didn't really get to the door yet to move his arm first, just to build the momentum to move his feet. And he was very sickly. And then about six months, just like Jeff, the whole body was rebound. Of course, they were young, but this woman was in her late 40s. And she saw him picking up food, getting food. They were in their 20s. 40s and 20s, big difference. To me, anybody in their 40s, 50s is young. For sure.

Q: Maybe consider restating that.

A: So, they were, she was a lot older than they were. So, he was picking all the food she wouldn't eat. And he was flush, like, you know, just like Jeff. Tanned and all of this. And the guy doesn't even get into the sun. And she said, what kind of diet are you on? He said, well, I'm on a diet that I just eat mainly dairy and raw meats and eggs. And that's about, a little fruit. And she said, you look so good. Why are you doing this diet? And he told her. He said, I was dying. I was skinny as skinny could be. I could eat all day and never gain a pound. I was never hungry, though. And I was just wasting away. I had no energy. I had fibromyalgia. I was just completely, chronically fatigued. And she says, how long did it take? Six months. So he gave her my telephone number. So she called me about 6 o'clock. I guess it was about 6, 7 o'clock. And said, you know, James Dawson gave me your number. And said that maybe you could help me. I'm a vegetarian. I'm not going to break my vegetarianism and eat meat. And I probably won't even eat eggs. Maybe a little dairy. But can you help me? Well, you're going to make it hard for me to help you if you're in this condition. But if you just want to stop bleeding [unintelligible]. A head of green cabbage. White cabbage. Green cabbage. Not the red cabbage. Red cabbage will cause bleeding. And the white cabbage will stop it. Green, white, greenish white cabbage will stop it. If it were that easy, everybody would be doing it. Bam! Vegetarians have that problem. So, I get a call in the morning, it worked.

[laughter]

A: Just like that. Overnight she stopped bleeding. Went on the diet for three months. I mean she was eating fish, raw fish. 100% of the diet. Famous photographer, Italian photographer. He didn't do the diet, but maybe 50%. But he was there making the food for her, making sure everything was done. Doing great. He called me three months later and she said, she spiritually thinks she's going downhill on this diet. So, she's stopping her diet and going back to vegetarianism. She thinks she's well now. She was dead two months later. And she went back to bleeding, everything. It's crazy. But people have their choices. They have to do their experience. I don't judge what people have to do. I had to go through everything I had to do to get where I am. So, everybody needs their experience for whatever reason. So, we stopped that bleeding almost. That happened one day. She took the pictures and a few hours later she had the cabbage juice and the bleeding stopped. But she went back to New Zealand. Here's when it was finished. Tumor was all dissolved. All this new tissue underneath was very ruptured. Because when you have cancer and it's dissolving, your cancer cells are the tumor. Your cancer cells contain a solvent. So when they die, it's enough solvent to dissolve up to 200 dead cells. However, you better be very healthy. You better have a lot of alkalinizing minerals and a lot of casein and a lot of milk proteins to be able to harness those poisons. Because it will melt all the good cells as well as the bad. It will damage everything. That's why people disintegrate. That's why up until that woman came to me, everything in her nose dissolved. But you saw after that, after seven years, very little deterioration because she had the nutrients in her body. Even at a place where there's poor circulation in the nose. Ears, eyes, nose has poor circulation.

Q: Put her in a hot tub?

A: Yeah, she [unintelligible]. You'd have to change the water every 20 minutes to re-heat it. A hot tub would have been better. But she went home to share her experience. And they saw that breast and they panicked and to placate them she went to the doctors. And they took her choice away and the courts made her take chemo. And she was dead a week later, nine days later. Her parents and family, her brothers and sisters and family went to the court. Showed her the pictures, showed them the pictures I just showed you. And said she's going to kill herself if she doesn't have that removed and have chemo. So they forced her and she was dead two weeks later.

Q: Even though she's an adult?

A: Pardon?

Q: Even though she's an adult? When she's young or old?

A: She was about, what, forty-seven? Oh they... Let me tell you, governments are out of hand, way out of hand, for sure. Way out of hand. Just last week I fought in court to have a farmer grow the foods we want. The one federal judge, Fielders, has said that you have no right to grow what you want to grow and eat what you want. This is a federal judge. We just had a trial against one of my farmers in Wisconsin. And the jury came back with, not guilty. On all the counts of, we can eat what we want, we can grow what we want. Without government licensing or permits. It was a great win. Second win in four months. We've got another one coming up in about six months or less, which will be the third. We will have absolute precedence. That doesn't mean the government's not going to try to control us in every way. They'll keep doing it. But at least we'll eat a little bit easier each time. So she was dead in about less than two weeks. They cut off her breasts and gave her chemo. And here it was over. 

Q: Who's that?

A: Barry. And this guy, you know, this guy was a weird guy. He's strange. He was 15 pounds lighter than his worst, but that's about what he was when he came to me. Wasting away three years on the doctor's supervision. Not eating like a horse. By the end he just kept losing weight. This is after a year on the diet. He took them at six months and he was the same as this. But he didn't have his glasses on like he did there. So I said, re-shoot those with your glasses on. You know, just because you're not wearing glasses you look better. So, it really looked like this after six months on the diet. You see this? You have the same situation? No. You had the same situation? No. This woman also. Three years.

Q: But I don't look like that. I don't look this good. I don't look this good.

A: Oh, you look worse than this girl here?

Q: I don't look this good in my recovery period.

A: How much have you been doing the diet?

Q: I do the diet 100%.

A: How long?

Q: Six months. But I don't feel like I know what I'm doing.

A: Well, he was 30 years old.

Q: You think I'm more than 30?

Q: Yeah!

A: Two years. 32. Were you 32 or 31 here?

Q: No, I was probably 32 in the top photo.

A: Oh, 32. And 34.

Q: Yeah, because those were about two years apart. I mean, that wasn't at my skinniest. I was about 99 pounds there. And I got down to 78 pounds.

A: Can you imagine? 78 pounds? I saw you about 86.

Q: No, you saw me about 90. Maybe 95, something like that.

A: A little less than this.

Q: I mean, I actually stabilized. That sounds good. But I stabilized at about 98 pounds. And then tried a couple of things that knocked another 20 off rapidly. So when I got back to more of a normal eating program, I kind of gradually crept back up to about low 90s. And that's when I saw you.

A: And then it went fast.

Q: Oh, then I started putting 15 pounds a month on. For three years, I hadn't been able to gain, you know. Anyway, you know, so at that 78 pounds, I used to do like a cleanse and a flush and all that stuff. So that was kind of an abnormal. I mean, my really normal bottom out was about 98, 97 pounds. Something like that. And that had held for a while. So I mean, you know, but then when trying something else, it just ripped.

A: So you were holding it about that weight.

Q: So once I started like eating normal food again, you know, meatloaf, mashed potatoes, all that stuff. I mean, it took me a while to creep back up another, I was probably gaining another 10, 12 pounds over a year, you know, a pound a month or something. But again, that was because I was starting to eat again. I mean, I had done like this flush and, you know, just various juicing fasts and flushes and detoxifying things. That really took the weight off me. So I was at least able to get out of the hospital without... this is a long story. But, you know, low 90s or something like that. I was able to put another 10 pounds off my lowest. But then that stopped again. You know, I got back to that.

A: And this was all about exercise.

Q: Yeah, it was not like a weight training program or anything. No, like being active. Yeah, just being active. I mean, I was able to, like, walk again. So it was fun to go just out and play. But that had to resist... I mean, my muscles were so weak. If you go out and just throw a ball, it's like you're throwing a [unintelligible]. Relatively speaking, it was resistance training on my muscles. You know, it wasn't weight training. But, I mean, I could throw a ball. It was, like, so crazy. I was essentially wheelchair bound for about a year prior to gaining the weight. Because when you're that skinny and weak, you just can't. You can't go anywhere.

Q: Before and after.

A: Doing good. Let's pass around later, because we need to move along here. Now, here was the singer guitar player. And he'd been on a tour with this smoke as a major part of the entire show, a two hour show. I saw it at Universal Amphitheater. And it went into cancer under his eye. And let me tell you, he was... The tumor got very big. This one started draining, leaking. There's white blood cells. Try to eat up some of those dead tissue. This one's going down. Even less. Back to the beginning. So, you can see... He was in that smoke all the time. When I saw him at that, I said, Listen, I held a mask over my face the entire time I watched your show. And I said, you're going to have a bad time. If you're inhaling that plastic, vaporized oil, it's going to block your system, probably your sinuses, your throat. I've already got one patient, Barbara, who had it in the nose. They were telling him he could have it in a year, and he quit. But still, a year later, this popped up. He won't get healed. He still works as a musician out of New York City, but he will not work in the smoke. And when the smoke starts, he tells them, that's not safe smoke, that's vaporized plastic oil. Trans fatty acid. So, he gets them to stop. In Thailand, there's a whole line of clubs in Pattaya. And I was on a tour with a friend, and these were mostly strip clubs. And I saw almost everyone of them using smoke. And I said, you know, all these girls are going to have cancer, you know, on their face or breast, or lungs or throat, you know, in their lifetimes, because they're around this stuff every day. So I wrote a paper on it. One side was in English, and one side was in Thai. I had his picture, I had Barbara's picture with her nose at the worst, and there was another singer, nightclub singer, who had cancer here. It burned through her chest. So I had those three on there. And I paid teenagers, young, you know, even younger than teenagers, 9-year-olds to 14-year-olds, to deliver these, to pass them out. Everybody going into these clubs. So they stopped going into clubs because they were subjected to it too. So within two weeks, all, everyone but one of the clubs stopped doing it. Just got to be an activist. You got to get a sense for that. One club owner came out there and he says, Okay, I'm not going to use the smoke, stop handing those out. And I said, show me you're going to get rid of the spoke machine, break it for me, and I won't hand them out. [unintelligible] He was a man who was really concerned. [unintelligible] Now this is a fellow, he's been on the diet since about, off and on, since 1978. He gets hooked into people telling him about, you know, vegetarianism and stuff like that. So, his neck looked like an elephant. Elephant's neck. Very dry, lots and lots of, you know, wrinkles and hard tissue in white there.

So this was after a few months of putting, taking a little slice of, a cube of pineapple, rubbing it into the skin. One day using pineapple, one day using raw applesauce, one day using raw apple cider vinegar, and the next day using papaya. Rubbing papaya into it. And then the third day, taking off, just putting butter and some coconut cream on it. And this is after just two months. So, I don't know where I put the pictures... They were older, let's see. This is all after the treatment. There, you can see this is early on. You can see how the color of his skin... There, that was after. This is early into it. That was one of the first pictures. See all that dry dead skin? So, it's half that now and this is about. So, he started in 2005. He does it maybe a few days a month, that's all. It's still working. He's not vain enough to do it.

Q: Would you put it on his face? Same treatment, would you put it on his face?

A: Yes, but really on your neck. Remember, your lymph glands, your main network of lymph glands are here, here, and here. Down here, inside, all around, over here. So, where do people get mainly rashes? Here, here, here, here, here, and here. Most of your rashes come from those areas. So, that's the lymph glands. Lymph glands, when they take the waste, they stick it under the skin to be perspired out of the skin. And you're supposed to neutralize it into a non-damaging substance before it leaves. But most people don't have a good time to do that, so it causes rashes. It kills the skin, the skin cells, as it passes through. So, barely any cells were alive in his neck skin. The rest of his body, a lot of cells were alive. And here's where he threw most of his toxins, and he turned that into scar tissue. 

Q: I'm wondering if, you know, I work in an office, I don't, you know, don't do manual labor. Don't work out with sweat, unless I do work out.

A: Hot tubs.

Q: No, I'm wondering if a lot of people just don't sweat like they used to 50 years ago.

A: Absolutely.

Q: Therefore, you see more of this constant.

A: [unintelligible] vegetarian diet for 10 years off the diet. But he started with me in about 1978. And, you know, he just had to learn. He's, what is he, here he's 62 years old, 63 years old. That's pretty good. He's now 68. See how much of that, how much of the wrinkles, how much of the dead skin has been removed from his neck? Considerable. Doesn't look like an elephant.

Q: Does the perspiration need to be with water or can you do it with exercise?

A: Can you do it with what?

Q: The effort at perspiration, does it need to be with hot water or can it be with exercise?

A: You can use hot water bottles, sleep with hot water bottles. But the water, when the water coats the body, it does not allow it to cool, so it can get deep into your lymph glands. Because you have both lymphatic waste under your skin and in your muscles, and then you have the actual glands and lymph nodes, which are congested and blocked with plastic oils. So to get deep into the lymphatic glands and nodes, it takes 90 minutes a day.

Q: You don't just run or something and try to do it.

A: It can't heat the body up high enough. The highest temperature that you will reach in exercise is 100.1 degrees. And you've got to get up to 102 degrees to get it out from under your skin and muscles, to get it out of your lymph glands and lymph nodes, it needs to be 105. Never over 110, because you will damage the vitamins and enzymes in your skin.

Q: So the Bikram Hot Yoga where it's 108 degrees in the room?

A: Won't do it. It doesn't dissolve the plastic. If you take a cold stick of butter out of the refrigerator, and you've got the room 98.6 degrees, how long is it going to take, and what degree, what temperature will it take, if the air space gets around and it's being cooled by the butter, cold butter, how long is it going to take? It won't. It will be hours, like 10-12 hours, before you can start getting warm enough to where the butter will get soft. If you have it 105 degrees outside, it will take 1.5 hours for that butter to start barely melting on the outside. That's the way it is with the lymph glands. You've got to melt that plastic. You've got to put it back in the liquid state to get it out of the body, because they're just beads of plastic. And they will melt because they're not so hydrogenated that they're hard plastic, they're still liquid beads. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: 105 to get to the lymphatic glands, 102 to get rid of the lymphatic waste.

Q: So you're saying your core body temperature?

A: While you're in that water, yes.

Q: What about chemicals in hot tubs?

A: Very toxic. Very bad for the skin.

Q: But he said a hot tub would be best because it keeps the temperature up.

A: If you've got a community hot tub, it just gets very expensive. Take a half a bottle of apple cider vinegar and throw it in the water with 10 minutes. When you get in it, it will neutralize all the chlorine and all the chloroform. And it will prevent you from absorbing, because there's some ammonia in that, keep you from absorbing the fluoride. 

Q: How much vinegar do you use?

A: You'd have to use two cups. Put in a community one.

Q: What about a personal one?

A: A personal one, then just have your own filter on it. Put a sand filter on it. You know, you have a three-stage filter. You have paper, then you have carbon, please. Carbon, you have coconut carbon, and then you have a sand filter, in that order. Plumber and health and water filters will tell you to do the opposite. Let me tell you, paper has plenty of poison. And you don't want that the last thing going through. So there's the paper, then the charcoal, coconut charcoal, and then the sand. You pass this through there, and you get your poisons out of your water. Put a little bit of coconut cream in there, you know, a tablespoon of vinegar. Epsom salt, if you like. Sea salt is okay in that situation, but you're just using like two tablespoons, you know, for the whole bath. And then you get in there, and you will perspire without being poisoned.

Q: Salt water hot tub's better than the other kind?

A: Pardon?

Q: Salt water hot tub's better than the other kind?

A: Yes, it is. But of course, you don't put as much salt in it as they recommend. Everybody's always trying to sell you, oversell you, to get you to use more of their products. That's where they make the money. So use a fifth of what they suggest, or even a tenth of what they suggest. If you have one of those electrical floor heating hot tubs, that use salt.

Q: What about the boron?

A: Boron is toxic, too. It holds a radioactive material in your body, seals it in your body. Not a good idea.

Q: What about the ozonator?

A: The ozonator you still need to put something... The ozonator kills everything. So you need to put some milk in there or something to bring up your bacteria. Turn it off after it's on. Turn the ozonator off after it's [unintelligible]. So it's not on when you're in there. Because the ozone will oxidize the fat in your skin and you won't be able to absorb vitamin D. You won't be able to make vitamin D, nor absorb it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The amount of ingredients to put in a bathtub is in there under baths, under alternative therapies, and under the baths.

Q: Sauna?

A: Sauna doesn't work because sauna is dry and heat and they're very hot.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, I talk about sauna and steam not being good.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It doesn't make an infrared, it's toxic. It still gets up beyond 110. Once you get above 110, you damage the nutrients in your skin. Your sinus is the worst. Scarring your sinus, stop yourself producing mucus. You can be allergic to everything. Okay, now this next one, this is a frightening one. She won't let the video show her first one. Now, I was on Antigua, the island of Antigua, with quite a few clients. They brought her to me in a wheelchair. Less weight than Jeff had. You know, Jeff's lowest. Just skin on bones. She was black and gray and her skin just peels away. Came in a wheelchair, and she had to go over a threshold. Take her over that hump, took five minutes. Screaming in pain, just going over that threshold. To get into the house for me to do my consult with her. Screaming crying. Twenty-two years old. She won't let me show the ones, because she's naked in them. Even if I put a strip over, she hasn't given me permission. But this is her after a year on the diet. And what happened was, she was going to college. And this was her sophomore year. They lost her vaccine records. So they said she had to take every one over again. So she had 18 vaccines in one day. But 10 days later, she was completely deteriorated. Black and grey from the mercury and the aluminum coming through her skin. You can see still patches of black and grey to her skin. But she was in excruciating pain all the time. I gave her some of my own spit kefir. I tell in my recipe book, if you want to make a perfect culture for you, put it in your saliva, a tablespoon into a quart of raw milk, and let it sit out, and let your own bacteria break it down. Perfect for you. Well, I didn't have any that wasn't made for me. So I gave her half a cup. Her mother had to feed it to her. She couldn't do this, she couldn't lift anything. Her head movement was this. And I couldn't understand her. Her mother would put her ear down to her mouth like that. And then she would talk. As she was talking, it was a whisper. I couldn't even understand it. But her mother was very good at it, and her aunt. They both, took two people to take care of her. And that was it. This was her movement from now on. And crying. And now you see, this is about nine months later. Yeah, I was there in February, and this is September. So about six months. So you can see the difference. Huge difference. From the diet.

Q: You're not mentioning green juices all day today.

A: Well, I'll get into that. I'm not going to finish on these awful pictures and these notes. I'm going to finish on food. I used to finish this way. There was a certain amount of unhappiness. I decided not to do that anymore. So you can see with vaccines, that just ruined her life. Of course, she dropped out of college. She couldn't even read a book. Couldn't focus, couldn't concentrate. Now, this next one I'm going to show you... This is a fellow who was health conscious all of his life. Sixty years of supplements. Sixty years of supplements. Standard brand for the last twenty years. Everybody know what standard brand is?

Q: Standard process.

A: Standard process. They are supposed to be the elite of all pills because they grow their own food and they extract their supplements from their own food. But there's one process they leave out. I'm telling people because nobody knows except the laboratory. You have to take that corn or that spinach or whatever you're doing, whatever you're using to gain the nutrients from, you have to put it and make it a liquid. How does the laboratory make those foods liquid? Only two things, gasoline, derivative, hexane, and kerosene. Natural, kerosene is natural. So my standard brand uses kerosene. How many of you would soak your food for 72 hours until it was a soup in kerosene, rinse it for, you know, separate it out and rinse it for two minutes and then eat it? No hands? What's the matter, crazy? Of course you wouldn't eat it. Any supplement has either used, if it's from food, has either used gasoline or kerosene to make it. That means it's etched into every part of that molecule that goes into your supplement. Every molecule. So, all these people who are getting high, they're getting high because they're getting adrenaline rush from the poisoning of gasoline or hexane. I mean the gasoline or kerosene. That's what's making you high. So this guy, I thought he was very, very healthy, came to me with a tumor here. On the diet, I figured because of his good background, everything would be great. Now I didn't know the cause of his cancer, so I thought it was going to be, you know, [unintelligible]. This one, not that one. Okay, this got so big, it was this big. Around, started cutting off his esophagus, his ability to eat. Even on the diet. This was the first for me. This was a tumor that kept growing. Incrementally, every week. Got a little bit bigger. So first time for me. This was the one like this, did that. I've had it [unintelligible], but that's because the doctors don't stop draining, stabbing, and giving medication. So... See how big it was getting? In fact, he'd just sleep all day. So... He decided, because he couldn't breathe, couldn't eat properly, he was going to waste away. He decided to have it surgically removed. So I went to the surgeon, he was part of Kaiser Permanente, and that was his insurance. And the chief surgeon there was going to do it. He was going to take the bone, the whole jaw bone, on this side. He was going to take all the lymph glands and even the thyroid glands. So, I got a hold of him on the phone, [unintelligible]. So I said, wait a minute, you don't have cancer in the thyroid gland, right? You've got just cancer of the connective tissue, right? That's all it is. And the tumor is building there, it's not arresting anything, it's starting to cut off its breathing, and it's starting to cut off the ability to swallow. So, and it's the pressure, it's the size of the tumor, it's not that it's in the esophagus, and it's not that it's in the thyroid gland, and it's not in the lymph glands. 

And you know the lymph glands clean the body, and if you remove them, if the cancer comes back, what's going to [unintelligible] then, if he doesn't have any lymph glands in his neck? He thought about it, got back to me the next day and said, you're right, I'm just going to go in there, I'm going to scrape the tumor away from the skin, the bone, from everything, take it out and put it back together. He promised me that's what he would do. Took out some of the skin, and scraped it away, and that was okay, because it would have been excess skin. But, it would go to where, after it was made, after it was done. There it is. Growing back after he had the surgery, you see it was cut from here, all the way back to here. And the tumor was removed, and then started growing back faster. He removed the lymph glands when I told him not to. 

Q: How did you find out?

A: Well, I found out because I looked at the medical report. The op surgery. Well, this man died soon after. And he refused to do the surgery. This is a show of the actual surgery. You can see all the veins and the damage, all the chemicals. They put iodine, they coated him with barium radioactive material. I told them to use nothing but alcohol. They didn't listen. But that tumor that you will see pretty soon, the first one, there it is. That's the skin that they cut away. This is the tumor. Mostly [unintelligible]. However, when I had it, it cost $8,600 to analyze. And that tumor, predominantly minerals. Kerosene. The guy took 80 supplements a day for 60 years. 80 supplements a day for 60 years. The first case that I saw that I could prove that it was caused by supplements. Because he took no other medications. He believed only in foods. He took, of course, clean, organic supplements. Lots of mineral supplements. That was mainly minerals and kerosene.

Q: What happened to the guy?

A: Pardon?

Q: What happened to that guy?

A: He died. After the second one grew, the surgeon wouldn't remove it. So he went to Nevada. He went to a doctor there who was working with some guy who knew chemo. He was dead in 9 days. Even so-called safe chemo was not safe. This woman had this stye and cyst over her eye. And I told her to put lime juice on top of it, and coconut cream on top of that, and then butter on top of that. It took about two weeks. It was gone. She didn't send me the after pictures for some reason. This woman cut off her finger, ground it off in a coconut machine, coconut juicer. Went in and just ground it to pieces all the way down to here. So you see it cut off some of the bone, all the nails gone, all the way down to here. Fifty-four years old at the time. Or fifty-six, somewhere around there. So you see the bone marrow, the blood cells that are in that bone marrow coming out of the bone marrow. That's jumped way ahead. That's when the finger grew back. I don't know how that one got in that place. This is after it was cut off. This is also a few months after it grew back. Do I have the date on that... That was September 16, 2007. This is a year later. September 27, 2007. The whole finger grew back. But you'll get to see the stages of it. So what I had to do was put lime juice on it. Every day. Lime juice is an antiseptic and an antibacterial. It's an antimicrobial. It's a safe one. What it does is surrounds foreign particles. It provides us with white blood cells to go into the area and eat the damaged cells. It just surrounds the toxin and isolates it so the body can neutralize somehow and get it out of the body. So, I put the lime juice on it, then coconut cream and honey mixture, and then meat over that. Raw meat for, what was it, seven months?

Q: Yeah, they said you have to get grafting on that. I mean, I don't know if you mentioned that or not, but there's no way that's, you know, you gotta get grafting on it.

A: Pardon?

Q: I'm saying, I don't know if you mentioned or not, but they told her she had to get a graft.

A: Oh yeah, she had to get a graft on it because the skin wouldn't seal over. There's no way it would come back. She would lose her whole hand. It was her gangrene.

Q: Is that the one?

A: You know, doctors, they have this, and there's the finger growing back.

Q: Oh, so she didn't get...

A: Nail growing back. No, she didn't have a graft. She never... She put meat over it. That's her graft, putting meat over it.

Q. How long does the beef and meat last?

A: Uh, two or three days. Depends on how stinky it gets. She has a finger growing back.

Q: Is that the one you documented in your newsletter?

A: Yes. But now, you don't get all these shots. You only get five shots of it, four shots of it. Here you get all the shots that they took in a year.

Q: Wow.

A: That's back to when we were in the beginning.

[unintelligible]

A: That's after a year.

Q: Wow.

A: Pretty great, isn't it?

Q: Yeah.

A: There it is. After a year. The other underside. You see the nail coming out there. Pretty good, isn't it? I mean, there's no scarring there. All the prints are back. Now, when I had a motorcycle accident, I was in Thailand, and I had rented a big car. It weighed about 650 pounds. And these Hollanders going right down the street, right in front of me, you'll see the ferry, the motorcycle, on the ground, or I'd kill one or two of them. They didn't even look that I was coming. I was only going about 15-18 miles an hour. But they got out in front of me. I wasn't 20 feet from them. So I buried it on my leg, and there was no roll bar there. So I was in shorts, shorts to here, my way down to here. I was on sandals, and a short-sleeved shirt, t-shirt. So I took all the skin, part of the elbow bone off, all of this bone off and shaved down. No skin anywhere here. All the skin was gone off. All the muscle was shaved off. All the way down, part of the knee was shaved off. All of the skin off of here and here. On the ankle, the ankle bone was shaved off. All the skin was gone. And part of the foot or the toe is all gone. Some of that bone was shaved off. Because I just skidded off the blacktop. I had all these blacktop pieces in there. And, you know, I was in excruciating pain. Because that was a 650 pound bite on top of my leg. Taking me about, probably was 30 feet. You know, ripping me to pieces. So, the knee, you know, usually I'll, I have an accident like that, I've been accident prone since I was born. So, an accident seemed to find me. So, in this spot, people walked out. I should have just hit them. Really, I wouldn't have... I mean, there were so many witnesses. And those five people disappeared. And all these Thais were around, helping me. You know, there was a nurse, a Thai nurse. She took me to the hotel and, you know, set the bike there on the road. And there, a taxi is a pickup truck with a cover on it. You know, you climb up in the back and sit in it. And so, I laid down on the inside, went back to the hotel. I had lime and everything there. And my girlfriend there was pretty much on the diet. She'd get all the food for me and everything. I put lime juice on it, bit on a towel, and screamed and cried as I put lime juice on everything. I cleaned out as much as I could. But some of it was just into the skin. I mean, into the muscle and bone. Just rooted into a few different things. So, I just put as much lime juice on it as I could for about 20 minutes. That exhausted me. I slept for about 20 minutes. And then I woke up, so that was about an hour later, an hour and 20 minutes later. And this knee [unintelligible]. So I said, it's out of place. By that time it was 1030 at night. So, no chiropractors open. So I went to the hospital. And I said, I need to go to the hospital and get me a taxi. The owner of the hotel, which I knew, she's an American, she's a Thai American. And it's in a hotel. And she called the life squad. So they came, the life squad. They got a fold out gurney, wooden gurney, put me on it. 

Put me down in the life vehicle to take me to the hospital about 10 miles away. And, you know, I'm saying, this isn't necessary. I'm in excruciating pain, but all this isn't necessary. And I had to pay for it. 7,000 Baht.  And out of 7,000 Baht, $200. A driver and four rescue workers. Five people in the life squad vehicle. Only $200. It was amazing. So I get there to the hospital. There's a young intern there. And I've got the skin gone. I had put honey and coconut cream on it. After the lime juice. Before I went there. They're looking at this. I've got all this, no skin. Bone showing. Muscle showing. And he's going, we're going to have to graft skin off of your ass. Thighs and thigh. To patch all of that. And he said, you know... I said, listen. I think I'm just out of place in the knee. I need you to reset the knee. He said, I'm not touching that. He said, I'm not touching it with anything. That is a very critical accident. You need somebody who's a master. So he called the osteosurgeon. And this is a pretty big town [unintelligible]. So they have a pretty big hospital. Not huge. Probably five times the size of this house. That's a big hospital for them. So the intern called the osteosurgeon. He got there about 12.30 at night. So I've been there a couple hours. And the osteosurgeon looked at it and said, I'm not touching it without an x-ray or two. Well, an x-ray or ten. And I said, no, no, no, no, no. If you're going to reset it for me, you get two x-rays. You might have to two x-rays. You get one from the top this way and one from this side. So you can see what's going on. But you've got to have enough of a leg in it, because I don't want any, oh, that's not enough. I can't see enough. And I get to set the [unintelligible] machine. And the radiologist, he thought it was entertaining that I got to set the machine. He said, you're pretty good with this, aren't you? So I took the two x-rays, and the tibia was broken all the way down to the ankle, from the knee all the way down, split in two. And at the back, it was open like this.

Q: Oh, my gosh.

A: So they wanted to cut me from the foot, midfoot, all the way up to here. Open that all up, cut the muscle away that was left on, and then go in there, take my knee apart, the whole joint apart, cut the tendons, pull them all apart, and then reattach them. And the femur joint had broken the top of the tibia off in that knee. So all these splinter bones were all in there. So they said, you're going to have to scrape all that out, or I'll never be able to walk again. I would never be able to put any weight on that knee or foot, the whole leg again, and I would probably lose it, because it would keep stabbing the joint area, and it would go into gangrene and deteriorate. So I looked at the x-rays, and I said, you know, that's not too bad. They also wanted to put eight to 12 pins to put the tibia back together. And I said, first of all, I've seen three people in Thailand, and probably two people in America that have had that very surgery from a motorcycle accident. And all of them are shorter, two inches shorter on this leg, and their muscles are one-third to two-thirds what they should be. So I don't want that kind of deformity if I can avoid it. I'm on a good diet, and he goes, literally, [unintelligible]. So I plugged him into an electric socket.
Diet, do that, insane. And he says, you're going to lose your leg, and you're going to lose your life. And I said, listen, give me your card. And the knee was back in place. It's just that it was all splintered. So I didn't have to be able to reset. Give me your card. If my leg isn't better in six weeks, I'll come back and see you. And you can do it then. He said, if you're alive, I said, if I'm alive, I can be back tomorrow or next week. He said, okay, and gave me the card. Sure enough, he thought I'd be back in a few days. What I did was, I cleaned it every two days with the lime juice, put the honey and coconut cream on it, and put meat over it. And every three days, I'd change the meat, because the meat would be so stinky, they'd kick me out of the hotel. Otherwise, [unintelligible]. Because the more bacteria, the more you clean, cleanse, and heal. So I liked that rotten meat. So I wanted it to stay on longer. So, in 12 days, all of the muscles, all of the skin, not the bone, which didn't all grow back, that took about 6 months, but all the skin and all the muscle, every bone, and completely sealed.

Q: Hamburger or steak?

A: Steak. Thin slices. I used hamburger, it was hard to keep it on. Crumbles all over. So, 12 days. So, that nurse stayed with me for that 12 days. Plus my girlfriend, so I had two people to take care of me. Because I was going around in a wheelchair for a week. And then after that, with crutches, I got the woman who owned the hotel to stop chlorinating the swimming pool.

Q: Wow.

A: So I got to go in every day. I threw a bunch of coconut vinegar in at first. To neutralise the chlorine that was in there. So after the third day, I was in that swimming pool. And I would stay around the deep end. So this foot, I was just putting that much weight on it. And that leg. And I would go around the pool, kept doing that. And I would barely balance in the water when you're buoyant in the water. So it was very high. So after a week, well, six days, the algae grew so much, she said nobody would swim in that water anymore. And I said, well, it's okay now. I'm strong enough. I can go across the street where there's the ocean. So I'd go into the bay and then go out far enough. And I would swim out with my leg, you know, swim out there until I got to the point where the water was up to here. And then I would walk half a mile that direction and half a mile back. So I'd walk a mile, and the water would barely touch this leg.

Q: Walking in the ocean didn't hurt?

A: Of course it hurt. Of course it hurt. But I had the meat over it and the bandages, the raised bandages all over that. Plus I had plastic. What I did was I had the meat over it. I had the meat over the wound. Then I put a piece of wet T-shirt, you know, to keep it moist so the meat wouldn't dry out and shrink. And then over that I had plastic just the size of the meat. And then I put ace bandages over that. So when I went into the water, it took a long time for any salt water to get around there. In fact usually that didn't happen. But once in a while it got under, like on the ankle one time, it got under and then the bandage. So that burned. It burned pretty badly, heavy from the foot up to here. But, you know, then I got out, got my crutches, and went back up to the hotel. And, you know, [unintelligible] myself in the hotel for six and a half weeks. And six and a half weeks I was walking. What happened was, though, after a week, I used to have a big butt. A really nice big butt. And huge thighs. You know, like a bodybuilder. And I never worked out. This is, like Cary Grant. This is my exercise. Sex. And only when [unintelligible]. So, my body had taken all of the protein, muscle from my thighs and my butt, and built a natural cast. So, after a week, my whole leg hardened like a cast under the skin. [unintelligible] just like a cast. The body had used protein and minerals to build a natural cast. At the seventh week, my muscles started reappearing in my ass. Only half of my ass. Just had a big, beautiful ass. So, all of it went away. Your body is absolutely amazing if go out and take care of it right now. Without screws, it reconnected. And all the tendons, this tendon was torn this way and this one was torn this way. So that's what was causing my legs to look like it was out of place. Knees looked like it was out of place. Those grew back, tendons. Reattached to tendons. So, I went back to the hospital. Just like that. And I did it just to his face. And he goes... I said, see no scar. This scar came from those injections. That scar wasn't even, I had no scarring from that accident. This is poison that caused all the scarring there. So I still have dead cells there. But I just danced in front of him. He said I wouldn't walk much less dance. I got to show him.

Q: [unintelligible] me how I can grow a butt.

A: Well, I don't exercise. I can go up and down stairs and build it. But my exercise is my computer. I carry my groceries once a week. And pull my suitcases. We're coming to the end here. This was a tumor that came out shortly after those injections. This was a few days after the injections. See how it exploded all over my shoulder. This is the left shoulder here. This is a hemorrhoid of a man. A very bad hemorrhoid. He sent me this picture. I said, you need to take a piece of meat. A long cube of meat. Not a cube. And then cut it to where, inside here like this, so you've got a plug on both ends. And I said, and this is narrow in here. Stick that in your butt so it will plug in the G-director. So it won't go too far in and it won't come out. So he did it, and in 24 hours all of his pain was gone, 3 days in, right to the end. I told him to put lime juice on it first, and then coconut cream, and then put the plug in. So that quickly was over. 

Q: [unintelligible] done the pump part.

A: Pardon?

Q: Never mind.

A: This is the system in general. This is a cell, a human cell. And you see inside it the basic works. However, the blood cell is not that shape. This is a blood cell. These are red blood cells. These are white blood cells, phagocytes. This is an artery membrane. Of course it's not glowing, this is all dead and stained. But that's fresh out. This was cut out of a piece of artery that was cut out of a heart patient. So they cut out a section, they had no plaquing on it. But the other side there's heavy plaquing on that part of the wall. And this is all the cells washed. So that's why it's so apparent. But you can see, if you saw these labels, these would be organelles, whole organelles. This is the digestive tract, bowel here, liver. So you have all these same glands in cells that we have, only in microscopic form. And they're all full of bacteria too. They're 99% bacteria. Every cell in our body, 99% bacteria. We're 99% bacteria. This is the skin. You can see all, this is the muscle down here. This is, of course, where the hair comes out. You can see all the different layers of the skin. This is the lymphatic area where the lymphatic system dumps the waste. And it has to get down and perspire out the body. The body will build minerals into the follicle, which causes all hair loss. Toxic substances, industrial solvents, gasoline, kerosene, when they actually contaminate the follicle. Mercury built into it will cause follicle loss. So you can see why we have to stay a very long time in the heat. Even get down underneath the skin in the connective tissue to get rid of, perspire the poisons. The lymph glands and nodes are under this. So it takes 90 minutes at a time to get to that deep. [cough] Benzene from the airplanes. Okay, this is the lymphatic system. Now this is just a slight version of what it is. You can see it's a circulatory system just like the blood. The neurological system is the same. This is one-tenth of what is really there. It's just giving you a small amount of what it is. Just like blood veins and vessels and capillaries, you have the same kind of network all throughout the lymphatic system. And your main networks are here. They don't show it here, and they are all down in the thighs too. They're only showing the glands and not the nodes. But there are probably 20,000 lymphatic nodes in the body. Probably about 500 lymph glands. And they're here, here, here. And they're showing very clearly. And this is the breast. You can see the 11 major lymph glands that are in the breast. So what happens when you lop off your breast. And you lose all that lymphatic system. All those 11 lymphatic glands in each one. Where, who's going to clean out the dead cells? Who's going to clean out the poison from your lungs and your throat? People who lop off their breaths usually get lung cancer. They don't tell you anything about that.

So what's going to happen to Angeline and Boyd? She's going to most likely get breast, lung cancer. Not the greatest thing to do. But she's safe from breast cancer. She will absolutely not get breast cancer. Now this was a woman who had impetigo. This is a Thai woman. She's been on the diet about 10 years at this point. This just happened last year. And it was difficult for her. She's 50 years old now. So she's 49 when this happened. When she came to me she looked like she was 50. And then she got younger and younger and younger looking and then this happened. And after a year after it was over, her skin was even younger. Most of this, when you have impetigo in the face, are dental injections. Mainly xylocaine, novocaine. Xylocaine and novocaine are responsible for about 80% of all mouth, tongue, and jaw cancers.

Q: What do you use when you have to have dental work?

A: You don't take anything. You find a dentist with a water jet on his drill or one that uses a thing called silica, blasted, frilly sand, very fine sand that roots it out with water. So when you have cold water on it, you don't have pain. He had it done by my dentist. And the dentist even hit the nerve and caused it to bleed. And he didn't even jump out of the seat. I mean, he hit the nerve. And it squirted with blood for one squirt. It clotted just like that and stopped bleeding. One second, it was clotted and stopped bleeding. 

Q: How do you find that type of dentist?

A: Almost all dentists have that now unless you've got a real old guy.

Q: This guy was in Tijuana. [unintelligible] I said I was hammered drunk, so I didn't feel anything. Maybe it's a better route to get drunk. You were talking about the sandblast. They call that air abrasion. That's kind of what they call it these days. And there's a few guys doing the air abrasion technique. You can probably Google it. If you go to the Mercolas site, he did an article on it one time. He just went to the Mercolas site and air abrasion. There's a Texas dentist who's kind of spearheading this air abrasion thing and trying to get people doing that. I cannot think of his name, but if I do, I'll let you know. He's got a list of people around the country that he has taught to do the proper air abrasion. It could still hurt, but it depends where the decay is. If the decay is right at the nerve, you're probably going to get some pain. In my situation, he did a little decay on the outer part of the tooth. I didn't feel anything.

A: He had two molars, decaying both of them inside. The dentist actually had to drill through the good tooth on both sides because I watched him. He had to drill in to get the decay out. 

Q: He's standing over the dentist talking about there's a guy barbecuing across the street. He's like totally distracted. He goes, look at this guy. I'm like, ah, hey, look at this guy.

A: It was deep and most likely would have caused pain in the average person. But you have to remember once they inject that stuff in there, it hardens all the tissues and blocks. So this tremendous amount of swelling can last up to five or six weeks. So you have that additional pain on that tooth. When the drilling is finished, let's say you even mix the nerve, that pain lasts 30, 45 seconds and it's gone. No more pain. If you get injections, that pain can last up to six months in that tooth. So that's your option. So anyway, I asked this woman to put lime juice on her face and coconut cream and to keep putting clay made with coconut cream so it wouldn't get too dry. She's drawing out the poisons. One time she said that the lime juice and the coconut cream and the clay would cause too much burning. So I told her to take some cheese, room temperature cheese that was very soft, pack it down into a flat piece and then put it on and seal that over. And bandage it, bandage all around the face. Leave room for the nose to breathe.

Q: What kind of clay?

A: Pardon?

Q: What kind of clay?

A: It was terramin clay. T-E-R-R-A-M-I-N.

Q: Go to terramin.com and you'll find it.

A: So she didn't go to the doctor and it took about three weeks for her to pass through the impetigo. And that was mainly because, again, dental stuff. She had one on her arm, one little spot on her arm, where she had gotten some kind of anesthetic injection. Okay, remember I told you what, you know, vitamin supplements look like and stuff like that? Well, this is when it's in food, soft and spongy like cotton balls. This is when it's made, this is the same, same magnification when it's made into a supplement, becomes rock or glass. 

Q: What about those yellow capsules where it's real fine? 

A: That's what it looks like. That's what it looks like. It's not like this.

Q: No, like capsules. Not the pills that are hard.

A: No, even the capsules, even the fluid stuff, the powdered stuff is this. This, in the fluid stuff, this is in the fluid. That is natural and raw. This is the kerosene on this to dissolve it, to extract it, and then it dries.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They can't. They can't, it'll destroy itself in hours. It has no shelf life.

Q: Why haven't I read about this somewhere before?

A: Pardon?

Q: Why haven't I read about this somewhere before?

A: Because they don't want you to know it. 

Q: It'll destroy the industry.

A: This is vitamin B1, raw form, no kerosene, no gasoline, fermented and separated from the food, five days, six days, ten days of work. You know how much it would cost if they made it like this and bottled it? It would cost you about a thousand dollars a capsule. They have to do it fast, so they use gasoline, kerosene, dissolve it, and make it into this. Crystal chunks. It has no relationship. It doesn't do the same thing. All supplements, every supplement. The only thing that's near natural are algaes and chlorella, but then we don't digest those. When I checked the feces of people who ate it, only 2% of the algae was absorbed. 2%. 98% of the algae that you eat passes through your digestive system. In chlorella, 7% was digested. 93% was waste. So you're going to have something. Have chlorella. Have just a quarter of a teaspoon. Put in an 8-ounce glass of vegetable juice. And let it sit in there for 24 hours or 3 days. If you make juice the way I described in here, you can make it for 3-4 days. It'll stay very fresh. Even if you want to use it on the 4th or 5th day, when it starts fermenting, it'll just be more of a cleanser for you instead of a vitamin and enzyme supplement. It'll be a detoxifier. And that's pretty good. So it's okay to have a little bit of very fermented vegetable juice.

Q: Just chlorella or chlorella and or spirulina?

A: Spirulina, like I said, even in the juice, I [unintelligible], 2%. Chlorella, 7%. If you're using quarter of a teaspoon for 8-12 ounces of juice and you let it sit for a day or two, you will digest all of that little bit. And that can help remove poisons out of the body. If you have a hot tub, let the algae grow. If you have a swimming pool, let the algae grow. Because algae eats rock, it eats minerals. It will pull it out of your body. Actually, just like it goes on the rocks, it's pulling, it's disintegrating rock. That's what it eats, rock. It's disintegrating, it's pitting the rock. So when you have it in your hot tub or in your swimming pool, my swimming pool, you see my swimming pool, I can show you my swimming pool, it's all algae, it's all green. And I get in there and swim, no any kind of skin disorders, no chlorine, no chloroform, and when I get out, my skin is less gray for 24 hours. Because the algae has actually pulled the metals out of my skin. Let me tell you, my skin went very gray after those three injections. Very gray. 

Q: Lake water makes you feel real good.

A: Yeah.

Q: I never thought of that.

A: Drinking it too, you're going to eat algae, drink your lake water in a swimming pool full of algae, or your hot tub full of algae. Okay, so that takes care of that. How long have I been going on this? This whole thing.

Q: Two hours and 22 minutes.

A: No, I mean I've been over an hour and 45 minutes. Okay, let's take a short break. Another ten, fifteen minute break and then we'll wind this up.

[break]

A: This girl came to me not as a patient, she was a neighbor. She was chronic fatigued since she was fourteen years old. She was born in 1969. She was twenty-eight when she, or twenty-seven when she moved next door. And as she had chronic fatigue from fourteen, she was able to only work six hours a week. Total work time, six hours weekly. That's all the energy she had. Lots of fibromyalgia, but mostly chronic fatigue. Now, she was born in 1969 and her mother was in college. Both the mother and father are teachers, so they believe all the crap like the poor nurses do. Absolutely accept everything that they're told. And so, the mother didn't know she was pregnant. For five months she kept menstruating for the first five months of pregnancy. But she kept swelling out. So she went to a doctor and found out what was wrong, she was pregnant. So she smoked, drank, and did all the things that college kids do without stopping. And when she found out she was pregnant, of course, she stopped all that. But that damaged the placenta. And the placenta is the baby's filter until the baby is born. Damages the placenta so badly that the baby wasn't filtering out the toxins. So this child was born with black eyes. Mother had blue eyes, father had green. Two sisters, one blue, one green. She was born with black eyes. So, now you're going to see this [unintelligible]. Now this is already on the diet a year and three months. It was even darker than that. This blue was dark green. This is all black in the intestinal tract and black out here. This is hip cancer right here and kidney. On the right side she had hip and hip bone and kidney cancer, breast cancer and yeah. Kidney, hip and, pardon?

Q: Is this the baby?

A: No.

Q: Is this the mother?

A: This is a woman. This is a 28-year-old woman. Her mother is the one who did all the messing around when she was gestating inside her mother. So this is a year and three months on the diet. So it's already cleaned up a bit. Now this woman became my girlfriend. So she asked me to dictate what she ate, how much she ate, and when to eat. So this is the first time I ever got to do anything like that except with myself. I was more careful with her than I was with myself. So let me put it in Photoshop so you can see them together. But I'll just open it. This is, whoa, eight years later. She will have blue eyes. My eyes were darker than this 40 some years ago, 46 years ago. My eyes were darker than this. Now mine are clean blue. After that injection, those three injections, my eyes went gray again. From blue to gray. Now they're getting bluer again. My skin is getting less gray, you know, as I get rid of it. But you can see all the tin and metal she still has throughout there. You can see the blue coming through. That's in only eight years. That's the first time anybody has ever done that much cleansing of the body in the history of anybody because she let me dictate it. Of course, I was observing her every day, you know, so I was able to see what she needed. Most people will take 20 years to do what she did in eight years, 25 years to do that. Now I've got it down a little bit better and that's what I'm going to share with you now. Things that make it quicker. The toxicity that she has in her nervous system around here, brain, that can be removed in probably half the time of normal. Twice the time that she did, half the time that she did. That's quick. And the way to do that is, I found that cheese, no salt raw cheese, is undigestible. Any dried food is enzyme deficient. And without the enzymes, you can't digest and utilize the proteins, the minerals, the fats. You can't digest anything properly without the enzymes. So you have to go ahead and leach them throughout the system, which I talk about in both books. If you don't have it, you can't afford to utilize it somewhere else, that food won't be digested. But that's what I want with cheese, no salt raw cheese. If you eat a little cube every day, all day long, 15 minutes, I have some people who look like they're Terminator, full of metal, their eyes are completely grey. Much like this, I eat a cube of cheese every 15 to 20 minutes. And it just starts pulling at it, it's like a train of it going through, collecting all those metals, absorbing them like a vacuum cleaner, and then dumps out the feces. Because you will not digest that cheese unless you eat fruit or honey with it. So, you wake up the first thing in the morning, I'm going to give you a good dietary general diet.

Wake up in the morning, if you're a small person, one and a half tablespoons of no salt raw cheese. If you're a bigger person, two to three tablespoons of no salt raw cheese. If you have a tendency to get a very dry fecal matter, eat a little butter with it. Teaspoon, if you have a tablespoon and a half of cheese, teaspoon of butter. If you have three tablespoons of cheese, have a whole tablespoon of butter. So it doesn't dry out so much in your system. We're just going to go through and pick up all that you dumped during the night in your stomach and intestines. The problem is, people dump this stuff from the stomach into the food, into their intestines, and they reabsorb all of those poisons. So they're just re-poisoning themselves all day long, maybe discarding 10-20% of it. But they're recycling 80-90% of their poisons. Because it dumps from the intestines into the food and stomach into the food. So, who eats the cheese first and absorbs those poisons?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Butter only if you want butter, if you need the butter. Then, so they'll absorb a lot of those poisons. And it's going to go through for 19-24 hours. Remember, it takes 24 hours for food to get through the system, the human system. That's why we're not herbivores. We don't eat vegetation. Herbivores have 2.5 times more digestive tract than we do. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the proteins and the fats. We do that 2-4% maximum. They have all molar teeth for grinding and grinding. They swallow, they regurgitate their food, they chew it again up to 7 times. Then when they desiccate, if they're on completely raw, fresh grass, they digest 65%. If they're on dried hay, they digest 45%. And they're herbivores. We will eat vegetation [unintelligible]. We'll only digest 2-4%. That's a waste in our body. It over-alkalinises the stomach and digestion tract, and then we don't have the acidic enzymes and bacteria to eat and digest the meats and the dairy and the eggs. So we just damage ourselves. When you eat vegetable juice, there's very little fiber in it. Because there's lots of vitamins and enzymes, that's your supplement. That's your vitamin and enzyme supplement, is your juice. The perfect live vitamins and enzymes. Of course, vitamins and enzymes really aren't alive, but they're nutrients that become live cells. So, to get the brain functioning to optimal, eggs are the best food. If you eat high carbohydrate foods in the morning, let's say you eat carrot juice, even if it's pure, or you're eating toast or, you know, some fruit juice, especially pasteurized, you're gonna have all this advanced glycation end product that makes it very sticky. So it makes your brain fluid very sticky. So that means your synapse is misfiring. You're not clear thinking. You get anxious. You get irritable. Because of all that clogged, sugary reaction in your nervous system. So to avoid that, you do not eat high-carbohydrate anything until six hours after you've been awake. The body will make all of its glycogen from the day in that first six hours, unless you go eat a bunch of sugar. Then it'll change and go right back into making sticky glycogen. And it'll just keep that that you made for the whole day, and just keep that in storage. It'll use the sticky stuff if you eat a lot of even later than six hours. So to make your focus very good, your clarity very good, suck three to five eggs. Have an egg, ten minutes after you have an egg, ten minutes after you have an egg, five minutes after you have an egg, seven minutes after you have an egg.

You're a big person, five eggs. If you're small, two or three eggs should do it. Ten minutes apart. So, if you have the cheese, cheese and butter. Ten minutes later you start with your eggs. Thirty minutes after that you finish three eggs. And then, that's the first thirty to forty minutes of your day. If you're eating five eggs, of course it's going to be fifty minutes into your day. The best way to make this diet work for you, is in that first hour of the day as you're eating that stuff, you prepare all the foods for the entire day. All the way up until where you go into bed. Prepare them all. When you prepare it all at one time, it takes me thirty-five minutes a day. Unless it's a juicing day. Then it's an extra hour, an hour and fifteen minutes. Depending upon how much juice I'm making. So that is, it's like one day every four days that I make the juice. So that's an hour and fifteen minute process by the time I finish washing, cleaning the juicer. Otherwise, it's thirty-five to forty minutes for me, every day, to make my food for the whole day. Most people will go out to a store, a health food store, and buy something, stand in line, and then have to eat it. Then you're blown an hour and a half to an hour to an hour and a half each time you do that. You stop and prepare your food again dinner time. You have to wash more dishes while you're, and start that chore all over again, making things and doing dishes. You have no scrubbing here because there's no, you know, cooked food, it's just warm water. It usually cleans everything. So, you make all of your foods for the one day, that first hour. It's all the time you're saving for the rest of the day. Plus, you'll be on a perfect diet because you're taking all the foods with you. It's already prepared. There's no excuses. Oh, I couldn't get to the store. I didn't bring it with me because I thought I'd get home sooner. If I leave the house, I've got at least 12 hours of food with me. Usually 24 because I don't know if my car is going to break down. I don't care. It's just one time in my life. It's going to be time that I don't have the food. And it's just going to be deprivation of my body. So, I'm going to take care of this body because it is still death do you part. There's no divorce. And I've tried to drown myself. I've tried to fast myself. And this body says, No, you're not. You're going to take better care of me. So, I do. So, preparing those foods in the morning and having them with you throughout the day is very important. Now, I don't refrigerate everything. Once it's made, I usually leave it out. If it's vegetable juice, I will always put it in the chiller. Everything else I take out. If I'm going to have meat, I take it out the night before. If I'm going to have milk, I always have milk, always have meat. 

I take it out either the morning before, so it's 24 hours at room temperature, growing lots of good bacteria, or I take it out the night before, so it's at least 12 hours before I start drinking it. Sometimes, like when I was in Wisconsin, I was getting fresh, warm milk every day, not refrigerated. I put a little bit of saliva in it, and 24 hours I had kefir. It was fabulous. And if you get milk, not refrigerated, never non-refrigerated, you know, ever refrigerated, never refrigerated, it will go into kefir faster, bacteria will grow and multiply. If you pre-digest all that milk, you don't have to digest it. It's already finished. It's already accomplished. So I eat it, and I'm very nutrified. A lot more energy. Also, I take my meat and I pate it. What did I say earlier? Hydrochloric acid will break down large chunks of meat and protein. So I eat meat, I chew it up, chew it, swallow it, and I've still got chunks in there. So I need more hydrochloric acid. The body has to take nutrients to make the hydrochloric acid. It has to take time and energy and spend nutrients and making that hydrochloric acid. Well, so I take my meat. I'll take a big roast, not roasted, but they call it big chunks of beef roast, raw. And I'll cut it up into little inch-to-inch-and-a-half cubes. I'll put it in my food processor, which is about two-quart food processor, and I'll fill it up to the top blades, and I'll paté it so it's minced meat. Guess what? When I eat meat that way, I sleep an hour less a day and have a lot more energy because I don't have to create the hydrochloric acid to break that meat particles down so that the bacteria can infiltrate it. It's already broken down into a mince. So, I sleep an hour to an hour and a half less when I eat minced meat. Think about it. These are all things that I've perfected over the years that can make your life more productive and more everything that you might enjoy.

Q: What's with the meat grinder?

A: A meat grinder doesn't paté, it'll help. That breaks it down, but when you put it into a food processor and leave it on for 30 seconds, you've got paté meat. Much finer than any ground. And usually, your meat grinders are pot metal. So you have plenty of metal in that meat. So, okay, so we've had the eggs. The brain's now functioning. You don't need caffeine, you don't need nicotine, you don't need any kind of stimulant to have your brain going. Now your brain's operating. So after that, if you're very toxic, if you've got dark eyes and you've got some blue or green spots in it, that means you're very toxic. If you feel blah, have a vegetable juice the next thing. Have cheese, you know, like ten minutes after you finish your last egg, and a little cube of cheese. A half a teaspoon is a sugar cube size. So when I say cube, I mean a sugar cube size, which is a half a teaspoon. So have a cube of cheese. Ten minutes after that, start drinking your vegetable juice. Always sip everything. If you chug it, most of the H2O is going to go to the kidney, and then you're not going to be carrying the H2O to the cells, with your other nutrients, and your body's going to dehydrate. Then you're going to crave water, and the water will never satisfy it, because you can't absorb water without the ionic activity. Gatorade, all that, is electrically charged, but it's not electrically charged by nutrients. It's electrically charged artificially, not with [unintelligible].

Q: Can you just say that again about why you sip the juice?

A: Sip it because if you drink fast, most of the H2O is going to go to the kidney. That's too much fluid in the stomach at one time, so the body will just absorb it, and it comes right in, filter [unintelligible] and pass the H2O to the kidney. So always sip. Treat, you know, your juices and your milk like it's tea, like it were coffee, like you sip. Nobody chugs coffee. I've never seen anyone chug coffee except me when I needed to get energy fast. When I crashed, I crashed hard. So I chuged. I put a few ice cubes in my coffee and down it to get myself charged. But most of the time, I'm just sipping. And most people do. So sip your fluids. Don't chug anything. You see, I'm still working on my [unintelligible]. And it started here. And normally, I take an ounce a minute. So if I have 8 ounces, it's taking me about 10 minutes to drink it. If it's 12, it takes me about 15 minutes to drink it. And that should be normal. And you should be sipping milk, milkshakes. And a sport formula all throughout the day. Now, I'm going to give you my sport formula. And I suggest you make a milkshake or just drink milk along with a sport formula every day as your fluid. Now, a sport formula is made with 3 cups of basic ingredients. And it makes a quart altogether. So you've got 3 cups of main ingredients can be at least 2 of 5 substances. Substances are cucumber puree, watermelon puree, tomato puree, milk, or whey. So those are the 5 substances. Now, whey is the liquid runoff from milk.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Cheese is the white stuff, those are the curds, that's whey. When the farmer separates them it will be even clearer than that. That's whey. That's the liquid runoff from making. Now, the whey is a little bit more cleansing. If you do sports, a high amount of lactic acid is in the whey. And the whey helps, the lactic acid in the whey helps remove the lactic acid in your muscles. So it frees up the fatigue. Because lactic acid buildup causes fatigue in the muscles. So it helps remove it. Neutralizes the lactic acid because of the high rate of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium in the whey. The lactic acid binds with the acidic lactic acid, [unintelligible] in the muscles and neutralises it. So it's no longer robbing minerals out of your bones, I mean out of your muscles. It's the causes of fatigue. It's right there in the whey. So whey is something very good to have in that if you're an athlete or if you exercise. So, like I said, do at least two of those five ingredients. You can make all five of them. You can put all five of them to make up your three cups. That's fine. And then the other ingredients, pardon?

Q: Total of three cups?

A: Those five ingredients is a total of three cups. Then I'm going to give you another cup of ingredients. One to two eggs. Two to four tablespoons of coconut cream. Two tablespoons of dairy cream. Two tablespoons of lime juice. Two teaspoons of lemon juice. One to two tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar. And that will be your other cup. Blend those all together. Now make sure that you understand puree. You're not juicing the cucumber. You're not juicing the tomato. You're not juicing the watermelon. And the watermelon you use down to the green. Peel away the green. You eat the white rind. And you eat all the way up to the seeds. It will really sweep stuff away. Because that will just sugar you up. Okay?

Q: You don't use any red?

A: Pardon?

Q: You don't use any of the red?

A: Yes. Yes, you're using it up to the seeds, where the seeds begin.

Q: Oh, that's sweeter.

A: Huh?

Q: I didn't realize that was sweeter.

A: That's right. You want to get rid of that sweet stuff.

Q: I didn't realize that was sweeter.

A: Okay. The heart's the sweetest part of the watermelon.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible] It might get irritable on you. And you blend... You peel the cucumber. You don't have to peel the watermelon. But you don't peel the tomato. The tomato's [unintelligible]. You don't need one. But you slice all those things. Put them in a blender jar. Put all the other ingredients, the eggs and the creams. And the way that you're using it, the milk that you're using it. And you blend it all together. That's your sport formula for the day. It doesn't have to be for sport. It will just hydrate you with lots of nutrients. It will make you feel cleaner and better. In fact, some people who do that everyday don't even need much vegetable juice. So you don't have to make vegetable juice everyday. You don't have to have vegetable juice everyday. Unless you've got a condition where I say you really need the vegetable juice. That vinegar will dissolve a lot of toxicity in your body. It helps dissolve tumors. It helps chelate and bind with heavy metals. The amino acids that are in the vinegar, raw apple cider vinegar, are the same that are in chelation therapy, only they use in chelation therapy processed toxic soy amino acids to do that. So you've got all this kerosene or gasoline in it. Raw apple cider vinegar removes it. If you eat too much vinegar, you're going to demineralize yourself, and you're going to start causing osteoporosis. So even though it's good, and you say, oh, if it's good a little bit, it's good a lot. No, it is not. If you're smaller, if you're under 125 pounds, you should only be having a tablespoon of the vinegar a day. If you're anywhere from 125 to 190 pounds, two a day. If you're 190 to 250 pounds, you could have three a day. And you're going to be eating lots of cheese all day long to make sure that you're remineralizing yourself. Now most of that cheese will be eaten without honey and without fruit. Most of that's just going to bind with poisons and will go through you. Probably 10% will be used to remineralize the body. Because it's going to catch up with some enzyme activity [unintelligible]. Yes, maybe 10%. But usually not that it's toxic. If you have a vegetable juice, and you have heart palpitations, and you're injecting vegetable juice, or you get very excited or nervous, or you get higher blood pressure, you need to put an egg in that vegetable juice. And a tablespoon of raw cream. Just slow it down so it doesn't rush into the system. Then you need to let it wait at least an hour. After that, unless you're an athlete, you go through food quickly. If you're an athlete, 45 minutes is fine to wait after you finish your vegetable juice before you have your first meat meal. And a lot of people will say, wait a minute, I thought you said that if I had high carbohydrates, it's going to make sticky glycogen. 

So, and I recommend usually a third carrot, a third parsley, I mean a third celery, and a third cucumber puree and 10% cilantro and parsley or beet [unintelligible]. And with that high carrot, there's a lot of sugar, isn't it? No, because your celery is a negative. So there's not enough carbohydrate in celery to digest celery. So it creates a negative on the carbohydrate level. So if you're having equal parts celery with your carrot juice, it's going to be a negative. I mean it's going to be a level. So you're not going to make a lot of sugar from it, okay? A tiny bit, but not much. I used to recommend honey in it. If you can't eat it, you can't digest it, if it's honey in it, you don't need honey in it. It's up to you if you want to have it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I thought it used to, but it really doesn't. Nor is lemon, really. Lemon causes more fermentation. That's when I did more studies, you know, and observing more. It seems to do that in the first, let's say, 8-10 hours, but after that the lemon causes massive fermentation. Lime juice will stop it from bacterial digestion and from bacterial advancement from fermentation. But lemon encourages fermentation. That's why lemon is so good to marinate, you know, chicken, fish, and your white meats. Because lime is not a good marinator. Because it stops bacterial breakdown. It stops fermentation. You peel them. Always peel your cucumbers. Even if you think they're organic, let me tell you, inorganic, the FDA has made that meaningless. They allowed 17.5% chemicals in food still going around. You know, 30 years ago, they allowed 2.5%. Then it was 5%. Then it was 7.5%. They keep jacking it up every 3 or 4 years. 

Q: How much lime did you add to a gallon of juice?

A: How much lime? I don't do it. I'd rather my juice gets higher in bacteria and it ferments on its own. If you have a lemon that's going to ferment faster, that's too fast. Honey will preserve it, but sometimes it's too sweet for some people. If you like it, it's fine to put honey.

Q: That makes it much better.

A: That's fine. Just remember, your honey, as long as it's truly unheated, and that means never heat it above bee-hive temperature on a hot day, which is 93 degrees. The bees collect the nectar. They swallow it. They pre-digest it. They get back to the hive and they vomit. That's what honey is. Bee vomit. Good vomit. Tasty vomit.

Q: Are you doing leafy greens?

A: Pardon?

Q: There's no space to green... Juice leafy green.

A: I said parsley, cilantro, 10% of your juice.

Q: I don't know, kale or collards or any of that.

A: You can do that but never make it more than 5% of the juice. You've got 10% of greens that you can do what you want with. So you choose what greens those are going to be.

Q: Asparagus.

A: Asparagus, the tips are a fruit. The stalk is a vegetation. If you use those, your urine is going to stink. Your urine is going to smell bad.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Good for the brain, that's right, good for the brain.

A: So that's the way to take a vegetable. Eggs and cream is always best. So you slow it down so it doesn't rush into the system. Also, because of the greens in it, they're going to detoxify you. Especially the cilantro, it's going to start pulling metals out of the body. Like mercury, tin, lead. And you want egg fat in there, protein, to chelate with those toxins. And then the walk-in cream to protect and shield the nerve cells and brain cells from damage from those metals. Cream is the only fat that completely protects the brain and nerves. Coconut cream will help a lot. Butter will help a lot. Sour cream will help a lot. But fresh cream is the only one that the body can use to make a total cholesterol to feed and protect the brain. [unintelligible] But, as far as fat is concerned, you require 60 varieties of bile. 60 varieties of bile that the liver has to produce. If the liver is toxic, it probably will only produce a third of those.

Q: Sour, that's expensive. Is it sour cream? That's expensive.

A: Yeah. But it won't feed the brain and nervous system quite as well. Because there's some fermentation that occurs that cannot occur to a certain cholesterol to protect the brain. [unintelligible] So, ok, so we have, you know, you've had a vegetable juice. Then, you know, 20 minutes, 30 minutes go by, you have a cube of cheese, another 15, 20, 30 minutes go by and you have another cube of cheese. 10 minutes after that, your meat meal. If you don't have a vegetable juice, 20, 30 minutes after you finish your egg, then you have another cube of cheese. 10 minutes after that, you have your meat meal. Always, always have butter, [unintelligible]. Say 80% of the time, 8 meals out of 10, have butter with your meat meal. Now when I talk about meat, I'm not talking about red meat, I'm talking about all flesh food. Whether it's poultry, seafood, fish, buffalo, beef, venison, it does not matter. When I say meat, it involves all flesh food. Most people think when you say meat, you're talking about beef. That is not the case when I speak. If I want you to have meat, beef, I'll say beef. If I want you to have fowl, I'll say have poultry. So meat, any meat that you like, is fine for you. You have that with butter. If you're under 100 pounds, one and a half tablespoons of butter is good enough for you. If you're above that, it should be two or more. [unintelligible] every 50 pounds. That butter will keep you from utilizing that meat as energy. That's what your body will make. If you don't have butter with it, or another fat, especially butter, your body's going to convert a lot of that protein, that meat, into pyruvate, and use it as fuel. Fat's your fuel. You get two and a half times more energy with fat than you do with carbohydrate fuel, protein. Two and a half times more. And you look. To prove that, you look at your weightlifter. Do you ever see a skinny weightlifter? Do you ever see a skinny wrestler? No. They need lots of fat to have that power and strength. Your bodybuilders don't have a lot of strength, because they don't have fat in their muscles. Take, for example, Schwarzenegger. I used to be around him, you know, in that same circuit, health food stores, where they work out, he'd come in, Sylvester Stallone, so on, all of them. And, you know, Schwarzenegger, down the raw milk, the raw dairy, raw meat, in Austria, that's normal, you eat raw meat and raw dairy for your athletes. They're all trained on it. They're trained on a raw, carnivorous diet, much like mine. And they build up. So Schwarzenegger would build up and build up, get fat and lift like 734 pounds. When he'd go to exhibit, he'd take off all that fat so his muscles would pop everywhere. No fat left in those muscles, so by the time he would be into exhibiting, at the exhibition stage, he could lift 300 pounds [unintelligible] pounds under. That's a 400-pound loss of strength.

You take off that fat. Fat is all important. Fat is also where your toxins go. So people need to be fat. I know you don't think I'm very fat right now, but I go down, and I go travel around. I went to South Africa, to Australia, and to the Philippines. So I started swimming in my new swimming pool with all the algae in it. So I got used to exercising. Also did some digging, some plumbing work, and stuff like that. But before I left for the first time, I forced myself in a three-month period to go from a 34-waist to a 47. I was putting my pants under by belly. And I felt so good. The most relaxed I felt since those injections. I tell everybody else, pull on the fat until you feel relaxed. I went up to a 47-inch waist before I felt really relaxed and calm. Now it's down to a 34-35-inch waist. And I'm going back, I'm pumping back up, and I'm like all babies. Babies put all their nutrients here, they have to absorb it here, and then they distribute that. So that's what we need to do. If you're eating cheese frequently, you don't need as much weight. But when I'm traveling to those areas, I can't get the cheese. So I pump myself up with a lot of fat. So cheese can make you a lot, you know, much more stable without being, you know, humongously fat. But to me, you're a very good size, you're an excellent size, you're skinny in the legs, but you're good in the stomach. 

Q: I gained 40 pounds.

A: I know you gained 40 pounds. You're good. Imagine how skinny he was, 40 pounds less than he is. And he's pretty good. Very good. She is excellent. I say he's excellent. You've got to be fat if you want to be safe and strong. You've got to have a way to move the poisons out of the body. You're excellent. You're excellent. I've got a good group here. This is not too thin. Most times I get two-thirds of my audience is skinny. 

Q: [unintelligible] skinny guy when I first met you.

A: Yes, yes. I remember that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: But she used to be terribly skinny. She looked rightfully skinny. She was a vegetarian for 30 years? 27 years. So, fat is so important. So eat your fat with your meat so you don't utilize it as fuel. But you want your fat to be fuel. Avocados are okay. They're hard to digest. But they're okay. Your butter and your raw cream are going to help you tremendously. But do not eat extra raw cream with your meat unless it's sour cream. Otherwise you will not digest your meat. Raw cream, as I said, is the hardest fat to digest. It's as hard as avocado. But avocado will not soothe the brain and the nervous system. It helps the liver, the adrenal glands, the pancreas, and the stomach. But it doesn't help everything like animal fats will. So, you have to butter with your meat. And if you, you know, if you're highly toxic, your intestinal tract, that ring, there's a ring around the pupil. This ring, there's a ring around the pupil. That area. All that benzene from thirty-six hours at a time flying from South Africa to Australia. See this ring around here? That's the intestinal tract. This is the autonomic nerve belt. This little thing that goes around here. It keeps the body in touch with the brain, brain in touch with the body. See that right there? You can see how toxic this is. If that is highly toxic, it isn't the normal color of the rest of your eye. The lightest color in your eyes is what the color of your eye should be. Then eat some cheese. A little bit of grated cheese with your meat, too. Just to make sure you're not going to recycle those poisons. Now is when we're going to get our mineral supplement. And how can we get a mineral supplement if it's not rock? We don't eat rock. Plants eat rock. But your main mineral supplement to come out of a pill or a powder is a rock. We don't eat rock. Plants eat rock. So we need our minerals digested by plants, eaten by animals. So, where are we going to find that? Cheese. But there's no enzymes how are we going to digest it? Honey. Honey will allow you the enzyme activity with the bee to put that insulin-like substance in. It converts the nectar into honey which is mainly 90%, without being heated over 93 degrees, is an enzyme activator. It will supply enzymes to digest any food you eat it with. So you only have a small amount though. Let's say you have two tablespoons of cheese with two teaspoons of honey. Maybe only one and a half teaspoons of honey. That will give you enough nutrients to digest the fats with the minerals. You won't digest much of the protein, you're not having enough honey to do that. You want to digest the minerals. You eat your meat so you don't eat the protein. You eat your fats so you don't eat much fat. So you have a small amount of the honey or a little bit of cubed pineapple with it. Honey is better. If you can't get good, fresh, you know, unheated honey, then you use just a little cube of pineapple and eat that with the cheese. You will digest those minerals. You're eating a whole quart worth of minerals with one tablespoon of cheese. One tablespoon of cheese is worth one quart of minerals.

Think about that. I've seen osteoporosis, 32% loss, reversed in one year by women eating three tablespoons of cheese with two and a half to three teaspoons of honey three times daily. A year. The medical profession doesn't even imagine 1% in a five year period. I've seen women restore 32% in a year. And they do that for each meat meal once in the middle of the night. So you've got weak bones, bad teeth, eat that cheese to pull the poisons out of your body all day long, and eat the cheese with the honey two or three times a day. And if you've got a real bad toothache, sit down and eat a half a pound of cheese with a teaspoon of honey for every tablespoon of cheese. Eat it until you have no more pain. You've got an abscess, you have the cheese and honey and the tomato mixture that I mentioned in the book for abscesses. And it will stabilize usually within 24 hours. Most people will go around with a toothache for months. Okay, so after you have your cheese and honey, you're going to have 3 hours, 4 hours until your fruit meal. So if you count all the time and space you have there, you've got 6 to 8 hours before you have your fruit meal. All your glycogen is going to be made so your fruit won't be used to run the brain and nervous system. So you won't have all that sticky stuff. And the fluid. So, for the next 2, 4, 3, 4 hours, you have your cheese every 15, 20, 30, 45, maybe once an hour. Up to you how quickly you want to get rid of the poisons out of your stomach and digestive tract. Let me tell you, body puts 80% of all vaccines into your stomach lining. And you're dumping that into your food all day long, every day. Everything you eat. Cheese will absorb it. The more cheese you have, the quicker you're going to relieve that. I saw one person this year that did it every 15 minutes. Theirs was black around here. After one year, it was light gray all around here and only charcoal gray just around the edge. Maybe a sixteenth of an inch. I've never seen anybody pull out that much. But that person did 90 minute hot baths a day and did the cheese every 15 minutes. They cleaned out... What I usually see, people clean out in three to five years. That person cleaned out in one year because they were diligent. Up to you how fast you want to get wet. Up to you how fast you want to detoxify, decontaminate. But I found that with the cheese and the hot baths, you go through so much fewer symptoms and the time span on detoxification is completely minimized. In fact, I used to have colds and flus three to four times a year and I cheered for that, even for myself. When I started eating the cheese and the hot baths, I was already doing heavy detoxification so my body didn't have to throw itself into one of those things. So it was wonderful, wonderful. And I only figured that out about five years ago.

Tested on about 50 people for two years and now I've been testing on 500 for, you know, three years. And it works with everybody. Nobody has gotten less by doing those. They've only increased their detoxification and their health so much more rapidly. Like I said in my books, it takes four years to get rid of all the toxins. Not anymore. I know how you can do it in less of a time. Maybe 50% of the time. But even if you're taking 10 years off, you're going to be well in 30 years on this diet instead of 40 years.

Q: You'll only be 90.

A: But just think. I met a tribe in the Philippines. I was banned from going to see them. The Philippine government, I tried to get a permit to do it. This is all their cannibals in there. [unintelligible] So, they just don't want you to know how healthy people can be on eating naturally. So, I went into this health spa to get a massage because I got anxious. When I went, I kept going to the government to get a permit to visit that tribe that I heard about that lives to an average of 138 years old. I wanted to meet these people and find out what they were eating because nobody could tell me that. And a few people told me about the tribe. So, I got to the point where the government got so angry with me that they called the budget [unintelligible], only major rental facility. I think they wanted a price. Because they knew I was going to try to get to the tribe, permit or not. And they warned me, if we catch you near that tribe, it's 10 years in jail and $10,000 fine. So, I was taking a big risk. So, I went to this health spa to get a massage to help me calm down. I was pretty angry that they started getting vindictive about it. I'm a scientist. I want to know. I want to discover. I want to learn. So, I went into this spa and this receptionist, a fairly dark Philippine woman, sitting behind her, her baby behind her. A few weeks old. White as a ghost. I looked at the picture with her husband and the baby. He's black. He's a black Filipino. And she's talking to this baby. It is as white as his shirt. And barely breathing. Not moving. And I said, you know, your baby doesn't move well. And sometimes I can't shut my mouth. [unintelligible] People come to me. When I saw that baby, I knew that they were going to give him powdered milk. So, and according to Dr. Francis Pottenger's work, powdered milk gives them all 2,300 diseases that humans have. Even the cats. So, I said, well, what do you feed your baby? Oh, the hospital said, you know, powdered milk and boiled water. So I said, so I explained to her, Dr. Pottenger's work, and I said, your baby looks like, you know, he's going to die, and she says, yeah, but they said keep giving him the powdered milk and he'll get well. It wasn't happening. I said, how long? She said, he's five months old. I thought he was three months, three weeks, four weeks old. So, I said, listen, you don't breastfeed, I don't know why you're not breastfeeding, but that would do it for the baby. They said, no, the powdered milk was better. The hospital told her not to breastfeed and that's the same thing they did in America. They want you to have formula and all kinds of medicine. I said, but even better, the cows [unintelligible], like I had rented a house on this island off of Mindanao, which is called the Samal Island. It's a small, little tiny paradise. I had gotten a dairy there to feed their cows, besides grass, green banana. So bananas are a melon, so they're high in hormones. So you get the body going and [unintelligible]. 

So I went over there, and I was getting my milk from that dairy. So I went over there and got six liters, took them to this woman, and said, now feed your baby. So I go back three days later and see how the baby's doing. The baby's dark, breathing slightly, crying, and happy. Crying because it was unhappy, just wanted attention. And the baby was so happy, so great, the grandfather was there. And the grandfather hugged me, started to hug me, and it was so beautiful when you see something like that. That woman, you know, the baby was like this [unintelligible]. So when I see stuff like that happen, and I have something to do with it, it's really gratifying work. I don't make near as much money as I did as an actor. I make much, much more as an actor than I did as an interviewer, but it's not as gratifying. So, he said, well, what are you doing here? I said, well, I was trying to get a permit to go visit this tribe. He said, well, I'm from that tribe. I left the tribe 30 years ago. Now, I'm liaison between the government, Philippine government and tribes, he said, I'll get you a permit. He couldn't get a permit. He avoided me for 10 days. And finally, he says, listen, I wasn't able to do it. They absolutely said no. And they said, you keep messing around and they're going to have somebody hurt you. He said, but, I have an uncle that left the tribe, I mean, a cousin that left the tribe only seven years ago. We're going to get a four-wheel drive and I'm going to pick him up and we're going to go. But we have to do it clandestinely. It's a day trip on the four-wheeler, then we're on a boat, a day trip on the boat, and then swimming. We had to swim to the island, which was over, not an island, so we actually had to swim. And we had these reeds, so if the Coast Guard came by, we [unintelligible]. There had automatic machine guns and they would shoot you down. They don't want anybody going near these tribes. They say it's protection of the tribes. I found out while I was there. So I get to the island. They don't let me go into the tribal park and into the village, but they bring about five or three members. They brought five or three members out. So I look at this guy, this guy, he's 38, 40 years old, 87 years old. Perfect teeth. Everybody had perfect teeth, stocky and full, averaged 138 years old. Oldest one was 152 right there. So I said, you know, to ask him about diseases and if they had any diseases. And he said, women with their, you know, hours and hours of questions. And I left the best till the last, what they ate. And they said, we eat two foods. Two foods. Raw fish and coconut meat. Coconut water. They may have a banana or a unripe banana or a mango once every two weeks to a month. Four weeks. That's all the fruit they eat. All of this fat and all of this fish meat, you know, and strong and heavy. If I eat fish, I get skinny. But I have that vagotomy.

So I think that's part of it. And I don't get, you know, stocky and thick with fish. But they were all stick. Can you imagine dying at 138 years old with all of your teeth perfectly white and full? There was only one woman who had a missing tooth here, but she had a scar on her lip. So you can tell, she had lost that tooth from an accident.

Q: I assume they don't brush their teeth.

A: No! It's unheard of.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No. They have no cows. They live on two foods. Their milk is coconut.

Q: Young coconut or mature?

A: Mature. Women will eat half of a coconut, all the meat in it. Men will eat a whole coconut a day with anywhere from one to three pounds of fish that they catch every day.

Q: They eat need more variety than that, don't you think?

A: To be that healthy and happy, I mean, on vacation every day, all they do is go fishing and [unintelligible]. That's pretty good. They'll go swimming. They'll weave a few reeds and build little huts. And they're nomads. They'll go from one part of the island to the other when they feel that they've done too much fishing in an area. Very ecologically conscious. They don't want you to know this. They want you eating cereals. They want you eating donuts. They want you having chunky chips. Chunky cheese shit. All this garbage processed food. That's what the government wants. That's why they didn't want me over there finding out how good and simple a diet can make you thrive for life. Imagine having teeth that are so you can bite at 138 years old. You can eat that hard coconut meat. I mean I have to grate mine. I can't chew on hard stuff. You know? I don't have my teeth dangling in my gums anymore. Most of mine grew back. Bone grew back. But I still can't chew on hard substances like the coconut. Unless I just grate it and then chew on the grated coconut. But I guess it didn't take a pilot chunks of coconut. Hard coconut. All day long eating the pieces of coconut. Just enjoying their lives. Their whole life is a vacation. They don't have to go to an office.

Q: Or do they eat [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah, they do eat their fish [unintelligible]. Not all of them. Probably about half of the fish.

Q: Is it cooked fish or raw?

A: Raw. All raw. They don't use fire for anything on that [unintelligible].

A: So, that's how simple it is. So you don't need a lot of food. But we do need some fruit when we're toxic. We need to provide extra fat. We do need a lot of extra nutrients because we are full of poisons. Industrial poisons. So those need to be removed and we need all these varieties that I'm telling you about. And when you have a symptom find that symptom in there and use the food that I suggest for that particular symptom. And it will go away faster. If you're eating the cheese and doing the baths you're going to have comparative to a lot of people, a lot of detoxification and it's very debilitating and taxing you're going to eliminate 80% of it. And that's what I've learned over the last 7-8 years of research. How to really buckle down and get it tight so you can get rid of the whole thing.

Q: [unintelligible] detoxing pretty much for the last 3 years because I've heard it's here to have. [unintelligible] And that changed.

A: Yeah.

Q: I've been eating cheese. I've been eating cheese. [unintelligible]

A: You decide whether it's every 15 minutes every 20 minutes every 30 minutes every 45 minutes or every 60 minutes that you have a piece of cheese. And it's up to you. In the morning you take your brick of cheese you cut it up into little sugar cube sizes and you chuck them whenever you think about it. But, you know, just have a little bit of your meat meal but you don't have to have it with your fruit meal. Ten minutes before you eat anything you do need some cheese. Ten minutes before you eat anything. When you're sipping your milk if you're having cheese let's say every twenty minutes you have your cheese ten minutes after that you sip some sport formula and or milk or milkshake ten minutes after that you have another piece of cheese. So every twenty minutes you're having some sipping some fluid and every twenty minutes in there you're having cheese. Or do it every thirty minutes. So you have cheese ten, fifteen minutes after that you sip your fluids ten, fifteen minutes after that you have your cheese again. So that's twice an hour you're having cheese. If you have it every fifteen minutes you're going to have it four times an hour. Twenty minutes is three times an hour. Every forty-five minutes it's going to be one time one and a half times every three hours.

Q: With honey. With honey.

A: No. No, no, no. Honey and cheese only happens after your meat meal.

Q: Okay.

A: So, well I didn't say that did I? I'm sorry. I said you have your cheese and honey together to about thirty-five minutes after your meat meal. Twenty-five minutes after your meat meal you have a cube of cheese. Ten minutes after that you have your cheese and honey together. Then you go on your three to four hour space of eating cheese and sipping your fluids. And I don't mean water. Unless it's a small amount. You need nutrients when you want. So then after that when you start at this hour you have after that last cheese ten minutes after that you have your fruit meal. And if you come to me I'll suggest what fruit that you should eat. Otherwise look it up here in the remedy section and see what fruit is best for you. See what symptoms you have in the past or symptoms you're having and that's the fruit to go with. Always eat it with fat. Coconut cream is the best. After you've taken coconut meat you run it through a juicer and you have coconut cream left. Creamy and delicious. But you have to juice it the way I suggest. You need to get that room to 80-85 degrees or else you're not going to get much coconut cream out of that, out of the pulp of the coconut.

Q: You can all buy it in the garage too. It's already pre-made.

A: Oh, okay. That's why we have somebody locally that makes it right in Stockton, Missouri. I helped her buy imported coconut juicing machines from Thailand. So she knows what she's doing. 20 gallons an hour. She's got four machines. That's pretty good.

Q: [unintelligible] It did not go into one of the jars.

[laughter]

Q: It's broken.

A: Anyway, you guys all made it right here, so it's cheaper here. That's a lot of work.

Q: It is.

A: I used to, when I wanted it done, I didn't have the time to do it. It takes a full 8 to 10 hours to do 16, 15, 16 coconuts. That will last you six weeks for just one whole day. And with my back, even my back now, if I do something like that for three, four hours, my back hurts where that radiation was pivoted in those two vertebrae. So I'd get aching back, and I'd have to stop and get into [unintelligible] with a spinal twist. It was so I didn't put a heating pad, I mean a hot water bottle on it at night to get rid of that pain. When I wake in the morning, it's gone. So what I did was I put up a three by five card at a high school gymnasium and said, I need somebody who likes to break things eight dollars an hour. Lots of calls. Fifty calls. People love to break shit you paid for. It's like people like to go into the military to blow up shit. You have to get paid for it. So I hired this African American on the football team, good with his hands. So I showed him how to break open the coconuts. To pry open the coconuts, to choose the coconuts, to grind it in a food processor, and to run it through the juicer, and how hot the room had to be to free up the most coconut cream out of the pulp. So, and if you buy the recipe DVD, you get two hours and fifteen minutes of how I prepare the recipes. Once you see that, you see how fast, on there I make a blueberry cheesecake in twenty minutes. Who can make a cheesecake in twenty minutes? You can make a raw cheesecake, absolutely scrumptious and incredible, in twenty minutes. You can make a meat sauce in three minutes. Even in two minutes. And I just take you through all these processes. So there's two hours and fourteen minutes of preparing. I show you how to make the coconut cream. I show you how to juice vegetation to make your vegetable juices. I go through it all with you. So, there's a... Because people read the book and they say, oh my god, it's complicated. When you see me do it, it's like, that's a breeze. So, it took me like, five years, seven years to come out after the recipe book with the recipe DVD and people say, why the hell didn't you do this sooner? Because it's so easy to make this food delicious if you know how to prepare it fast. So, I didn't bring any with me because I just overbooked with that particular airline on weight. So, but you can go to WeWant2Live.com and it's WeWant spelled out, Live spelled out with a two. WeWantToLive, you spell T-O, it's the numeral two. And go to that website and you can also get a DVD, workshop DVD, the ones I used to give, they concentrated more on diet, food combining, how the body works in more depth. That's five and a half hours. So, if you want to get that, you can get that.

Q: Will you be able to see your, plan your studies on people?

A: No. I just tell you how it all works. I don't give you the material. So, after you have, you know, if you have a fruit meal, always have it with a little bit of animal fat too. So, let's say you have, you've got a very strong digestive tract and lymphatic system. Pineapples, excellent to help dissolve fat. So, have a cup of, say, put this down with his side. A cup of pineapple with half a cup of raspberry to get rid of all the toxic iron in the system, and iodine. So, to do that you need to have three to three-and-a-half tablespoons of coconut cream, one-and-a-half to two tablespoons of dairy cream, two tablespoons of lime juice, one teaspoon of lemon juice, a tiny bit of vinegar if you're not eating, if you're not drinking sport formula. If you're not drinking sport liquor, you have to add vinegar or some other form. Add a tablespoon of sugar and two to three ounces of raw milk, two times a day. If you have cancer, or you need to dissolve dead cells and you start moving calcium [unintelligible] and bones, anything like that, do that for a week. It'll get rid of plaque. It'll get rid of congestive arteries, veins, and all that pretty rapidly, like in six months or five. So you could have built that for years and years and years. So, that's how you can have your vinegars. You can have different fruit meals. When you get a very bad digestion, have a custard. Custard is papaya, eggs, butter, and honey. Grate a little fresh ginger in it to make sure mucus doesn't form too heavily or too thickly. So, that will help your digestive tract. Custard. And all that's in those two books. So you find out what you like. Come to me personally, and I do your iridology, and I show you where your toxins are, show you where your weak points are, and I'll show you, and I'll give you a diet from beginning to end, which is what I suggest you to do for your particular system that you're all tasked with. So, after you have your fruit meal, then you go three or four or five hours of having your cheese and sipping your fluids again. Then, if you are very toxic and you're low in enzyme, you can have another vegetable juice, or if you haven't had one in the morning, have your vegetable juice now at 5, 6 o'clock. If you have a diet of vegetable juice, you go right into your second meat meal. Again, have butter with it. You can have a sauce that's mainly made of butter. And I have 82 sauces in this recipe book, but you can make them 4-5 different ways to eat. So that's 400 sauces. So you won't get bored of eating them. And then, after you have your meat meal, again, have a little cheese. Grate the cheese with it. You have a lot of toxicity in that thing, that area around the pupil. And then, after that, you have your cheese. 

You have your cheese about 25 minutes after, 10 to 15 minutes after that, you have your cheese and honey again. Then, in the evening, you have your cheese and sip, up until the time you go to bed. And that may not be very long. Maybe you're having your meat meal at 8 o'clock. Maybe you're having it at 5 or 6 o'clock. All depends upon you. It's just, that's where you have your meat. You want your juice in there. You throw that in there. And it may move the meat meal later into the evening. Or whatever it is, just follow those patterns. But, make sure you eat in the middle of the night. Because in the human toxic system, you go 5 hours without eating, and your protein level in the blood completely drops. So what do we find? We find high ketones in the blood, because red blood cells are eating each other. They become cannibalistic. So you sleep 8-10 hours, you digest 2-4 tablespoons of red blood cells, and you're anemic. So those people wake up to 8-10 hours, they're sluggish, they go for caffeine or nicotine or theobromine, some way to pick them up. It's because they're anemic. They're eating their own red blood cells. Well, cigarette, coffee, chocolate is not going to make anemia... It's not going to correct anemia. Eating proper foods corrects it. So, you set an alarm in the middle of the night, you don't usually wake up in the night, and you eat something. If you have osteoporosis, you eat 2-3 tablespoons of cheese with 2 teaspoons of honey, and maybe 2 ounces of milk. If you're a little sporty type of person, down a few eggs, a little bit of cheese and some milk. Or have a milkshake, half a milkshake or a whole milkshake, depending on your size. Next you go back down and go back to sleep. If you're a person who doesn't wake, and you're a hyper person that does a lot of exercise, or a lot of activity, like a [unintelligible] person or construction worker, then you set your alarm for 3 hours. You wait and eat. And go back to sleep for 5.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You're eating raw food, not enzyme deficient. Only when you eat cooked foods that's enzyme deficient, plus you have 32 toxins formed, you're going to have problems sleeping. However, if you are a high person, builds a lot of adrenaline, a high activity person, you sleep 5 hours and get up to eat. You may not be able to go back to sleep if you have too much energy. So you set your alarm for 3 hours. Wake and eat. Go back to sleep for 5 hours. Wake and eat again. And the difference in some people is astounding. I had one fellow in Nevada City, John Fox. He was on the diet for a year. He was a skinny vegetarian. 14-year vegetarian. His wife had been an 18-year vegetarian. He was only 46-years-old. He was walking like this. He was a vegetarian. He was walking like this. 46-years-old. Like a 67-80-year-old man. And we're back a year later. He was all pumped up and buff. You know, overweight here too. Belly on him. Feeling strong enough. He said, Aajonus, I get to 10 o'clock noon before I have any energy. And I said, well, this was the third year. And I said, well, you've been to my workshops. Are you waking in the night and eating the food in the night? He said, no. And I said, well, you've heard two workshops. It's going to be the third you're going to hear tomorrow. Why don't you make, intertwine that activity. Eat it at night and see what happens. Do it tonight. Sure enough, he set the alarm. Woke, ate at night, went back to sleep. Guess what? When he woke at 7 o'clock in the morning, he had all kinds of energy. He didn't have to wait till 10 o'clock in the morning. That is how important it is to the human body. If your body's eating its own red blood cells, that's how much less oxygen you're going to deliver to your body. If you're already contaminated, you're already at a low point. If your blood is delivering nutrients into the lymphatic system, you're debilitated already. So just waking and eating that food in the middle of the night is going to be a huge difference for you. Okay, questions and answers.

Q: Can you talk the salmon?

A: Okay, salmon. Have you heard of vomiting all over the place after a salmon? I stopped eating salmon six years ago. Because when I got into investigating GMO salmon by Monsanto, I found that over 2,000 fish were escaping a year into the population for 28 years, and that was six years ago. So now for 34 years, Monsanto has been letting, purposefully letting, their GMO fish jump out and crossbreed. So now it's all over the planet. So what did Monsanto do to the seas? [unintelligible] They'll sue you because you owe them because they own that GMO gene. So now the salmon is all contaminated with it. But the FDA and the government didn't get their license until two years ago to set their fish free. But they had been doing it for so long. They were going to get in heavy trouble because now they're showing up in a laboratory test. So six years ago it came to the point every time I ate salmon, within three bites I was vomiting. So I don't eat salmon anymore. If I were to eat it, I would eat it with a ton of cheese. To absorb the poisons that are made from the GMO enzyme activity. And the toxins that form from the GMO activity.

Q: You have a license now to let it out? You have a license now to mix it in and release it to the ocean?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Ok, you had a question?

Q: In the morning, did you have milk?

A: No, the milk will take the poisons and you'll digest some of them. Ok, so you're going to lose your minerals. You need that cheese to absorb the poison.

Q: So, it's not so much... you said cheese isn't a food. So, in the morning...

A: It's going to absorb the poison. You don't want it as a food. You want it to absorb the poison 10 minutes before you eat.

Q: Your midnight meal.

A: Yes.

Q: I was saying, did you have milk, did you want a meal there?

A: Have half a cup of milk if you want.

Q: All right, but then early the first thing in the morning, have your cheese.

A: Have your cheese, yes.

Q: The mid... the... the... the... you know, at 4 a.m. or 4 a.m., 3 a.m., however it is, milk is fine.

A: [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, usually in the middle of the night, so just eat a chunk of cheese and eat the... you know, drink the milk, or eat right on top of it. Because you don't want to stay awake too long.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah. You still have a little cube of cheese in the middle of the night when you eat it. Okay.

Q: Do you hurt your teeth? Do you hurt your teeth eating in the middle of the night?

A: Because?

Q: Because you're not cleaning your teeth afterwards.

[laughter]

A: [unintelligible]

Q: What's in the milkshake?

A: It's in the recipe book. You know, it's milk, cream, egg, and honey.

Q: Oh.

A: Pretty simple.

Q: You said something about pig fat, or fat.

A: Yeah.

Q: Can you elaborate on that? Like, is it raw? Is it rendered?

A: No, you never render it. It's always raw.

Q: It's always raw.

A: Yeah.

Q: So it's not, is it, rendering means it's clear?

A: Rendering means you, yeah, you cook it and melt it down.

Q: Yeah.

A: To get it even.

Q: Yeah. I like that. But raw pig fat is really good for you?

A: Yeah. I just, the fat, you know, it's like the bacon. You know, a slice of bacon is that outer edge with that thick fat, two frames of fat. Usually in the feral pigs, that first layer of fat is very, very hard, so you have to chew it a while to get the fat out of it. And then the next layer is very soft in the back. But I usually get, you know, chunks of that and just eat it like that. I'll eat the, you know, it's like eating bacon. And it's easier to eat it if it's sliced thinly as bacon, of course, I like wrestling with my meat sometimes. It's not...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's too much honey with your, if you've got an inflammation right there, it abscesses, you know, it's a tomato mixture and that's suggested in we want to live, and if you're going to have your cheese and honey together, you mash the cheese with honey. The honey doesn't get that area. It's the honey that will open it up. It's enzyme active. And you chew it on the other side of your mouth.

Q: I'm sorry.

A: Chew it on the other side of your mouth. Yes.

Q: How much sun exposure?

A: Whenever you like, as much as you like. Vitamin D, you can't get too much out. I mean, you can't get too much of a synthetic vitamin D. And guess what vitamin, supplemental vitamin D is?

Q: What?

A: They take hydrogenated oils, vegetable or not. That means they turn it into a fat, a plastic fat. Plastic oil, not even a fat. A plastic oil. And then they expose it to radioactive material. Well, the sun's radiation hits the fat on the skin and turns it into vitamin D. So you must be able to take oil, plastic oil, subject it to radiation to be vitamin D. It doesn't look anything like it, but that's what they sell as vitamin D. 

Q: Standard process?

A: Pardon?

Q: Standard process does that?

A: Standard process, no. [unintelligible] different way, but it's still highly contaminated. The only way you can get concentrated vitamin D is by eating butter and getting in the sun. A lot of butter and getting in the sun. If you want a supplemental, you have to get cod liver oil. And cod liver oil has to stink and look cloudy and all of that. The only one that makes that is green pastures. And you have to get the non-flavored. And it's nasty, not any capsule, because a capsule is what? It's cooked [unintelligible] and, you know, waste. It's garbage. It's cooked and highly processed and sterilized and melted with kerosene or gasoline. So you get the non-capsule stuff in the bottle, that blue bottle, and non-flavored, and you drink it. And you got a little, you know, eye dropper in there. And you just, you know, take it out like that. But the stuff is nasty, it'll burn your throat. But it's still where you can get a concentrate of vitamin D if you can't get it out in the sun. Because if you're too far North, you don't get it. 

Q: You can't get a whole lot of stuff in the winter.

A: Well, in the winter you can, but in the summer it's like... How do the people in Finland and Switzerland grow things in only three months? Because they have 20 hours of sunlight, 24 hours of sunlight. And it's the sunlight, it's not the cold that determines vegetation's speed of growth. So, you don't have any sunlight, I mean, it's sunny. There in June, in the end of June, there's not one minute of darkness.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That is the one. No matter where you are, if you get sun exposure, that, excuse me, the fat, the proper fats on the skin, it's going to absorb that sun radiation, and it's going to transform into vitamin D. Doesn't matter.

Q: On high meat, in the instructions, you're supposed to open it every day.

A: Not every day. If it's outside the refrigerator, you're doing it out of normal room temperatures.

Q: Well, if you have it in the back of the refrigerator and you forget it for a week before, between opening it and stuff, I mean...

A: Yeah, it's going to be moved very slowly. I mean, it sounds a little [unintelligible], but it's fine. It does break down bacteria, so you're not getting the proper thing. Unless you've just been poisoned. That's a good one.

Q: What about the vitamin K?

Q: We're going to talk about it. It's important.

A: Vitamin K and vitamin U is in cabbage juice. Very concentrated. That's why, when that woman was bleeding, vitamin K and you U helped her blood clot. Vitamin K and vitamin U. So you don't bleed. Now, about three weeks ago, I was on my farm. A sinkhole. And I fell over onto the barbed wire. The barbed wire is about this long. And it ripped my ear from here all the way out. Do you see any scar? 

Q: No.

Q: No.

A: That's three weeks ago. Three weeks ago. It sealed over. I didn't bleed for one second. And my whole ear was torn all the way through. [unintelligible] But it would have been a big catch. So, yeah, I did have a little bit of a scab right here. It's a tiny little scab there. That's just three weeks ago. And I ripped the entire ear open.

Q: So you are actually...

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Yes, I know.

A: But I mean, it doesn't look like I'm awkward or stupid. I'm just... I didn't ask those people to walk out in front of me. It's just accidents look for me to happen.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, the cabbage juice has to be had alone. But it's in place of another vegetable juice. If you have a cabbage juice, that is the only juice you have unless there's a little beet with it. Only. And then you have the other juices other times. All you need is... Let's say if you're a heavy bleeder. Like I had a woman who was bleeding 22 days a month. I put her on a cup of cabbage juice every 2 to 3 days. And within her first period, I got her down from 23 days down to 17. With the first one. The next one was down to 12. The next one was down to 7 days. So we'll see what the next month looks like.

Q: I'd like to see more variety. I mean, I think that we're doing the juice recipes the same. And combined with the question of if we want to grow more of our own food. Let's say I have a garden in the backyard. I can't grow celery anyway. I mean, it's too difficult. [unintelligible] And also, maybe I could grow things and feed the rabbits. What happens if we have a lot of rabbits to eat, is that?

A: That's right. Yeah, you're feeding the rabbits. Rabbits are all raw food. If you're feeding alfalfa pellets, they're not good. You have to heat and cook those. You use a binder to make them into a pellet. But if you're feeding your rabbits carrots and greens, those are going to be healthy rabbits.

Q: And can we grow things that you can put in a juice? Things like, the recipe that we have, maybe I could grow cucumbers for part of the year and cilantro, but...

A: You need to go buy it. I'm telling you, those are the best. That's the best juice mixture. Everything else doesn't work as well. The celery is high in sodium. It helps get rid of salt out of the body. [unintelligible], because almost everything has salt in it. You know, that you buy in the markets and you get at a stand. So, only fresh foods don't have salt in them.

Q: What about fruits and chard?

A: Like I say, you can have anything you want as long as it's a strong, vegetable, no more than 5% of the juice. And everything should be relatively mild. Carrots, celery, cucumbers. And when you get into the heavier stuff, 10% of your juice, it's really strong like bok choy or chard, then you need to keep that to 5% of the juice.

Q: [unintelligible]?

A: You're going to have vomiting, you're going to have more diarrhea, you're going to have more detoxification symptoms. You're going to like your meat less, you're going to eat less meat, and you're not going to get well fast. You're going to alkalinize the system. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You've got chemtrails. She wants to know if she wants to exercise more. She likes to run, walk, whatever it is, outside. And you've got these chemtrails that the Navy is dropping on us, and it's full of barium, aluminum, all these toxic substances. If I were going to exercise and go outside when those are in the sky, I'd wear an Israeli gas mask with canisters. I'm serious. And you've got three layers of canisters in there. You've got a HEPA filter, you've got a charcoal, and then you've got, I forgot what the other one is, you've got three layers of filter to go to that. And I'd change those canisters every two weeks, because they would get full. I carry one in the back of my car. If there's a spill or some kind of contamination while I'm driving, I want protection. I'm not going to suffer for two or five years because of some spill on the freeway, and it contaminates me for five years. I have protection. So every time I go over a border with it, like Canada or Mexico, they see that in my trunk, and they pull me over. So you've got to have a gas mask in there, because you're a terrorist. They sometimes rip a panel off my doors, and they've gone through my whole car, taking me sometimes two hours to get to customs. But I'm going to sacrifice that two hours, because if a spill happens and I'm damaged for five years, I'm damaged for five years. It's not worth me taking two hours to cross a border. I'll take the two hours.

Q: Speaking of customs, I've been traveling a lot recently, and I've gotten food confiscated both at customs when coming to Canada or the U.S., and also when you first go into the airport, you know, the TSA screening checkpoints. So is there any way to get an exemption from getting food confiscated or X-rayed?

A: Okay. I have a letter that I write to my patients. I have an MD that writes it for me. So when I boarded the plane, I had three quarts of milk, a whole jar of raw meat and my butter. When I go to Asia, I'll take 20 pounds of butter with me, and I hand carry it, and they don't X-ray it because I have this letter. They can refuse and say, listen, we're not going to let you on unless you X-ray it. But that carry-on X-ray is a very mild X-ray. It's not going to bother your food, most of you, if it passes you one time. I don't, it makes me ill because of all the radiation therapy I had. So I will spend an hour, hour and a half, going up the chain. Your supervisor, let me speak to your supervisor, they're calling supervisor at home, they're calling Washington, D.C., I've gone through that sometimes, to get my food through without X-raying it, even if it's in the mild scanner. But I have a letter that I write to my patients. I charge $100 to do it because I have to look at your irises. I have to determine what is true, so in that letter, so I can tell them that you have to eat every hour. You need these foods, you can't get them. Your airlines don't, your restaurants don't supply them. So you need your food with you. And, you know, my doctor said that I was diagnosed with diabetes when I was 22, and I had bone cancer. I was diagnosed with bone cancer. It doesn't say I have bone cancer, it says I was diagnosed with bone cancer. And that's a long time ago. But that's in the letter, so they look at that. They clear me 99% of the time. Holland, they do not let me on a plane. I've been to Holland twice. Amsterdam, they will not let me on a plane with raw milk. They make me drink it before I get on. They'll let me have meat and butter and everything else, but they will not let me on that plane with milk. That's the only place.

Q: It's too bad for you. It's bad for you.

A: No, they think you have some kind of liquid that could be bomb-containing. So I drink it in front of them and I say it's OK. But that's the rule. They have no smarts in Amsterdam at TSA, at the airport. It's a brilliant country, but they seem to be brain-dead at the airport. So, anyway, I get on almost every time. Yes?

Q: The concept of having intrinsic factor and not able to absorb vitamin B12, you know, they put me on B12 injections and  put aluminum on it and they said, oh, it's for preservatives and I quit taking those. Now they say, well, take two sublinguals, you know, for your tongue twice a day.

A: Let me tell you, I don't know how many times I have to say it. All those B vitamins are just like I said those were. They're either chemical or they're treated with gasoline or kerosene. There's no natural vitamin B12. It's all a chemical, you know, and pharmaceuticals used to be [unintelligible]. Oh yeah, now they're selling them, and they're keeping checking them, they wanted to corner the market. Now they have. There are a few companies like Standard Process, which will, you know, make their own. But still, those people don't even know how their food's made. In the lab, the lab that they use it all, it isn't their own lab. But their chemists know they have to use kerosene or gasoline. Five years ago, I said this in a workshop in Chicago. On a Monday, I got a call, a message from the law firm, Standard Process, telling me to call them back. So I got home from Chicago on, like, a Thursday morning. I called them and said, What's up? And they said, Well, we have two senior salespeople from Standard Process that you're working [unintelligible] Chicago. And you said that our Standard Process, when they asked, used kerosene. And we want you to retract that. We want you to take out a full-page ad in the front section of the New York paper, the LA, Chicago, and Houston, and San Francisco. Five papers. $500,000 a page ad like that. So, I said, and you want me to do this because? And they said, well, you talked about, we used kerosene to dissolve our [unintelligible] to extract the nutrients we want out of them, isolated and separated. I said, that's correct. And they said, well, that's not right. And I said, have you been to your laboratory? No. Well, I suggest you go to your laboratory. If you find that you use a different way, some new special thing that nobody knows about but standard process, give me a letter. Give me a breakdown of what it is. I'll sign a nondisclosure agreement, just so I know. And then I'll bottle the 500,000 and I'll put your ads in. And I never got a call back. And you know what that means.

Q: And they're supposed to be good, right?

A: Yes. They thought it was until they learned there was kerosene. There's no other way to do it. Any other way if you use, let's say, apple cider vinegar or use lemon. There's a breakdown. There's a fermentation. There's a bacterial process that takes a long time. They want to do it in three days. If they do the fermentation process, let's say it takes 10 to 30 days. They're going to charge you $1,000 a pill. You can do it for spitefully expensive. It's just like the carbonated oil. That shit's expensive and it's nasty tasting. Nobody wants to eat it that way, but they do if they want the supplement.

Q: Do you believe in the clinical diagnosis?

A: I don't believe in any clinical diagnosis. They're all pointed to get you to take some kind of substance.

Q: Isn't there a mutual problem with people?

A: If they're vegetarian, absolutely.

Q: So if I started eating animal products...

A: Raw?

Q: No, raw.

A: I've been had long term vegetarians who were vegetarian for 36 years.

Q: I've been doing raw eggs for a long time.

A: B12 is good B12 in eggs, but they better not be from soy.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It doesn't matter. 90% of the feed that's given to chickens is from soy. And they say it's organic. Sure, you can raise organic soybeans. But when you dissolve them with kerosene or gasoline and feed it to a chicken, because you can't feed a raw soybean in any form to any fowl, any bird. It will kill them. Just like a human. You eat raw soy, it will kill you. So it has to be treated with solvents to neutralize all those enzymes. The cows can eat soy. Meat won't taste so good. But cows and sheep and goats, all those can eat soybeans, raw soybeans, without a problem. They've got the enzymes to do it. But if we do, and birds do, serious death. You know how serious death can be? Death can be serious. Gravely serious.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Eggs excellent. Meat excellent. They have to be pastured and not fed any soy.

Q: It has to be.

A: And no soy.

Q: And I don't know about no soy.

A: You have to call the company and ask. I have many of my Amish farmers, any of my sources. They're feeding their chickens... Look what chickens are. Chickens are vultures. They eat rotten, decaying tissue. They eat dead animals. That's normally what a chicken eats. When they feed them grains, that's not a chicken's diet. That's why they start losing their feathers. They start having a pecking order. And they peck each other, and they bleed, and they'll eat another chicken. Every month, a herd of chickens, or what they call a flock of chickens, will eat another chicken or two, every month, just to get the protein so that they can survive. I've had my farmers give their chickens rotten meat scraps, fresh and rotten meat scraps. Take bones and crush them and leave them. Those chickens, when I go visit the farms, always unexpected, those chickens will come up and rub up against you like a cat. And they have no pecking order. And they do not peck each other. They do not bite. These chickens are fat and happy. And they love maggots. So, you know, I have my farmers put, you know, cuts out and everything that they don't sell on pallets. And all these flies will lay their maggots, and as the maggots grow, the chickens will go around eating all the maggots. They get everything they need. They're so happy.

Q: So, in St. Louis, because I know in Pennsylvania, they have the [unintelligiblé] Farm. Any farm, you know, that has chickens that you talked about near St. Louis?

Q: Well, the eggs we get are like that.

Q: I'm talking about chicken.

Q: Oh, chicken. Oh, yeah, that's a tough one. I get it from Amos.

Q: You're talking about ground meat.

A: I grind it myself.

Q: They grind it, too.

A: I usually grind it myself. I like it ground, fresher for me. What time is it?

Q: Nine.

A: [unintelligible] stay two hours later.

Q: I'm going to get trouble at home. Thank you so much.

A: Okay, we're going to have to end it. One more.

Q: Just a question about tonsil stones. These yellowish, whitish things which can build up in the back of the tonsils. Have you done any kind of analysis or studies on them? 

A: Usually that's anesthetic and dental.

Q: And if you get them, is it a good idea to take them out?

A: They will fall out if you're eating vinegar and pineapple. They will drop off eventually.

Q: But you can sometimes swallow them if they fall out. But that's bad, right?

A: Your body can decide what to digest and how to digest it. If you're on this diet, I've seen the body pass really nasty shit out to feces without digesting it. You know, your body has a choice when it's smart. And it gets smart when you give it good food. Just like you give a child a lot of sugar, even fruit, and that child's screaming at it, erratic, you can't control the behavior, that's an organism out of control because you fed them improperly. That's not a smart child. If you're feeding that child right now, giving them sugar and a lot of fruit, the child's not going to be erratic and crazy.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, if you're spitting out gray, if that's what you're coughing up, spit it out. It's highly contaminated with metals. If it's yellow, it may be some penicillin or mainly bacteria. If you have a bacteria detoxification of a cold, mainly it will be yellow. When you're having a viral detoxification, it will usually be clear or gray with metals in it. Either of that I always spit. Those two I always spit out. If it's green, that means you're using a fungus to detoxify. So, the one I absolutely always, when I'm spitting out clear or gray, I don't swallow it. If it's bacterial, if I'm somewhere where I can expectorate it, I expectorate.

Q: What if it's pure white?

A: White, I'll spit it out. White, clear, or gray. If it's black, I don't, yeah, I know that's not good for you.

Q: I spit it all out.

A: I do mouth pulling after that. I put cheese in my mouth, chew it up, 20 minutes and I spit it out. That pulls. A lot of people do oil pulling. They take like a tablespoon of olive oil or some kind of coconut oil and they'll do some around their mouth for 20 minutes, 10 to 20 minutes. And that does extract a lot of toxins out of the gum because the brain dumps most of its toxins out the salivary glands, the gums and the tongue. That's why we have dental decay. It's not from bacteria. The bacteria goes in at the metal and [unintelligible]. The rate of dental caries that ensued after vaccines has been tremendous. 

Q: I read that in the morning your mouth has a lot of toxins in it.

A: [unintelligible] So you can rinse it out, oil pull, pull it out of the gums. That's a [unintelligible]. Oil pull. I like to cheese pull.

Q: But oil pulling is okay.

A: Pardon?

Q: Oil pulling is okay.

A: It won't be as efficient as cheese pulling. I found that cheese pulling is twice as good as oil pulling. Cheese pulling is good. Cheese is a lot cheaper than oil.

Q: Just a cube like usual and just chew it up and leave it in your mouth.

A: Just keep going, swishing it around.

Q: You said 20 minutes you're supposed to do it, right?

A: I do it about 20 minutes. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

[audio cut]

A: Left ovary is in good shape. Left adrenal gland is in good shape. Left side of the pancreas. Quite a bit of scar tissue there. Let your hand go limp. Good. Good. Left side of the pancreas is about 47% alive. That's pretty good. We only need 10% on this side. Left thyroid, good. Parathyroid, good. Tonsil area, very, very poor. You have a ton of metals. Now, this is what's inside the cells. The eyes show what's outside the cells. And [unintelligible] and everything. You have a cell that's gray, as you have all over. It's just a lot of metals, especially tin, inside the cells. So you have a lot of contamination inside the cells. So you need the weight that you have, and that's good for you. It's protecting you. I wouldn't lose any more. Did your mother take an anti-nausea medication? [unintelligible]

Q: I have no idea. She took [unintelligible].

A: Almost the same thing. So that's still in your system. It's formed some of your genes. And eating, let's say, out of half of the meat meals that you eat, have one tablespoon of coconut cream with one of the meat meals once a day. Oh, no, with the butter, too, with one tablespoon of coconut cream. And that will help change the mutated genes. So much of that. You need blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries, any of the dark berries. I'm going to suggest for your fruit meals, four of them weekly. About a third of a cup of pineapple and a third of a cup of any dark berry you like. And then about two and a half tablespoons of coconut cream, one and a half to two tablespoons of dairy cream, a tablespoon of lime juice, half a teaspoon of lemon juice. And if you're not eating this fourth one, just about a quarter of a teaspoon of vinegar. You can mix all the fluids together and have the berries whole and dice the pineapple, or you can blend it all together. So blend it all together, take time to chew it, eat it slowly. Meat-wise, have whatever meat you want, you've got signs of anemia. So, red meat, white meat, it doesn't matter. A lot of lymphatic congestion everywhere, inside the cells. So, that doesn't mean you have it outside the cells, but definitely inside the cells. The cells' lymphatic system is jammed. That's a little harder because you have to get the blood hotter to clean that. So, it's like you need about 106, 107, 107 degrees. 106 to 107 degrees Fahrenheit. The water should be 105. So, when you do hot baths like that, you can take a bowl of cold water, lots of ice cubes floating in it, wash rag in there. Don't wring it out much. Put it on top of your head and let that cold water drip down your face. Take your fist, open fist, and dip it in the bowl up to the top of your wrist here. And that will chill your brain from the bone all the way because mostly bones here. And the brain is the object in the body that does not like to be hot. So, that chills the brain, the cold rag up here and here. Usually you can stay in another 10 or 15 minutes without having to do that. And then you do it again to stay in as long as you can. Vegetable juice I'm going to recommend... About 25% celery, 25% carrot, 30% cucumber puree, 10% cilantro. In about 6 months, no, make it 9 months after you're on the diet, on predominantly doing the diet. Then move it up to 15%, cilantro 15% of the juice. And then 5% zucchini, but when you're adding 10% cilantro, you'll have 10% zucchini. Peel the zucchini. Peel the cucumber. The cucumber will always be pure. You have pretty good fat all over your system. You do have some smoke tars in your lungs. You smoke?

Q: Marijuana.

A: Well, when you smoke marijuana, you get 16 to 20 times more tars. So it's one joint's worth of those pack of cigarettes. So you've got some of that built up. It looks dark, so I thought it was maybe your father who smoked cigars and pipes. But marijuana's dark.

Q: I used to be a big pothead.

A: Pardon?

Q: I said I used to be a big pothead.

A: Yeah, I can see it.

[laughter]

Q: That's a good [unintelligible].

A: I used to be a big donut, and [unintelligible]. That's worse than being a pothead. Really debilitated on the left side here. Put a hot water bottle under the left arm pit. Get that stronger. Lung everywhere around here. I don't usually talk about what people should do, but you've got a lot of movement... Body likes movement. Dance, any kind of expressive, even creative body movement. I don't care if you're a massage therapist or a dance instructor. 

Q: I'm a massage therapist.

A: There you go. You should be doing something like that. You're doing it. That's good. You've got a lot of bile in that left kidney. A lot of metals in your adrenal gland. A lot of metals in your adrenal gland on the right side and a lot of bile on the left. And that can cause ups and lows, downs, up periods and low periods of [unintelligible] formation. So sometimes you can be very up and sometimes you can be very down. This one, I wouldn't follow it too much if you don't want the metals to move too fast. This one, I shouldn't have the bile, but hot water bottles at the left adrenal gland and left kidney. On the metal side over here.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They're not going to do a lot. They'll help the skin, that's good for the skin and maybe the connective tissue, but it's not good for healing. You need a whole area to heat up or heat down, heat around, heat about. I would eat more red meat than anything else, just in terms of red blood cells.

Q: I hardly eat any [unintelligible].

A: I'd say, you know, I'd say 6 times out of 10. Let's say you have 14 meat meals a week or you're having 2 meat meals a day. And when I talk about the meals, you know, the eating, the schedule, I didn't talk about quantities, but someone your size, a cup of meat, you know, 8 ounces, 7 ounces by volume of meat should be fine. I'd say somebody like him, a cup and a quarter is [unintelligible], or even more. If he wants to be a bodybuilder, you've got to eat a lot more. A lot of metal, a lot of tin. You need that cilantro. [unintelligible] the most dark berries. Okay? You're welcome.

[audio cut]

A: Let your hands go to limp. Okay, the left testis is probably 50% scarred. It's got a lot of scar tissue there. The adrenal gland is about 15% scarred, but good. The left side of the pancreas is probably 70% scarred. That means 30% alive, that's good. The left thyroid is very good. The parathyroid is very good. The tonsil area is very poor. Very poor circulation in your stomach and intestines. You're going to have cancer of the stomach and small intestines. Okay, relax. The right testis is a little bit better. More scar tissue, a little protein deficient, but it's okay. The right adrenal gland is very good. Relax. The right side of the pancreas, a lot of scar tissue here. Probably 80% or more, so that's less pancreas alive there. The right thyroid is excellent. Parathyroid, poor. Tonsil area, very poor. Very poor lymphatic circulation in the brain all the way down to the stomach and intestines all the way down to the chest. So, you are blocked from head to toe. Your cells, right, your entire lymphatic system is blocked. On the right side, on the left side, mainly [unintelligible] on the long upper back. A lot of metals in the cells in the brain, but an average amount, not excessive. Especially on the left side, less on the right side. You have more fat over here. A lot more fat in the brain. That's a good fat [unintelligible]. On that side, this is not a good fat [unintelligible]. So, the left side of your brain, not enough fat in your idea over here. So, this left side of your brain, right side of your brain is much better than that. Red blood cells are okay, white blood cells are better. So, you need more red meat for a while. A lot of bile around the crotch area and legs. It has a tendency to cause irritability and anxiety. It can cause nervous legs at times, nervous knees. More nervous feet. Something in your esophagus, from here to here. A lot of metal or something else. It's on the left side. The right side [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] You haven't been cleaning it. [unintelligible] cleaning it, you've got heartburn and some tightness in here.

Q: Well, sometimes I would get tightness. I feel like it was a muscle tightness.

A: It's the toxins in here causing the cramp, the tightness. It usually follows the heartburn unless you have no cells around there. 

Q: I never had heartburn.

A: You might just have a lot of dead cells. Putting a hot water bottle there is good. [unintelligible], the heartburn and the anxiety from that tightness that you get. So, do put the hot water bottle on there, but don't put it on for more than two hours. Okay? Because you want to bring the cells back, the nerve cells back to life and [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] That's going to cause some tightness in the back, because this is rigid, and it's up around here. Fruit-wise, I'm going to suggest, you need lots of pineapple. What I suggest to you is get mature coconuts, and not only get the coconut cream from them, but I'd like you to take the hard coconut meat, grate it, and blend it with the coconut water. And that's what I'd like you to have, about two cups a day of that milk from that. And even if it doesn't blend all the way, you've got little tiny chunks in there, chew it. So I'm going to recommend two cups of that a day, and have about maybe a quart and a half of milk. I'd like you to have about 30% carrot, 25% celery, 25% cucumber puree, 10% zucchini, 5% zucchini juice, 5% puree like you do the cucumber, and then 10% cilantro or parsley. One time you can use parsley, one time you can use cilantro. And I'd like you to always have an egg, have about 16 ounces of juice once a day. I'd like you to have two eggs in it, and two tablespoons of cream. Take a good 30 minutes to drink it. And you can have that juice whenever you want, just as long as it's not more than, less than an hour before a meat meal the other two hours after a meat meal. Otherwise you can choose whenever you want.

Q: One thing is, I think, I might say every other week, maybe once every other week, I will feel like I get cramps in my shins, like when I'm sleeping, or about to, or something like that. I can feel it in one set, so I have to, like, take my feet off underneath the cover so there's no pressure, no torsion on my feet or my ankles. [unintelligible] taking something for that, I can't remember what it was, it was an over-the-counter, little pills.

A: Yes. The what? The little bit of pineapple, it'll remove that and whey.

Q: Okay.

A: And put, you know, hot water bottles under your feet to make sure that it's moving properly. But, down here around the feet you've got a lot of the lymphatic digestion, so you're not going to get poisons out of your feet and stuff. So if you can put a hot water bottle down there between them, wrapping a towel around that and forcing your feet to perspire, it's going to help you a lot. Coconuts, two cups of coconuts, maybe a cup of whey, and your sport formula will help you do most of that.

Q: Okay.

A: [unintelligible] a lot of sugar and coffee, [unintelligible] lactic acid in your feet.

Q: I don't do much.

A: So for your fruit meal, a coconut doesn't count as a fruit meal. It's a fruit. It's going to be the milk for you. Have a half a cup of pineapple five days a week, with a third of a cup, no, make it a quarter of a cup, of dark berries and a quarter cup of light berries. Light berries are raspberries and strawberries. Even cherries. Also dark berries and blueberries, blackberries. Have three tablespoons of coconut cream with that, and one and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. One and a half tablespoons of lime juice, one teaspoon of lemon juice. And if you don't have a sport formula that day, you can have a whole half a tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar in with that fruit. Blend it all together or mix the fluid together and have diced pineapple with your berries. Blending it together will work more efficiently more often. So do that four days a week. You have a lot of industrial solvents on your chest area here, on there and here. So I'd like you to have three ounces of lime juice, one and a half tablespoons of lemon juice, a kiwi, a small to medium kiwi, and four tablespoons of coconut cream, two tablespoons of dairy cream. Blend that together and have that two days a week. One day a week I'd like you to have a custard. The custard's just papaya, butter, honey, and egg. And both books, custard recipe's in both books. We want to live, that's under recipes. And the recipe book is under custard. Okay? You're welcome.

[audio cut]

A: Relax your hands. Okay. You're going to have a lot of fat [unintelligible]. [unintelligible]. You drink way too much water and it's very impactful. So all that weight on you, all that girth on you, it's not fat, it's water. Not good. You're starting to dissolve the body with all that water. How much water do you drink a day?

Q: Not much.

A: Really? You're just holding on to it. You need a hot bath. You need a hot tub. Do you have a hot tub? Are you using it?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: So you're going to have to fix it. Yep.

Q: Okay.

A: You're going to need at least one sport formula a day instead of drinking milk. [unintelligible] milk kefir. That's fine. [unintelligible] Your mucous is low. Your fat level is low. Yep, you got it. Okay. Your left ovary is about 50% there. The left adrenal gland is pretty good. A little weak, though. The left side of the pancreas is about 72% scar tissue. But you have 28% alive. That's fine. Left thyroid is pretty weak. Parathyroid is okay. Tonsil area is poor to fair. Relax. The right... The right set ovary is barely there. The right adrenal gland is okay, but weak. The right side of the pancreas, a lot of scar tissue here. Probably only about 10% active and alive. But still you have enough over here. Only need 10% of the pancreas to operate on this guy, because he's still in carbohydrate. The right thyroid is fair. Parathyroid is okay. Tonsil area is very poor. A lot of metals in your brain all throughout the cells, all over the body. Lots of tin. Lots of aluminum, especially in the left ear. The left side of the brain, lots of aluminum. And tin. The left side of the body and all those cells are much more contaminated with this metal than the right side. The right side is much more fat-supported. The left side, very little fat in your tissues anywhere. Except along your spinal cord, that's in your back. That's pretty good. OK around the adrenal. But everywhere else, very dry. Very non-lubricated. Over on both sides of your intestines, small intestines, [unintelligible] is good. [unintelligible]. Hard enough you won't be able to absorb any of the foods that you can have. So, lack of fat. Pardon? Lack of fat, yeah.

Q: Is there something wrong with that?

A: Could be. You just, you know, you have all this fluid storage in your system. See, this should be half of that. That's all the waste product underneath your skin ready to be perspired out. You have all that plastic oil in here blocking it. Plastic oil. You need to get into a hot bath and melt it out to start pumping that. [unintelligible]. And it's not going to protect you.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, that's good. But there's very little fat in your body right now. [unintelligible] You need to perspire in that bath to get it moving.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Your body is in the plastic oil that's in your skin, holding on to fluids, trying to dissolve it and melt it. You don't need as much fluid when you get into hot water for a long time. You don't have to hold on to as much fluid to dilute it. Because right now, your body's trying to dissolve it. You don't need to dissolve it. You need to heat it. Melt it out of the system fast. You try to dissolve that and then there's chemicals, more chemicals, swell more. You could end up with lupus or MS. That's not good.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Put a hot water bottle in that [unintelligible]. Wrap a towel around it. You put a hot water bottle in that area. [unintelligible] That pain that's localized in a particular area. You apply a hot water bottle to that area. Okay. Dietarily, you can eat any meat you want. But later on after about 4 or 5 years on the diet, less red meat. Or maybe just half red meat. And more white meat. Now white meat, I don't mean like ostrich. I consider that white meat and it is as dark as liver. So any fowl, any seafood, any fish. That's all white meat. Rabbits, white meat. Red meat is [unintelligible]. But you need some red meat. Four years on the diet [unintelligible]. There's indications that it should happen. And you probably eat with it so you don't over-acidify. Which is the reason you don't like red meat. It causes over-acidity. Eat some cheese with it. Eat an egg with it. It might bring it down to make it less acidic. So you start with the cheese before you eat the red meat. Yes, grated cheese in the meat might reduce it. The butter will bring the acidity up. So you might eat, with your red meat, sour cream instead of so much butter. And save the butter for your chicken or your fish. Enzymatically for a juice, I would say 40% carrot. 40% cucumber puree. 10% cilantro and 10% parsley. So, not much salt for you, not much sodium in the celery. Because you might have a bad reaction with all the sodium that is in your body. So if you have that much water [unintelligible], I don't want to start causing huge rashes and sores on your skin.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible] Because all you see is getting ready to go to a heavy rash, like an impetigo like that woman had, that you could have all over your body.

Q: [unintelligible] 

A: [unintelligible] Okay, meat-wise, what's your age?

Q: 36.

Q: Yeah, 59. 

A: 59, okay. I'm going to suggest about six and a half ounces by volume. So it's ounce and a half over a half a cup, twice the weight of meat. Whatever meats, it's any kind of fresh meat, whatever you need. But always have your butter with it, if it's not red meat. If you have red meat, sour cream or egg, [unintelligible]. That's it. I'd like you to have at least a quart of milkshake daily. You need that mucus to protect things.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, absolutely. The fruit meals, make it three a week of custard. And I would like you to take a little bit of fresh ginger. Grate just just a tiny bit. [unintelligible] Don't make it hot because you have a real thin mucus. It's supposed to protect your intestines. I need these intestines protected. They're about to eat each other and end up with Crohn's disease. It's bad for you. So it's probably affecting your foot. It'll cause joint problems. So just enough to taste the ginger. [unintelligible] So three days a week, the custard with a little bit of grated ginger. Definitely want to [unintelligible]. Use a little bit of tomato. I want that to get the sodium out of your body. Better way to remove that sodium for you. And I would like you to have a full two tablespoons daily. [unintelligible] We got the eggs, you know. Some people like, you know, I said two to three. One to two eggs is fine. Some people can have more eggs. And I suggest you have three eggs in your sport formula. Only one tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar [unintelligible]. So, back to the fruit. I want you to have about a third of a cup of dark berries and a third of a cup of light berries. With two tablespoons of coconut cream and one and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. A tablespoon of lime juice. Half a teaspoon of lemon juice. One egg. And I want you to [unintelligible]. So, take that three days a week. Custard three days a week. And one day, the natural solvent remover, which would be two ounces of lime juice, one tablespoon of lemon juice. For you instead of having a kiwi, I want you to have a semi-ripe third of a mango. Half a teaspoon of vinegar, raw apple cider vinegar. And one egg in that mixture. Take your time sipping. Because if you drink that fast, it's not only going to dump a lot of water to the kidney, it's going to irritate the kidney. I [unintelligible]. At least a quarter of an milk a day. At least. Okay? You're welcome. Hot tub is going to help you remove a lot of that water.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, usually what that is, is your brain is dumping out the tear ducts. Some of that gets into the flow of nutrients going into the eye. All that [unintelligible] splashes, because it's coming from the brain, where you're supposed to be transferring light. Flutters is when you're building up too much waste product. You know, dead brain cells are getting into the eye. The only way you can remove that quickly is with a hot water bottle in the eye that's causing the most problems. And you wanna do both sides in one night. One side one night, the other side the other night. One eye is giving you more reaction than another, you go two nights on one eye.

Q: I need a lot of hot water bottles.

A: I have seven. I have seven.

[laughter]

A: I used to have one here, one here, one here on each side of the head and neck.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible] When I stopped living in the bathtub, I used a mat. I put three layers of beach towels down. One time I didn't, but I molded [unintelligible]. Bed cost me $1,200 and I ruined it in 30 days with all the mold from my sweat. I molded the mattress and they couldn't kill it, they couldn't stop it. Steam it or anything, so I had to trash it and buy another. So, towels down to catch the perspiration.

Q: And then temperature for the hot tub, I used to set mine at 105. 

A: 105 should be just right.[unintelligible], in case you get heat prostration. Ok, let them go relaxed. The left testis is in very good shape. The left adrenal gland is in very good shape, but still some protein deficiency. The left side of the pancreas has a little scar. [unintelligible], so it's a lot of scar tissue. Probably only about 18% of that pancreas is alive. [unintelligible] You need a little fruit, carbohydrates. The left thyroid is excellent, parathyroid excellent, tonsil area very poor. Very poor lymphatic circulation, only the back and the left side. Mainly from the shoulder blade down to the waist. Very poor circulation into the small intestines. Some of your intestinal tract and stomach are getting hard. The left, I mean the right testis is in very good shape. The right adrenal gland is in very good shape. Right side of the pancreas is a little bit better. Probably about 30% alive. That's good. Right thyroid is excellent, parathyroid excellent, tonsil area pretty good. You have less contamination in your intestines than you do over here. It's pretty good. Back is pretty good. A lot of salt in your brain. A lot of metals in your brain, a lot of aluminum in your brain. On the left side of the chest also quite a bit. You've got enough fat there to handle that. Not quite enough fat in the brain. A lot of metal in your kidney and adrenal glands and testis. A lot of metal in this area. Kidneys are the most toxic part. Your left kidney is the most toxic part. Slightly going into the adrenal gland. Over here, this is even more toxic. Your right kidney. So, that right kidney is full of metals. So, you need to get hot tub that you let get full of algae. And drink some of that algae water. I don't care what it has in it. It's algae. If you have a sand filter on it, it's going to keep it clean. You have the algae to be able to grow. So, scrape some of the algae out of the hot tub. Pack it on that kidney, the right kidney. Pack it on the left too. And then wrap it. Put a wet damp cloth on it so it stays damp all night. And then wrap it around. If you don't want to get your bed wet, then put, you know, your cloth, wet cloth on top of that and plastic over that. Not to where the plastic touches your skin, but just covering the damp cloth and the algae. And then just pack that on there. Wrap a piece of bandage around the sleep with it. [unintelligible]. And the skin will start [unintelligible]. It's mainly your kidneys, especially your right. But they're both highly metallically contaminated.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, and also, not only heavy metals, you've got industrial solvents that are coming out through the skin and they're [unintelligible].  If you perspire, you're going to get rid of it. Are you eating enough butter? You need to eat probably five tablespoons of butter a day minimum. And you can put that in a lubrication form. Page 146 or 147 of the recipe book. That's where you have lemon, butter, honey, and egg together. Tastes like a lemon meringue cake. Do you like lemon meringue? Don't chug it though. I need you to break it up 
Break it into thirds or fourths. So you're eating an equal amount three to four times a day. Spread it out. And make a big batch of it. At least 8 ounces of it. Even 10 ounces of it. Because you're not a little guy. Meatwise, any you want. Mostly red. Red blood cells are pretty contaminated because of all the tin in your system. Destroying bacteria in the red blood cells. Fruitwise, I'd like you to have about 6 ounces by volume of dark berries. And 4 ounces by volume of pineapple. With 4 tablespoons of coconut cream. 2 and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. 2 tablespoons of lime juice. 2 teaspoons of lemon juice. And if you're not having sport formula that day, then a whole half a teaspoon of raw apple cider vinegar. Blend that together. So do that 5 days a week. 2 days a week do custard. And you can grate a little bit of ginger root into it if you like. I would like you to have 3 eggs. I'm going to give you your papaya, I mean your custard recipe. I would like you to have 3 eggs. About 3 quarters of a cup of papaya. 1 tablespoon, maybe 1 1⁄2 tablespoon of honey. I would like you to put 1 cube of cheese in that. You can add 2 cubes if you like. I think it will be a little bit better with 2 cubes. Or 1 if you want. And about 2 tablespoons of lemon juice. No, too much. You are going to have that with your lubrication formula. Just have your, like, 1⁄2 teaspoon of fresh ginger. 2 tablespoons of coconut cream. And 3 tablespoons of dairy cream. [unintelligible] So you do that 2 days a week. And I'd like you to have a full 1 cup of water a day. But no more than an ounce at a time. So it can be 2 hours an ounce of water. 2 quarts of milk. Or 1 quart of milkshake. 1 quart of milk in the store for you. If you do the hot baths you're going to need that much water.

Q: Alright, thank you.

A: You're welcome. Are you going to do it tomorrow or are you going to do it now?

Q: I'll do it now.
