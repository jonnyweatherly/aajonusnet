A: ...understanding of the proper diet. And you can come up with that conclusion yourself, but I'm going to give you the conclusion anyway. So we start off with digestion in the mouth. And the basic digestive activity in the mouth is chewing to break down the food into smaller molecules. Smaller particles to be digested into tiny molecules and to be digested by the intestines. Intestinal tract, the bacteria in the intestinal tract to be absorbed. So we chew and then our first digestive fluids enter the food from the salivary glands. And guess what? The major product is bacteria. We have more bacteria than dogs and cats. So don't bite anybody. We have the ptyalin enzyme in there, which only the horse has, and that digests carbohydrates. But it is only enough to digest about 5% of all the food consumption is carbohydrate. First clue, how much carbohydrate we should be eating. 5% of the diet, no more. Then the food goes down the throat, down the esophagus, and it hits its first station, the stomach. Now the stomach is the most resilient tissue in the world, besides bone. But the stomach forms hydrochloric acid, which dissolves bone. So the stomach is more resilient than bone. And as resilient as hair, because the hydrochloric acid doesn't break down hair. That's why you see in cats and dogs, hair balls comes out, won't digest hair. So the stomach lining is as resilient as hair. Creates hydrochloric acid that can dissolve bone, cartilage, and everything else, except for hair and itself. It has a mucous lining that protects itself from the inundation of too much gaseous activity and byproducts from the gases produced when the hydrochloric acid enters the food. Also, if you're detoxing from the stomach, dumping poisons from your blood or neurological fluids into your stomach, it doesn't penetrate the intestine, the stomach wall, and cause more damage. It will dump from the stomach lining into the stomach and not be able to move back. It's like a sphincter valve, the mucous lining. In there, there's mainly hydrochloric acid. 

There may be a little campylobacter and some other bacteria, but they don't thrive very well, except that that is entered in the salivary glands, survive the hydrochloric acid. So, there's not a lot of bacteria in the stomach comparatively to what's in the intestines. Now, in the stomach, the first compartment of the stomach, the first part compartment of the stomach is where the hydrochloric acid is secreted and dumped into the food. So, it makes the large chunks of like meat that you eat, will dissolve them into smaller particles so the bacteria can infiltrate and eat. In the second part, the lower part in the duodenum is where bile enters the stomach. Bile is created by the liver, held in the gallbladder, and dumped into the stomach to digest fat. The hydrochloric acid works on proteins and the bile works on fat. It takes those molecules of fat and breaks them down into smaller molecules so bacteria can feed on those, break those down. So then the food passes into the small intestines. We have around 60,000 groups, all involving only about three or four families of bacteria that feed on the food you eat. That is how we eat. 90% of digestion is bacterial. We have 150 bacterial genes to every one human gene. We are not even a half a percent human. We are bacteria. So the whole concept and the myth that bacteria is our enemy and creates disease is the myth of the pharmaceutical and medical department. And it is easily proven that it is wrong, false, and they get people to thrive on medications, not thrive, to subsist and get worse on medications rather than getting well. Again, they make money, you get sick, they're happy. So that bacteria, picture it this way. You've got these organisms that eat the food that you eat. Their fecal matter, their urine, their perspiration is your food. Sure shoots the hell out of the pharmaceuticals bacteria theory about washing your hands with poisonous chemicals after you've gone to the toilet and touched yourself.

How many animals do you go around licking each other's butts, their anuses, and getting it in there and cleaning it out? They want the bacteria. We feed them awfully. We feed them processed foods. They need bacteria so they're getting it where they can. They're licking themselves many times daily to get the bacteria that they lack because of the processed chemical damaged food. Think about that. Why aren't they dying? They're eating toxic E. coli, aren't they? Of course not. E. coli is not toxic. E. coli is a form of bacteria in the intestines that breaks down harder tissue. It's a good thing. And then, of course, your doctors who are more scientific, and there are more of them, and they can't keep the wool over everybody's eyes, so they come up with the E. coli 157H7. That's now the bad guy. When it was all E. coli before, and this 157H7 doesn't occur in nature. It's created in a laboratory and put in our environment and told that that is our problem. To keep the bacteria theory going, keep medicine, and keep you terrorized, and thinking that something, all these little microbes are eating up the body. They're making girly men out of everybody, right? The Schwarzenegger phrase. You can't have a more girly man than Schwarzenegger who's afraid of bacteria. Think about that. Think of all of the licking of anuses. You're sick. You have pus. Things are coming out of you. Your dog or cat will come over and lick you to clean it. They're putting their bacteria on it to help you and removing the toxic stuff that's coming out. And most of that fluid that's coming out, that white stuff, those are white blood cells. What's icky and bad about white blood cells? They're your protection. They eat dead tissue. In the blood, the only place where white blood cells are supposed to exist is in the blood. They eat the dead red blood cells.

So they don't accumulate in the blood. That is their job. They're phagocytes. Phago means to eat. They are eaters. They are like sharks of dead red blood cells. They eat the contamination and the waste, so the blood stays clean. So when you see pus, 95% to 98% of that is white blood cells, and the rest is contamination. It takes a lot of your body's resources to deal with a little industrial contamination, toxic substance. It could take 2,000 white blood cells to harness and control two, three molecules of mercury. That's a great resource for two or three molecules of mercury, which are infinitesimally smaller than one white blood cell. But the white blood cells only have to maybe one or two or three eat it if it's three of them, then all the others have to surround it because that white blood cell is going to start blowing up and disintegrating, and then they have to eat that to keep the contamination down. So the only way you can prevent disease and dastardly experiences is by removing yourself from industrial chemicals in the environment, in your food, and most importantly in your food because you're consuming them every day. So the intestines, now you'll still have about 10%. If you have the good environment, you'll have only 10% of the intestinal activity will be digestive juices that you have to form, and that's more hydrochloric acid and the conveyance of more bile from the gallbladder to the intestines to break down the fats. Hydrochloric acid breaks down the protein. The bacteria, remember, consumes it. Their waste is our food. And whether the bacteria are eating blueberries or milk, their waste is always the color of milk. So when that's absorbed into the intestines, it's called lacteal. The system that collects it is the lacteal system. It's a web network like, you know, a very complex, intricate spider web. And it connects to the intestines, and all that fluid, that milk fluid is absorbed. It's transferred, transported in the lacteal system to the lymphatic system.

The lymphatic system bacteria breaks it down further into a translucent substance, slightly milkish, translucent substance that feeds every cell in the body, except for the red and white blood cells. Every cell in the body. That's the way it's supposed to work. Then the food moves down into the bowel, and the same thing occurs. However, the bacteria in the colon are of different family and different nature than those in the small intestines. That's why they're separated. Now, the E. coli and other bacteria in the colon, they break down the food into the finite molecules that feed the brain and the nervous system. So if you have somebody in the family, a child or whatever, who doesn't have good mental function, is on a good diet, they do not have the bacteria in the colon. You may have to take some raw butter and raw cream and raw coconut cream and infuse that into their colon, so they'll get fresh, whole fats to be able to break down and feed and protect their brain and nervous systems. I help many people, many families with autistic children. Their children are no longer autistic, or those that have just, like, oh, you just got a note from a woman in England who had a severely autistic child, and she says, almost all of his autism in two years has disappeared. If you know what to feed the body, how it works, you can correct anything. The body will heal itself, even if it's something that's happened from a very young age. Down syndrome, haven't been able to reverse that yet, been able to mitigate it, but I've not known one down child that will eat the diet for more than six weeks. Then they refuse it. There's nothing I can do if they won't eat the food. There's nothing that the body can do for itself unless they eat the food. But autistic children usually have no problem with it, and they just consume and consume and get well and get better gradually until they're well. 

So the colon is very important to the brain and nervous system. That's where it gets fed from that passage of nutrients. Now, by the time your food gets to that colon, you know, it's like an orphanage. The big guys who get up there first get most of the food. So what gets into the colon is not very much and not very good quality. So it's like the little runty kids stay runty because they don't get up and get the food first and the best choices of the food. So again, if you want to help your colon and your brain and nervous system, feed it from the back end. Let it get some fresh, whole fats. It's very easy, just take a, you know, like two, three tablespoons of, if you're an adult, three tablespoons of butter, raw, no salt butter, three tablespoons of dairy cream and three tablespoons of coconut cream. Quarter teaspoon of honey only, about the size of a bean. Put it together in a four-ounce jelly jar with a lid on it, shake it, put it in a bowl of hot water until it gets to about 105 degrees, a little above body temperature, but about as high as a cow's body temperature gets, about 105 degrees. Take a bulb syringe, you know, it's at least a five-ounce one, and I think there are only two and eight-ounce bulb syringes nowadays. So you get an eight-ounce one, put it in there, get on all fours, bark like a dog, put it up in you, and then keep your knees up, stay on your knees with your buttocks up, and then go down like this on your face, on the bed or floor, whatever you're doing it, and roll your stomach like a belly dancer. And that will get it to move up the descending colon. Then you do that for only three minutes. Then you roll on your right side, lift your left leg in the air, and roll your stomach again. And that will get it to move over the transverse colon down the ascending colon. All the bacteria will thrive and get to eat. And you leave it there. You go to sleep. You do it before you go to sleep.

And you'll find that you're happier the next day. You're more positive. Your brain works better. And the more you do it, the better your brain and nervous system get. And then the body is breaking down all that stuff. And a lot of people will experience constipation, especially when they're drinking a lot of raw milk. It's easy to absorb. And guess what? The bacteria thrives so much on all that good food that everything dries. There's no fats left. So the fecal matter gets hard in some people, very hard and hard to pass. They think they have constipation. True constipation is when you have a block in the intestines and food is not moving through. And you swell with everything you eat because nothing is passing. That's constipation. The other is just non-lubrication at the end point. So, again, infusing yourself with that suppository will remedy that. You're delivering so many fats to the bacteria in the colon, they're happy. They don't need all of it. So some of it will stay there and lubricate the fecal matter so it can pass without much effort or no effort at all. Sometimes it does it without your effort and you end up with diarrhea. That's rare, but it happens and you're going to have diarrhea sometimes because the body detoxes out of every point. 90% of toxins are supposed to leave through the skin. But because of the skin, the lymphatic system are so jammed in 99% of everybody that's in our advanced society, that is for advanced society, that it no longer passes through the skin properly. So the body takes it to the stomach and bowels to dump there. So you have vomit and you have diarrhea as a way of passage of the toxicity in the system. And that's a good thing. But we want to correct the body so it works properly. So when things move out of the body, it's not supposed to be toxic waste. That's not supposed to be something that'll kill you. If it did, dogs that ate it would die. 

But they thrive. They get healthier after they eat fecal matter. Why? And there are tribes that eat buffalo crap. They eat garbage. They eat waste of other animals. Why? Because the animal has already pre-digested it. A cow digests maximum 67% of what they eat. That means 30-some percent, 33%, is passed out. That's waste. Yeah, it's waste for that animal, but it's not toxic waste. There are bacteria, there are insects, there are dogs, there are birds. There are all kinds of animals that eat fecal matter. Especially crustaceans in the ocean. That is their diet. That's their food. They thrive on it. Look at a lobster. Gorgeous colors. Beautiful creatures. And they live on shit. Because that is their diet. That's what they should eat. But if you decided to eat shit because you had no other food, you would survive very well on it. Not eating your own, and not eating other humans, because no human is healthy enough to eat theirs without toxicity. Because we're always passing toxicity out with our feces. But if you were to eat buffalo stuff, it's already predigested. You can't eat vegetation. We don't have a system for that. Our hydrochloric acid is built to break down meat. Our bile is to break down animal fats. Not vegetable oils, not cellulose. It's to digest animal products. So when we eat vegetation, we only digest 2%. That's a lot of waste. That's why 99% of your vegetarians and vegans are very sick people when they're on it for more than 6 years. The highest rate of my cancer incidence is among patients with long-term vegetarians. Not a good commentary for it, is it? So we are not built to do that. But the cow and the goat and the sheep, the horse, they are meant to eat vegetation. They have 2.5 times more digestive tract than we do. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to break down the cellulose to derive the fats and the proteins from it. We only do it 2%.

So if you're eating the fecal matter, if you can't survive any other way, we weren't meant to eat fecal matter. There are animals that are and creatures that are. But I have seen people thrive on it. Live very old ages on buffalo shit. Because they're so poor they don't have anything else. They're slaves to some plantation owner and that's all they have to eat. They don't get chicken or they don't eat anything like that. The worst is, of course, the British in Africa. They created that circumstance, especially in the peanut fields where they destroy a whole land and whole villages from planting peanuts the way they do for 10 years and the soil is completely ruined. Then the tribespeople can't even feed themselves anymore. So it is not a dangerous thing. Fecal matter, your urine and everything. Well, humans is a little bit quite toxic, even if you're on a good diet, but it won't kill you. So all this bacteriophobia, they want you to take chemicals that will kill your cells and they want you to wipe off the natural bacteria with these poison chemicals and as it goes into the body, every time you're destroying a little bit of yourself. And when they request that you take antibiotics, what do they think they do to your intestinal environment? They destroy... One five-day cycle will destroy 1% of your entire body. Taking from 10 weeks, that's 10% of your entire body is destroyed. 10% try to recover on a bad diet. People just get older and sicker and older and sicker. Unless they're taking hormones, they counter that by giving you hormones. You know, thyroid medications, stuff like that pumping you up with those hormones so you have all these false energy. It's not true energy. As soon as you just take them, you hit bottom and you're down and out unless you know what to do, like on this diet, then it all changes. Then you don't have to rely upon the seesaw of illness from that kind of medical treatment.

So let's start with the glands. Let's take a look at how the glands work. Now, the endocrine gland system is a system of producing hormones that are directly delivered to the blood. Those are the endocrine glands. We have the pituitary, the pineal, the thyroid, the thymus, the adrenal glands, and the gonads. Now, the pituitary, we can connect it. I believe in the empirical, so nothing's absolute until we have enough evidence. But my evidence has led me to make probably a 95% conclusion that the pituitary delivers growth hormones to the body. But also something that I noticed, that in all animals that are healthy, hormone production and content in the blood and the rest of the system is minimal. Only trace amounts. So, maybe the endocrine glands are all for emergency purposes. And that's my conclusion, for emergency purposes. When do I see an increase in pituitary hormone? In young animals that I stop feeding and starve. After about three hours on, let's say, a dog, about two hours on a cat, on a small animal, on a young animal that's still developing, you'll see lots of pituitary secretions in the blood to keep the body developing even though it's starving. Thyroid gland, I mean the pineal, they say it's... The yogis and mystics of the world say it's the seat of consciousness, but I've never known anybody conscious enough to prove it. So, we don't know. But it's supposed to be the bridge from this world to the other world. It's where information passes through to our spiritual or psychical auric cells from the body, from the body's brain to its so-called higher self. That's the belief. I don't know. I'm not that involved either. So, then we go down to the thyroid. Now, the thyroid, that's an interesting gland. The only other glands we know that have two are the adrenal glands and the gonads. Here we have six left right thyroid glands, and then we have two parathyroids in each one. That's six thyroid glands.

What is so important in the body that we need a backup for the backup for the backup for the backup for the backup? Your heart and your lungs. Your heart doesn't beat, your blood doesn't move, you die. You don't breathe, you get no oxygen, you have no energy, everything stops. You die. But the pharmaceutical house, they know men's and women's weak point. Oh, it's causing you to be fat. You're losing your hair because of thyroxine. You don't have enough thyroid hormone in your blood. You can't hit a woman lower than losing her hair and getting fat. All of them want to be skinny and none of them want to be bald. 

[laughter]

A: So of course, they're going to take this thyroid gland just based on silly myths, conclusions like that. Now, I've seen plenty of people with plenty of thyroxine in their body go bald. I've seen plenty of them have fat, very, very great, you know, almost twice the body weight with high thyroxine in their bodies. It's not true. So I thought, okay, it has to be related to the most important things in the body, is the heart and the lungs. So what I thought is my brother used to punch me in the stomach and when he punched me in the stomach, I lost my wind. Occasionally, my heart would stop beating. What would start them going again? So I thought, okay, let's go out to a football team. Let me get a guy who's hit so hard that he's lying on the ground and has to be carried off the field. Or he's been lying on the ground and he comes to. Take his blood and see what the concentration of thyroxines are off the chart. If the thyroid hadn't kicked in in that emergency, the heart and the lungs would have never worked again. So the thyroxine was to kick the heart and the lungs back into activity. Again, it proved to me that the endocrine glands are for emergency purposes only, not for your daily functions. But the food industry, our governments, the pharmaceutical industry, the medical industries, they're all tied together. They know that you're weak and sick, now hormones can keep you going. Just like the pharmaceutical, you get sick, you get ill, they give you hormones to think that you're okay and getting well. And it's just the opposite. Your body uses them in emergency situations too. Starving them, injuring them, the body will use these special products that it forms, that it makes from your food into these miraculous substances we call hormones.

Okay, let's go down to the thymus. Now it's believed and still is, the thymus has to do with the lungs. We already know what protects the lungs is the thyroid gland. What is this whitest of all glands and fattiest of all glands? And all of your glands are 65-80% fat, including the brain, that organ, fat. That thymus, when it secretes stuff, where does it dump it? Into the esophagus and into the stomach. It's a protector of poisons going into the stomach and for functionality of the stomach lining. In case, what happens? You get bitten by a rattlesnake. The poisons naturally will go to the stomach for the hydrochloric acid to neutralize that poison and then vomit it out of the body. Or pass it through denatured by the hydrochloric acid. Well, if there weren't an excess fat, like from the thymus, there to help protect that intestinal wall, as those poisons dumped into the stomach, as that venom dumped into the stomach, the stomach would be damaged. The stomach would go into a rigor mortis, would not function and you would die. The thymus is there to protect us from insect bites, from predator bites, from any kind of venom, and from toxins basically dumping from the stomach lining into the stomach. And while the toxins are resting in the stomach, your thymus is always there protecting the stomach. The stomach is a very important organ. Also, when you get an injection of a poison, a great portion of that, anywhere from 40 to, well, 30 is the least I've seen, 30 to 80% of it will go and store in the intestinal lining. Remember, the intestinal lining can't even dissolve itself with the hydrochloric acid that it makes, so it's a resilient tissue. So the body stores that mercury or your aluminum, the formaldehyde from those vaccines and injections in the stomach lining. Sure, it damages the stomach lining, but the worst part of it is that your body dumps a little of that into your food every time you eat, poisoning the rest of the system.

So even though the body is resisting and taking care of that kind of unnatural process, it's doing the best it can to keep you from dying or becoming brain dead from those toxins getting to the brain. So how do we prevent all that? I'll get into that stage. So then we go down to the pancreas, we have to say, is an endocrine gland. It dumps insulin right into the blood immediately to make glycogen out of sugars, out of carbohydrates. Glycogen is what we use to run the brain and the nervous system, to give the brain and nervous system energy. So we have to have glycogen. But it can be made from pyruvates rather than sugars, carbohydrates. And then we don't have a great waste product. So the pancreas, that's not its main job. Because the main job can't be sugars because we're only supposed to eat 5% sugars. If you look at the remains of Lucy, who's 3.8 million years old, she had a pancreas two and a half times smaller than ours. Can you imagine that? A pancreas that's two and a half smaller than the one that we have. All of the other remains of those people, they're anywhere from a million to five million years old. Now we've found some others in South America, I think it is, who are almost five million years old, they have a small pancreas too. Because they didn't live on grains, they didn't live on starches and carbohydrates, they lived on meat and fat. So the pancreas has swollen over these years from the consumption of grains and all of these sugars that we eat and all the forms that we eat it. So what is the main function of the pancreas then? It isn't to spend its life making insulin for us. What it does is every time you eat something, so you take one grape and you eat one grape, the body analyzes the nutrient concentration of that in the mouth, sends it to the pancreas.

The pancreas decides what bacteria is to propagate to nurture, it's like a farmer, to propagate, which nutrients to convert those into feeding the human body, this particular human body. It's just like every house is structured differently, every building is structured differently for the person who has it. So the pancreas is an architect, it is an analyzer, it is a coordinator of how food is to be digested and utilized in the body. Very complex organ and gland, organ gland. So it's idea is not to digest fats and insulin, but yet the pharmaceutical and medical industry said that's what it's about, it's about insulin. To make you think that there's no other world, so that you'll think the body is really stupid, and then you have to treat it the way they tell you to treat it. But it isn't that way. So, then we get down to the adrenal glands. In the adrenal glands, we know are for emergency purposes, fight or flight. Even if you get injured, you can have high amounts of adrenaline to help you recover. That's why when you have, let's say, plastic surgery, they now inject adrenaline compound, adrenaline hormones around the area that they've cut, because it will heal and strengthen and take care of itself faster. But again, that's the absorption of something that is supposed to be natural for something that isn't natural. I'm not saying don't have plastic surgery. I won't, but some people do. And if you do that, I suggest you don't use the medical profession's adrenaline. I suggest that you get some adrenal gland, chew it into a mush, and then put it around the area. Don't use antibiotics, because part of the healing is bacteria. So the adrenal glands are for fight or flight. Then we have the gonads, two of those also. If somebody loses one, they can still procreate. We know that procreation can't happen without the gonads. The male delivers the seed, and the woman has the egg. And there you have life. 

And any man who does not take responsibility for getting a woman pregnant is a bad guy, because he put the seed in her. It isn't the woman's responsibility. If he can't pull before he ejaculates, it is his fault that a woman gets pregnant. And he should have his balls cut off if that woman didn't want to get pregnant. So, I'm very hard on that. Pardon? Oh, that's true. And all this crap about saying, well, I pulled out in time, no such thing. I've analyzed the pre-secretions on at least 20 men, and it all contains urine. The pre-flow is to clean the urine out because the ammonia will kill. The ammonia that is created by the kidneys will kill sperm. It will not just kill them, it will kill part of them and completely paralyze all the rest. So, sperm can't swim if they live from the urine. So, it wipes it out. Then when the ejaculation comes, there's no sperm in there to penetrate and cause a blocking of dead ones or immobile ones to those that are mobile. The only way you can get pregnant is if a man ejaculates into you. Period. So, all that crap about your pre-sperm, you know, can cause pregnancy is absurd. Not true. If that were true, the tribes wouldn't have control that they do. You know, in a tribe, you can't have a baby unless the whole tribe agrees to it. Do they go around with prophylactics and birth control? They know that unless you ejaculate into your woman, that she's not going to get pregnant. Yet, they still have sex. So, another great myth of the medical profession to get you to use prophylactics so they can put their profit dollars, you know, their dividends into their pocket for all these prophylactics and birth control pills and all that. All they have to do is educate the men is do not ejaculate. Period. I haven't ejaculated in a woman except during a period in 47 years, 46 years. Never gotten anybody pregnant.

Of course, I don't have sex, much sex anymore. But when I did, you know. And that's because I don't have time. Not because I don't like it or I can't do it. I don't have time to have relationships anymore. The only time I have is when I got my girlfriend in Thailand. And then I have to say, wait a minute, will I spit dust or rust? It's been that long. Can I perform? Yeah, it does. It works. I still work. So get rid of that myth too. Another myth for investors in the pharmaceutical drugs and prophylactics. Okay, so the gonads are for reproduction. Of course, the more sperm you have, the more sex that a man wants. That can be from all kinds of different reactions from bad foods and chemicals. They create an over sexual desire. In tribes people, and I've met many tribes people, probably over 100 different tribes, probably 110 tribes in my lifetime, and none of them are over sexed. They enjoy it when they have it, but it doesn't overwhelm them. When I was a child, the only thing I could exercise, the only exercise I could do was masturbation. Because I was so sickly, and my body produced hormones for physical activity, but I was so sore and weak all the time, I couldn't, so I masturbated a lot. Five times a day minimum. That's the way I got my exercise. I don't have to do that anymore, because I don't have those kinds of compounds creating problems in my body, and now I am functional without severe pain. I still, after those injections in the arm, I'm back to that point. I bring this arm over this amount, and I start going into pain in this whole area. So that I have to deal with again, and it's getting better, improving a little bit every month. Okay, so that takes care of the endocrine glands. Let's take a look at the organs. Start with the brain. The brain is 60% to 80% fats, 15% to 25% protein. The rest are carbohydrates and fluids.

The brain does what? The brain allows you to have choice over your body. To be a dancer, to be an artist, to be an inventor, to being a ditch digger, to being a farmer. Anything you do is choice because our brain is connected with the body. If you're endowed with special talents like a contortionist, you can put your head between your legs and, you know, your arms and all of that and do all kinds of phenomenal feats with your body. And that's one way of the body's expression. Body can express itself in so many ways. You get in touch with your body's talents and you can make a living of it in a happy way instead of doing a job that you don't like doing. Especially if you're healthy and know what your body can do. Know what your healthy body can do. So the brain allows us to make choices and to control the body. Now a lot of people don't have to control it, it's automatic. Take your natural athletes. You know, they don't have to think about it. They do it and automatically it happens. That's a fabulous, fabulous activity. Talent, gift, whatever you want to call it. My being able to do math was a great asset for me because I was able to make a lot of money as an idiot. You know, think about that. How many idiots get to make $80,000 a year as a 20-year-old? You know, not many. And that was in 60s, you know, 66. So we all have a talent and the brain is the way to choose. Well, my body does it automatically. Let me use it automatically to help. I just saw Cirque du Soleil. It's my only entertainment every year. I go see Cirque du Soleil. It's a circus from Canada. And it means circus, Circus of the Sun, Soleil. And the phenomenal things, the acrobats, and that's mainly what it is. That's my preference to going because it's mainly acrobats. They do phenomenal things with their bodies. And these people do it naturally on their own, but they do feats that are not natural. And they have to practice every day to do it. And it's often dangerous. The trapeze work is very dangerous work. Even if you've got a net under you, it's still dangerous. But they are using their brains to do something extraordinary with their natural talent.

So, that's the brain. What happens if the brain becomes highly toxic? Confused, depression, all kinds of problems. Now, what does the brain consist of? Like I said, mainly fats, some protein, high ratio protein. But what does it use to function? It uses metals. Why? Because neurological fluid is mainly transferring light and energy, electromagnetic energy throughout the body. Those are the signals that it utilizes. Just like a computer uses silicone chips. Ours uses trace amounts of mercury, aluminum, lead, cadmium, zinc, iodine. All of those in trace amounts. But if you're infusing them in the body in environmental pollution, including your food, where does the body store most of those toxic free radical metals? In the brain and nervous system. So, what becomes most toxic quickest? Brain and nervous system. Government knows this, military knows this, NSA know it, CIA know it. That's why they're dumping chemtrails, dumping barium and aluminum. Now you have to look at why barium and aluminum? Why aren't they dumping lead and other things? What do we use aluminum for? What does the military use aluminum for mainly? Increase the strength of gunpowder and explosion. In all of your bullets that you buy, 15-25% aluminum. If they add that to the gunpowder, the explosion increases by 3-5 times, depending on how the gunpowder is produced. So, they get all this aluminum dumped in your body, and then you mix salt with it, which is an explosive when sodium is isolated. And what is likely to happen to your body? Having internal explosions all the time. And it will increase the explosive nature of salt, of sodium. Now, the military has tried to make sodium into an explosive as a weapon for over 60 years. My father worked on one project for General Electric. I told you my father invented the first Bering computer. Great scientific inventive mind, but no restraint on his emotional life. And every time they tried to do this, and we gave, we, our taxes were given to General Electric to $2 billion to make sodium into a bomb, our explosive device.

Why? Because one solid crystal of pure sodium can take out all of New York City. Worse than an atomic bomb. All the buildings and everything, level everything. Plus, make a hole in the earth. A big hole in the earth. So, of course, it's the efficient way to destroy things. The military wants it. But sodium in that form, in that concentration, they can never contain it. It will go off at a 1.5 degree change. They've handled nitroglycerin to an extent, but it is still reactionary. You change the degrees, 10, 20 degrees, you've got an explosion. You don't control it. Sodium, 1, 1.5 degree, and it ignites. There's no controlling it. What do you think it does in your body? You want to find out what it does? These three guys were ridiculing me about salt. And they took frog legs. These are legs cut off of frogs, not cooked, put on a plate. You put frog legs, salt, video, and you'll come up with that video on YouTube. And they take those three legs and they salt them. Now, they've got a shaker that's not putting out a lot of salt, so they're shaking mildly around. You can see them start to twitch. They turn them over, do the same thing on that side. They twitch for 32 minutes. These are dead frog legs. Why are they twitching? Because sodium, salt, starts separating when it reaches the tissue and starts exploding, creating electromagnetic energy and destruction of the tissue. Then they say, well, what would happen if we put pepper on it? I said, nothing would happen with pepper because the animal's dead and it's a spicy thing. It burns the tissue and it will only respond if it's dead, if it's connected to the brain. It's not an explosive. So they pour the pepper on one frog leg and it has one spasm and that's it. But with the salt, it goes on for 32 minutes. They only leave it for two minutes. They don't let you see it for two minutes. But it goes on for 32 minutes. The nature of salt is dangerous. Nobody should be eating salt in any form. Sodium that we get is high in foods, especially certain foods like tomatoes and watermelon and avocado. Those are your highest concentrations, but there are other forms of it. But when sodium is in food, it's not an explosive. It's an adjunct to energy and helps build energy.

So I'm getting off on the tangents here. So let's go back to the organs. So we talked about the brain and its chemistry. Now let's go down to, we have the salivary glands, we have the tonsils. Now what do the tonsils do? The tonsils protect the brain when you're eating something that may be toxic. The tonsils will produce a fluid like lymphatic fluid concentrated in fat and arrest it. Your body can even transport what is absorbed into the tongue and the gums and deliver it to the tonsils, not the tonsils, tonsils, to be able to dissolve that, neutralize it, and throw it out of the body. But what happens in our concentration of toxicity from, anybody know when tonsillitis was at its greatest? 50s, in the 50s. Why? Because the, many of you probably don't know this, but World War II was created to get people into accepting canned goods quickly. The King and Queen of England were most responsible for that, getting us into wars. And it was all methodically planned by all of their minions, the Rockefellers and the Rothschilds and all of them manipulated the war. The boom in industrialized food, and the King and Queen owned 70% of all food production in the world and 35% of all the land mass on the planet. The CIA and all of its minions are working very hard to get ahead of them. So that's the ploy that's going on, who's going to get the greatest empire. Anyway, when they started canning food, what was happening? All these metals were getting into the food. As you ate, all those metals went into the tonsils. The tonsils were being deteriorated and disintegrated. They were constantly infected with this new food. Tell me the sense of this. The ploy of the government was going on television saying, support our troops and eat canned food. How the frick is that, supporting our troops by us eating canned food when we can eat fresh food grown from the farm? Doesn't make sense. That was your brainwash. That was the spin to get you to... My mother absolutely loved it. She didn't have to peel, she didn't have to wash, she didn't have to cut anything. Open a can and pour it into a pot, cook it. Very simple, easy.

So we grew up on the worst foods because my mother loved canned foods. We didn't get anything fresh unless it was an apple or banana or watermelon or berries, you know, in the springtime. And that was mainly because my grandmother grew raspberries and those other fruits so we would get them in the summertime. Otherwise, my mother would have gotten maybe bananas and apples and that's it. That's all she usually got us. So the contamination in everything, in our food and everything, has to be understood. It affects the body. So the tonsils are there to protect the brain. And you have them removed, what happens? The brain gets toxic or your lymphatic system and the tonsils in the lymphatic system are almost identical in nature. The lymphatic system cleans the body of all waste and all toxins and helps neutralize them. So what happens? My tonsils removed at three years old, these glands swelled. My lymphatic glands and my neck swelled. They've been swollen ever since. So now these glands are acting for the missing tonsils. So now we have many more people going around with swollen necks because their lymphatic systems in their necks are dealing with more. But I'll get into those systems in a minute. So we go from the brain to the throat and then to the lungs. We know what the lungs do. The lungs absorb oxygen. The white blood cells take that oxygen, delivers it to every cell to do what? Helps convert nutrients into energy. And there's no burn to it. There's no carbon dioxide. Carbon dioxide comes from burning with flame, with fire, with high, very high temperatures. We produce, excuse me, carbon monoxide. Sorry, carbon monoxide is from burning. Carbon dioxide is just from a transference of chemistry. Sure, it can be toxic if it builds up in the body because it causes lactic acid buildups in the muscles. You get stiff and sore. So the white blood cells have two jobs. 

Red blood cells have one job and that's to deliver oxygen to the body for the body's energy. The white blood cells have two jobs. Has to eat the dead red cells in their waist, the phagocytes. And they take carbon dioxide and deliver it to the lungs for expulsion. The byproduct of that energy production. And it's not a burning. They get you to believe burning because they want you to accept cooking. Half the planet is, you know, half of all of industry is medical, pharmaceuticals. The other half is food production. Now, we have computers and all that other stuff. But the main items that people buy in the world, the greatest, are food and medication. So, clean food is very, very important for the working system. Lungs, oxygen, carbon dioxide. Removed from the system. Then we have the heart. What does the heart do? It's the motor that runs the blood through the system. Keep everything flowing. Keep the body warm. Red blood cells produce a lot of heat if they're healthy. And they do it by eating waste from the white blood cells. They are eating themselves, basically. Red blood cells eat their own waste by eating the discard of the white blood cells. The white blood cells get most of their nutrients from the intestinal tract. Red blood cells can, too, but not much. So, the bloodstream is supposed to have one job. Deliver oxygen to the body so that cells will have energy. Whatever energy that is. Whether it's digestion, whether it's doing acrobatics or dancing or thinking. All of that is done by bacteria. All of those processes are all facilitated 99.5% by bacteria. Just like the intestines. Bacteria does everything. The more bacteria in the body, the more you will thrive. Okay, let's go down to the pancreas. We talked about it since it's part organ, so I don't have to cover that. I did that well. We go to the liver. The liver is supposed to do one thing. Manufacture synthesized bile for digestion of fats. Now, there are varieties of bile to be made. There are 60 varieties of bile to be made to form 60 varieties of cholesterol. Those are families of cholesterol. There can be thousands within that depending upon what that body needs to do whatever it needs to do. Flying fish produces different finite molecules of fat to be able to do what it does.

A bird flying creates a different cholesterol for its ability to fly. Us running, climbing trees, all of that produces different hormones. A person who is sedentary and thinks all day long, completely different cholesterol is needed in the body. So, the liver is responsible for manufacturing, synthesizing, produces whatever you want to call it. Those varieties of bile, then they will be stored in the gallbladder. Now, what does the gallbladder do? Nothing, doesn't produce anything. It stores bile, that's its job. It's a storage, it's a cabinet. It stores the bile that the liver produces. Now, it stores enough to eat about 20 pounds of fat. Who eats 20 pounds of fat? Your ancestors. When they went hunting and found an animal, the first thing they ate was the liver, concentrated protein, then all of the fat. They'd eat 10 to 20 pounds in a sitting of fat. If they didn't have the bile to digest it, they'd have diarrhea and pass it out and never be able to utilize it. When you have your gallbladder removed, you cannot eat ice cream again unless it's an ounce at a time. You can never eat concentrations like an avocado without some problem unless you're eating a third of it at a time. So, when you have your gallbladder removed, you have to eat little amounts of food, especially fats, at all times. Never consume a lot at one time. You're going to have problems. So, the gallbladder has its importance. Now, we take a look at the spleen over with the pancreas. Now, what does the spleen do? We know it's full of red blood cells, sometimes young white blood cells. Well, what happens, when do we see the fluctuations of increase in the amount of red blood cells and the decrease in red blood cells that are contained in the spleen? When you get cold, the spleen will dump a phenomenal amount of red blood cells into your bloodstream to thicken it. Remember, the red blood cells use oxygen to produce energy, even in themselves, so your body temperature raises. Because now, those white blood cells are active in the bloodstream, moving, charging. When they go into the spleen, they go into a hibernation. Also, when you have a cut. Let's say you fell out of a tree, one of our ancestors, climbing a tree, fell out of a tree, or even now. 

And there was a branch that poked through and ripped your jugular vein, and you lost a quart of blood, a third of your blood, or a fourth of your blood, if you're a big person. Well, what happened? You'd be anemic. And then they were dinner, or breakfast, or lunch, or snack for some other creature, who ate animals, like tigers, and other cats, and maybe even dinosaurs. So, how did the body make up for that? As soon as the bleeding stopped, the spleen would dump all of its reserves, like almost a quart of blood, back into the bloodstream. Giving the person, so the person would no longer have anemia. If the person had anemia, they're not going to climb another tree, they're not going to be around 10 feet, they're going to be some meal for a creature, or a snack, a candy bar. For a dinosaur, it would be a candy bar. So, you have to take a look at that. Body is phenomenal. Spleen holds the red blood cells for a reason. For incredibly wonderful reasons. So, then we go down to, you know, we talked about the stomach and all those organs, so I don't have to go back into them again. And we have the kidneys. Because they don't produce anything but ammonia. Now, what do the kidneys do? We know that when the blood and the neurological fluids and lymphatic system passes through the kidneys, that fluids dump into the kidney. But not many red or white blood cells. Why? Because the ammonia they produce causes like a negative side, the south side of a magnet. It pushes the red and white blood cells away. Because if we peed our red and white blood cells every time we urinated, we'd be anemic and be dead. Or we'd be worms. So, to preserve the red and white blood cells, the kidney forms the ammonia to prevent the red and white blood cells from entering the kidney. But we do need a loss of fluids for several reasons. The main reason is when we undergo a body temperature change or an atmosphere change of 3 to 5 degrees, we have to adjust the fluid level in the blood or put on a lot more coats or remove a lot more. So, what do the kidneys do? The body starts dumping a lot more. When we're cold, the body will dump a lot more fluids into the kidney. So, when you're cold, you urinate more. So, your blood will thicken.

So, you've got the red blood cells from the spleen going into the bloodstream to thicken it and warm us and get rid of some of the fluids where the body, you know, water freezes very low temperature. Blood does not. So, the body tries to get rid of excess water, excess fluids, H2O, by dumping it into the kidneys. Now, we have a bladder. Why do we have a bladder? Because we'd be peeing on ourselves all day long. It collects the fluids that have dumped into the kidney until it's to a point where you have to urinate. How would you like to go around peeing all over yourself all the time? It wouldn't be fun. So, and you wouldn't smell very good. So, we have a bladder for a reason. Rectum. 

Q: If you pee blood, is that because of a rupture just somewhere else along that?

A: It depends. If the blood is red and fresh, you have a tear somewhere around your rectum. If it's black, then you have a tear somewhere else in the intestine. He asked about whether you have blood in your fecal matter. If you have a question in the future, don't ask it. Write it down. I will probably answer it by the end. One time, I answered every question early in my process. It was about 1998 in New York City where we had 85 people in the room. I answered every question as they were asked in the room. We got out of there at 1.30 in the morning. So, not a good thing. If you have a question, write it down. We will have a Q&A period. If I don't answer that question, then ask it at that time. We pretty much covered the organs and the glands. Now, let's take a look at the fluid systems in the body. Pardon? Oh, the appendix. Thank you, thank you, thank you. I forgot. See, I don't have one. Why talk about it? Appendix is a very important organ. It has a memory of everything that's ever entered the body, whether toxic or non-toxic, whether a natural bacteria for you or a natural bacteria for something else, someone else, a mushroom. It doesn't matter. It records everything. It's a library. Say you got bitten by, stung by a scorpion. That agent would be stored in the appendix, and within 10, 20 minutes of that sting, your body would already be doing what it needs to do to neutralize it and to lower any kind of damage. If you do not have a pancreas and your body hasn't devised some other way, like removing your tonsils, then these become your tonsils basically, your lymph glands, then it will take you anywhere from 24 to 36 hours, even longer, to decide what to do about that element again. There's a lot of damage that can go on in that time. So an appendix is a very important library to have. Now, obviously, you know, after the 40 years of doing, 42 years of doing raw foods and about 32 years of doing the primal diet animal products, I have developed a way to handle and remember those toxins better, not as well as when I had a pancreas, would have if I had a pancreas, but pretty well when I got stung by those three scorpions. The first took a long time because that's the first time I'd been stung by a scorpion in my life.

Sure, it took 24 hours to really take care of and get it under a harness, but the next time, hour, two hours, next time, 20, 30 minutes. So my body either has grown back the appendix or it has devised a type of appendix memory somewhere else in my body. If you're feeding it right and treating it carefully, then your body will make up for limitations. Thank you for that. Thank you for reminding me. So the fluid systems are the blood, the neurological fluids, and the lymphatic fluid. Now I went into heavily what the blood is supposed to do. The blood is only supposed to carry oxygen throughout the body and remove carbon dioxide. Imagine if that's all your blood did, how much energy we would have. The government would not be able to keep us down and out, and the schools would never be able to keep us in the classrooms. We would not be minions of the few people who run government. We would all be healthy and bright and smart without the need for government. We would probably have just community organizations which handle everything, just like the tribes do. Certain selected people which take care of the people, not usurp their money to use for their goals. It's basically what government does, government individuals. The Constitution set parameters for a healthy government, but our government actors are not acting in line with the Constitution, and they're usurping the money for their own uses. And there's nobody worse than the CIA. We pay for everything the CIA does, and the CIA builds businesses, racketeers all over the world. They were caught peddling cocaine in the 80s and 90s, and now they've been caught peddling heroin. The amount of heroin now in Afghanistan has quadrupled since before we went in. And we went in there to stop the poppy fields, and that was the rouge to go in there. Now they've produced four to five times more heroin, and guess who runs it? Minions of the CIA. Corporations formed by the CIA. So you have to take a look. ur governments are not in agreement with our Constitution, which meant that we are all equal. Each person is his own sovereign. As long as he doesn't hurt anybody else, he is allowed to have life, liberty, pursuit of happiness in whichever way he wants without hurting people.

It doesn't happen that way anymore. The body governs itself as long as you take care of it to the best of that kind of Constitution. It has its own Constitution. And it will always work for you no matter how you abuse it. But sometimes those poisons, it can't, cannot, doesn't have the ability or nutrients to do it, so then the body collapses, dies, or has some terrible disease. Which can always be reversed. Well, 99, 95% of the cases I've seen any disease reverse. In lung cancer, 65%. In Lou Gehrig's disease, only probably 20%. And third and fourth stage Alzheimer's haven't been able to reverse it, but stop it. So no matter which stage, it can be stopped in this diet, but reversal of the symptoms stops at second so far. I haven't been able to find any other way to reverse that much degeneration beyond the second stage. So the other fluid system, so we talked enough about the blood, but let me talk a little bit more about the blood. The blood is now delivering nutrients to the body. So it's got a new job. So now it's absorbing nutrients out of the intestine and transporting them to the body, to other cells in the body. Why is it doing that? What is not working in the body that the blood has to do that now? Remember, the lymphatic system is responsible for absorbing the nutrients in the intestines to delivering them throughout the body, and like the white blood cells, the lymphatic system has two jobs. It has to deliver the nutrients, and it has to clean the body of all waste products and neutralize poisons. What is jamming the lymphatic system that it cannot, that has to concentrate only on cleansing and not doing that well, and not transporting nutrients that has to give the job to the bloodstream? The greatest assault that happened when, also in the 1960s, early 60s, when margarine became the thing. Trans fatty acids. Trans fatty acids take fat molecules and convert them into chemistry that makes them plastic. Same molecular structure as plastic. So people began eating plastic fats. Don't eat butter, eat margarine. It's from vegetables. Well, wait a minute, the human body isn't built to break down vegetable oils. Why are we eating them? Again, to control the population.

So eating all these, and any oil, safflower oil, almost all the oils in a restaurant, manufacturing, 99% of them are trans fatty acids. And they devised a new way of handling it. Still comes up with a slightly different molecular structure, but it's still a form of plastic. And they give it a new name, and they sell the same kinds of oils. Same kind of plastic substance. Every time you eat a donut, every time you eat a cereal that's fried and cooked in these foods, you're eating plastic fat. Can you digest plastic fat? You can't even digest it when it wasn't processed as a vegetable oil or a seed oil. We can't digest them. Our bile is constructed for animal fats. Mainly, 2% we can handle. If we continue eating those things, our body will build up to 25%. Utilizing them, but never well. Never thoroughly, and there will always be side effects. So we have all this plastic fat congested in the lymphatic system. Because the lymphatic system has to absorb all of these compounds and put them in the glands and the nodes. The lymph system has probably 20 million little bitty nodes in every body. That can be the size of a pinhead to the size of a pellet. You know, a firing BB type pellet. Be that big. And we have the glands which are anywhere from, you know, a small marble to the size of your thumb. And the women around in the breast. Big lymph glands because they have to take care of the breast feeding, nursing, and take care of the lungs and everything. That's what these glands are for. Your lymph glands' major networks are in the neck, lower part of your face, your underarms, and all under, on the upside of your underarm, and going all the way down to about mid-rib, all the way across into the mammary glands, more so in women than men. And then the next major network starts in the thighs, halfway down the thighs, comes all the way up to the crotch, and broadcasts all the way over to the hips. And also some in the back, all around in here. Those are your major networks which are responsible for taking all the poisons out of everywhere, and it's not supposed to be much. It's supposed to be just the waste of metabolism, not poisons from food, not poisons from your environment.

So the lymphatic system is so jammed with these plastic, waxy, toxic, undigestible, unbreakdownable toxins that they fill up these glands and nodes, block the channels in the lymph glands. People just keep blowing up and getting bigger and bigger and bigger, if they're lucky. If they're not lucky, they'll get multiple sclerosis, they'll get dissolution of the connective tissues, lupus, they can get muscular dystrophy. There can be all kinds of problems, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue. All of these are a result of the body not cleaning itself. And this is the jammed lymphatic system. The lymphatic system, what does it do with its waste normally? It dumps it under the skin. And we're supposed to perspire it out of the body. Our skins are so dead from all the shampoos and soaps and chemicals, you know, formaldehyde in your makeup and all of these dastardly things, we damage the skin and it can no longer perspire. Many people don't even perspire. You have to put them into a hot tub to get them to perspire. And then they have to stay there 90 minutes before they're even getting the lymphatic system working for an hour. And then when they get out, as soon as their body cools down to normal temperature again, lymphatic system is solid again. So the blood has taken on that job. Well, if the blood is doing that major work of delivering nutrients and the lymphatic system is doing it, how much does that lower your body's ability to produce energy from blood? 66%. You're only producing 33% maximum of the energy you're supposed to. Think about that. You're running around on a third of the energy. A third of the energy that you're supposed to. That's disgusting. That's criminal. And our doctors and our government is telling us that's the way it should be. Because they can't control us in any other way. This is 1% of them and there's 99% of us. And they've got us all duped. They buy everything that means anything. They've got the universities. They've got the TV and all the commercials. The news station that broadcasts all the malarkey. Please turn off your cell phones, everyone. And people believe it because they're brainwashed. Not because people are stupid, but because people have faith. 

They basically believe that they can trust most people. And the people they trust most are the people they shouldn't. Those are politicians, educators. Anybody who's propagating the false information out there that keeps us sick, ill, and stupid. Or ignorant. Not stupid, but ignorant. And even stupid, because I was a stupid kid. My brain didn't work. I was stupid. I wasn't just ignorant. I didn't have a brain that could think. My brain didn't work. So I was stupid. I was an idiot. But a lot of people out there have the intelligence. They just need to open their eyes and take a look. And make the changes appropriate. And this is the big start. Take care of yourself first. Self-governing your own body. To take care of it, rather than hurting it and annihilating it. Okay, so this lymphatic fluid. We'll get into how to get that going again. And then we have the neurological fluid. And I talked about it already. Talked about how most of your free radical metals are transported in the neurological fluid. Of course you're going to have a hard time concentrating. You're going to have ADD. You're going to have ADHD. Especially in our children. Which are given all of these vaccines. Like in New Jersey, 68 vaccines by the time you're 15 and a half years old. 68 in New Jersey. New York is the same. They're 52. Really high up there. California is 30 some. Every different state has their minions working on vaccines. Vaccines prevent disease. It's an absolute. How can you have five basic toxins that are toxic independently plus you have 23 to 56 other toxic ingredients that they call inert. Well what are they doing in there if they're inert? They're all toxic. And they all are toxic on their own measurement, on their own personality. Putting that soup together of 53 to 63 toxins in every vaccine. It's insane. There's a Saturday Night Live type group in Canada that did a skit. And you can find it on the internet. Put flu, Canada, flu vaccine Canada, YouTube, comedy or SNL, Saturday Night Live, something like that. And you come up with it. And they have this skit where they talk, they interview these people seriously about flu shots and all this in Canada. 

And they're talking about, oh, well, I think it's important that we have them because we need, you know, to prevent disease. Flus kill people and stuff like that. Well, how do you feel about, you know, your government? Well, they're free. And the announcer said, well, then who pays for them? Oh, well, I guess they aren't free because we pay them with our taxes. So they're not free. So you come up with all of this stuff. And I was amazed they even let them put it on the air. So what they do is they say, okay, let's make a vaccine that we can make in our own home. So you have a blender. And they take a thermometer and they break it, dump the mercury in, liquid mercury in. They take a rotten egg. And they break the rotten egg and put that in there. They take ether, formaldehyde, liquid mercury, and detergent. They take, you know, like Tide or something, dump that in there, blend it, and then offer it to everybody. This is what you're injecting into your body. Here, for your flu. When you see that, I still, to this day, don't know how they got it. They never repeated that. They repeat every episode, but not that one. The only way you can find it is on the Internet. And it was so revealing and so true. And you've got 23 to 56 other toxic substances than just those main five. How can anybody in their right mind say that it's healthy to inject it on children and that you're a bad parent if you don't? You've got to have this information. And you write it out and you say, these are the ingredients. You're going to tell me that these are safe to put in my children? I wrote up a release form that says, these are all the ingredients here. If you want my child to take it, you have to sign this release, which means that person who's forcing the vaccine is saying, I will guarantee $1 million that your child won't be affected. But if he is, I'll give you the $1 million to take care of him. Nobody ever signs it. And your children don't get vaccinated. And it will never go to court because that document is used in a courtroom. And when a jury, and you never take it to a judge, any time you go for a judge, the judge is paid by the state. The judge has the state's or federal government's interest in mind entirely. You go for a jury, at least you'll have a chance.

So if you're fighting anything with the government about your children, your rights, your food, you take it to a jury, not to a judge. Okay, so the contamination in the nervous system is compounded greatly by medications and especially vaccines. 70% of all the disease I see is created by the pharmaceutical industry, mainly vaccines. The damage is astounding to the brain and the nervous system, as well as the other parts of the body if it gets to that area. If your lymph system is really bad. And you have to look at the children these days. It's terrible. Now children are not supposed to have a lot of energy. So of course they're stuck in a classroom and they outlaw phys ed. What are you going to have? And Schwarzenegger knows that, but he outlawed, you know, he got rid of physical ed in California when he was in office. He got rid of raw milk in its purest form. Because he believes in the Nazi. His father was a Nazi and he was all for the Bush family and Nazism. The Bush family, I don't know how many of you know it, the Bush family helped finance Hitler. And the Attorney General found out about the bank, the Bush's bank financing Hitler and seized all the assets of the bank. Of course, Bush Senior Prescott was connected with the Rothschilds, everybody with money. He was the banking for them. So he had many resources. He said, you know what? I'm going to run this government. You're never going to pull that off again. So he put his son, got his son in a position to run the CIA and be involved in the CIA and run a major majority of what happened to it for 30 years until he became President. Still, he was a CIA agent at that time. So all that stuff is maddening and crazy. How close were we there? I don't know, 45 minutes? 10 minutes? Pardon? 11 minutes. 11 minutes. I knew it was coming close. I didn't know whether to start the next phase or break it here. Let me talk a little bit more about that.

So that neurological fluid, to clean it because it's not discharging out the blood, I mean the skin anymore as it normally would, or dumping into the lymphatic system where it could be neutralized before it's sent out and wouldn't damage the skin as it moves through the skin, being dumped in the stomach all day long, along with all the contamination that's in the stomach lining. So what you're doing is as you're digesting your foods, you're recycling all those poisons. So you're weakening yourself every time you eat. Pretty scary thing, isn't it? By following the pharmaceutical and your teachers and everybody else who propagates this nonsense in the media. So what we're going to get into after this is we're going to talk about how to clean those systems. And I'm going to go ahead and start now. It's reserved time. Okay, the lymph system blocked. The only way that I've been able to devise a way to get it to move, it's not in my books because I discovered this all in the last five years, or I proved it all in the last five years because I don't write about anything unless I've proved it enough to my satisfaction. And that means empirically the results have to meet with what I want. Heating the body from 105 to 108 degrees will start the lymphatic system cleansing, melting so it can cleanse itself and start it moving. So it's an artificial process. You can move to the tropics, have it happen all day long, every day. Or you can get a hot tub. And another way is to sleep with about seven hot water bottles and put about three beach towels underneath you to absorb all the perspiration. But the disadvantages to that is that you don't have a constant washing of those toxic substances that come out of your skin. The best you can do is put on like cotton or silk underwear to absorb those toxins so they don't rest on your skin and age and damage the skin by drying it out and bursting the cells and killing them. The best place is a hot tub where the water is consistently 105 degrees. You stay in there and you have certain substances in there or certain filters for the water, you know, to make sure the water is pure. And then you stay in there 60 to 90 minutes a day to get that lymphatic system moving.

Now, when I began experimenting with this about five years ago with other people, I had to do it with myself for about five years just to prove that it worked on me. I always used myself as a guinea pig first. Then I started using it on other people. So in the last five years of working with other people doing it, the increase in health and activity and everything has tripled. Tripled just by this. I used to go by Pottenger's and Howell's work with cats and rats that showed that it took 40 years to completely clean a body and restore it. It took 40 years for a human to, but it took seven generations, excuse me, five generations of an animal to restore it to optimal health from disease. So for us, that's 38, almost 40 years. So I was, because I saw that, that was true, everything was going at that rate, two and a half, three percent a year of change toward better health every year. So balance that out, we're looking at 40, 35, 40 years. More at 38 and a half years. So I thought, there's no magic bullet, but I'm always looking for one. So I thought, okay, the lymph system is our greatest problem. If we can get that working and moving, we can start feeding the body properly, the blood can have its free reign of creating energy, and we can start moving the poisons out of the body on a daily, hourly, minute basis as you get better. So melting that was the only thing that I could come up with. And it works. It works. Hot tub is your best health investment besides food. There are other people that say a rebounder gets the, you know, a miniature trampoline will get the lymphatic system moving. Let me give you a demonstration. I take a cold stick of butter, which is hard, and it's in a jar, and I jump up and down on that trampoline for 30 minutes. Is it going to move that hard?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Not until it's warm enough, and it takes 30 minutes to get it warm before it'll start melting. So think about that. All that work on a trampoline isn't going to help your lymph system unless your lymph system's already moving. If you're healthy and your lymph system's moving, sure, it will get it moving and moving faster, and that's a good thing, but the state of people's impacted and congested lymphatic systems, a trampoline isn't going to move it. Heat will, and not that, because your body's only going to get at the maximum 101.3 degrees after intense exercise. Your heart could race like marathon runners' hearts race up to 213 beats a minute, and that's okay, but the body will never heat. I've never, and I've tested a lot of athletes, and I have a lot of athletes that test for me, body temperature's never gone over 101.3 in exercise, in strenuous heavy exercise. I have one guy that does 12,000 jumps in an hour with a jump rope. He trains for martial arts, and his temperature never goes over 101.5, I mean 100.5. So, your body's never going to get up to above 102 that's going to melt your lymphatic congestion. And that plastic can get it to move out of the body. And it takes at least 40 minutes in the body to get everything else moving, not the lymphatic system. It takes about 60 minutes in temperature of 103 to 105 degrees to get it starting to melt. So, say you have a cold stick of butter in the middle of a two-cup jar, glass jar, and you've got 150 degrees outside the jar, and you've got it encapsulated closed like the body's, you know, hermetically sealed. And how long is it going to take for that 105 degrees to change the cold temperature in the water that's broadcasting from the butter? Because it's cold butter. The amount of time is 60 minutes before that butter starts to melt with 105 degrees on the outside. That's a long time. So, your body has to be immersed in the water. If you're doing saunas and steam, you have an air medium to heat you, and the body has a defense aura. In other words, a boundary of what can be touched and how quickly the body can change temperatures. Air has 6 to 8, sometimes 12 inches. The body can, just like in the jar with the butter in the center, how long does it take before it starts melting, before it gets to the body? So, it can be anywhere from this to this. Even this, depending on certain individuals. That airspace there is being cooled by our bodies. So 105 or 130 some degrees out here is being blocked. So except when we breathe, breathe it into ourselves.

We're breathing it directly in. That's why you can damage your lungs, your bronchioles, your esophagus, your throat, your sinuses, ears and your eyes, because it goes directly in. But otherwise you've got this space. When you're in water, you have an inch or two. You notice when you're in hot water, all of a sudden the water doesn't feel so hot until you move a little bit. And then immediately you've got about an inch that water moves, and you can feel it. In a sauna you can move a foot before you feel the change. So your body has an ability to control the temperature around it in a certain distance. So your hot bath is the best thing. Is it about this? Okay, then write it down and ask it later. So trampoline, those other methods, they do not work without harm and damage. The trampoline isn't going to harm you to jump up and down, but it isn't going to move your lymphatic system unless your lymphatic system has already moved. And you black out and pass out. Trying to exercise? No, you aren't getting the oxygen. But in the hot baths, they work. Well, yeah, but you're lying down, that's okay. You're not going to fall and hurt yourself.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, I blacked out hundreds of times. I wouldn't be here today if I didn't use my bathtub. Because with that back pain that I talked about from the radiation therapy, when I was in excruciating pain 24 hours a day, every minute of every day, I finally, I was going to drown. I never told anybody about this before, but I told everybody I was trying to kill myself when I eat the raw meat. But I was going to drown myself in the bathtub. Fell asleep in the bathtub and I didn't drown, but when I woke, my pain was gone. When I got out of the tub, within 10, 20 minutes, the pain returned as severe as before. So I learned that, and I was only able to sleep 10 minutes at a time without waking up in excruciating pain, screaming and crying. After I got into the bathtub, and that's what brought me to it many, many years later, to try the heat for other things. But I'd sleep in the bathtub sometimes 14 hours a day, be painless. I'd wake up freezing after, and I had a big old clawfoot tub, you know, and it was made of pot iron, so it would stay hot longer, you know. So I could be in there 30 minutes, 35 minutes, but I would fall asleep, and I was so deprived of sleep for almost a year, that I was sleeping, you know, 8, 10 hours at a time in this cold water, but of course the cold water would wake me, because it would get too cold after about an hour and a half, two hours. And I'd be freezing to death, but still no back pain. But it would return fast if I got out cold, like within minutes. But I'd just let the water out, like I explained, and bring the hot water back in. Of course, when I did it that way, I'd be asleep for an hour and a half. The water's really cold, so I'd have to let about 4 inches out, and put scalding hot water to bring it back up. Of course the metal holds the cold longer, just the way, you know, it does hot, so I'd have to change it over a few times in 20 minutes to get it hot again. But I would spend 14 hours a day. Sometimes I'd spend 16 hours a day in the hot tub, just so I could be without pain. So, you know, heat and water do phenomenal things. I find when people are around a lot of electromagnetic fields, and you can't relax, that if they get into hot water, it diffuses that electromagnetic buildup of energy, and they can discharge it into the water. 

You can also lie on the ground in sand, dirt, on top of concrete, as long as the concrete is ground level, and that'll discharge it, but it takes about 40 minutes. In the water, you can release it in about 20 minutes or less. So these are all ways that you can deal with symptoms. Okay, so let's get into food. Now, of course, raw food is the way nature provides, and it has enzymes, vitamins, non-cauterized active minerals that are properly charged with electromagnetic fields. You have the proteins, you have the carbohydrates, you have the fats, everything intact as long as the food is raw. Now, the FDA, USDA, you know, which is supposed to be about helping you know and provide food and legislation that makes sure that you have the food to feed yourselves properly. And they have this pyramid, which was built by the food industry. It was about high carbohydrates. Everything is the opposite of what you should be. No fats or little fats, and just the opposite of what you should intake calorically. So with that, you're not going to get the nutrients that you need. They say, well, you can't digest vegetables, but cook them and then you'll digest them. Okay. I cook them. I can then assimilate more proteins, fats, and carbohydrates. But what about the vitamins and the enzymes? The minerals are cauterized. What about the repercussions? Oh, we'll get sick. You live on our medications, and that's what we want. It's exactly what the bottom line is. So cooking is no adjacent to eating vegetables. We don't belong eating vegetables. Remember I said that herbivores have a digestive tract two and a half times longer than ours? Plus they have two to four stomachs. We have one. You watch them. They'll chew their cud, bring it up, regurgitate it, chew it again, swallow it, regurgitate it again, chew it and swallow it. And then they have the two to four stomachs to break that down. Then they have two and a half to 100 times more digestive tract, intestines, to handle the breakdown of the cellulose. And they have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble that cellulose to get the fats and the proteins out of it. We don't have that, but cook it. But the problem with cooking is, it creates by-product chemicals.

And there are 32 identified toxic chemicals created from cooking. And I've listed those in the last 50 pages in my recipe book, all 32 of them. The three main ones that everybody acknowledges, and they only acknowledge those because it shows that they have concern about something. That's heterocyclic amines, lipid peroxides, and acrylamides. And acrylamide's the only one where you're going to hear a lot of information. New York City has banned trans fatty acids in the state, I mean in the city, New York City, in their restaurants. You cannot serve those in restaurants there. That's stepping in the right direction, but they aren't getting to the heart of it. All of these toxins create ill health, interfere with bodily health and functionality, 32 of them. That is only because certain researchers have spent enough money to find those. There are byproducts of those in interaction that create more toxin. So there could be 2000 byproduct toxins of those main 32 toxins. But nobody's going to fund that research. Nobody has funded it. So raw foods is the imperative thing here. In order to get all the nutrients out of things, you need to eat them raw. In their state and growing at the temperatures that they've grown. Now milk can get up to 105 degrees because a cow, goat, sheep's body temperature goes from 101 to 105. Ours is 98.6 averages and most people's are lower. Lower. Why would we want to heat milk over 105 degrees destroying some nutrients in it, altering some chemistry of it? Not a good idea. We know from observing, of course it isn't as apparent now, but you can observe animals that live in the wild that eat their natural diets and there's no contamination in their environment. They have no disease. No cavities, no nothing. When they're put on processed foods they develop diseases like the Pottenger cat studies here. He put 900 cats over a 10-year period on different diets, cooked and raw. And those that were on the cooked food diet developed, I think it was 2,300 symptoms of disease. They developed all the diseases of man, every one. The animals who were on the raw food diet, the things that they would naturally eat, which was all animal products, no diseases, none. Plus the animals that ate the toxic food fought. You could only put so many of them in a cage. They were irritable. They were angry because their nervous systems were getting poisoned. 

Not only that, they took the feces of the two groups. The ones fed raw produced plants with great leaves and lots of foliage. Everything was bright and healthy. The plants that were fed the feces from the cooked animal, cats, were sparse in foliage. The only ones that would grow were beans, which are very hardy, very few leaves at all. They would produce a bean, but that's the only thing that would happen with that feces. Only with the beans were they able to propagate good healthy plants. I mean not a product, a fruit of that plant was the bean. How healthy was that bean? So raw foods are so important to maintain all of the biological everything. Remember your food, the food you should be eating, is 99% bacteria, and they're telling you to get rid of the bacteria in your food. Does it make any sense? No. Your milk is 99% bacteria, your meat is 99% bacteria, eggs are 99% bacteria. Any animal product is 99.5% bacteria, including our bodies. And if that's what we're meant to eat, we have the digestive system only for that as our major food. Maybe 5% fruits and vegetables, or something like that. But that's all we're meant to have. So our food should be full of bacteria, not annihilated with cooking and processing and pasteurizing and chemicals that destroy the bacteria. Let me give you an example of what a high bacterial diet can do. I had a fellow called himself Tarzan. He was a big heavyset fellow, about 6'1", and I mean a bear of a fellow. And he was antisocial, hated people, always depressed, so he chose to be a landscape artist so he didn't have to deal with people, dealt with plants. Didn't have to talk to them, he didn't have to talk to them. And he got on the diet, he was on and off of it for about a year and a half, and he said, Aajonus, this is very hard, you know, it's antisocial, and I said, wait a minute, you don't have any social life anyway, what do you care? And he said, yeah, but, you know, it's hard. I said, yeah, it can be hard, but you can get rid of your depression and anxiety if you'll just exercise when you can, besides, you know, your tree trimming and gardening, whatever it is, on those days when you're not doing much, do more exercise, and eat high meat, rotten eggs, rotten meat. Finally, after that year and a half, 18 months, he decided to try it. 

Now this man, I don't think a sentence that came out of his mouth that wasn't negative in the whole year and a half that I knew him. He started eating the high meat, called me about six weeks later. I didn't even know it was the same guy. Not a negative thing, only wonderful, bright, funny things. And I really didn't think it was him. It was like me calling my uncle. And he was, the personality, just a flip like, different person, charming, funny, loved everything. So I went to do a workshop in that city about probably six months after that. And I had been there a year before. And he was eating only rotten meat, two pounds a day. He wouldn't eat any fresh meat. At the workshop, he had three girlfriends, all tens and plus tenses. He's only a six and a half. He is so funny and so charming, as long as he eats all of his meat, high meat. And he said, I went a week eating fresh meat, and he said, I was unhappy. So and he said, and it only stays on my breath for about 20, 30 minutes, and then it's gone. On me, it's different. I have bad breath no matter what because of the vagotomy. Those acids and bacteria that normally would be generated in my stomach have gone up into my mouth. So that's why when that Dr. Travis on the doctor show said, oh, your breath is terrible, you know. Went on Dr. Phil's show and said that. And I said, the jerk knows in my history what I gave to him, that I had a vagotomy, a pyloroplasty on top of that. He should know that that creates the bad breath. That had nothing to do with my raw meat eating, you know. So all this disperse of bad information out there, you know. So that's the difference what high meat can do. It can change your whole life. People are so afraid to eat high meat, rotten eggs. You know, if I want a bunch of rotten eggs, I've got some brewing. You know, the Asians have the century egg and they're 25 years old. It cost $1,000 a piece. What do they do? They make octogenarians sexually active for 30 days, 6 weeks at a time from one egg. It's a shot of a, you know, Viagra, healthy, you know, for, you know. What I do is I'll take the round end of a spoon and I'll tap it until I hear a faint cracking and I'll turn around and do it again and I'll let it sit for 3, 4, 5, 10 weeks, 6 months till it is foul. And I mean, you know what a rotten egg smells like.

You take, you do not do it inside your house. Take it outside and you eat it out there. And it's funny. It looks and smells awful so put a swimmer's nose clip on your nose with maybe a little ginger or something at your nose, you know, take a little ginger and put it there and then eat it. But what it tastes like, an overly salted hard-boiled egg. It's the weirdest thing. That's what it tastes like. Overly, I mean, it looks like, it tastes like you just poured the salt on it. Because it's released, the bacteria has released every mineral in the egg. So everything is completely absorbable. Every part of it. So then you've got your nerve and brain, nervous system and brain fed because it's breaking it down into the finest molecules. Remember, this is already liquid. So the cells, the bacteria goes in there and breaks those cells down into the finest particles there are. Feed the brain and nervous system. And that's how it works. The bacteria has broken the food down pre-digested before it gets into your intestines. What happens if you go in, what if you find a dead carnivore? And you open the, and let's say you've just killed a dead carnivore. And you open their intestines. You know what you're going to smell in the bottom of the, in the small intestines? You're going to smell rotten meat. You're going to smell the same as you making it rotten. Because that's what bacteria does. But there are certain bacteria that eat the odorous esters, fat esters, that make the odor of the rotten. So those bacteria eat it in the colon. Some in the intestines, small intestines, most of it in the colon. And most of your bowel movements won't smell like rotten unless your intestinal, your colon bacteria is very low. Then the feces will smell pretty foul and pretty rotten. Also they'll smell that way if you have discharge of poisons out of the body. Your feces could smell like metal or a conglomerate of rot and metal and all kinds of things by what it's discharging out the bowels, which is supposed to be going through the skin. You should have foul smelling skin and not bowel movements. But the body does the best it can. Can't move it out the skin. It's going to move it out the bowel. So don't be afraid of bacteria. Now I say you don't have to do it unless you're really gung-ho about getting healthy faster for your brain and nervous system or you're depressed and anxiety. 

Anxiety that follows depression, not anxiety that follows high energy. If you have high energy anxiety, you need to exercise. You produce a certain amount of hormones like estrogen, testosterone, adrenaline for physical activity. And if you don't spend that every day, you're going to be in anxiety and spend it in anxiety. But that's hell on relationships. You're not going to have good ones. You're not going to have a happy home if you're releasing your energy and your anxiety. So exercise. If you're fatigued, chronically fatigued like I was, sing. Got a bad voice, hand out ear stops, earplugs, or get in a closet, a soundproof closet or something like that. Or build one of the primal, what do they call those, primal therapy, one of the primal houses that's all soundproof. Yeah. But, you know, they built these little houses which are soundproof. So the people can go in there and scream and kick and throw things and do all kinds of things in there to release that energy. Or they can get on a trampoline or they can sing. Singing is the most strenuous exercise there is. 20 minutes of singing is an hour on a treadmill. Reason for that is, we're not used to controlling the pitch and sound of our voices by the breathing and the fluctuation of mouth and throat takes muscles and nerves we don't normally use. Take a look at your opera singers. You've never seen a skinny opera singer. You have to be fat to be able to produce that much volume and energy. And it's a tremendous amount of energy. Look at poor Mick Jagger. The guy eats eight times a day and because he gets up there and dances so hard and he sings at the same time, poor guy can't gain any weight. And some of those rock singers don't eat and they're so skinny because even if they eat they just don't produce any, they aren't able to maintain any fat on their body because they sing and dance at the same time. It's very strenuous on the body. So if you're in anxiety because you're nervous, you have nervous energy, you need to exercise. Find an exercise that you enjoy. Don't do an exercise you don't enjoy. Only exercise I enjoy is sex and, sex and sex and dancing. I mean, you can't get me to do anything but stand up during these. I'm a peripatetic lecturer. 

If I sit down, I can't follow thought as well. Who would, was that Aristotle, who was it, that was a peripatetic lecturer. He had to talk and lecture, walk and lecture at the same time. So I love to dance. I mean, you can't get me to dance, you can't get me moving unless the music comes on. Then when the music comes on, it takes over my whole body. I have, like the last time I, was at a, one of those little bitty tribes on a remote island in the Philippines. They have 7,107 islands and I've only visited about 100 of them so far. I've got many to go. And there was this little tribe, they had their, they had, you know, some electricity that they had a generator that ran two hours a day in the evening. And then once a week or once every two weeks, they would have a dance on there. The only thing they had was, they had a cemented area that was a basketball court. So we used that as the dance floor. And I hadn't danced in years and years, probably six years. And I got out there and I rocked for six hours without stopping. Six hours. The kids, the young kids were all, because they were all kids out there dancing. The adults didn't know what to do, you know, just watch. And I was out there dancing with the kids and I don't dance with low energy, I rock. And I move. And you know, I'm dancing, jumping up and down and doing all kinds of, you know, things, you know. You know. I'll do anything. When I feel the music, it just makes me do it. People say, are you coming from a black family? I really get that. And I said, maybe. Family's from the south. So you know, if I have to turn on music if I'm in anxiety, I'm a terrible singer. I even hurt my own ears. So I don't do that. And it's funny, I try to sing and I'm just out of breath and I want to go to sleep. That's too much exercise for me. I want to stay awake and work. So I'll just turn on the music and rock. It's easy. 20 minutes later, I'm fine, I sit down and go back to work. So take care of your anxiety with exercise. Remember all anxiety that comes from nervousness is you're not utilizing the hormones your body produces for physical energy. Like I say, if you can't do it because you're not well, sing. And that'll take care of it. If you're depressed, that's low bacteria in the colon. Your brain and nervous system not getting fed.

Eat high meats, high eggs. Rotten meats, rotten eggs. And it will change things in 10, 20 minutes. That quickly. Go from, I mean, you take medication, takes a few hours or a few days. You have to stay on it, you have to take it every day. I had one woman who had taken psychotropic drugs for 27 years and she was like 37 at this time. So she had been taking them since she was 10 years old. She was a famous yoga teacher, videotapes and all of that. The most depressed woman I'd ever met besides my landscape artist. And nothing, she couldn't do anything about it. So she was on the diet the same way, year and a half. And I kept trying to get her to take the, you know, the other guy who was off away from other people. She was dealing with people every day in her yoga instruction and classes. So I said, you know, over that year and a half, I said, you know, you've got to eat the high meat if you want to really change things over. Try it one time, just one time. Otherwise, I can't work with you anymore, you cause me anxiety, you know, you call me every other day, sometimes several times a day and, you know, I don't need that kind of money. It's stressful on me. So if you don't try the high meat, I'm going to stop helping you. I'm already on a diet that's anti-social, just trying to eat raw meat's bad enough. I can't do it. Everybody thinks I'm crazy and all that, bam, hung the phone up. Called back about two hours later and said, okay, what do I do? I said, well, you have to take the meat, you cut it or grind it into small pieces, you put it into a jar, leave half air space in there, and then you start letting the bacteria grow in it. If you do it out of the refrigerator, it'll take about maybe 14 days. If you do it in the refrigerator, it may take three weeks, six weeks. I don't have that kind of time. I could kill myself tonight, and you know what I wanted to say. I'd been there, done that. So I said, well, I've got a patient who makes a lot of it, eats it regularly, you can probably buy some from him, I'll call him and give him your number. Well, why don't you give me his number? I'm not giving you anybody's number. I don't give out numbers of my patients. If he's interested in helping you, he will call you. So obviously, he had called her, she had gotten some high meat from him, and she called me about four hours later, which probably must have been 10.30, 11.30 at night. 

And at that hour, I see who it is first, and if it's an emergency, I listen to the message. More people just hang up and don't call back until morning. So I heard it was her voice. She said, I got ahold of James, I got the high meat, I had some. I'm really nervous and worried. I need to talk with you. No way I was going to answer that phone. No way in hell, because it would have been hell. I would have been nursing her all night, and I wanted to make sure she got through it on her own because then she would know. So every 45 minutes to an hour she called. Like clockwork, all night about me, because I'm up most of the time, so I sleep very little. Very little in the nighttime and very little in the daytime. So listening to her message each time, and each time she's getting a little bit better in temperament. By 4.30 in the morning, 4.35 o'clock in the morning, she was making jokes. She says, you know, I'm going to stay on this phone until you answer it. She started whistling a happy tune. Time for me to answer. Sun's almost up. She can go to sleep. I can take a nap. So I pick up the phone, and I said, see? See the difference in you? You're making jokes. You're whistling. You're happy. I've known you for a year and a half. I never heard anything but negativity from you. She said, oh, yeah, it works. And I said, you did it all without me. It was just the high meat. So you don't need my assurance. You don't need anybody to babysit you. Just eat the high meat. Look how fast it worked, you know? And I mean, you're taking your, you know, she was taking five psychotropic medications a day, 28 doses a day of psychotropic drugs that just kept her locked into the depression. Medical company, and all of the people who invest in it fill their pockets with her, you know, $2,000, $2,300 a month expenses. Each diabetic, they make $1,200 to $1,600 a month on every diabetic just on their insulin. And we pay for it if the government's sponsoring it. Think about that. That's why they want us to sponsor health care. They can just keep pushing more and more of it on people. Medication and drugs. And there are more people, if they go to a doctor, they'll take more medication. But who's paying for it? We're subsidizing the medical industry. A famous doctor who's called the heretic, and he wrote Confessions of a Medical Heretic. Yeah, Mendelsohn. He said that the people who are lucky are the poor people because they can't afford to go to a doctor.

And that's the truth. It's the truth. So if you have depression, eat rotten stuff. Lots of bacteria. It'll change your life, okay? I've had people who've had cancers that wouldn't reverse eat fecal matter. Why did I go to fecal matter for that? Because I read 27 years ago, I think it is now, a doctor Arab, a female, at the University of Toronto in Canada was using the byproduct of E. coli, so-called verotoxin. They're calling it a toxin. They already labeled it a toxin because it was a byproduct of that E. coli. E. coli makes food for your brain and nervous system. So they're calling that, because they're isolating, you want to scare people, they call it a verotoxin. She found that it dissolved human brain tumors in five days by injecting the verotoxin into the tumor. Where did that go? 27 years ago and nobody's using it. No, they didn't arrest her. But they've smothered her in money and isolated research. Keep her quiet. So think about that. Bacteria we're dependent upon, especially the bacteria they're saying bad for you, are the ones that are going to save your life, ones that are going to save your life. Turn it around. Of course, it's quite disgusting to think the fecal matter. But I've watched people reverse, you know, I've been on this diet, you know, the cancer has stopped growing, a few people it's continued growing, but not many, maybe 5% of them. And just the way to reverse it is to eat some buffalo crap. That's a freaking miracle, you know, and not a lot of it. You know, maybe two ounces at a time, three days a week for about six weeks. Wash it down with milk, whatever it takes. But it's pre-digested matter. And when it runs through your system, you've finally gotten the nutrients and the bacteria to continue that. So after you've done it and inoculated yourself with all that bacteria you lacked. Because our colons are almost the same as any herbivore, small intestine is very different. So by the time food gets to the colon, it's almost the same as ours, except we don't have all the vegetable fiber that's left in the fecal matter, unless we eat whole vegetables. So eating it is a way to reverse cancer. Normally we have three items that we need. We need fats, we need the proteins, and we need carbohydrate. And I listed them in that order with the most important first, fat. Fat does more for our bodies than any other singular nutrient. Fat alone produces two and a half times more energy than carbohydrates and protein. When we produce energy from carbohydrates and a protein, it is a fizzled out, quick utilized energy. When we produce it from fat, it's long lasting and two and a half times stronger.

Have you ever seen a skinny weight lifter or wrestler? You can't have them, the two don't mix. You have to have fat, fat to be able to have strength, two and a half times more. Your body builders who go out there trimmed without fat have done that for the last six to seven weeks before they exhibit their muscles. During the whole time of their training, they're consuming massive amounts of fat to build muscle and meat. But then when they're going to show their muscles, the development of them, they have to get rid of the surrounding fat. They're very weak. Schwarzenegger, when he used to work out, when I saw him working out at Gold's Gym in Los Angeles, he was eating raw eggs, raw milk, raw meats, like, out of style. And he was winning every year, like, you know, he won seven times Mr. Universe. Yet he outlawed healthy raw milk that he won on. And all the other crap. He's just a frickin' hypocrite. Anyway, and he would go from lifting, when he had all of his fat on his body, before he'd start exhibiting, he would lift 400, 470 pounds. By the time it came time to exhibit, and all the fat was gone from the muscles, he was lifting 270. That's 200 pounds less than he could lift with the fat on. And all that muscle had no fuel, no energy, because there's no fat in the muscle. So think about that. Fat, not only does that, produces your best energy and strength and endurance, it takes care of toxins in your body. We know that all fat storages in the body have the most concentrations of chemicals, toxins, and even in poisonous form, intensely poisonous form, except in the stomach lining, where you have the vaccine contamination. Otherwise, all the other fat deposits in the body are inundated with toxicity, dangerous toxicity. The fat can arrest the toxins that surround it, just like the white blood cells I talked about pus earlier, 95 to 98% of that pus is white blood cells. And then 2 to 5% is the toxic chemicals that are in it. Took all of those white blood cells to arrest those poisons. And what are those white blood cells? Fat cells. They are fatty cells. That's why they're white. Phagocytes. They're fat cells. They're fatty cells that eat lots of things. And they can eat lots of toxicity because they're full of fat. They're 80% fat. So fats are so important in our toxic world. And it is a toxic world. Let me give you an example of what fats, even if they're bad fats, they're still protective. It just takes many more bad fats to take care of you than raw fats.

So I had a man come to me who was about, I think he was 46, 47 years old. Skin was very thick. I could see that he had done drugs and alcohol for a long time. You've seen alcoholics with thick noses and thick skin and everything all over. And drug users have the same thing to an extent. But I could see he was using many things because of the condition of his skin. Skin was gray, you know, thick, noduled, scar tissue all over, pock marks. And he was only about probably 12, 15 pounds overweight over what he was supposed to be. So he wasn't fat. And I looked at his skin and I said, oh, these eyes are going to be bad. When I photographed his eyes. Yet looking at his eyes, and it's like he was 30, you know, 25, 30 years old. Clean inside. Liver was good and everything. And I could tell he had done some bad stuff. And I said to him, I said, this is very interesting. Are you from this planet? And I wasn't kidding. And he said, as far as I know, he said that kiddingly. And I said, well, it's just a little odd. I can see that you've done drugs and alcohol and abused yourself for maybe 20 years. He said 25. And you have no severe internal damage. And I said, you're only 12, 15 pounds overweight. It's not possible on this planet. He said, he started giggling. He said, three months ago, before I went on your diet, I was 300 pounds. Even bad fat can protect you. So if you are fat, embrace it. Because it's protected you from a lot of contamination, okay? You rejoice in it. I won't date a skinny woman. They are too much work. Oh, my God. You can't please them. Why? They're not happy in their bodies. They have no fat to relax. And they want to change everything in their environment, including their lovers, to make them happy. And that's not going to make anybody happy. Health makes people happy. Feeling good in your body and secure makes you happy. High maintenance. I tell this story once in a while, I dated Twiggy one night. Everybody know who Twiggy is? She was the first skinny model that hit the circuit. Everybody before that was like Marilyn Monroe, full and voluptuous, and those were the models of that day. So she came on the scene, and I mean, she's bird skinny. Bird leg skinny. So I, because I was so sickly and my brain wasn't working, and I was no longer autistic, so I didn't have the faculty for math that I had before. I could still figure things out, you know, systemically, you know, and systems analysis, but not the same as I did before, and I just wanted to vegetate in front of a camera. It's easier to do that, so I became an actor.

So my publicity agent was the head of MGM publicity, so he said, I need you to take Twiggy to this opening of Butterflies Are Free at this new Abco Cinema that had three theaters. That was the first multiple theater theater in the world. So I took Twiggy in the limousine, and I'm still sick, you know, I'm only 23 years old, and I'm still sick, and taking her, I think it was maybe 71, 72, I was still sick. So I didn't want to go through the paparazzis on the way out, so I said, let's go out the back way. Now the cinema had opened only this main theater for this opening of Butterflies Are Free. So they still had construction work in the alleys in the back and everything. So we went into the back, and the publicity, Dorie Freeman was with me, and Twiggy and Justin, her manager, and I, and we walk out, and I said, don't let that door close just in case we're locked in here. Just in case. That's all Twiggy needed to hear. And the door closed, so nobody caught it. She screamed hysterically, and I mean nothing could stop her. She had decided that this was her time of torture. She was going to be stuck in this back alley inside of a movie theater between empty theaters, in this concrete environment with all this construction material all over the place. So Justin and I had to shake, he slapped her finally, to stop her, to stop it. There is no fat to buffer the information that goes to the brain and nervous system when you're that thin. So everything's extreme. Your myelin is like 65 to 80% fat, and it buffers the amount of information that goes into the brain and out. So everything is exaggerated in people who don't have fats. And that goes for males too, and they can be even worse because they can get violent on top of it. Well, I've seen the women get, one woman, when I was trying to explain this to her, that she was too thin and she thought she was gorgeous, and I was trying to explain to her that it was her lack of fats was the problem. She threw a paint can at me and broke my skin pretty badly. So you get away, you move fast away, dangerous. But mostly men are physically violent in that kind of a situation. So no matter, now it's not 100% of them, I would say I've met only in the tropics where life is cleaner and nicer, I've met some very skinny people that are very nice. But in our society, two or three that were very skinny and still together, nice people. 

So it's not an absolute, but the rate up there is so high that I have to conclude that fats are the most important nutrients in the body. And there are people who are too fat, there are definitely those who are too fat, they're still protected, but it's hard to carry all that weight. It can be a big stress on the body unless you're having good food. Now I have one patient who was, she was a world athlete, Olympic gymnast, who at 26 years old got very sick and all of a sudden gained 200 pounds. So she went from weighing about, what was it, she was small, so 90, about 98 pounds to weighing 300 pounds. Now she'd been on the diet seven years before she started losing the weight. Her husband was the same way. He had to be on the diet six years before he was able to lose the weight. But the longer they were eating the fats and putting on the new fats, their lives got better easier. They could handle the stress of the weight in their bones and in their body because then it was good fat. Now you say, Aajonus, you're a freaking hypocrite. Look at you up there, thin, and you're talking about fat. No, I'm fat. I have 18.5% body weight when I left Los Angeles yesterday, 18.5% body fat. Most people who are my size, they're about 7% to 10%, 11% body fat at the most. When you're eating raw fats, the fat molecules are tiny. And when they break down, they become even smaller by bacteria and digestion. When you cook a fat, it swells five to 50 times its normal size. Take a strip of bacon or, you know, they call flatback from the pork, and you fry it. All of a sudden, that goes from this thin thing to this big old crispy big thing. That's what you're consuming, swollen fats that can't be utilized in the body properly. And if the lymph system isn't working, guess what? It all stores in the body. And you just get bigger and bigger and bigger until the body changes, until you change something you're doing for the body. You get rid of the fats, you stop eating those toxic fats, you eat the small molecule raw fats, and you start changing your body over, take the hot baths to burn that toxic fat off the system.

And most of that that they fry in, trans fatty acids, vegetable oils we don't digest anyway, cellulite that you have, it's those trans fatty acids and other very waxy fats that don't digest and dissolve, binding with toxins, keep filling it up and filling it up until it's a hard substance. They're a lump under your skin where the lymphatic system should be dissolving into a fluid to be discharged with perspiration, they're just staying there as hard little lumps. So what happens? You go on a good diet like this one, you take hot baths, all of a sudden that little lump of cellulite all of a sudden gets bigger and bigger and bigger and bigger because it was so concentrated with toxins, you need so much more fats and fluids in there to neutralize it and harness it into something you go out and leave the body without damaging the skin and the connective tissue so you end up with MS or lupus. So fats are very, very important. Every molecule of fat. Now let's take the types of fats. We have the regular fat in cream and milk, which is very soothing and relaxed. You see that all these people say, oh, milk's inherently bad. Oh, milk's, someone was telling me earlier, oh, milk is not good for us to eat. It causes dental cavities. And I say, wait a minute, a baby develops his teeth and bones on milk and it's inherently bad? Hello? You know? Raw milk? Natural milk? No. Not possible. I grew all my bone back on my teeth, and I was 22 years old from drinking the raw milk and carrot juice. So you can't tell me that that's a good theory and it has any evidence to it. People have prejudice against drinking milk from an animal, the fluids from an animal. Hell, I love it. I love raw milk. I love the way it makes me feel. So calming and relaxing. So we have the cream and that. Now that cream will feed the brain and nervous system better than any other fat. Relaxes it. It will also feed other parts of the body, but what the body does is, with the use of those 60 varieties of cholesterol, will turn two-thirds of it into butter. So a third is used to feed the brain and the nervous system, and two-thirds is to feed the body. So if we make butter, the liver doesn't have to worry about producing all the bile for that particular kind of cholesterol, because that particular bile is very complicated and it takes a lot of nutrients to break cream down. Cream is the hardest animal fat to digest.

You think that the hardened fat around the heart in an animal would be hard to digest, but it digests just like that. But cream is slow and hard to digest, difficult for most people, unless you've been on the diet a very, very long time, and I'm talking 12 years. So the next is butter. Butter is so easily digested, it only takes a third of the normal cholesterols produced by the third types of, a third of the types of liver, of bile that the liver produces. So butter is better. That will feed everything in the body, even the brain and nervous system, but not thoroughly, like cream will do. And butter is much more utilized throughout the body, everywhere, bones, connective tissue, cartilage, tendons, muscles, everywhere. So if you want to get a fat that you can digest quickly, then I suggest the moisturizing lubrication formula. I think it's on page 146 of the recipe book. And what that is, a combination of egg, butter, lemon... 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you want that in it. You don't need those, but that's the basic ingredients. It's a little honey if you have a little bit of trouble in digestion. But it's lemon, butter, and egg are the main ingredients. All the varieties of fat that you need, along with the egg white, which is protein. You cannot digest fat without protein. But it doesn't take much protein. It only takes 15 to 20% protein to digest fats properly. And that's what you have in an egg, that's what you have in coconuts. You have 80% fat. You have 15% protein and 5% carbohydrate. And as I mentioned before, the USDA said, oh, we need this. We need to eat carbohydrate. We need all this stuff. I met a tribe, took three days to get there by boat, by swimming, by four-wheel drive to get there. I had to swim from one island to another one day, and it was about a mile. I had swum a mile when I was a child to get my shark's license, and it took me four hours to swim a mile. I was sick, you know, but I wanted to do it, and I did it. And I mean, I sometimes just lied there and went like this because I had fat to be able to float easily. But you had to keep moving or else you were disqualified. Sometimes that was my movement only, but they couldn't disqualify me. But this was in ocean water, so swimming was more difficult, currents and waves and stuff like that. So I got there, and it was hard getting to this tribe because the governments don't want you to discover anything. And they told me those tribes, I tried to get a permit, a license, and they told me those tribes would eat me. They were cannibals. They had all kinds of stories. So finally the way I got there was after two weeks of being frustrated, they banned me from renting cars in the Philippines. And Budget was the only one that was a renter there. They called Budget and said, this name pops up, you don't rent a car to him. So I was really angry at that. So I went to a health spa to get a massage. And the receptionist behind a desk twice as big as that was back there, and I noticed her baby in a crib behind her was all white, and she was dark, very dark. Not as dark as you, but dark. But her husband was darker than he is. And I saw in the picture, and this baby is as white as this is white here. And I thought, oh my God, and that baby breathing was, it was five months old. She looked like it had been just born right out of the hospital.

And I thought, she just came from the hospital with her baby, and she's back to work already? That's pretty good health, but that poor baby is unhealthy. So I said, how old's your baby? She said, five months. I said, really? What are you feeding it? She said, oh, the best thing, the hospital put him on powdered milk and water. According to Pottenger's work, the greatest diseases created in those animals was from powdered milk. Fastest way of producing disease was powdered milk. So I said, your baby is terribly anemic. Look how white it is, and I see your husband, and you are very dark. That is not natural. That baby should be black, you know? And here it is, white as a ghost. And she said, oh, the doctors assured me that was the best thing. I said, look at your baby. I said, your baby is exceptionally ill. You don't see other babies in your, you know, in all the Filipinas here, you know, look like that. I said, that is, that baby is very sick. And the grandfather came at that time, her father. And then we got into a discussion, and he says, I know that baby is sick, you know? And we don't, I don't like what the doctors are telling them. So I made a connection on a neighboring island of a dairy there that had just been constructed about six months before. So I got about, I think it was six liters of milk, or five or six liters of milk, and brought that to her. In three days, the baby's color was in. In 24 hours, the color was already coming in. And the baby was active and moving, having bowel movements properly instead of diarrhea or no fecal matter at all. And all the rashes on the baby's bottom disappeared, and the baby was great. So the father of the girl, the mother, the grandfather, said, I come from a tribe way off beyond Mati, and I'll take you there. He said, I'll get permission. I work for the government. He's a liaison between tribes. He couldn't even get it for me. So he said, I'm taking you anyway. So we got a four-wheel drive, and we went, spent a day. Then we got in a boat, spent a day. Then we swam for a day, you know. And we got to this island, remote island. It's a small island, probably, I don't know, less than a mile long, and probably about three quarters of a mile wide. And people on that island lived to 150 years old. That was the oldest.

Normally died between 128 and 138 years old. They lived on two foods. Shoots the hell out of USDA's food pyramid, doesn't it? They ate no cooked foods. They'd use fire for nothing except for solidifying certain things, like cutting tools with the coconut shells. They would sometimes cook those to make them sharper, use them as tools. They ate coconut and raw fish. The men ate a whole coconut a day, the mature coconut meat, and then maybe one, two pounds of fish a day that they caught every day. And the females all ate about a half of a coconut, the meat of a coconut in a day, with the same amount of fish. They were all thick and strong. I was expecting, you know, fish to produce skinny people. They ate pork maybe once in a while when they killed a wild pork on a surrounding island. But that was maybe once a month or once every two months, something like that. But it was fish. They were all thick and healthy. Can you imagine having teeth in your mouth that are healthy with no cavities when you die at 138 years old? I pray for those days, you know. Think about that, two foods. They did eat once in a while a fruit, either mango or banana. And they ate them green. And maybe one a week, one every two weeks, maybe one a month, depending upon the person. But they lived on two foods, coconut and raw fish. So all of the fantasies about out there, what we need is not true for vibrant health, longevity. It's all hogwash. But because we are already so toxic, they're born into a good environment. They only eat raw foods, those foods, all of their lives, and that's all they need. We are very toxic people. We need things like vegetable juice. We need lots of butter, extra fat. We need a lot of different things compared to their diet. But really it's only a few things. And that is some fruit on a daily basis, very little, maybe 5% of the diet only. We need vegetable juice to help clean the system and provide vitamins and enzymes and minerals that we can't get in any other source, and to help neutralize the toxins in the body. And even with cilantro, it helps remove toxins and heavy metals from the body. And all of the additional raw fats.

Now when you get into a hot bath, the hot bath doesn't work alone. We have a chemistry working with it. You have pineapple with coconut cream. Now that's a fat. Coconut cream, coconuts are 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate. Only 7% of the 80% fat is oil. Only 7% is oil. That means that there's a concept, you're never told that there are water-soluble fats. And most of your fats in cream, in milk from cream or cream from milk is only 7% oil. You've got a, you've got, what is it, 73% water-soluble fats. Nobody talks about water-soluble fats because they're very fragile. They stink, they rot quickly, they cause all kinds of unattractive fragrances and appearances. So they don't want you to know about those, how important they are for the body, any animal's body. So they don't talk about them. They're very important. In coconut, it is a fruit fat and it is a very cleansing fat. You can't break it down into, you know, animal tissue easily, but it's a good cleanser in the body. It's one of the best cleansers there is. You can make good esters and other ethyl products from, but healthy organic ones, that can dissolve toxicity, can feed the body and the lymphatic system to help get in there, chemically dissolve some of that waxy and plastic fat. So you've got the heat to soften it so this chemistry can go in and infiltrate it, dissolve it so it doesn't harden as a large substance again. It's a gradual process, daily process, but it works. It's like, you know, you see a rock and you see a big pit in it where the water has washed over it, washed over it for thousands and thousands of years. Well, it takes us many years to do that process, not thousands of years, according to Pottenger and Howell. Forty years. With the baths, maybe 25 years. We can cut 15 years off of it. That's my estimation. Still, I've only been working on it with other people for five years, so we'll see what the long-term effects are. But it looks promising and good, I mean, on an empirical level, not just on a theoretical level because of the changes from the eyes from one year to the next when they've begun doing the hot baths every day or the hot tub baths every day. So the coconut fat is very important.

Another reason that tribe may have stayed so healthy because even though they were in a pristine environment with no pollution anywhere, and they didn't generate any of their own, that they were so healthy so easily. Now the Maasai and the Samburu tribes of Africa, before they had that 11-year drought that devastated their whole sustenance, which was their cows creating raw milk, they lived 65% on raw dairy, 30% on raw meats, and then some other kinds of stuff they made from like squashes and stuff like that. But they never ate fruit, and they lived into their 130s, 140s also. Didn't have dental caries, didn't have disease until with these droughts, now they're accepting care packages that are nothing but denatured toxic cereals with powdered milk. Remember when you give to these agencies, you know, for feeding food to these places, most of these companies, these so-called non-profit companies, were formed by the manufactured food industry to get rid of their waste products and make a profit. So they feed these starving, you know, debilitated people with their byproducts and make a fortune. And sell it for more than they do for the regular stuff on the market that makes it. And it can be highly contaminated and that's one reason they can't sell it. Could be just a carton is bad and the carton was misprinted or damaged and they can't sell it on the regular market, so they take less. But if they have these organizations which are called, you know, philanthropic non-profit organizations, buying this food, sending it over to feed it, they're making fortunes, absolute freaking fortunes. So you have to be very careful. There are some out there where you buy animals and, you know, farm equipment. Those are the ones to donate to because you're creating a farm, not feeding them toxic food. It's going to make them sick and more dependent upon all kinds of other illness, dependent upon their governments for medication and everything for their symptoms. So they, you know, they eat very little food. In fact, the Maasai and the Samburu just ate the meat and the milk. So that's two foods, meat and milk. The Fulani tribes, they lived on 95% raw dairy products and only 5% very, very slowly at low temperature cooked meats. They were cooked in the ground, in the earth, deep. But they were not as healthy as the Samburu and Fulani. In fact, I mean the Samburu and Maasai.

The Maasai, when they were the healthiest, you know, about 40 years ago, were the tallest, strongest, smartest, most fierce tribe in the world. You know, they got up to 8 feet tall. I think the shortest one, the shortest woman is something like 6'7". One of them was a good friend of mine. The actor, Kevin Michael Hall, who was the Predator in The Predator. He's 7'3", 7'2", and he was the shortest in his family. I was working in a health food store at the time, Aunt Tilly's, and this was in 78, and he walked in the door and he had to come in the door like this. Out the store we had all these aisles of food, and we had plants hanging down, so we paid somebody, one of our employees, they had to take every one of them down, water them, and then re-hang them from a ladder. So I said, we've got to have this guy, he can just go up there and take them down. We hired him for that. Wonderful guy though, really wonderful. They killed him with, told him he had AIDS, and he freaked out. Even though he was health-minded, went against everything I told him, and was dead three years later, because he took all the chemotherapy for AIDS. Ridiculous. Great great man. So he was also Harry of, you know, Henderson's and the Sasquatch type character. And he used to be a massage therapist. So you know, huge freaking hands. Can you imagine getting massaged with those hands? I mean, that would be like ten massages in one. And I got two of them from him, and they were great. But he was so busy, you know, I could hardly get a hold of him when I was available. So fats, the coconut cream is very important. Your other fats are also very important. Each one of them does a different thing. Now dairy is a very unusual substance, because it can be used as just a regular growth substance, as fresh raw milk, or it can be used for remedies and for reversal of certain diseases. Butter is very important to reverse many, many skin diseases, bone diseases, along with eating cheese, and cartilage, anything. Butter is so important for the reversal of probably 80% of the diseases out there that are not neurological in nature. The cream soothes the nervous system.

Like I was exposed, I don't know, chemtrails were the thickest I'd ever seen them. I'm up on top of a mountain, 3,000 feet up in Malibu, overlooking the ocean, and they were spraying chemtrails probably only 1,000 feet above me. And I was just like this. I took the raw cream, drank that, got in some water, calmed it just like that. When I had done that earlier in my life and not had those, I would have been just like this for days, weeks.

Q: When you say cream, you mean the dairy cream?

A: Dairy cream, yes. Coconut cream is not soothing like dairy cream is. Coconut cream is mainly a cleanser. It will relax and soothe to a certain extent, but the cream can be used totally to soothe the system without being converted into anything for detoxification, if the body wants that. But with coconut cream, it can't do that. It's going to convert probably 60% into cleansing fats rather than soothing and relaxing fats for the body. So then we have the cheese that we make from milk. Milk, raw milk, never putrefies. It only turns into soured products, which means the bacteria is pre-digesting for you. Even if it's, you know, sour cream or cheeses that stink to high heavens. The Germans, how do you think they got so strong? They eat some of the stinkiest, rottenest cheese in the world. And I mean, it is foul, but it produces some of the strongest, best skinned people in the world. And I've looked at the people who live on that stuff in these villages, and they are the strongest, healthiest people in the world. And they do not, they're satisfied. They're not always hungry for more things. They're just happy being social, doing their little farming. Everything is great. Because of getting the nutrients they need. The cheeses, when they're broken, there's one country, I forgot what it is, they put maggots in the center of their cheese to break it down, and they eat all of the waste of the maggots. Remember, bacteria, we eat the waste of the bacteria in our bodies, and even parasites. So why not letting the worms eat the cheese first, the dairy product, and then you eating their stuff? It is just the same, produces a phenomenal long-lived tribe, village in this country. And they all eat it. And they open up and you see the maggots go all around, and some will eat the maggots along with it, because they're made of the cheese. That's all, it's not a bad thing, they're just cheese maggots, you know? And some will let it air until the maggots all crawl away and just eat the cheese. But it is incredibly pre-digested matter, so it gets into the body and feeds it instantly, like magic. 

Q: Is mold on cheese a bacteria?

A: Mold on cheese is a fungus that does the same thing. Fungus is also part of our cleansing process.

Q: So you can eat it, not scrape it off?

A: Well, you've got all the spores on the fuzz on the outside, those are a lot of spores. Of course, spores will breed lots of mycelium, which can cause a heavy, too heavy detoxification. So just scrape the outside only, the little fuzz on there, the white fuzz, and you can eat the white on the inside, and you eat all the fungus with the cheese, perfect. Same thing as eating the maggots.

Q: Do you eat the maggots?

A: I have.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, they just taste like what they've eaten. When you go to South Africa and other countries, they eat these things. One of my roommates was a Peruvian girl and grew up until the age of 15, she lived in Peru, 10 or 15, somewhere around there. We'd go into a health food store, and I'd watch her shop, and she'd watch me shop, and she would never buy an ear of corn that didn't have a worm in it. Worm meant that it was a good item, and it didn't have chemicals. So she would take the worm first thing and pop it and eat it. That was my first reaction. I had just started eating raw meat, so this was a new trip for me. This was the year after that. She said, just try it. It just tastes like the corn. Sure enough, I ate one. It tasted just like I had chewed the corn. Tasted just like what they ate, and that's what the maggots taste like. It has cream cheese. It tastes like cream cheese. Cream cheese is tasty.

Q: A little crunchy.

A: No. Maggots are soft. There's no crunch to a maggot.

Q: It's a little white mushy thing.

A: Yeah. White mushy thing. Now, in Thailand and throughout Asia, they eat beetles, they eat these huge cockroaches, and they eat scorpions, they eat all that. Of course, I've eaten raw scorpions and raw tarantulas, break off the poison gland, and that was hard to do, but I was so hungry living in a desert that I had to eat something, so I ate those. But when I don't have to eat things like that, I don't. I still have trouble, and I shouldn't, but I'm squeamish still, a little. But I'll eat them if I have no other food, and I guarantee I have no qualms about eating them. But they're not something I dream about. I've met lots of Thais who dream about to eat the beetles every day raw that are on my diet.

Q: What do you dream about?

A: Pardon?

Q: We all have food dreams. What are yours?

A: Food dreams? Sherry's cheesecakes. Not the brownies. Yeah, her strawberry shortcake. Yeah, that was what I had last night. But then when I have them for a week, I don't want them anymore till I come here again, you know. But in sauces, you know, I dream, my dream is drinking milk, and sucking down cream, and having maybe ice cream once in a while, you know, that's barely firm, you know. It's still in the dairy queen appearance, you know, not solid frozen. Yeah, softer. I've consumed up to a gallon a day for, I've done it no more than six weeks at a time. I did more sleeping and relaxing, but it didn't cause any disease. No, I have several elderly women who only drink raw milk. They won't eat the raw milk. They won't eat fruit. They live on the raw milk, and they're doing very well. One's in their late eighties, and one's in their mid-nineties. 

Q: Just not more than two ounces at one time?

A: Pardon?

Q: Just not more than two ounces at one time?

A: No, they're consuming probably four ounces at a time.

Q: No, but like, sip-wise, really? I thought you were supposed to do that, because it...

A: Well, they don't eat anything else, so their body's digesting it better that way. But I suggest that people sip only two ounces at a time. You know, two ounces, let's say, every three, four minutes, if you want. You can consume a lot of milk in a day by doing that. But just give your body time to utilize it. Remember, your milk comes refrigerated. You know, right out of the cow. I can drink a quart right out of the cow and have no problems. Warm right out of the cow. But when it's cold, there's interference with digestion. Destroys a lot of bacteria and alters nutrients. So cheeses have other benefits to getting well. Cheeses are dried substances that lack enzymes. Talking like raw milk is alive. It is. So I'll say who instead of that. So cheese is a dehydrated substance where there's no active enzymes. Less active enzymes means less utilization of vitamins and proteins, carbohydrates and fats. We need enzymes to do that. But cheese is a magnificent concentration of minerals that is accompanied with fats that are able, that are like butter fats, are able to utilize to make those concentrated minerals as if it were a mineral supplement. All you have to do is add a tiny bit of honey to the cheese. It becomes your mineral supplement. One little inch by inch square of cheese will be equivalent to what your body could absorb of one whole bottle of mineral, rock minerals that people take as a mineral supplement. All you have to do is add a tiny bit of honey. The honey provides the enzymes to utilize it in that way. Now honey is an interesting thing, interesting food. The bees go around sucking up the nectar, they swallow it as they fly, they pre-digest or they gather more and more, they pre-digest it and they produce an insulin-like substance which converts most of the, like 90% of the carbohydrate into enzymes for digestive activity. And also be converted into a food to develop themselves and maintain themselves and to feed their young, the larva, until it becomes a bee and then it feeds on select varieties of honey for that.

So they have a variety that they produce. When they get back to the hive, they vomit. That's honey. It goes from nectar, a pre-digested substance, to a vomit. That's what honey is. It is pre-digested by the bees. Nectar from flowers. So it's bee vomit. Change your idea about honey anymore? Good. Delicious stuff. And anyway, because of that conversion, it helps you digest. People who have digestive, don't produce digestive acids well, digestive juices, not bacteria because it's slightly antibacterial. But you eat that honey and it helps the body make the digestive juices like hydrochloric acid and bile to digest the proteins and the fats. It's a great aid for that. And the bacteria is just a matter of producing, you know, small molecules of food for them to feed and eat in good quality, of course. So, now what else can we do with that cheese? Phenomenal thing I came on in the last year, experimented with, started experimenting with about four years ago, is remember I talked about all those poisons stored in the stomach lining, mainly from vaccines and medications that dump? Eat a little piece of cheese every 15 to 30 minutes, every hour, once every hour, and it'll collect those substances. As long as you don't eat honey with it, it'll pass out. The body will not digest raw, no salt cheese, unless it has honey with it. Or you eat like pineapple with it, something like that. Or papaya. So, eat the cheese with none of those substances. Better to stay away from fruit when you're eating cheese if you want it to absorb poisons. So, before you eat, also, every 10 minutes before you eat, eat like half a teaspoon to a teaspoon. A little sugar cube size, one or two sizes of that of cheese, to absorb those poisons. It will pass out in your feces. And then, 10 minutes after that, you eat your meal. It will not be contaminated. You have 25 minutes after that before the stomach will start dumping poisons again into the food. If that's the case, eat a piece of cheese, wait 10 minutes again. What happens is, when the body receives food, it starts dumping its fluids from the stomach into it. And, of course, those poisons go with the fluids. And it'll do that as long as you're eating. But once you stop eating, 10 minutes after it stops.

So, if you eat the cheese, do it for about 10 minutes, and then it stops, and all the cheese has absorbed all those poisons. Then you eat, and the body doesn't secrete any more of the poisons into it, only the digestive juices. Why at that point? Probably because there was so much ready to be dumped, and it was dumped in 10 minutes, didn't need to dump any more, just the juices by themselves. So, you have to, but after 25 minutes, it starts dumping them again. So, you have to stop eating your meal, and go back to eating a little cheese, and then wait 10 minutes again, and finish your meal. The amazing results that I've had with that are pretty astounding. And I use those with people that I've used on a large body of people, like about 30, now still 32 in the group, who are doing the cheese without doing the baths, because I want to see what the difference is. People are using baths, and people are using cheese. The results are probably half of what baths do, but it's still a huge, huge movement in a faster direction to have all those poisons absorbed. And you have them in your intestinal lining, too, all the way through. So, if you have this train of cheese going in every so many minutes, they're always absorbing the poison and through. Now, when you want the minerals from the cheese and have honey with it, I suggest it's after a meat meal, about 35, 30, 35 minutes after your meat meal, where you're not dumping a lot of toxins. You're just digesting your meat. And that's the time to add the extra minerals and fat with the honey to help digest it. And I find that that degree brings much more strength. Now, let's say you have a great deal of pain and you have osteoporosis, you know, deterioration of the bones. I've taken people with that condition, mostly women, especially going through menopause, and had them eat about a tablespoon of cheese every hour, besides the other cheese taken to absorb the poisons, with some honey.

And within a year, 80% of that osteoporosis is reversed. That's remarkable. Because before I did that, the slower process of it, it would take maybe 2% a year improvement. So big, big difference to go to 80 a year. Other people who have, you know, very weak teeth, very sore gums, painful joints, also eat a lot of cheese with a little bit of honey. Now the ratio is anywhere from 6 to 1. It could even be 3 to 1. 3 to 6, even 12 of cheese to 1 to 1 part honey. So let's say the highest ratio would be 3 tablespoons of cheese to 1 tablespoon of honey. An extreme change of that would be 1 in 12, you'd have 3 tablespoons of cheese, 1 teaspoon of honey. You have to find the amount that works for you. And if you're just getting on the diet, let me tell you, 1 to 3 ratio is good for about a year. Then 1 to 6 ratio for many, many years out beyond that. With me, it's about, you know, 3 tablespoons of cheese to 1 teaspoon of honey. And I handle it the best that way now. But I've been on a raw diet for a very, very long time. And on a primal diet for about 28 years. So find your ground. Find your way. I can usually, if I do your eyes, I can usually give you, I'll know what your ratio is pretty close. And you can tweak it from there on your own. Sometimes I've even used cheese when I didn't, when I was in a desert one time. And I had no cloth. And I didn't want to use sand on a wound, wound that I got because I slipped. I'm not real coordinated and never been. My hamstrings never developed from all the vaccines that I got as a child. So my hamstrings going from my lower back to my knees are very short. So I can't stretch. You know, I can't bend over easily. And it takes somebody to push me over because they're that tight. They never developed. So I'm not real coordinated and I try to mountain climb and do all kinds of crazy things. So I have to go much slower than other people. And sometimes I'll still, you know, because I'm expecting to be able to step higher than I can. And I don't make it and I'll slip and hurt myself. 

So I had no bandage to put on and I didn't want to put sand on it. Sand isn't like dirt if I had dirt, I'd immediately put the dirt on it. I found out later sand would have been okay but, you know, I've done sand before and some of those particles get into the wound and they, it takes a while for them to come out. And it's a little bit more scarring than it is with dirt, especially stinky black dirt. Heals it faster. And so I put cheese on the wound and it worked. It was very good. So I try everything. You know, I, ever since I had chemotherapy, I've got a bald spot. You know, I lost all my hair. I just had strands of hair here and there. My hair grew back. It never grew back here. So you can see that patch there. So that's been there since I was 21 years old. But I usually kept very long hair to cover it. And nobody noticed. Now I keep my hair shorter so everybody notices. Unless they're not taller than me. If they're taller than me, they don't notice. They notice. Not as tall as I am. They never notice. So I've tried everything. You can read in my book the different things I've tried. Garlic, you know, eggs, olive oil, everything. And all those things help. Just in the last year and a half I started just putting milk on it. And all of a sudden my hair is thicker. Like in six months. Doubled the thickness in those places where I was losing hair. Stopped losing the hair. Even growing a little bit more. Just from plain milk. So food is your medicine. I mean, I've had, I've been in situations where I bruised and hurt myself or been attacked or whatever. And I use whatever food I have to apply to my body. And it always helps. I mean, not hot peppers. I won't put hot peppers on it. I mean, that's a little bizarre. Maybe some people could and would and it might help. But I've tried it and it hurts. It burns severely. So I don't do that. I know that there are some people who do. When I had those lesions come out of my leg. Filipinos, native Filipinos had this mixture of herbs that they mashed in together into a polstice and I let them put it on one of the wounds. It made the wound twice as bad within 24 hours.

So I removed it, put my honey on it, coconut cream and meat over that. Wrapped raw slices of, thin slices of raw meat. Then a damp cloth over that so the meat wouldn't dry out. Oh, I also put butter on top of the meat and then maybe if I used a band-aid I'd put the butter on top of the band-aid too so the meat wouldn't stick to it. So the meat would stay moist so I could keep it for two days without having to change the meat until it got a little stinky. People were saying, where did that odor come from? It was like fresh rotten meat. 

Q: Put a saran wrap just over the top of the meat?

A: No, I never use saran wrap. That is highly toxic. Use plastic bags, you know, like produce bags. You cut a piece. Put it only over the rag. Just over the meat part, not touching your skin. Right. You can put the rag beyond the meat. The damp rag goes first. First the butter on top of the meat or on the cloth that's damp. Then that over, and it can be touching your skin. But then the plastic only covers the cloth, never touches your skin. Then you wrap like an ace bandage around that or a bandaid to keep it on. Like here, I got some new knives, new cutco knives. And I decided to try the slicing knife instead of the meat knife, you know, on some steak to cut it up. And I sliced all the way down this long and about that deep. And it was a week ago. And you see how little there is left. And the bandage fell off yesterday. And I only changed it once. And what I did was I put a tiny bit of honey on there. I put a little bit of butter, put meat on top of that, butter on top of the meat and the bandage, the Band-Aid. Got it, the Band-Aid wet. And then wrapped that on. And then kept putting good drinking water on the gauze that was in the, and I got that type of Band-Aid that was gauze, cotton gauze. And then just kept it wet. I would wet it maybe once every five hours to keep it wet, keep it moist, so the meat wouldn't dry out. And you can see it grew back up until, and that was just a week ago, seven days ago. And I mean, that was deep all the way down. And that hole in there was huge. 

Q: I flipped over my handlebars in my room back down in Florida and I did it to the whole side of my leg and I had a big gash in that raw meat and it healed completely. I have no scar.

A: Yeah, yeah. Works that way. A fellow who was in a truck accident flipped over on the freeway and he went over to the passenger side, took all the skin off of his arm. And I mean all of the skin off of one side of his arm here, about a fourth of his arm. And he put the meat, you know, the honey and the lime juice first. The lime juice helps harness toxins. And, you know, where your body will use white blood cells to gather, they call infection, to gather an area to pull the toxins out to neutralize them so they don't damage your tissues, your cells. So the lime juice will encapsulate those so the body doesn't have to use white blood cells to worry about them and spend white blood cells on that. And they'll pop out through the skin for the next year and just peel them off. It's the wildest thing in the world. Women won't do it, only lime. So I had him put lime on it first to make sure the particles were surrounded so he wouldn't have infection. And then he put the meat over it. Twelve days, all of the skin was replaced. Twelve days. Renee, she's a woman who makes coconut cream and I guess she got a little tired and her finger went into the grinder and took off this much of the finger. Bone and all. All to the joint. To the joint. The joint wasn't gone, to the joint. And I had her put the lime juice and the honey and some coconut cream and then the meat on it. And I, you can get pictures of it, it's on one of my newsletters. 2006 was it? Seven? Somewhere around there. And you can see her finger. We watched it grow back. Grew back. Nail everything. And the pictures are there for the proof of it. 56 years old. 

Q: And only on the diet for a year.

A: Yeah, only on the diet for a year. So, food, you can feed your body on the outside as well as in. I remember when Adele Davis was big in the 60s and 70s, she had a patient or she was helping a person who was suffering. Couldn't eat. She kept applying food to his neck. And he was able to get healthier and better because his neck was absorbing the food. And that made me realize, yeah, of course the body's alive everywhere. We have cells that can eat anything. And of course you apply, you know, you... Cleopatra used to take milk baths. Can you imagine bathing in a bath of pure milk? What an ecstasy that would be. That was extravagance. I wonder who drank it after her. And I mean, you know, look what it did for the skin and everything. And don't doing for my hair and scalp. So I mean, it's phenomenal. Food can be digested almost anywhere. Only thing that there's a problem with that I found a consistent problem with is putting honey on the skin too much for too long. Blocks the skin from being able to absorb oxygen. And it will call like I put it on my face a couple of times when I thought about vanity. And because I was detoxing through the face and I woke up, I awakened probably three hours later. Couldn't breathe. Anxious. Skin felt, you know, claustrophobic and irritated. And several people have told me that they've done the same thing. So honey is the only thing that you have to put on very thinly if you're going to do that. Very diluted like in milk or something like that. Or touch with honey and butter is okay, but that will still smother the skin a bit. Depending upon how thickly you put it. If you put it on thinly and your body absorbs it, it's done. But a lot of people like think they need to put something thick on, like a face mask. And I've tried all types. It's better to put thin. Thin more frequently than one big, you know, kind. I'm not vain, so I only do something for my skin, do something like that a couple times a year. And that's it. But I do now shave with milk. I used to shave with coconut cream. Sometimes I use butter, but with the butter I still cut myself. And dairy cream I'd still cut myself. Coconut cream I never cut myself, but it's so hard to clean it out of the razor. You know, you really need hot water.

And when you're in the tropics, there's no such thing as hot water unless you're in a hotel. No home has hot water. Why do you have hot water in a hot climate? Everybody wants cool water. So, you know, it's hard to clean the razor, you know, out there in the wild when you're using coconut cream. So I experimented with milk, because that's all I had. No more coconut cream. So I used milk to shave with. No cutting, and it was the easiest, and it's easy to clean even with cold water out of the razor. So I thought, oh, another leap, you know, another new experience. So that's what I use now.

Q: Does it work on your legs too?

A: Yes, absolutely. Yeah, work anywhere. Yeah. I've tried it on my arms just to see how it would work. Go around with no hair on certain patches. Aajonus, your diet isn't very good for you. People won't want to find something wrong all the time with my diet, you know. 

Q: I wanted to ask you about if you're using a hot tub and it's somebody else's, what do you think about the chlorine if it's a public hot tub?

A: Well, when I've used a public hot tub like that with chlorine, I take two cups of vinegar, raw and pasteurized apple cider vinegar, and I will throw it in there when nobody's looking or I sneak it in there with a towel and I'll get in and I'll sit on the edge and all my legs get in and I'll dump it in, you know, underneath the towel and I drip it out a little at a time and then I leave for about 20 minutes because all the chloroform vapor is still very toxic in the air. I'll leave for about 20, 30 minutes, return and then I can take a hike back. That's the way you can sneak that in. Yeah, go work out and come back.

Q: The chlorine is pretty toxic.

A: Oh, it's very toxic. Chloroform is the worst. That's why swimmers have so much asthma and even get emphysema in their later years. Well, yeah, the chloroform just breathing it damages their lungs, their eyes, their brains, everything. Bronchial, esophagus, throat, ear aches all the time. Yeah, yeah. Just do my trick. Put the vinegar in. You can even put a little raw milk, but that's seeable. You need to change?

Q: No, your buzzer went off.

A: It's been an hour and 45 minutes already. We better take our last break now.

[break]

A: ...mine, and that's oil. And I talked a little bit about oil. Just mentioned what percentage of a plant or coconut in plants. There's only about 7% oil in leaves. When you extract an oil from a plant or a seed, it's only 7% of that item. Not more. When you extract an oil out of a substance, it is highly cleansing. It is not soothing. If you want an example of a fat like olive oil, which is highly acidic, take a look at your Italians and Greeks. Very passionate, very volatile creatures. They're magicians. They know how to make you [unintelligible]. That does go in with the nature of what they eat. Because it shuts off certain brain activity, certain consciousness, conscience, conscientiousness, and end up a lot of things are okay that really may not really be if you're in a healthful situation, healthful state. They have a lot more passion, and they call it passion, instead of irritability, internal irritability, and that's really what it is. And olive oil will do that. Any oil will do that, but olive oil especially because it's highly acidic. Also, it comes from a substance that's highly poisonous in its raw state. Olives are poisonous. They have to be treated with, got this, strychnine. That enzyme in them is treated with strychnine. What they do is run the olives over these needles, and they're very fine needles, and they scratch. They roll them over, and it scratches the entire surface of the olives. Then they spray diluted in water, distilled water, strychnine in it. So that kills that particular enzyme that can cause you to get very sick. Or they pick them black. When they've reached their highest maturity stage, it's gotten rid of that enzyme. But all of your green olives had to have been treated with strychnine. Only your black olives will not be naturally poisonous. And all of your olive oil is squeezed from green olives.

Q: So no more olive oil anymore?

A: Well, if you can get it stone pressed. And when they do it in the granite, when they use a wheel, a stone press, the way it's oxygenated, it destroys that enzyme. But when it's hydraulically pressed or spin pressed, it's not the same. It can cause irritability, deterioration of your nervous system. Stone press is okay, even if it's made from green. But you'll see olive oils that are slightly amber, that's squeezed, pressed from dark olives, ripe olives. And that's okay. But most of your olive oil is from green olives that have been treated with strychnine before they're pressed. What do you think that's going to do to the nervous system? I'd be out killing people too. I'd be out being a mafia guy too. And there's nobody that consumes more olive oil than the Italian community. It's amazing how much they consume. The Greeks do it, but usually the Greeks do it from dark olives. Almost all of their oil is from dark olives. 

Q: Strychnine you're saying they're using?

A: Yeah.

Q: They don't use formaldehyde?

A: No, strychnine. Formaldehyde would be too, it would, they have too much flavor and smell. They use strychnine, which is almost odorless. It's mixed with water. It gives and does its damage to that enzyme that's poisonous. But then you're getting the strychnine with the olive, and a lot of it that's dangerous. So it's either the high acidic and strychnine toxic olive oil, or your dark olive oil. Dark olive oil is okay. Still acidic, and it's still too much of it will cause too much detoxification and make you irritable. Olive oil is not soothing. No other oil is soothing, except for coconut oil, and it's only 25 to 30% soothing. The rest is completely detoxification. So oils can be used to help you eliminate. One of the most frequent uses that I agree with those oils is like taking olive oil or coconut oil and swirling it around in your mouth. It's called oil pulling, and it helps pull poisons out of your brain. And then you expectorate it. You don't swallow it. The only reason I agree with this is because I did it a few times and sent the oil before, you know, some of the same oil, I sent it to the laboratory with the swirled-in-my-mouth discarded oil, and the concentration of toxins was very high in that that I had swirled around in my mouth that weren't in the olive oil, the same olive oil that I swished in my mouth. I used both. The problem with the olive oil is it made my mouth sore because of the acidity of it. Yeah, but I mean, if you did it often, every day it might cause soreness in your gums and in your tissues. Coconut oil, you can do it every day forever and it wouldn't hurt you. It's not acidic. It's alkalinizing. I mean, coconut oil, no coconut oil. You can use coconut cream the same way, but you can use coconut oil as a puller also.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: An abscess always comes from the gums. It's not really an abscessed tooth. It's the toxins leaving the gum that are irritating the gum that are coming from the brain. Your brain detoxes through the eye tear ducts, but mainly the gums, sometimes the mucous membranes here in the sinuses, but the gums, the tongue, and the salivary glands. Highly toxic. Again, eating cheese helps control that and doesn't get as much into the food when you eat cheese frequently. 

Q: How long do you do it? 

A: People do it, you know, if your mouth fills up to a great amount, it means you've dumped a lot of saliva, so you may have to spit a little bit out and keep it going. I know people do it for 30 minutes. I do it 10 minutes maximum.

Q: I did it 30 minutes. There's a website on that, oil-pulling.com. That's where I learned about it.

A: But yeah, I experimented with that after I lost the bone around my teeth, and I always had inflammation and bleeding. My gums were always sore from the chemotherapy. The radiation deteriorated the bone, but the chemotherapy gave me sores all over. My tongue blistered and bled. I noticed that when I mixed raw milk in my mouth, that soothed my mouth. At the time, they had a cod liver oil, which was pure, like the Green Pastures is now, the non-flavored one. But it stinks and it burns, and it's very bitter. And that's the fermented kind. This was fermented a different way, so it wasn't as acidic. And I'd mix that around. And I felt the difference for hours. You know, there was removing the chemotherapy from the area and all the other poisons. And then, you know, maybe 12 hours later, I'd have to do it again, 10, 15, 20 minutes to clear all that out. So, there are different ways you can do it, but I've tried it with milk, and it does pull a lot of the substances out. But my greatest concentration has always been found in oils or coconut cream. And milk doesn't discharge it. Body doesn't use it to discharge into milk as much, because there's not as much fat in milk. So body probably just doesn't want to release as many toxins into the milk, because it may cause more mouth damage. There's no other oils. I mean, there's no other oils than those that could be cold-pressed. Like I said, the olive oil of the stone-pressed is the best, and the only one that I ever use. I don't buy an olive oil that isn't stone-pressed. I won't use or take an olive oil that isn't stone-pressed. It's hard to find a stone-pressed olive oil these days. Everybody wants to do it fast with machinery. And stone rolling over the olives and then having to filter it is a slow process.

Q: What brand do you use?

A: I use Oliflix. O-L-I-F-L-I-X. No, it's not the only one. Any of your dark olive oils are not going to have the strychnine in it. Your amber, any that's green, going to have strychnine in it. So talk about proteins. Now, I was a vegetarian for six and a half years in my quest. And that was it. I left the raw milk and the raw cheese and all that on a raw fruitarian diet to be the ultimate as I was brainwashed to believe. And the highest spiritual attainment, not eating flesh food, not eating animal meat, not having to kill anything. I bought all that crap and I did it seriously and religiously for six and a half years and ended up with bone cancer again with my teeth falling out and my teeth rotting. And, you know, a fruitarian diet, we're not built to eat a fruitarian diet. And we can take a look at the monkeys that eat that are fruitarians. You ever see a calm monkey that wasn't masturbating all day? There you go. There's no such thing as a calm monkey, you know. And the killer monkeys, they wait until the figs and bananas are fermented and then they eat those and they will gorge for about 48 hours and then they go around killing everything in their path. They will kill elephants, they will kill insects, they kill other monkeys and they just go on a rampage for 24 hours. And they just kill, kill, kill until all the alcohol's spent and then they go back to eating small amounts of non-fermented. But they do that like every six months, killer monkeys. So, that is a choice. I was always irritable and angry at people for eating meats, killing animals and, you know. How can you think right on that kind of a diet when the sugar's always melting away your brain cells and dissolving all the minerals in your body, you know. Dissolved my teeth, gave me blood and bone cancer again. So, not a good diet. We can't get proteins and fats that way. We are not designed, nor are monkeys designed to do that. And the gorillas are different. They eat unripe bananas when they eat it. They eat some leaves. But when they eat, they'll kill like once every 28 days. It's like having their period. They'll go and they'll slaughter an antelope or some other animal and they'll eat 14 to 28 pounds in 48 hours.

So, they never see these gorillas eating animals unless they hang around for that cycle. And most people don't do that. They don't hang around the animals. And that one day where they go off for the kill, they're gone from the regular grazing area where they're doing this so people never see it. So, they have no idea that that goes on. But can you imagine eating 14 to 28 pounds in 48 hours of meat? I mean, but look at a gorilla. Really strong creatures. And so are the hyperactive monkeys, very strong creatures, but still they're eating raw. So, there's an advantage there, although it's not the proper diet for nice behavior, acceptable social behavior. And they're fighting and they're always yacking at one another and you can rarely see them in a cage together without fighting unless there's a lot of space. And maybe you can have two in a cage, even if it's a big cage, because they'll be fighting all the time. Masturbating and fighting. Men and women, masturbating and fighting. All day long in the monkey cages. So, if you want that kind of behavior, if you want to feel that way inside, like you want to do that, not do it, be a fruitarian. Otherwise, it's not a good thing to do. And, you know, a lot of people say, well, you can eat nuts and you can eat grains, even though you have to cook them or germinate them. Not true. We are not designed to digest nuts. Squirrels are. Birds are. They're designed to eat seeds and nuts. But we aren't. In the nut, when I've had feces from a nut eater, when I used to eat, when I was a fruitarian, I'd eat seven pounds of nuts a day to get my protein because I was so hungry. I lived outdoors for three years in my healing process to discover what was really truth and not, because I knew that all the crap that we have in our libraries and on TV is all nonsense. You've got all these people who go to school to learn nutrition, and what they learn is not science. It's garbage spit out by the medical industry, the pharmaceutical industry, and the agriculture and food business industry.

They want you to believe that's what nutrition is. And these vitamin supplements, there's your magic bullet, right? All of them have kerosene. Every one, even the best ones. In order to extract a substance out of a food, even if they say it's from food, you need a solvent to separate it, and then a way to attract it and isolate it. And that takes various forms of kerosene. That's for the natural ones. The unnatural vitamins will use ethyl alcohol and petroleum products, which are even more toxic. But kerosene isn't far behind. It's a highly toxic substance. But like I said, would you soak your food for 10 to 22 hours in kerosene, and then rinse it for two minutes and eat it? That's what you do with any supplement. Every supplement. There's not one supplement that isn't manufactured that way naturally. And if they say organic, it means maybe the food was grown organic, but once it got to the laboratory, it has to be handled in that way. I had a very famous organic vitamin producer call me about a year ago, year and a half ago. And two of their biggest salespeople were in my workshop. They went and reported it. The company's attorneys called me and said, you have to retract that. You have to pay for it being published and all that. And I said, what do you want me to retract? The fact that it's not organic, that the substance isn't organic, and it's not natural. And I said, okay. I will do that if you send me a letter saying that your laboratory doesn't use kerosene or kerosene derivatives to extract the product from your organic food. Guess what? Never heard from them again. I know. I've worked with laboratories. I've had laboratory technicians on my diet and on this diet. And as my patients. They said, I had one who was 58 years, ran in charge of major laboratories that produced all types of things, pharmaceuticals. And he said, there's no way. You either use kerosene for the natural ones and you use ethyl alcohol or petroleum products for the others. There is no other way. Period.

Q: So there's no benefit?

A: There's toxic benefit. You'll get your adrenaline going, you know, because you're putting toxicity in your body and your adrenaline will make you feel high. So most people get a false high and think it's the vitamins working properly. When it's poisoning them and causing an adrenaline rush. So no supplement is good. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Do you know what it costs to sun dry it? And then to granulate it? No, they have to dry it with high temperatures. That means it turns into a vegetable you will never digest. The only one, but that's not a, but when you get chlorella, chlorella is not a supplement. Chlorella drives in the air just like that. Now, chlorella's an okay, but it's a food. You're not going to digest much of it, that's why you have green, you have a teaspoon of it and you're going to have green feces. You're only going to digest 2 to 4% of it, but that 2 or 4% could mean a benefit to you. But what you can do is you can take it and put it in vegetable juice with a tiny bit of honey in it and let it sit in your refrigerator for 10 hours or put it in all of your vegetable juices and let it sit until you're ready to use it, then take it out and let it sit out and get room temperature before you drink it, then you're going to digest maybe 10% of it. And that's it.

Q: Didn't you say that the chlorella and the cilantro is actually good for getting rid of the heavy metals?

A: Yes.

Q: Cilantro.

A: Yeah. Cilantro. Cilantro, but you have to juice cilantro.

Q: Oh, you can't juice.

A: You can't juice chlorella.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, in a tablet, you won't digest any of it. The sealers and binders that keep making it into a pellet, you can't utilize it. Powder, okay. But any of your algae, all of those, they're dried. They're hard, dried vegetables. You can't even break it down when it's fresh. What makes you think you're going to break it down when it's dried and hard? Takes a vegetarian animal to do that, I mean, an herbivore. Use juice, fresh vegetables. As I said before, that'll help you clean. Now in my book, I tell you what the different foods do, what they're good for you. Now the protein, you can't get them from nuts, you can't get them from grains, you can't get them from anything other than meats and dairy. And dairy is not high in protein. It's enough to build a baby fast, but that baby, about four years old, starts requiring other protein to be able to develop muscles. You know that most children, when they grow up on milk, they're good and fat, plump. You've got lots of protection, and then when they start eating meat, all of a sudden their muscles start popping out and developing. So you need meats to develop more solid and large muscles, and the heart is almost all muscle and so is the liver. So just to feed those two organs, you need meats. Flesh food of any type is meat. I call meat any flesh food, whether it's fish, seafood like shellfish, ocean organisms, shellfish, four-legged animals. All four-legged animals I put in the red meat category, even pork, rabbit, all of them in the red meat category. Pork with its nature is almost in between, but still not. And all of the animals who are two-legged or no-legged, like fish, are all in the white meat category. So when you read that in the book, it is a misnomer because you can have ostrich with two legs, that the meat is darker than liver or as dark as liver, and still isn't red meat by definition of what I'm categorizing. So when I say in the book, red meat, it doesn't mean red in color. Tuna's red. Still I don't mean red in color. White is a particular meat that will operate in a certain way. Red will operate in another way or function in your body to just be utilized in a different way.

So that information is in the book, so I won't go over that. Now the 5% carbohydrate, some people, because they're so toxic, and let's say people who are overweight, could use up to 10% carbohydrate. But let that be consumed in only one meal. And that should be in the afternoon. Now in my recipe book on page 40 and 41, I give suggested diet patterns of eating. Add to that the cheese that you're going to nibble every 15, 20, 30, or 60 minutes. And then follow mainly that diet. Your fruit is always eaten in the afternoon, preferably. If you start off with high carbohydrate in the morning, your brain and nervous system isn't going to function as calmly, and as focused, or as alert. You can see that in children right away. You give them a sugar meal in the morning, like cereal, and you'll find they'll function okay for an hour, an hour and a half. And then in their classroom, they start descending in focus, and accomplishment, and memory. If you feed the child a milkshake with lots of eggs in it, or feed them a meat meal, they are focused all day long, as long as they don't get sugar or sugar product until about noon. So the body builds, normally, the body builds all of its glucose in the first six hours of your waking day. And then the rest of the day, it uses that glucose. So whatever you eat is how the body's going to build that glucose. Is it going to build it from a carbohydrate, or is it going to build it from a protein, with the help of fat? So if you eat sugar, you're going to have a high carbohydrate reactive glucose that has a lot of advanced glycation end product, byproduct. Columbia University in New York City found that the glycogen, the advanced glycation end product, they call it AGE, advanced glycation end product, AGE will age you. And it stores it in the body at a rate of 70 to 90%. 70 in a healthy person and 90% in a person who has kidney problems or diabetes. That is a waste product that causes aging and deterioration of the body. So how do we eat to feed, to force our body to make glycogen with pyruvate?

Pyruvate is a sugar made from protein that has very little waste product. No AGEs, no advanced glycation end products as a byproduct. So you eat eggs, you eat milk, and you eat meat in your first six hours of the day. Honey is okay as long as it's not in abundance because 90% of that is enzymes the body uses for digestion. So not a problem. So then you have your fruit meal in the afternoon after 12. Let's say you have pain and you need a little bit of banana in your milkshake or your moisturizing lubrication formula to get rid of the pain. Banana at that time is fine. Or banana butter and cheese will also help that factor of pain, reducing pain. Or you go find my pain formula in the book. And that's just the moisturizing formula, moisturizing lubrication formula with egg, lemon and butter as the main ingredients. Then you add bee pollen to that, blend that and eat cheese as you're drinking it. And that's the advanced pain formula. But a pain formula can, you can get rid of pain, many kinds of pain in other ways. Eating honey and cheese together, dates and cheese together, butter, dates and cheese together, cheese and banana, cheese butter and banana, butter and banana. There are many ways you can reduce pain. But the one that I found reduces the most pain for the longest is the moisturizing lubrication formula with bee pollen in it and eating cheese while you're drinking it. Now there's one formula so that everybody's okay with the fruit you eat in the afternoon. Always eat it with a fat or 95% of the time you eat it with a fat. Coconut cream, like I said, is the most detoxifier. We need some of that fruit not only for the enzymes but for the alcohol that our bodies will produce as we ferment the carbohydrates from the fruit juices. And that helps blend with the fats to make solvents to help the lymph system dissolve compounds and the rest of the body to clean itself out of impactations, crystals, minerals that have developed anywhere in the body.

So we need that fat, especially coconut cream, with the fruit meal. But because it causes always detoxification, you always want to protect the nerves and put some kind of animal fat in there. So let's say we have a larger individual using a cup of pineapple and a smaller person using a half a cup of pineapple. You eat three to six tablespoons of coconut cream. If you got half a cup, you're using two to three tablespoons of coconut cream. Whole cup, it may be four to six tablespoons of coconut cream. You want to add butter or dairy cream with that to make sure you've protected your cells. If you're going to use a dairy cream and you're having a half, use one to one and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. Using a whole cup, one and a half to three tablespoons of dairy cream with it. Or you use a teaspoon of butter with a half a cup of the pineapple and coconut cream and you use a whole tablespoon of butter with a whole cup of pineapple. Or any other fruit, you do it the same way. Now if you have digestive problems in general and you're eating all the foods that I recommend and they're just not moving through the body, you're not digesting well, you can take a little inch cube of pineapple and eat one four times a day. By itself, that's okay. Or with a little sip of cream, a half a teaspoon of cream, that's okay. You're going to deliver enzymes that will help your stomach and the rest and the intestines manufacture hydrochloric acid and other digestive enzymes which break down the larger particles of food. Now in the book I talk about berries that help remove heavy metals out of the body, the different berries. So you just look in there and see what you need for your condition. And your conditions will change. Get a headache, use honey and lemon and sparkling water with a little dairy cream or coconut cream to help get rid of headaches. And then the next day you've got a backache and you use cheese and butter and banana. Just find the things that are in there that are more your conditions that you go in and out of and then you'll get better. Don't stick on the exact same thing if your symptoms change. Foods will react in different ways in everybody.

Now we need to talk about the, oh, as far as quantity of meat, usually a pound is best. Pound a day for anybody. If you're drinking a lot more milk, then you can reduce that, but still you're not going to have the muscle strength or texture unless you're eating enough meats.

Q: Eggs?

A: No, eggs are an interesting creature. They will maintain what exists, but they don't help you regenerate anything. And that takes, you know, meats and some dairy will do it. Not much dairy, but some dairy. If you get dairy right out of a cow, it's going to help you generate, regenerate tissue, but not muscle, mainly glands and organs, bones and stuff like that. But the muscles need meat, period. And that means your heart and liver, you know, very important organs in the body. Okay, now, I didn't talk about all the cleansers of the body, and cleansers of the body are bacteria, parasites and fungus. Lastly, virus. Now the first three are alive. Bacteria is alive, parasites are alive, fungi are alive. Virus, they want you to believe it's alive because they're selling more drugs by scaring you. Oh, your virus are multiplying, they're reactive, and all this stuff. Anytime you look at a solution that they're calling a virus created this murk of waste dead tissue that is in all this liquid form that's dissolved, they're calling that virus. And it is virus, but you have to understand virus is a solvent that the body has used to clean the body because it's so toxic that parasites, your first and best, your bacteria and your fungi are poisoned if they eat that tissue. Now when the parasites eat dead cells and waste product of dead cells, they can eat 100 times their weight in 24 hours and excrete only 1 to 5 percent of it. You've taken a massive amount of waste product, toxicity, and you reduce it from 100 percent to 1 to 5 percent. I want that janitor, give me that janitor, give me a parasite, I want a parasite. And there are even digestive parasites that will work like the bacteria to digest food fast and in humans and pigs it's trichinosis, the whipworm. And we're taught, oh, trichinosis is such a bad thing. Yet Joel Weinstock of the University of Iowa found that the pigs at the university were sickly and all those pigs that had trichinosis at the farm that he grew up on were healthy and vibrant, eating their crap and their urine, their food out of all that pit of slop. And they're vibrantly healthy creatures.

So he took the sick pigs that were in sterile environments, fed the best scientific foods, you know, like the science diet for dogs and cats, ridiculous diet. Every diet that I've taken care of from other people who raised them, put them on the science diet, more diseases in those dogs than any other. I mean, every six months there was a major illness that would come up in one of these dogs. Parasites are your best advantage. So he took the whipworm and infused it into the pigs at the university and they were well in five days. The whipworm digests food. It's an intestinal parasite that's just like your intestinal bacteria, but it can do twice as much as bacteria can in a 24 hour period. Bacteria can eat 50 times its weight, still pretty good, and discard only 1 to 5% waste. Again, the waste is equal to what the parasites do, but the parasites can consume more and give us more nutrients. And the toxicity level is very small. But the healthy, good, digestible waste that is our food is abundant. When you get to fungi, it's a little different. You have... The fungi don't break the food down the way parasites and bacteria do. They're still beneficial and they're great janitors, but you usually have rashes. It doesn't break the matter, the toxicity in something down enough to where it won't cause ridged nails and black or brown or gray or green fungi as it comes out, and your skin will peel away from the fungus. It's still a good thing, but it is very uncomfortable when it's out of control. And you know, like athlete's foot. The fungi is in there doing its work on very contaminated tissue like in the feet or crotch where you put lymphatic systems dumping its worst waste. It's doing its job, but it can't neutralize those poisons as well as bacteria and parasites can. And then when you get to the point where the tissue is so toxic that none of those will eat it, then we have to, each cell has to create a solvent.  So you have about 300,000 varieties of solvents, so there are 300,000 varieties of virus. 

And it was known 35 years ago, virus aren't alive. So no antibiotics. Even about 30 years ago, and that was for 60, 70, 80 years, doctors found you had a virus where there's no bacteria, no parasites, no fungus in an area. That was degenerating and dissolving tissue. It was a virus experience, a viral experience, but they knew there was nothing to kill and nothing alive. So there were no antibiotics. So 30 years ago, they thought, hey, why don't we just call that alive too, and we can sell antibiotics. And that was the pure nature of the whole change. Now they come up with all these Disneyland drawings of what a virus looks like. And you'll never see one in real life photograph. It is always an image which was generated by a computer, by an artist, because there's no such thing as a live virus body. It is a solvent. It is a liquid, just like Drano. And muriatic acid. There's nothing alive about it. But it will go in and dissolve matter. Talk to any Italian who has a cleaner. Put your body in the, you know, in the bathtub, and you pour muriatic acid all over it, and you put a little water in there, and that whole body is dissolved. And that's what virus are. Virus are solvents created within the cells. And each cell will create a different, like, let's say, your neighbor has died on you, and there's no way to get rid of her but dissolve her. So you produce one out of your own body and put it on her. Or her own body, dead body, produces it and dissolves it. And that's the way it works. There's no bacteria. There's no mysterious thing about it. It's such a natural process. Any of those bacteria, any of those parasites that are cleansing, of course, they put them in a Petri dish, and they say, see, they eat these live cells. But those live cells are in an unnatural environment and dying anyway. So that cleansing, that janitorial bacteria or parasite or fungi will go to work. But they don't work on live cells in the body, only in the Petri dish. But the pharmaceutical house points at the damage in a Petri dish and says, and nothing is natural in a Petri dish.

It's all chemical environment. Nothing. Not even the water is pure. And they point to that and say, see those parasites eating all that, all those live cells? But what's the quality of those live cells? They're already deteriorating. And if they've actually put a process of mummification in it, and they're half alive with that mummification, they still say, see, they're alive, and they misrepresent that they are live, healthy cells when they are not. So those parasites, the bacteria, the bacterias that are janitorial and the fungal will go to work and break those cells down. But they say, see, see what you should be afraid of? Then you get in your body and take it apart. Can you imagine a big man like Arnold Schwarzenegger, seven times Mr. Universe, going to worry about these little fricking organisms take over his body when he thrived on it the whole time? But that's where his head is now. And you have to get out of that fear-mongering place, because they will trap you into their treatments. And none of their treatments are healthy. Not one. They all cause harm. All medications cause side effects, period. So don't be afraid of them. Invite them in. Eat high meats. Eat moldy cheese. Just scrape off the spores on the outside. Eat all these things. Your fermented milks, your kefir, your yogurts, same thing. When they use grains from a cow's stomach, it's not the same as you need. It will break down the food and you will absorb more nutrients from your dairy. But if you want the kind of bacteria that's specific for you, expectorate a teaspoon into your quart of milk. Then you will have the bacteria that is right for you, digesting that perfectly for your body. I just do some oil pulling, or milk pulling, or coconut cream pulling first, before you use your saliva and put it into your milk. And then you can use it in the next batch until it won't grow anymore, and then you put your saliva in again. And that's your best starter. The bacteria that will grow in it is your bacteria for your digestion. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, not if you do the oil pulling first. Those are the toxins that get into it. I've never found it foul once you do the pulling first. That's why I'm suggesting you do pulling first. I don't mind a foul smelling. Gives people that leap to go into high meat, especially if they're depressed and they need help in the neurological area. Or they need their brains to work better, you know? Need more focus, more clarity, more accomplishment, orientation, you know? High meats and high eggs and high dairy really works wonderfully. Okay. I can go on for hundreds of hours, but we need this cutoff point. So now we're going to go Q&A. So anybody have any questions? We have a few, good. I suck. See when I drank that, I squeezed it over my tongue and through my teeth. Why did I do that? Because when you do that, it pulls saliva into it, like a baby sucking a nipple. So I suck my liquids, especially dairy, to get the bacteria into it. You'll digest it better. I drink half the milk. I could go through a gallon of milk a day. I used to drink two gallons of water a day when I believed that was right. So then I went to milk and I was drinking a gallon a day until I started sucking it and pulling the saliva with it, then went down to a half a gallon a day. And I don't drink water. Well, I drink half a cup a month at the most. Half a cup a month of water. Now a lot of you will need a half a cup a day because water is a solvent. Water is not good to drink. Water became popular in 1961, and it became popular in 1961 because one of the wealthiest out there in the Coca-Cola and the Pepsi-Cola industry made a bet with somebody that they could make as much money on Coca-Cola, on their soft drinks, make as much money on water as they could with their soft drinks. So it was a bet. So this guy had doctors, hired doctors to say that you need eight glasses of water a day and all of that. But when I was in school, you went to the fountain once a day, you drank your milk, your orange juice, and you got, you didn't drink water. Water was, nobody drank water except at the fountain at school.

And maybe the athletes would suck down a half a cup at a time because they were sweating so much. But then in 1961, they came out with all the commercials and doctors saying, you need eight cups of water a day. And it's grown to a point where now water's just as expensive, and sometimes more expensive than soda. You can buy a soda for, what, $2 a quart, and yet you get a good water, and you're paying, you know, $2.50 for a liter. So same price, or more, for the water. And you've got a good market, and it's not good for you. What is water? It rains, dissolves rock in the ground so the plants can eat. So it's a solvent. If you look in an archeological book, the first item under solvent is water. So you'll dilute your mucous membrane, the mucous of your mucous membranes, you'll dilute your food, you'll dilute your acids, you'll destroy bacteria, because water destroys bacteria. It neutralizes. So all the harm comes from water. However, everybody needs a little solvent, pure water, to help clean out some very difficult stuff out of the body. So let's say a half a cup is normal for the average person. And you don't take it all at once, you sip it, because if it rushes to your kidney, all you're going to do is damage your kidney and your intestinal tract. And you're not going to be able to utilize it, and you're going to urinate it out after it's done its damage. You sip, tablespoon, two tablespoons at a time throughout the day. Now, if it's hot in the summer, or you're taking the hot baths, you might put, drink a sport drink. And when I'm doing hot baths, I do a sport drink every day. A sport drink is three cups of two or more of the four following things. The first three are all to be pureed, not juiced, tomato, cucumber, watermelon. Whey is the fourth item, but since that's already liquid, that's a runoff of the milk from making cheese or butter. Listen, okay, so you can choose two of any of those four, or you can choose all four to make up the three cups. If you're using whey, it has water in it. I mean, milk is 86% water, fruits are 90 to 92% water, meats are 55% water. 

Everything contains water. Once you cook it, you've separated the ion bond to the H2O. As long as you're eating raw food, the H2O is bound to your whole amalgam of a smorgasbord of nutrients. And when a cell opens up to eat, it has ions inside, and it attracts the molecules from that mass that's traveling through, but it's like this big compared to my body, or this big compared to my body. That's the smorgasbord of 93 to 117 nutrients that a cell will eat at one time. So all of it contains every nutrient, including H2O, everything that the cell needs. When you eat salt, which I mentioned before, the sodium, when it separates from the potassium or the iodide that was in the table salt, or even in sea salt, it starts exploding these. So these burst, and maybe a cell will eat 23 nutrients instead of 93 to 117, or it'll get 50. So your cells are always starving when you eat salt. That's why people eat so much more food when they eat salt. So much more thirsty when they eat salt. There you go. So you have all the acrylamide along with the salt, causing cancer and dehydration. So you get your water from foods, all of our foods, unless you cook them, it evaporates and separates it and changes everything, the chemistry of everything. Very little water in anything. So let me finish this. So in this mixture, you can add, if you're not using whey and you're just using two or three of those items, which are the tomato puree or the cucumber puree or the watermelon puree, then add a half a cup of water to that or whey, half a cup of whey as your water. Then add a tablespoon of vinegar, two tablespoons of lemon juice, two tablespoons of lime juice, two tablespoons of coconut cream, and one to two tablespoons of dairy cream. Then put one or two eggs in it for your protein and other fats. Blend that all together. Now what you can do is you don't blend the tomato or the cucumber or the watermelon separately. You just slice it up.

Peel the cucumber always. You don't digest that. That's cellulose that will not be digested. So peel it, slice it, slice your tomatoes, put them in the jar, your quart jar, dice up the watermelon and deseed it, and then put that in the jar, any amount of those that you want to make the three cups. Then you add your other ingredients and blend it all together. You sip on that all day. If you're taking the hot baths or a hot tub, you drink a half a cup of it within about 20 minutes before you go in. Drink a cup, sip on a cup while you're in there, and then a half cup when you get out. Then you've got two cups to drink throughout the day, to sip on it. You sip that and you sip milk interchangeably. If they mix together, that's okay. Sometimes when I'm in a tropical environment, I'll take the sport drink and have a sip of milk and then have a sip of my sport drink. Then I can replace the fluids better. And that is your source of H2O that is pure and will deliver nutrients to your cell. H2O is not absorbed into the cells without other nutrients bound to it. It will dry you out. Just listening to a health food program yesterday, the guy's talking about all this water, you need to drink more than eight cups. And the guy's saying, yeah, I started doing that. He said, boy, my body needs even more water. The more water I drink, the more water I need. Hello? It's dehydrating your body because you can't absorb it. And it keeps pulling other fluids out of your cells. So it's drying. It's not hydrating. People just take things that's a little level and don't go deeply into it and the consequences.

Q: How much vinegar?

A: Apple cider vinegar was a tablespoon. If you're, if, let's say, if you have as much weight as you, you could use two tablespoons of vinegar to help break it down, okay? And if you're a bigger guy, you could use two tablespoons of vinegar in it. Now, it tastes remarkably good. Any of those combinations, do not gulp it because it will go and irritate your kidneys. You need to go in and dissolve compounds and hydrate your cells. So you sip it all day long. Utilize your food. Chug-a-lugging does not utilize your food. Puts too much H2O in your stomach at one time, and it'll shoot it to the kidneys. Then you'll be pissing your nutrients away. Literally. So okay, questions?

Q: Why can't you have whey by itself?

A: You can, you can sip on that by itself, but I like it, but you know, I've been around rotten meats and that tastes jeweled compared to rotten food. Actually the rotten meat doesn't taste bad. It melts in your mouth like chocolate. It's like braised in brandy lamb that's broken down. It's just a stench. You know, just put a nose clip on there with some ginger at your nose, you know. And just rub a little ginger root there.

Q: I see a lot of this whole grain stuff on TV, the doctors pushing it. That's a scam, right? A myth. This whole grain thing.

A: Well, I talked about it already. It'll create a lot of advanced glycation end products, 70, 90 percent of it will store in your body and create some disease. So grains is not what we eat. Squirrels and birds can eat grains and nuts. We can't. And, you know, some herbivores can have, I saw on my grandparent's farm, I saw the cows sucking dried grain off of, you know, grass, grain, wheat grain, anything like that. Once it's dried and hits the ground, they'll suck up and eat two cups a day. So I'm not with feeding only, you know, grazed grasses to these animals because they do eat some grain naturally. And if they're not given a pasture that has gone to seed at some time, they're not going to get that nutrient. And my grandparent's cattle always had better meat, I mean, better tasting meat and better hides when they got their grains in those times of the year when there was seed produced by the grasses. So I'm not for this no grain feeding. I'm just, you know, limit it to two cups a day, not bags of it a day to make them swollen and fat, but to give them enough fat to keep themselves healthy. So we eat them, we're eating the healthiest of tissue, okay? But we don't eat grains. We're not built to eat it. Yes?

Q: Is kerosene being used for the acidophilus?

A: Kerosene is not used for acidophilus, but it's still chemically produced. 

Q: I think that maybe other people have the same question. When you go out to dinner, how do you do that? I mean, there's nothing to order in the restaurant, so do you just take your own stuff?

A: Well, California, we made sure there was a law when they tried to outlaw raw meat in restaurants. The restaurants went up in arms, and the law was changed in six months. They outlawed raw meats and raw eggs, so that meant no Caesar salad that used raw eggs in, no sashimi, no steak tartare, no carpaccio, any of those. The restaurants went nuts. Only law in the United States that was changed in a five-month period, and actually in, you know, it was that fast. So I have the law in my glove compartment, and if I go into a restaurant, and I say, I want steak tartare, I want you to take a steak, I want you to chop it up for me, and I want you to put a raw egg in it, and I know the chef will think it's a, you know, an omelet if I have the egg white with it, so put the egg white in a cup for me, and put the egg yolk in the steak tartare. No capers, no salt, and that way for me. And then... Pardon? No, that's their meat. The restaurants have the best quality meat, anybody in the world. They get the best quality and the top cuts anywhere. Because they couldn't get anybody to come in if they bought the crap from here or from any market. They get the best quality of everything. And that's agreement with butchers and the restaurants. And they pay for it too. And we pay for it when we eat in a restaurant. Well compared to a restaurant, restaurants within days of butchering, a day of butchering. This meat here is at least two weeks old before we see it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, that's fine. That's fine. I'm saying, if you get in a restaurant, it's no more than two days old. Unless it's aged meat. You're getting an age cut meat. But most restaurants don't carry aged meats. So I take my little, you know, legal, you know, my health department statute in with me and they would say, oh, we can't serve you raw meat. That's against the law. And I take the little law and I say, see here? It says, if it's on the menu as raw, like steak tartare and carpaccio and sashimi, or the patron asks for it raw, it is legal. So I've got that. But I go to a restaurant, any other place, and they say, and I say, oh, is there something wrong with your meat and fish? And I say it loud enough, everybody is listening for the answer. And I say, the Italian restaurant down the street serves carpaccio, which is sliced raw meat, raw beef. And then the French restaurant down there sends me, gives me steak tartare, which is chopped meat, or chopped or ground meat, and with raw egg put with it. Is your meat wrong, something wrong with your meat? To shut me up, they give me what I want. And I've learned to do these things over the years. If I really don't want to make anybody that I'm with embarrassed, that's when I'm alone. When I don't want to embarrass anybody, I'll call the restaurant ahead of time and ask to speak to the chef. And then the chefs are always making the same thing, bored to death. So I'll say, listen, I'm on a special diet, I have to eat certain foods, I can't eat salt, I can't eat capers, but I like steak tartare and that's on my diet. Can you make me a steak tartare and use the egg white? And a lot of times they'll say, wait a minute, if you use the egg white, it's an omelette. And I say, well, give me a fricking omelette then, jokingly, and like that. But I have them put the egg white on the side if they don't want to put the egg white, because it looks all mushy with the egg white in it. So like when I was in Finland, I could only get it separate, but they would feed me the steak tartare with a little mountain, and it looks like a volcano with the egg yolk sitting in the center. And I have no trouble eating out.

Q: How about with relatives?

A: Same thing. No, I'll order that at the restaurant. I went to a steakhouse in Tennessee with my family from the South. And I got them. It took me 10 minutes, but I got them to give me raw steak. And my son ate it with me, you know?

Q: What do you eat with it in the restaurant, or is that all you eat?

A: Well, a lot of times I have butter and other things with me, so I'll bring out the butter.

Q: Bring your own?

A: Yeah, but, you know, I usually take these, you know, these crystal-type little canning jars that look pretty. My butter's in that, or, you know, let's say I took olive oil and I'm going to have a sauce, you know, with it, and I'm going to a restaurant, you know, I'll have olive oil. Maybe once every three or four months, something like that. It's okay to have an oil, like one tablespoon a day, but if you have a lot as a sauce, you don't want it for a while. Maybe once a week and no other, no, not a tablespoon a day after that as a cleanser. So, you know, I'll take maybe a, you know, olive oil with some garlic in it and some, you know, maybe some chopped fresh hot peppers, you know, something like that, tiny bit of vinegar in it, and then put that with my meal. Now, I won't have vinegar with my meat unless there's oil in the sauce, okay, because vinegar with meat don't go well together. So it interferes with proper bacterial digestion, creates gas, the odor isn't too good, so that's the way I handle it. Or I'll order raw fish, they say, well, it's not sushi grade, and I'll say, oh, you mean it's bad, you mean it stinks, full of bacteria, oh, no, no, no, no, I said, well, then we don't have an argument, bring it to me raw, I'll put lemon in it, fine, fine.

Q: What about bone marrow?

A: I eat the bone marrow, when I'm in Los Angeles, I eat one pound of it a day, and I still eat all my butter, too. I still eat all my butter, too. Bone marrow is the soft portion on the inside of a bone. That's where your red and white blood cells procreate. They divide in there, they mature in there, and enter the bloodstream. It is the only place where you can get regenerative stem cells, not adult stem cells. Adult stem cells is a cell that's matured and can only reproduce its own kind. In bone marrow, you have stem cells which, when they enter the body, the body can decide what it will be used to grow what cells. I can only get the right kind when I'm in Los Angeles. Sometimes if I'm seeing a butchered animal, or I butchered myself, wild animal, I take out the bone. Like one of my cows died in childbirth, because my foreman bought the cow from a wrong source. So this baby kept developing in my cow and killed the cow because it developed in childbirth because it was too big. And plus the cervix was wrapped around the head of the calf and couldn't get it out. So it died. And I tried to get in there and pull it out, but it was stuck in there and it was a mess. Cow died, so I broke up the bones. And I'm there with all these other, because I had, you know, we have to get rid of it fast like that. So I had one of the Thai tribe call ten other people and we divided it up and I made them pay for it. And we all butchered it together. Can you imagine about 15 people butchering and consuming, and I'm there eating the stuff raw and they will take it home to cook it. And I take out the bone marrow raw and they're all fascinated by this, you know. But it was delicious, fresh, warm out of the bone marrow. It's like butter, just like butter, delicious. Anyway, the only other place you can get that kind of stem cell is from sperm and the ovum.

Q: [unintelligible]

So bone marrow is the only other place. So it helps you regenerate tissue faster. I get mine from North Star Bison in Wisconsin, right outside of Rice, Wisconsin. North Star Bison, they're on the internet, you can find them. Rice, R-I-C-E, Rice, Wisconsin. But you can get it from any producer that's slaughtering animals. 

Q: I mean, I get a cut of meat that has bone, that has marrow in it. I mean, you don't get much, but you still get something.

Q: Can you just buy the bones?

A: You're going to saw them in two and break them up?

Q: No, I'd tell my husband to do that.

A: Then you could do that, absolutely, that's fine. Yeah, you can do that. But you buy the femur or the tibia, but usually it's the femur and the tibia which have the most in it. Of course, up near the knuckle, it's all cartilage and bone, there's nothing in it. So about from here to here on the animal will be the rich bone marrow inside it. So at the knuckle, you're not going to get anything, the knuckles at both sides. That's just hard bone and cartilage. Anyway, it helps regenerate tissue fast. I eat that with my meat meal, and I'll eat every day that I'm in Los Angeles. I go through a package of it a day, which is if the bones are all together, it comes in a package of maybe seven bones. And not all of them, some of them are hard too near the knuckle, but they don't care. We'll send them to you anyway, but that's the price. They're not going to just throw something away, they're not going to test it for any action. But they know not to go too high up into the knuckle or the joint. So I go through seven of those a day when I'm in Los Angeles. But then I'm gone from Los Angeles, like here, I'll go from here to another city. So I'm in Los Angeles six weeks a year, and I eat it every day when I'm there, a whole pack of it, which is about one and a half sticks of butter worth. Plus I still eat my butter with my meat meal. But that's because if I were here in this town, I may eat two of those, you know, two bone marrows a day, and that's it. But I'm not here very much, not in Los Angeles very much. Now what you can do is, those have a tendency to turn on you quick. Turn causes quick bacterial manifestation, you know, oxidizes the bone marrow. So it's best as soon as you get home, leave it out for a few hours so it gets room temperature, and pop them out, and put them in a jar, and then refrigerate that. And they'll keep longer.

Q: It happened to me. It was really bad.

A: Oh, they get really nasty.

Q: And I was hungry. How good it tasted.

A: Right.

Q: I was really angry.

A: But my crows and hawks are like, I can take those out and throw them up and the hawk will come down and pick them right up. Loves me. And the ravens, too. They love rotten meat. That's what they feed on. Eat the bone marrow, and then the fat, and all that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, freezing. Thank you. OK. When I did tests with animals on frozen meats, I divided them in half. They got the same meat, organic meat. One group ate it frozen. The other group didn't have it frozen. And I did that. The same of half of beef. Just wait for the story. It'll take two minutes. So it's the same beef, half, one frozen, one unfrozen. All of the ones that ate it frozen got skin disorders within six weeks, severe skin disorders within 10 weeks. Those that ate it raw had no problem, rarely drank any water, and they were very happy. No irritation. Coats were fine. Same meat. The ones who ate it frozen also drank a lot of water. Now to test, now Sally Fallon and I have been having an argument about this for 20 years. Freezing anything will cause a problem unless it's fruit. So freezing butter, freezing cream, anything is a problem. It degradates the nutrients in the substance. So I wanted to prove this. But this is before I met Sally. This is in the early 90s. And I took the butter to give it to, because I knew that raw, no salt butter, if I fed it to these animals with skin disorders, would resolve the issue within an amount of time. I figured two to six weeks. So I gave them, I split that sick group into two. Frozen butter, unfrozen butter, the same butter from the same batch, frozen and unfrozen. All of those that got the frozen butter took five times longer to heal their skin disorder. Five times longer. That means 80% of the nutrients were altered by freezing in butter. Not good. Still is healing, but why reduce it, you know, by one, by four-fifths? Keep your nutrients. Even if the butter goes into blue cheese, you can make great roquefort dressing with it. And it's pre-digested. The butter's pre-digested from the molds. Just scrape off the top blue fuzz where all the spores are. That's all. And eat it. Enjoy it. Okay. You've got to go. Bye. And any other questions? Yes.

Q: I am totally convinced that we need protein because I was raw vegan and switched back to eating meat. Well, especially the raw dairy, you know, the raw meat was a little harder and I'm not doing a whole lot of that.

A: I saw you squirming.

Q: Yeah. I'm not there. But I'm feeling so much better now that I'm doing the raw dairy, the butter, and the eggs. Not doing any of the high. But I have a question because a few years ago I got the book, The China Study, and I was really afraid because in that book he said that the long-chain amino acids were much stronger than the short-chain and animal products are short-chain because they're complete essential amino acids or whatever and they're weak and as human beings we need long-chain and we can eat incomplete protein but our bodies will tailor-make the long-chain which is stronger and was designed for human beings and he said that most all degenerative diseases including Alzheimer's comes from animal products. So I went off animal products and now I was wondering.

A: There's somebody who is biggest full of crap, oh no, crap's healthy, biggest toxic garbage information there is. You'll read a book called, that's all garbage, that's all intellectual garbage. All intellectual garbage, your body will form the chains that it needs. Like the body doesn't eat cholesterol unless it has some eggs, there's a little cholesterol in eggs. There's no cholesterol in milk. There's no cholesterol in meat. Your body makes cholesterol and it's important because it makes the different cholesterols to do everything that happens in your body. Cholesterol is vitally important. You would die without it. You would not be healthy without it. So there's another book out that says something about the China studies. Everything is wrong in the China study. And let me tell you, that's a biochemist that even goes through the intellectual crap that's in there and to prove all the things that are wrong and all the bad conclusions that are formed. That was created, again, by, they were financed by the Bilderberg community that wants to keep us unhealthy and to create genocide. He was paid by the Bilderberg trust to write that book.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's a ploy.

Q: He is a nice guy, but he's just writing it from a vegetarian standpoint, and I followed that. Not only always, but it's vegetarian style. So he's going to tell you what he thinks is good, and that's his opinion. Now, Aajonus says his opinion, and I agree with Aajonus.

A: He wasn't even a vegetarian.

Q: He wasn't?

A: The guy who wrote that book. He lied in investigating, he's not a vegetarian. The whole book is a lie. People believe what they read, instead of using their wits about themselves. I don't believe anything that I read. I have to have it proven to me. I read probably 200 pages of research a day, and I don't believe a word of it. But when I come into circumstances with it, I watch and observe what it does. And 99 times out of 100, the opposite is true. Whenever I hear something coming from the medical profession, I know if I do the exact opposite, I'll be right. 99 times out of 100 times. Literally. Literally. If they tell you to put ice on something, you put heat on something. If they tell you don't eat fats, eat tons of fat. Yeah, absolutely opposite. I'm here because I do the opposite. Anything they say, drink water, eat salt, eat starches, eat all... I don't do any of that. 

Q: Do you know what's interesting about the water? But you know, it was that Dr. Batmanghelidj, he said that the more water you drink, yes, the thirstier you're going to get because your body didn't even know it was dehydrated. Now you're waking it up and now it is thirsty, but you know, he died of dehydration.

[laughter]

A: Think about that. Think about that. He died of dehydration from all the water he drank. It dries the body.

Q: Just common sense like you say in the book.

A: Put water on your skin constantly, what happens? It dries out. Put butter and fat on it, what happens? Stays supple and strong. Common sense. Yeah, most studies are on cooked and processed foods, of course. Okay, we're going to take one more. Yes.

Q: When do you use avocado for your fat?

A: Only when I'm out of butter and any other fat. Like I was in Philippines and my butter supply usually take 30 pounds with me and I eat less there than I do here. So it takes me a week to go through a pound. So I'm there 30 weeks at a time just about, traveling, going around. I have a letter from my doctor that says I was diagnosed with cancer and diabetes, it doesn't say 40 years ago. And it says he needs these foods and he needs, when he goes to Asia, he goes for four months at a time and needs to take 20 to 30 pounds of butter. It cannot be x-rayed because he had radiation therapy and he'll vomit all over the plane. They don't want me vomiting all over the plane so they hand check everything. So I go three hours ahead of time because it takes them an hour to get me through TSA, to check everything. And I take milk, I'll take three quarts of milk with me and you're only supposed to take three milliliters because the thing says if he doesn't eat every hour in these foods he's going to be sick. And do you want to be responsible for him getting sick? Nobody wants to be sick. So they let me, I take a big cooler, you know, a cooler about this high, full of meat and everything. Pardon?

Q: Storage, right? Baggage storage?

A: No, no, no. It goes on with me. Absolutely, it goes on with me. I put it in the overhead. Yeah. It's, I keep, I keep a cooler that's about this wide, about this wide and about this high. And it takes...

Q: You pick it up and put it in the overhead and it stays in there?

A: Yeah. I'm strong. I can do it. If I can lift 400 pound freaking sink, stone sink, even though I hurt myself, I can put it in the overhead and pick up, you know, a 60 pound cooler. Okay. Okay. Two more.

Q: I had a question about high meat. I've been trying to make it and every week we've been making it in the mall jars. And I don't know if you have ever seen this before, but after a week or so, it starts getting this strange black oily substance on top of the lid. And I've been trying to make it and every week we've been making it in the ball jars. And I don't know if you have ever seen this before, but after a week or so, it starts getting this strange black oily substance on top of the lid. And I've been trying to make it and every week we've been making it in the mall jars. And I don't know if you have ever seen this before, but after a week or so, it starts getting this strange black oily substance on top of the lid. Is it, is that all right? Is that?

A: As long as it doesn't drip down on your food.

Q: Okay. Do you know what it is?

A: It's a black fungus that eats, you know, evaporated substances, acids from the meat. But because it reacts with the lid, you want to rinse it off every time you open it. Rinse that off every time.

Q: With the meat that I have, is that still safe?

A: If it dripped down on it, it was moisture that was dripping off, then it dripped down. You have to take the top layer of your meat and throw it, you know, about this much. Take it and throw it. The rest of it will be fine. Okay.

Q: [unintelligible] So you don't have to skim off the top layer of your meat every time?

A: Well, like I said, you take the lid and you clean it off each time. You're supposed to open it every two to three days. Okay. And then you put new air in it to get more aerobic bacteria into it so that you have different organisms grow. Pardon?

Q: How long does it take?

A: 20 seconds, 30 seconds, just enough to put new air in it. You know, if you let it stand like this, you may have to stand there two minutes. But I go like this and get the air in it fast because I've got too much to do. And then I take and clean the lid and put it back on it and put it in the cupboard. I don't put mine in the refrigerator because I like mine to grow fast and stinky quickly because I'm not in town long enough to slow breathe it. And the juices, the black juices at the bottom, that's the finitely melted stuff. That's the stuff you want most. Drink that liquid and your brain and nervous system are fed instantly. That's the best. Chop the meat up into the finest pieces, even grind it and put it in. And it will break itself down fast. It's just like making yogurt, only it stinks. 

Q: Speaking of grinding, I've read or heard that if you blend the raw egg, you're actually damaging the protein.

A: If you directly blend the raw egg by itself. If you're blending it with milk or some other ingredient, it will encapsulate the egg white and won't damage it. Otherwise, it will oxidize. 

Q: High meat. Is there a faster way of doing it than the book says? Can you do it faster?

A: You take it out of the refrigerator, you spit into it, and you can add more bacteria that way. Did you have a question?

Q: So would you get really sick if you ate any of that black stuff?

A: Probably. There's a plastic that covers that lid. It's not enamel anymore, and you'll probably get some of the BPAs out of it, the phthalates out of the plastic.

Q: What's your opinion on eating carnivore meat versus herbivore meat?

A: Any animal that eats what it's supposed to, I don't have a problem eating it. I eat lobsters, I eat crabs, clams that eat crap, the fecal matter, it doesn't matter as long as that animal is healthy. If I eat a tiger, and that's the only thing I have to eat, I'll eat that tiger, even though it eats other animals. Not a problem. If you're eating healthy animals, it doesn't matter what kind of animal cells, animal food you eat, as long as they're healthy. One more, no, okay, we got to go.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They are so booked with so many orders, yeah, but there's going to be another one opening up soon, Renee in Missouri. They're already doing it?

Q: Renee's doing it.

Q: It's called Original Living Coconut, originallivingcoconut.com and we've got her number if you want it. And then Bucho is going to be doing it.

Q: You want to think of anything you want to recommend?

A: It's been stopped in Los Angeles, but it should kick in about two weeks, but that's a longer way to get it to travel than Missouri with Renee.

Q: How about the young coconut, the white coconut?

A: Young coconuts don't have much fat in them at all, they're not mature. It's okay if you have a baby, a young person or even an adult with some intestinal problems, it helps soothe the intestines. And I eat it when I'm in, it's called Bucho in Philippines and I will eat it. And I get the water because I can't get milk sometimes, like in the middle, I can't get milk. So I take that soft and put it in with the water and I'll sip on the water and if I have a blender, if not, I just shake it up. Yeah. Okay, that's it, folks. Okay. Now what are we going to do? We're going to take a little break and then we'll do that.

[break]

A: So if you want to have a detailed, suggested plan from me, you have to come to a personal consult, and I do those all the way through Wednesday, and I think we only have a few appointments left. And in that, I photograph the irises, and with the irises I can detect almost everything that goes on in your body, where the toxins are stored, how you can resolve it, and I give you a diet, a strict diet to do. You can follow it or not, that's up to you, but I've been around a long time, and I know what works in probably 95% of the situations. There's 5% of people who've got a lot of, you know, multiple conflicting complications that I have to help, you know, for months afterwards, but most people, 95 out of 100 that I give a plan, it works, without having to see me again, and a year after that, you want to adjust, come see me again, or if you have difficulties, you can call me. If you're 7 or 9 any morning that I'm in town, if I'm not in town, you can always send me an email, and then I can get back to you on my suggestions of what to do, and again, 95 times out of 100, what I suggest works, almost immediately, sometimes there's just some tweaking to do, so, and then there's other people, it works fine, and they're doing well on their own with the diet, and just want to come back and see the progression, because in the irises, my irises were brown and green 43 years ago, now they're blue, my eyes were supposed to be blue. There are only three colors of eyes, there are blue, hazel, and amber. Dark brown and black eyes are toxic, they show massive amounts of toxicity in the body. A lot of people who have hazel eyes and brown eyes are really supposed to be blue like mine. So I can tell, we'll look at the iris, blown up and take the iris, which is this small, and we can blow it up to this big, so we can see all the details all around, you can see what color your eyes are supposed to be. Each year, if you stay on a good diet, your eyes, the toxins will leave the body and your eyes will clear where those toxins have been removed, and you can see the progression. And during the next phase in the workshop, I'll pull a group out, one of my patients was so delighted with her progress over a five-year period that she put the four irises down so you can see the progression, and I'll show you that, but you can see it in mine. 

From dark brown and green eyes to blue eyes. If you blow up the eyes, there's still a spot in the prostate, which is brown, and there's still lots of yellow in the brain from penicillin injections that I've received a lot of, and penicillin is still in the brain. So the brain takes a very, very long time. It takes 40 years for the body to clear out everything.

Q: 40, 4-0?

A: 40, 4-0. According to Dr. Pottenger's and Howell's work with toxic animals, it took seven times the generations to completely get to optimal health of those animals. For us, that's 40 years.

Q: And that's if we have a pure environment with pure food, right?

A: Yes.

Q: So really, that's not happening.

A: That's from when you're pure already, yeah. But a lot of people who are toxic, they don't notice it, they don't recognize it, and they don't care. So they're already satisfied. That's okay. But I'm one of those people that the only way I will get poisoned is if somebody poisons me. I want to see what Superman can do. That's what I want to see.
