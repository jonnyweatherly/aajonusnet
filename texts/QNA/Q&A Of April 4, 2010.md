Q: I guess my biggest concern now is [unintelligible]. If there′s any suggestions, maybe. I wouldn't like to root canal it. [unintelligible]

A: Is it a molar?

Q: Yes, it′s a molar.

A: What I did was, I had a lot of trouble with my teeth after chemotherapy and radiation therapy because it rotted the bone around my teeth. The radiation therapy in particular. So my teeth just dangled in my mouth, in the gums. And if I bit down on my own teeth, I bled. I'd lose a half a cup of blood a day. So I was sometimes getting two transfusions a week. And then when I started drinking the raw milk, it took about two years to regrow the bone all around the teeth. But I still had a lot of dental problems because of being a fruitarian, vegetarian. After that, my teeth were rotting a lot. So every time I had tooth problems, I would eat a lot of cheese. I would take clay and pack it on the area to help draw the toxins out. Most of the dental problems in all cavities are not from bacteria. Bacteria feed on the damaged dentine. All bacteria in our bodies are both constructive and cleansing. The body is 99% bacteria. You never hear that from the medical profession because they want you to be afraid of bacteria. Their whole theory is that bacteria causes disease. The bacteria theory. Obviously, that's garbage. When I was doing experiments with people with polio, the greater the concentrations of bacteria in their intestines and blood and urine and feces, the more healing transpired. They were healthier, they were stronger, and they would get well. Those that continued with antibacterials through their whole treatment ended up paralyzed, shrunken legs, all kinds of problems. Especially in children. So, bacteria is prominent and is very important. It's the heavy metals that collect in the brain and the nervous system that cause the decay on the dentine. Because the brain and the nervous system use metallic minerals to conduct electricity to transmit and transfer light. A concentration of minerals forms in the brain and the nervous system. Now when you cook foods and eat processed foods, all of the bonds with those trace toxic minerals that would not be toxic as long as they're bound with other ions, and they're nutritive. So, mercury, arsenic, lead, all of those which are isolated poisons together in unison with other nutrients are helpful to the body. But when you cook it, you fractionate the ionic bonds so they become free radicals and they do damage. And they have a tendency to collect and magnetize to each other making the harm, the degeneration greater. Now mercury is the greatest neurological poison to any animal on this planet. Thallium is next and then arsenic. And if you put a liquid solution of mercury like thimerosal on dentine and put it under the gums, within about 10 days you will have a cavity. And what's happening when we get cavities is the brain is detoxing and it detoxes mostly out the gums, the tongue and the salivary glands. 

So as it comes down the teeth and binds with the teeth, the body uses calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, alkalinizing minerals to bind with the acidic minerals which are toxic and highly corrosive. And that's what causes plaque on the teeth. So plaque is a defense against those heavy metals damaging the dentine. However, once cauterized, once cooked over about 141 degrees, calcium is no longer active in the same way. It loses more than 50% of its potency to alkalinize and neutralize the caustic acidic minerals. So as it sits on the teeth, even if you have a lot of plaque, it will eventually eat through and damage the dentine. And that's what causes cavities. You can have internal cavities too, from the inside out, and that's when the mercury thallium from the brain passes into the nerve, and then tries to exit to the tubules and gets into the dentine and works its way from the inside to the outside. As soon as oxygen is involved, the dentine starts decaying instantly. So cheese is very helpful. Cheese is concentrated in minerals. You can't digest raw unsalted cheese because it's not fractionated. It's a dehydrated product, and any food that's dehydrated has no enzymatic activity. You have to... Are you drinking my milk? Oh, no. My berry milk. Yeah, you want this milk too? Well, you already drank all of it. Okay, here. So, if you have the cheese with honey, you will digest it. Now, there are two things involved. He has a tooth problem, and he's got pain in it. And the doctors, dentists of course, they all want to do root canal and say that the nerve's damaged. Sure, the nerve's damaged. That doesn't mean you need a root canal or the tooth pulled. I always wait until it's... The tooth has created a root canal on its own. And I've had several do that. I've let them do that. I let the nerve inside dry up and harden like a string. And it will. And then they can just pull it out and put a cap over it. And I let that happen on two teeth. But getting through that pain while it's detoxing from the heavy metals can be difficult. I always used lots of cheese. I would eat cheese to help draw out the poisons out of the system. And I would pack clay or cheese in my mouth. Sometimes the cheese gets a little acidic, so it causes the gums to get more sensitive. But it does draw the poisons out. And then I used clay that's been moist for at least five days. And then let it harden about the texture of clay that you mold for pottery. And then pack that up there and that draws it out and keeps pain down. And of course my pain formula, which is the moisturizing lubrication formula, would be pollen and cheese eaten with it. And then lots of milk. I refrain from eating meat when I have a tooth pain like that that is pretty severe. I won't eat beef at all. When I eat meat it will be fish or chicken. And I tend to do better with fish because of the high mineral content. It can help bind with the toxic minerals and help soothe and give minerals to the nerves. So it can pull the caustic metals out of the nerve, which irritate and burn the nerve, which is most of the pain. That's what the pain originates from. 

You can neutralize that with the minerals from the milk and the cheese. The pain is usually very manageable and endurable. If it pusses, great. That means that the white blood cells are involved. And the white blood cells will consume the poison and regurgitate it when it gets to the skin or pass out and die with the chemical in them. Pus is a good thing. Doctors say, you need antibiotics. White blood cells aren't your problem. Why would you want to poison white blood cells? It's the most ridiculous concept in the world. But it sells antibiotics and people buy it. Think about it. White blood cells, which are responsible, like the lymphatic system, is mainly fatty cells and white cells that draw poisons out of the body. You want pus where there's toxins. It's an infection, yes. It is infected with some kind of chemical pollution and you need the white blood cells to help remove it. That's what it's all about. That's what the white blood cells do in your blood. That's what the white blood cells do in your entire body, even your intestines. When you eat cooked foods and no raw food with it at all, you have what is called leukocytosis, which is the white blood cells leaving the red blood stream and entering the intestines. And up to one third of the white cells will enter to deal with the toxicity that's created from cooking your food, because you've got a lot of toxic byproducts. 32 that I name in the recipe book. And those are only the ones that have been identified, but that's because a few scientists have taken the time to do that with very little budgets. Of course, the budgets, the only thing that our government will sponsor is pharmaceutical stuff that gets us nowhere, like cancer and multiple sclerosis through drug campaigns from the pharmaceutical industry, and there's no cure there. They don't make any money if you're cured. And Hippocrates cured diabetes in 6-10 weeks in every case with just a raw milk diet. And we have 53 million diabetics in this country. That's a fifth of the population. Think about that. They can all be cured in 6-10 weeks. They're not. And the government knows this. The pharmaceutical house knows this. That's why they campaigned to get rid of raw milk. There's no other reason to go after it the way they're going after it. It also helps relieve a lot of poisons out of the body. It keeps a lot of people much healthier, like 5 times healthier than you can be without it. So milk is a very important thing. This Whole foods thing, I was waiting for this. Back when Whole Foods started buying up Mrs. Gooch's health food chain, which was a good health food chain. When they advertised organic, 60-70% of all the foods in Mrs. Gooch's was organic. When Whole Foods came out, they'd say go go organic, always campaigning for it, but if you went into their store, in the highest point of organic availability, they would have no more than 10% organic. 10%, and at the lowest it was 2%. 80% of the year, Whole Foods only carried 2% organic produce. Why? Because they're saying go go organic. There's plenty of organic sources out there.

So I looked into it, and I went to the head office in Texas, and I asked them what they fed their beef, and it was all natural, like they labeled and everything. And I said, well, specifically, what do they eat? And I finally got to the person who oversees the ranches, which are contracted with them to produce the meat. And they have contracts, somewhere around 60 contracts, with very large ranches for their beef. And there is, and the man who oversees it makes sure that they're almost all fed the same, and they get 15% bakery waste. 15% stale, boiled and oiled doughnuts. Since when is that natural? Well, the grain is natural, they naturally eat grain. I said, not ground and processed and boiled in oil, as doughnuts are. And then, so I decided, okay, who are these people that are buying out and taking this attitude? They're obviously interested in money and not interested in health, and they're purposely destroying people's health. So I knew it was a front. So I found out it was the Bush, George Bush's family, and the Bass family of Texas. And both of them are anti, and both of them are Nazis, and believe that we should diminish the population. So that's who owns, who are the major shareholders, through trust, ten trusts. They own about, well, when I investigated ten years ago, they owned about 80% of all the shares of Whole Foods. So, then two months ago, they put two vegetarians in charge of all of the stores. You know how much vegetarians think that raw milk, or any milk, is the worst food in the world. So what's the first thing to go out when they get into management? The raw milk. They're using, well, we can't get it insured. They've had it insured all along and nobody's spouted it and had a problem with it. So this is a way to get rid of it, and to get rid of good healthy food, some more healthy food. So that's why they've stopped carrying raw milk. Anyway, cheese, pain formula, pack it with clay. And drink milk, sip on milk all the time. Now, you can sip on cold milk just a little bit to numb the pain, but don't do it too often.

Q: What I started to do is put the raw milk up in the cabinet, mix it with honey, and make kefir, and drink kefir cold.

A: That's okay, that's okay. I found that if I put the cold on it too often, it made it worse.

Q: Okay, another question, where to get the kefir... Do they use pasteurized milk, and some do use pasteurized milk to make their kefir. I don't know if it makes a difference if you're using a culture. Could you recommend where I would buy a culture for the kefir? 

A: Like I said in the book, when I make my kefir, I use my expectoration and honey. Because it's your own bacteria. We have more bacteria than cats and dogs in our mouths. Yeah, use your saliva. It's in the recipe book. So, your saliva has more bacteria than dogs and cats. About the only creature I know of that has more bacteria than humans is a fly. But I'm not going to grind up a fly and put it in my milk. So, I'll get some saliva with some honey and expectorate it into the milk and that's how I make my kefir. And if you keep the milk warm, put it in a bowl of warm water. I put mine in my hot tub which is only 102 degrees and cows body temperature gets up to 105. I'll have kefir in 24 hours or less. It goes very fast with my saliva and a little honey. And I mean just a little honey, let's say about two-thirds to three-quarters of a tablespoon per quart. That's all I use. The same subject, I'm going around.

Q: You mentioned about kefir. Now, for my son, you recommended that he stay away from it because it's high in alcohol?

A: No, I said if it's far fermented, if it's too fermented, there's lots of alcohol. 

Q: But he can have like fresh kefir?

A: Fresh kefir is fine. Okay, do you have a question?

Q: It's probably a really dumb question.

A: There's no dumb question. Just dumb people.

[laughter]

A: Kidding.

Q: I might qualify for that. Okay, so you were telling me to do the green juices and I'm going to do that. I wondered, I'm thinking that I can't do blended green drinks, can I? I can't blend it in my blender and drink it with the pulp and everything. You want it separated? It's like a Vitamix blender.

A: No, if you do that, you're going to have all that cellulose you can't digest. Cellulose is going to release alkalinity all throughout your intestines and it's going to neutralize your acidic bacteria so you won't digest your milk, you won't digest your eggs, you're not going to digest anything properly. 

Q: Okay, so I've got to do it into the juice, okay.

A: If you want to do a little of that, because maybe you have over-acidity in your intestines, which you don't.

Q: Well, I may have from the coffee, but I probably don't anymore.

A: No, you don't. I just saw your irises and you don't have that. So normally if I suggest that for someone, it's the last thing in the day they eat, so no dairy, no meats coming behind, you know, to interfere. And by morning you're going to be overly acidic from detoxification anyway. Okay?

[unintelligible chatter]

Q: Where's the dog?

A: Yeah. Very strong.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, I haven't felt one in probably six years.

Q: It's still going.

Q: It is, it's still moving.

Q: Still moving. Still moving.

Q: Where's the dog?

A: [unintelligible] 2012.

Q: So expect a natural disaster.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Are you used to this, Aajonus?

A: Very.

Q: You said it doesn't get that big.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, well, cucumber's not a vegetable. Cucumber's a fruit. So you're going to get your collagen from it. So collagen replacement. So it's not a complex cellulose like roots, stalks, and leaves. It's a fruit. And because we don't eat a lot of sweet fruits, for the obvious reason, getting the highs and lows and deterioration and demineralization of the body, you know, we have the cucumber, which is a bland fruit. Okay? Do you have a question?

Q: Go to Nancy. I'll have to come back.

A: Do you have a question? Okay, yeah.

Q: Yeah, when I saw you in October, I was exhibiting symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, and most of those seem to have dissipated.

A: Good.

Q: I have a little swelling here, but I still on the balls of my feet get some swelling. And it's interesting, like, we had this meal today, and everything was good until I ate that little ball of nuts and honey or whatever was in that.

A: Yeah.

Q: And then all of a sudden my feet, and they're still doing it, they start to tingle and feel like they're getting a little swollen. So is that an allergy to something that was in that, or that doesn't have anything to do with the RA, or?

A: It depends on what was in it. I don't know what was in it. Are those from the Rawesome?

Q: Yeah.

A: Some of that stuff created at Rawesome isn't necessarily good. It's like that oil they were pressing, and I think they use the safflower oil or pumpkin oil in here, and for two years they claimed it was raw. And I said, okay, prove it to me. So I went there and I took a heat gun right where the oil was coming out, and the pumpkin seed oil was coming out at 129 degrees to 134 degrees. The flax oil was coming out at 150-some, and the sunflower was the only one that came in under 96 degrees. When they first started pressing it, the machine got hot for some reason, but after about three ounces of pressing, the temperature dropped down below between 89 and 92 degrees, which is fine. So the only oil that is good up there that they press is the sunflower seed oil. 

Q: So if I get that reaction from something, then I just be aware that that's something for me that I shouldn't be eating?

A: Not necessarily all the time, but in the case of if this is made with those oils.

Q: Sometimes even I'll, I think, I feel this, sometimes I'll just think something, think about something, and I'll start to get that tingling. So I know this is maybe an emotional component also? I was wondering if you had any thoughts.

A: Well, you know, you can, you know, you see somebody eating a lemon, and you know, you water and you taste it, you know, so the brain does come into it, and it usually doesn't go to the point where it's causing electrical, you know, stimulation. However, in some people that are very thin, I have found that that is true. One patient I had who had MS, multiple sclerosis, was so advanced that she lived on a gurney, and she flew down from Canada. I wasn't willing to fly up there, and I had no idea... They had to buy four first-class seats. They had to take out the seats and bolt her gurney in and fly her down, and she came in a life-support vehicle. So she was wheeled up to my house in a gurney, and she fell asleep within a few minutes there as they were settling her. And I went over to see, and I went like this. She woke up screaming, and I was just this far away from her arm, and she woke up screaming in pain because the energy that she could feel, she was that sensitive, and nobody could get near her. She had caretakers that, you know, it was futile because they screamed every time they got near her. She screamed every time they got near her. She was that sensitive. That's the only time in the cases of MS, and I've seen three cases like that, where they're so sensitive that you can get close to them and wake them up, cause pain. That's sensitive. But that's the only disease I know that has that ability. So your thought process, maybe because you were even thinner before, and maybe you had some hardening of your nerves, that you may be that sensitive that even your thoughts can create that, but it's not a general rule.

Q: So should I continue to wait a while before I have my mercury filling removed?

A: I always suggest people wait two and a half years on the diet.

Q: I've been three and a half years.

A: Solid on the diet?

Q: Yep.

A: I'd say go ahead and do it.

Q: So even though you said in October, wait until the immune situation has kind of cleared out?

A: Well, has it?

Q: Well, I don't know if it has a hundred percent.

A: You're taking the baths to help clear it?

Q: I haven't been taking baths lately.

A: Yeah, then wait.

Q: Okay.

A: Ninety percent of toxins leave through the skin. You've got to perspire them out. And most of those toxins are, you know, styrofoam or other kinds of plastics by using hydrogenating vegetable oils. So, almost all the... besides Haagen-Dazs and what's the other Haagen-Dazs? And there's another one, Jerry's.

Q: Breyers?

A: Pardon?

Q: Is it Breyers?

A: Breyers. They're the only ones that use actual dairy products. However, because they're international now, there are regulations on it, so they're having to defat, remove the animal fat, the cream, from all dairy, and then add back a hydrogenated vegetable oil for long shelf life. So, almost all of it's plastic now. Styrofoam. Actually, styrofoam. And why does the FDA and our government allow it? Because they don't give a shit about you, it's about profit, and that's it. You have a question about this?

Q: Yeah, I have a question regarding the balls she ate. If it's a nut based, do you think it's going to be the nuts that she's allergic to? Or what's your opinion on nuts?

A: Well, as long as the nuts have some kind of fat with it, with a little honey, it will break down. So I have the nut formula in the book. It helps to break down the phytic acid. And phytic acid is an enzymatic activity which causes us to not be able to absorb certain minerals. And that prevents the absorption and utilization of certain proteins, which prevents the utilization of certain fats. So it's a whole chain reaction. So I found that if you're using a fat and honey with the nuts and seeds, that it neutralizes the phytic acid. It changes the properties so the enzyme doesn't work that way. I think that nature created that enzyme so many animals wouldn't eat all the seeds, so they would propagate. Birds, if you feed them only sprouts, they will die. Birds can eat a lot of nuts because they have a gizzard and seeds because they have a gizzard. Squirrels can eat a lot of certain kinds of nuts and it will not bother them, but they're equipped to eat it. They have certain enzymatic activity. But the human isn't built that way.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: But those are never real bad, usually. I guess I decided to not say never, but to change it because that's when it always happens. Who knows, it could be this one time and it's worse than the original shot.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Do you have a question, Marie?

Q: Yes. Because of my [unintelligible], is it okay to get some dental treatment done? I just want to get several old fillings out [unintelligible] the pesticides and the poisoning.

A: Yeah, it's okay. I use Dr. Breton in Tijuana. He'll do anything that I want. He's not restricted like they are here in America where they have to give you x-rays, they have to do a certain procedure, which was written by the pharmaceutical industry and made law by our Congress. So I go to Mexico where I don't have to get x-rays, I don't have to have Novocaine, I don't have to do any of that.

Q: I also get complications sometimes. Is that because of the pesticides?

A: Yeah, pesticides will definitely damage. Any kind of chemical can harm the heart, if the heart's...

Q: What can I take for that?

A: Clay. Clay and milk.

Q: For the juices [unintelligible].

A: Beet helps you build hydrochloric acid to digest your proteins better.

Q: You were telling me to have like two ounces a day.

A: Yeah.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Not unless you're having a digestive problem.

Q: This is strictly to make the liver work better, we were talking about that one time.

A: Well, it's to help you digest proteins to help your liver get well faster. Because you had signs of not digesting proteins well. And the hydrochloric acid would help. But as I said before, 80-90% of digestion is bacterial. Only 10-20% is enzymatic or digestive juices. The digestive juices break down larger particles of food into small molecules so the bacteria can infiltrate and eat. So basically, our food is the urine and feces of bacteria. It's their by-product.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I would say if you have a lot of exposure to that chemical, which you have been exposed, I suggest that you have maybe two a day with an egg in it and a little clay, maybe a quarter of a teaspoon per eight ounces. And whip one egg in it. Don't blend one egg in it. Just whip one egg in it.

Q: And that's eight ounces each time?

A: Each time, yeah. Eight ounces. I'd rather you do the sport formula. It's a little bit better for you than too much juice.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you have enough weight, it's not necessary. I have the milkshake for people to gain weight fast. The only thing that can make you gain weight fast on this diet is a milkshake.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: To me, the least important is juices. Least important. It helps alkalinize, but your meats and dairy and eggs are always most important. If your very sick eggs are the most important food you can eat, milk would be next. Eggs digest in about 27 minutes. It takes milk 6 to 10 hours.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, cheese to absorb poisons out of the stomach and you have a lot of formaldehyde and other industrial solvents in your stomach lining. You should be eating cheese like every 30 minutes, just a little sugar cube sized amount. There's a lot of people that need to do that. Do you have a question Joseph?

Q: I know someone that has arthritis, she has a lot of trouble with her knees, walking and stuff.

A: Yeah, those -itis boys are really nasty. A lot of people go to bed with those -itis's.

Q: The doctors have her on chemotherapy, what's that supposed to do? Is that crazy?

A: It's all absurd to me. Well their whole idea is you poison the body, the body stops doing what it's ever doing in that joint or that body part. And it does, it stops the detoxification of that particular area. But the problem is you've got toxicity there from industrial pollution. Whether it's in your food, air, water, whatever. In the body because of industrial manufacturing. They can poison the body with antibiotics or any kind of chemical. They used to give arsenic, you know, 500, 800 years ago. They would give arsenic as a recipe, as a remedy. Because it would, the body would poison the body so badly that the body took all of its energy and nutrients just to handle the arsenic. So the symptoms would leave. And they would say that was a cure. It certainly wasn't a cure, the whole body is toxic now, you're going to have a shorter life. You're going to have more colds, flus, lots of disease and illness, all kinds of compounded problems. So of course it's the stupidest thing in the world. But I don't know anybody more stupid than doctors. Really, they spend 12 years learning everything bad, and they believe it. Are the most revered profession in the world, and TV is terrible about that. That's why... I turned on the TV and saw Oleanderland, White Oleander, which she starred in. And here she is today, this is so weird. But first there was that nurse, that new nurse something, new TV series. Nurse Jackie. And they had been giving this little boy chemotherapy. Oh, his results are good and good and good, and the parents praised them. I mean, almost on their knees praising nurse, I keep wanting to say nurse Betty, but it's ugly Betty and nurse Jackie. So, you know, this kind of brainwashing goes on with ER, and back in my days, which I was on, I was on Medical Center, you know, with Chad Everett and James Daly. And always, they revered the doctors, you know, rarely they would attack them. And it was always justified when they attacked, because you got bad people in every profession. But majority of it, you know, they praised doctors. And they lie. These people who write it, I have no medical background, and they're just writers. And they believe what they're told. What happened over there? Somebody pass wind?

Q: No, it's cold.

[laughter]

A: I thought maybe the dogs went over there and did something.

Q: The ground isn't shaking as much over there.

A: Okay, do you have a question back there?

Q: Yes, you've heard of the cavitation cases, where you know, the cancer or the heart problems on... Either root canals or extract the wisdom teeth and they get infected. The gum seals up over the bacteria, which supposedly are... They turn into anaerobic bacteria because of the oxygen starvation. They get more deadly that way. They creep into the bone, and then it causes osteonecrosis.

A: Yeah, that whole theory was written by a B-movie writer. Pretty bad. You have to understand that bacteria is always good. In the human body, it's natural bacteria that's all good. The only bacterias that are bad are man-made bacterias like the E. coli 157H7. That was manufactured, G.E. manufactured, General Electric. And then they put it out there as being part of nature. It's not part of nature. So, the bacteria, you can, the gums can heal over an infection. But that doesn't mean that it's a bad thing. You cannot get a tooth problem to cause cancer. If you have cancer as a result of some relationship with a tooth, it's because you've had mercury and thallium from a lot of amalgams that were in the mouth. It's gone through the nervous system and back down to that area and settled in that area. And then that kills all the cells. Cancer, again, is nothing other than cells collecting because your body has stopped dissolving dead cells. So, what's it going to do with dead cells? They have to be liquefied and removed to get out of the body. Otherwise, they're too large to pass through membranes. You can never perspire it out of the body. So, those cells have to be dissolved to be eliminated. If you can't do it, they'll collect as fibroid tumors or as other kinds of tumors. Warts are tumors. The body can't dissolve it. It just grows them on the skin. It can't even let them go. So, you know, usually if you get some, like after those poison injections that I got, I got a big wart here. And it was very large, probably about the size of a bullet. You know, at the back end, at the fire pin end, the flat end. It was about that big. And I just kept putting my saliva on it, and it would come off layer... Every two days, a layer would come off of the saliva. When I didn't use the saliva, it stopped coming off. There, the bacteria is working again. The bacteria here digests and breaks down. Breaks down what? The foods that we normally eat, which are supposed to be, that bacteria is acidic, so it should be dairy and animal products. If we have acidic bacteria here, we eat alkaline foods. Does it make any sense? 90% of our digestive juices are acidic and belong to digesting acidic foods. We have about 10% that are alkaline, and that's only because we're used to eating them. Alkalinizing foods. The Maasai and the Samburu don't eat fruit, they don't eat vegetables. They don't chew on it like gorillas and spit out the pulp. They just eat the raw dairy and the raw meats. And they have no alkalinity in their entire digestive tract. Sure, we can adjust to a diet of alkalinity, but that doesn't mean it's right and healthy for us. So the bacteria in a tooth is not going to create cancer. The poisons always cause cancer. They kill cells. Your body can't dissolve the cells, so they collect, you have tumors. Do you have a question?

Q: No.

A: Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, I'm just curious if you can recommend a good source of lamb and beef, except in the North, where I buy some fresh meat.

A: Yeah, Miller Organic Farms is where I get all of mine. Are you local?

Q: Yeah, I'm from [unintelligible].

A: Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible], Orange County.

A: Okay. Well, our co-op here in Venice, Rawesome, carries lamb, pork, and if they don't have it, you can always order it.Every week we have a shipment that comes from Pennsylvania, from Miller Organic Farms. Pardon?

Q: Do you have lamb and beef? 

A: Lamb and beef and, well, they get mostly the North Star Bison Buffalo. And they are not supposed to send us any breeding females, because she vaccinates the breeding females. So they're not supposed to be sending us any vaccinated female meat, nor any byproducts of those buffalo. Do you have a question?

Q: The meat that we buy in the store, they're grass-fed, where I am, and then they're also organic. But the grass-fed, they came into [unintelligible]. I don't know what that means, but does that mean that they give, is it better just to get organic meat, or is it better just to get grass-fed?

A: I would get the grass-fed, because it spent, you know, 99% of its life eating grass.

Q: And what do they do at the end?

A: They'll feed them a lot of grain to fatten them up.

Q: Okay, but it's not necessarily that they give them antibiotics?

A: No.

Q: Why is that better than organic?

A: Well, organic, they can feed them mainly grain, and then they'll get very fat, and their tissue aren't as strong. Cows, 98% of their diet is grasses, and only 2% is grain. When I used to go to my grandparents' farm, I would watch the cows eat, and they would eat grasses and grasses, and they like dried grass almost more than they like fresh grass for some reason. So they like straw, they like hay, and that's why you can feed them that in the winter completely, and I guess that's part of their diet for wintertime. But when you feed them grain, their hooves, too much grain, their hooves start cracking, you have to kill them earlier in their life before they start breaking down with disease. So that's what I learned from my grandparents' farm. And we had to be very careful because they were mainly a dairy, and you couldn't have the females splitting their hooves because it would affect the milk and everything else. So they were only allowed 2% grain, so they got two cups of grain at each milking, and that's it. But when they were out in the field, they would suck up the seed, only after it had ripened and turned brown and had fallen off the grasses, and they would suck it up with the dirt, like that, and then eat the grain. So they would eat grain, and there's a lot of people that say, like Sally Fallon, say you shouldn't feed them any grain. Hello? They eat grain. So I would say get the best you can get, grazed would be best, organic is next. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes, I have a lot of questions, but this will be one of them. You mentioned how important eggs are to be eaten to get well, and some recommend to be just eaten whole without being whipped, but others can be put in a milkshake. So why the difference?

A: Eggs eaten alone will digest within 27 minutes. When eggs are in a milkshake, it's going to be the length of time that it takes to digest milk, 6 to 10 hours. If you want quick energy, clarity, and not necessarily you need to build mucus or put on more weight, then you eat the eggs alone.

Q: How come you sometimes get acid after you eat eggs? If you wait too long or something?

A: Well, eggs are an acidic food. It's like a meat, so you're going to get acidic. And if your body is using it to help you detoxify something, you're going to have more acidity. But are you talking about the mouth or generally in your body?

Q: In your stomach.

A: Everybody's stomach is loaded with toxins. The stomach makes hydrochloric acid, which dissolves bone and anything. Yet the hydrochloric acid won't dissolve stomach. So think about that. The stomach is so resilient. Poisons, most of the poisons, like from vaccines, I see in 90, probably 92 to 95% of the people, stores in the stomach lining. So when you have those poisons in the stomach, sometimes the body will use the fats from the eggs and the protein from the eggs to draw the poisons out of the stomach lining. That's what you're experiencing. It isn't the nature of the eggs. I eat up to 50 eggs a day sometimes and never get that acidic reaction. Of course, I have no hydrochloric acid in my stomach either because of the vagotomy. You were asking a little bit more depth of that question.

Q: Yes, because I had a friend, you had responded to an email that I sent you about a friend who was losing her kidney. It was a transplanted kidney. She didn't get to get on your program, unfortunately, before she...

A: Had the transplant.

Q: Completely, well, she lost it totally. She lost the transplant in four and a half years. But you did mention...

A: Someone else's...

Q: Oh, just stop...

A: Stop. Pardon?

Q: All the tapes are running out, right?

A: Yeah.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Okay.

Q: But anyway, you had recommended that she not put the eggs, but just eat it whole.

A: Correct.

Q: So if you put it, like, in a shot glass and just, like, [unintelligible]. Well, you said the cream takes a long time to digest.

A: Cream takes a very... Cream is the... Of all the foods that we eat, cream is the hardest to digest.

Q: And you mentioned it in the milkshake, though. She should have it in the milkshake. So if it's so hard to digest, should we even put it in the milkshake?

A: To gain weight, absolutely.

Q: Oh, for weight gain.

A: Yeah. To gain mucus, to gain all that, you need the cream. But there's not much cream in it. Putting, like, two, three tablespoons per milkshake.

Q: I put two tablespoons.

A: You put what?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's a good thing. Yes, you need weight, definitely, so...

Q: I'm skinny here.

A: Right now I'm using, like, you know, almost a cup per gallon. Because I need to put on weight before I go to Asia again. I can't get cream over there, so I just get the milk, you know, not all the time. Allison, do you have a question?

Q: I do. I get really bad headaches every month, or I'd say it's one really bad headache. Probably a migraine. And I think it's because of my period. It only started happening maybe, I would say, about a year ago. But I don't really know what to do because when I'm in that space, I can't think straight and it gets pretty bad.

Q: It's your right eye, too.

Q: Oh yeah, and I had eye surgery when I was 18 because I had crossed eyes and they fixed it. But the headache is always on the eye that had the surgery done. And it is so painful, and I don't know why.

A: Because they used mercurochrome or methylate or iodine during the surgery. So you've got probably quite a pocket of it there. And when your hormones increase, you increase the fat availability in the blood and the neurological system and the lymph. Because your hormones are anywhere from 60 to 80% fat.

Q: Okay, so I increase the fat...

A: So when you have your period, you increase hormonal activity and then your body uses it to detox.

Q: Oh, so detox is a good thing.

A: Yeah, but what you need to do is put a hot water bottle in that area.

Q: I do cold and hot because it feels like the cold seems to take away the pressure. And then I do hot because it feels good.

A: It expands so there's less pressure. The cold, of course, will shrink everything, but it also, you know, you don't clean out the toxins. So don't use the cold for any more than a minute at a time.

Q: I just kind of go numb, I feel my whole body detached. And I just, I cry, and I don't know what else to do.

A: That's all you can do besides, you know, you could have some clay and milk together. I would say take, for your condition, with that kind of toxicity localized in the eye. And where the, you know, the muscle is, as it goes into the brain. It coats that whole thing.

Q: If I drive long distances or I knit too long, like there, my eye gets really [unintelligible].

A: Yeah, because it starts, more circulation in there will cause it to detox.

Q: Okay.

A: So have about one and a half tablespoons of clay. Moist clay that's level, one and a half level, or one heaping tablespoon. Of the moist clay. And put that in about four ounces of milk. And drink that over about a ten minute period. It tastes a little like chocolate milk for some reason. When you use the terramin clay with the milk. Don't use honey or anything else, just the clay and milk. And that will provide plenty of minerals to help bind with that toxicity. Because methylate and mercurochrome are both liquid mercury. And they also use iodine. They are antibiotics, antiseptics, because they are caustic. They kill cells. They kill anything. And of course they're going to irritate and burn cells. They're going to etch their way into a cell. And if it's a nerve cell, it's going to be very painful. And the eye is full of nerves.

Q: Should she be sweating a lot too? Should she be trying to pull the toxins out that way?

A: That's helpful, definitely. But if you get the whole body involved and the nutrients need to go here, then it could be a problem. I also always say when you've got a pain, a specific pain that isn't systemic, keep the heat to the localized area. So the body will use most of its nutrients on that localized condition.

Q: Do you think that there's a reason why it's gotten worse over the past year? Or is it just because my body's healthier?

A: Your body's healthier and cleaning it now. A lot of people who have such surgeries end up with eye cancer or brain cancer right around the ear. So, you know, as they get, you know, 40, 39 to 46 years old. So your body's going to take care of it before you get there.

Q: But how is she to eliminate? Because you're saying, you know, reduce the pain, you know, take the terramin clay and the milk.

A: No, the terramin clay absorbs it.

Q: And then how do you eliminate it? How is she supposed to eliminate it, though?

A: She can eliminate it out the skin. She does. She breaks out. You can see she has a skin condition.

Q: And then also, when I sleep, sleep really helps. It's the only cure for it. If I sleep for a good, you know, 12 hours, then I'm fine, you know. But sleep really helps.

Q: Why should she drink it for 10 minutes?

A: If you drink it too fast, it can cause the body to rush too much of the blood to the stomach. Any time anybody has a painful condition, they should always consume food slowly.

Q: But you told me to take the same thing. Can I just drink it down or do I have to [unintelligible]?

A: You can just drink yours down. You're not in pain. If you're in pain, then I would drink it slowly. Also, when you get a certain kind of nutrient too concentrated at one time, like clay, it's not a good idea. I always drink it slowly. I drink everything, eat everything slowly. I don't do anything fast.

Q: Do you blend that up or does it all just [unintelligible]?

A: I blend it for one second.

Q: And then doesn't the clay just kind of go to the bottom?

A: It doesn't at all, not in milk. In water and other fluids it will, but not in milk. It suspends. Well, that's room temperature milk that's slightly moving toward kefir. All my milk is that way.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you don't want cold milk.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I'm sorry, I couldn't hear you. Britton, B-R-I-T-T-O-N, Britton. Tomas.

Q: What does he charge?

A: About half of what they charge here, sometimes less.

Q: Does he do it in succession or is it one at a time?

A: Well, he'll do it however you want to do it. When I had mine done in 1978, I had one whole, two quadrants done one day and the next morning. So, I had four hours of drilling one morning, four hours of drilling the next morning, but no Novocaine. And back then, they had no water jet. So, the drill bit would get really hot and that's what caused most of the pain because the drill bit would burn the nerve and then you'd have a burn on the nerve, which would last days. So, I had a signal where I would touch the dentist's elbow to let him know he had to dip the drill bit into cold water before he could start drilling again. And I also ate some marijuana, fresh green leaf marijuana for pain and that helped.

Q: Did he replace those with porcelain?

A: He'll do anything you want. If you ask for porcelain he'll use porcelain. If you want composite, he'll use composite.

Q: Is there one better than the other?

A: Porcelain is always better, you know, even though it's a very hard, composite's a very hard plastic. There's a slight bit of BPA that gets into it, bisphenol phosphate, that get into your system. I still use them though. I'm eating enough, you know, nutrients that I don't worry about it.

Q: How do you get over the border to his place? Do you just take a taxi or...?

A: No, I drive over. It's ten minutes from the border, twelve minutes at the most. So I drive over. And he's third generation dentist. He's very good. He's very gentle. He's like a bear.

Q: But is it safe with the people there?

A: Pardon?

Q: Is it safe in Mexico?

A: I've never had a problem. Do you have a question, Mark?

Q: Sure, yeah. It's actually about getting a new car. How long does it take for a car, a brand new car, to off-gas? Is that an issue? Because we hear like if you get a new car, it's like the worst toxins.

A: Oh, it is. With all that plastic and you've got dioxins, you've got everything gassing from it.

Q: It's actually a 2008, right?

Q: Well, it's never been used, I don't think it's ever been used.

A: What I do is whenever I get a new vehicle, I will open the windows and let the sun hit it so that it's baking, but with the windows down, and I'll do it for 30 days before I drive in it without the windows up. With the windows up, I won't drive it with the windows up. And I usually will not drive it for that 30 days. But if you have the windows up and you don't bake it in the sun, it could take a year or more. Five years it could take.

Q: A comment, too, about Whole Foods. I called them when that incident happened several places. This is the response that I got from everybody. People were getting sick from the raw milk, so they had to pull it.

A: That's a lie.

Q: And then I researched on the news and read the article that came out saying they had to pull up because they wanted to redo the regulations and the insurance. So I'm sitting here thinking, who got sick? They're telling their employees to tell people that people got sick from raw milk? It's disgusting.

A: And every time the CDC says that people got sick, it's always association and never by laboratory evidence.

Q: Like because they just got the flu or something?

A: Yeah. Well, you know, people eat a lot of preservatives and chemicals in their food every day. I would be going after that, of course, causing diarrhea and vomit. I certainly wouldn't go after bacteria in milk. But like I say, there are invested interests on keeping everybody very sick. Look what the government's doing. I mean, robbing the till, robbing the till of the people. If the people were healthy and clear of mind, the government wouldn't get away with that. So they want you not well, because you're going to be involved in your illness and your pain, your family, taking care of your family. So they want to keep you busy. And let them do what they want to run the world, [unintelligible] game they play. Do you have a question?

Q: Two things. First, as part of the menstrual cycle, mine's always been very long and very intense. Is there anything that we should be doing to change that? Because I'm just out for three days.

A: Like I said in my book, We Want to Live, add mushrooms with a salad or vegetable juice, and a little bit of the mushrooms. I found that eating mushrooms also with meat is helpful. I said five mushrooms a day with a salad for five days before your period's due. However, I would change that now to one mushroom with each vegetable juice and two vegetable juices, at least two vegetable juices, and then two mushrooms or three mushrooms with a meat meal, or one and a half with two meat meals for each day. Still consider them being five mushrooms a day.

Q: Okay [unintelligible] don't eat them all at once. So add with the juicing, add it to the juice.

A: Correct.

Q: Okay.

A: Well, no, you eat it and then drink your juice.

Q: Oh, okay. And that should lighten the period, or should it just the intensity, like the pain?

A: It should eliminate the pain.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah. And it should shorten the period. You have to understand that a period is to dissolve ovum and sperm that is absorbed into the uterine wall, or that the eggs that come down, the ovum that comes down, it needs to be washed out, because the cervix is very, very tight. It's anal retentive. So nothing passes without hormonal activity to open the cervix, and then the blood has to flush it out. It's that tight. So it takes a period cycle of a lot of hormones with blood to clean it. If it didn't, you could have multiple pregnancies on many different parts of the cervix, and how many people could stand 10 to 20 per pregnancies at a time. So that is the cycle. Usually once the egg is impregnated, then the whole cycle stops of cleaning, but then the ovum isn't produced anymore until birth again. But each month it will wash out any eggs that did not get impregnated. So if none got impregnated, then they would wash it out. But the ovum can live for about seven days. The sperm can only live for three days. But the older an ovum gets, the weaker the child will be. So the body has to have a way to flush it out. So that's the way it does it. Now, in most animals, there's very little blood loss. In humans, it's prolific because of all the toxins in the body. So the blood is getting rid of other toxins that store in the ovaries, in the uterus, in the cervix. Flush it out. Most of the time, if you want to slow down and reduce the bleeding, and the body can do it, and it's not full of mercury or thallium or something like that where it needs to bleed a lot, then just drinking some green cabbage juice, like five days before your period, have a half a cup for two days. By the third day, you'll have enough vitamin K and vitamin U to stop excessive bleeding. The mushrooms for the pain.

Q: My next issue is with sleep. Ever since I was born, I've never slept well, and it just seems to get worse. And when I do sleep, it's never really restful sleep. I'm always dreaming nightmares, lots of nightmares. Is there anything that I, food-wise, that could...

A: Did everybody hear that? Okay. When you're restless and sleep and have a lot of nightmares, it means that you have toxicity that's in the neurological system, psychotropic chemicals that are in the brain. And that releases nightmares, releases them. It's like exercise for the brain and nervous system. And if that is happening, your body's detoxifying when there's no life, while you're in sleep. So you're not going to be able to sleep well between midnight and 5 o'clock in the morning. So if I were you, I would adopt a different sleep program. I would sleep somewhere around 7, 8 o'clock in the evening, get up somewhere around 1 or 2 o'clock when my body awakened me, and then be productive until 5 o'clock and then take a nap.

Q: Yeah, it's funny. Right after 5, right around like 5.30-6, if I go back to sleep, I have the best, like two hours of sleep.

A: That's it.

Q: Really only the rejuvenating sleep I get.

A: Yeah, because as soon as just a hint of light comes over the horizon at 5, 5, 30, the nervous system stops detoxifying. But as soon as it goes down, it starts by midnight, it's in full. And if you're into an intense detoxification with some very caustic chemicals, you're not going to sleep beyond 1, 1, 30, 2 o'clock.

Q: That's usually when I'm awakened by intense nightmares. I look at the clock, it's right around 1, 1, 30.

A: That's it. So set your alarm clock to 12, 30 so you have to get up and do something to avoid those nightmares.

Q: That's really helpful. Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Do you have a question Lisa?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: BioKleen is 80% made from seed oils, like grapefruit seeds. And just remember, all fats, almost all your soaps are made of fats. They used to make soaps out of lard. They'd take pig lard fat and mix it with lye, and there you would have a soap. I have a friend who makes coconut oil soap and just has a coconut oil, a very expensive oil that we eat. He puts lye in it to make the soap. Now, the lye is a hardener. It hardens the oil so it can be, as soon as water is added to it, it will act as an emulsifier and a solvent to break things down to get rid of dirt or caustic compounds. So that's preferable. Almost all of your other soaps are made with petroleum fat, not seed oils. Very cheap, also very caustic and very toxic.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, it will get into everything. It gets into your hands if you wash them with your hands.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you have to understand that they cut those down to get into the sun. They cut those with either kerosene or a kerosene derivative. Well, we can pull the whole table over. Or let's bring this chair over and put it all on the chair. That makes it easy. How about right there. Bring it all over by Mark. Thank you. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's all I use is coconut cream on my body.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, I just, I use it, well, once it's fermented, you know, I start using it. Well, when it's cold, it never ferments up in the mountains where I am, so I can never get my coconut fermented, coconut cream fermented during the winter, like right now. But during the spring and summer and fall, when it gets warm enough, then it takes, you know, probably three days to ferment.

Q: Because I've been trying to shift Jay to, like, just coconut cream. Everybody in my household to shift to BioKleen.

A: Right.

Q: And now he's saying, well, I can't shave with the coconut cream because it doesn't get the hairs off.

A: That's funny, that's, but if you leave it on, that's the only thing I [unintelligible].

Q: No, but I get, as a black person, I get ingrown hairs viciously. That's what I get, that's what I was trying to [unintelligible] about earlier. So when I talked to Max, Max said use sheep butter. But I use the, that, and it just, it worsens my ingrown hairs.

A: Alright, the coconut cream [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, coconut cream is the only thing I can shave with without cutting myself and without getting ingrown hair. But I leave it on my face for maybe 10 minutes before I shave. And it softens the...

Q: Because he had a thing that had essential oils in it.

A: But the coconut oils may be breaking something down in your skin and it's collecting in one spot.

Q: So then, like, if people use essential oils in their households, I'm like, okay, they could [unintelligible]. They're natural, but I have one roommate who [unintelligible]. And she reacts to everything, anything that's essential oils.

A: Essential oils are very toxic. They're distilled oils. And anything is distilled... Any oil that's distilled is caustic and just eats into a cell. The cell has no option but to absorb it. So is that why he can shave better with essential oils?

Q: Because it's breaking, it's like poisonous, like cutting in there and cleaning out the cells.

A: Dissolving the...

Q: Well, he feels like it's better, but it's actually poisonous.

A: It's dissolving, yeah, it's dissolving the hair.

Q: So does he use coconut cream or coconut oil?

A: I used to, you know, whip an egg and use egg.

Q: Why?

A: But it turns dry sometimes while I'm shaving and still cut myself, but coconut cream is the only thing I can shave without ever cutting myself.

Q: What about, what about, mixed with the sheep better?

A: I would say that's a good mix.

Q: But not so, otherwise, like even castor oil is bad.

A: All of that stuff, it's chemicals, yeah, there's heavy chemicals in it. And those oils that make fragrance are caustic, kerosene-derived, you know, substances, which penetrate a cell. A cell doesn't have a choice. It's like taking battery acid and putting it on you, or gasoline. It's going to eat right into your skin.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, it'll, yep, definitely.

Q: [unintelligible] "Well it's all natural!" [unintelligible]

A: No, it's not natural. That's the lie. It's like Whole Foods saying go organic, go organic, and they only carry 2% organic. It's a sales pitch. It's a lie to get you to say, oh, well, I'm getting natural food. I'm going to Whole Foods.

Q: Did you read about that thing that they make in china [unintelligible]?

A: That is all a setup, too. That's a setup for the FDA to take more power. It's all a setup. It's a game they're playing so they can control your food completely.

Q: Wow. Oh my god.

A: I only use coconut cream. Fermented coconut cream. Old coconut cream.

Q: How long can it ferment?

Q: Well, for example, the coconut cream, I can get a jar and bring it and set it in the sun here on this patio here.

A: It'll ferment in 10 hours.

Q: Yeah. I can wait for the next morning and it's ready to go.

Q: What does it do for you?

A: Well, you've got some alcohol in it, and alcohol and the fat together will dissolve dirt, grease.

Q: Oh, the alcohol does. That would get some dirt off your hands?

A: Yeah.

Q: Veins or something?

A: But the oil that's left, the coconut oil, is only about 8% of the coconut cream. So you're not getting an excessive amount of oil, but enough just to make the skin clean. So, like I went into my hot tub this morning, I only take a bath every seven days. I'm that clean where I don't have to worry about stinking. But what I do is I took my coconut cream thinly, you know, I mixed a little water with it, just a tiny bit, and put it on my skin, and look at the 63-year-old skin.

Q: Everybody wants to wash their hands all the time. People are kind of like, oh, I touched your dog, oh, I touched your, I'm going to wash my hands in your sink, where's the soap, and then they start freaking out. And I'm always like, it's not going to hurt you.

A: You can't help those people. They believe all of the stuff, you know, that our world is toxic. Our world is toxic with chemicals, not with bacteria and animals. 

Q: I know, especially animals. They go, oh, I don't want to touch you. Or they lick me. They go, oh, they licked, your dog licked you. And I go, good thing. They go, oh.

A: Okay, we'll go around again. Do you have a question, [unintelligible]?

Q: Yeah, for headaches, and my headaches, I think Allison brought up. My headaches, I had a head injury. And they usually start with a head injury, and I have a front, and then they work their way to the back. The [unintelligible] is on the right side. Usually if I get sick, it always starts with a headache.

A: Well, did you have any kind of medical help for that injury?

Q: No, no, they didn't... They took x-rays, but they couldn't read the x-rays.

A: You had x-rays. All of a sudden there, you've got molecular change in chemistry of your brain and nerves. So, and there's a lot of toxins when nerve tissue is irradiated. There's like almost 100 times more toxins formed than other type of tissue because of the metallic nature of nerves and neurons.

Q: But that happened 20 years ago, so...

A: I had this surgery done 42 years ago, and I'm still suffering from it. I still vomit all of the... They used both methylate, which is liquid mercury, and iodine on that surgery here. I still have lumps under here. This used to be up to inch and a half wide and three quarters of an inch high. That's why they irradiated me and cauterized my spine. They had it going like this, you know, the radiation gun. And I would lay there for ten minutes, get a whole ten minutes of radiation. So they cauterized my entire spine. But this used to be all lumpy, and I used coconut cream on it, and you see it's pretty much dissolved. But I do still have lumps under there, very small ones. They get smaller every year. But I still have lumps there from all of that caustic iodine and whatever else chemicals they use, that methylate and the mercury. So there are knots there. All of these from here up have gone and disappeared. But from here up I have about probably eight lumps in there still full of that garbage. Forty-two years ago.

Q: Well, what do I do for the headaches now?

A: I would do the clay and the milk together. For yours, because of that caustic nature of the irradiated nerve tissue, I would probably use a half a teaspoon of vinegar with four ounces of milk and a level tablespoon of clay. And I would have that while you have the headache three times daily. And as soon as the headache is gone, then stop.

Q: Usually it will last to the morning, just before the morning, and it will fade. The last one that I had, it went already to the afternoon. I lost a day's work. It's not good for me.

A: The vinegar and the clay and the milk will probably mitigate it to where it won't cause a problem. There's no way you're going to stop it completely. But you can mitigate it 80-85%. I'm just going to turn around here.

Q: I did this ten months ago. And so, yeah, it went all the way down to about here. So it's healed up and it's starting to heal here. But I'm still trying to put, wrap it with beef.

A: Beef is not the thing to use now. Beef is just to make sure the skin seals it. Coconut cream will dissolve the scars. It's like this here. This was from, this part of it was a motorcycle accident. This was all that stuff that was injected into me. But still, I mean, most of the scar tissue is going away quickly. But I put the coconut cream on it. I'll put sperm on it or also a bone marrow. And that brings it back to life. You see this was all a burn? You see how that's burn tissue? That was the chemical burning it. This one still is pretty burned. It's not moving as quickly. But, you know, just six months ago, this was all very wrinkled burn tissue. And it's diminished by about 75 percent. 

Q: When did that happen? 

A: This was a year ago. But this stuff... 

Q: July, when you were here last time.

A: No, it was in April it happened.

Q: Oh, April.

A: April 2nd is when I was abducted and given those three shots. And then this happened ten days after that on the 12th of April. So it's its birthday.

Q: So you're saying coconut cream.

A: Coconut cream will dissolve it.

Q: What's this when you touch that?

A: That's scar tissue, dead cells that have collected there.

Q: The coconut cream will dissolve it.

A: It helps dissolve it. Also, bone marrow helps dissolve it. Sperm will help dissolve it.

Q: Did you once say that the ejaculate has those toxins in it and a man should not ejaculate on a woman?

A: No, I said it can. There's a lot of fat in sperm. And the testes are quite predominantly fat. Did you ever eat the testes of a buffalo? Well, we sell them up at the... And they're very rich. It's like clams or oysters with butter. No, it's almost like... Have you ever had urchin? Yeah, have you ever had urchin? In a sushi bar, you haven't had urchin. They look like tongues. It just tastes like that. The buffalo testes taste like that. Anyway, it's rich in fat, so toxins can go to that area. Heavy metals. So if the sperm smells like metallic minerals, don't swallow it.

Q: What if it smells like vinegar?

A: Don't use it. That's normal.

Q: So how do you know if it's heavy metals?

A: If it smells like metals. If it smells like a coin. When you touch coins and you have that smell on your fingers, if the sperm smells like that, don't use it.

Q: [unintelligible] a condom or something?

A: Well, don't let them ejaculate inside.

Q: So you can put it on your skin if it's not toxic. 

A: I'm not in favor of condoms because of all the toxins that are in the condoms. They get worked into the female. Because on the man, it usually stays in one place. So the friction is on the woman. So all those toxins, the BPAs, all that stuff gets into the vaginal cavity. It deadens it. I'm not for condoms.

Q: You suggested coconut oil before too, though, for sex.

A: But if you use oil with a condom, it will dissolve the condom.

Q: They have natural skin condoms, don't they?

A: Pardon?

Q: Lamb skin condoms or natural skin condoms.

A: Yeah, you can use those. They're better, but still, they're processed, made, and hardened. They have to use a, what do they call it, a polymer and an adhesive to get it to make it. So it isn't just a heat process. Like, you can take rubber and use a heat rubber and heat plastic into a shape without using a glue. But with the animal cells, you have to have a glue and a polymer, which is a drying substance. Okay. Mike, do you have a question? Do you have a question, Mark?

Q: Along with the headaches, I get really moody.

A: You're too thin.

Q: So that's probably it. So yeah, and I get really emotional. And I have a tendency to start thinking negatively instead of looking on the bright side. So I started doing high meat, and I was wondering how often I should do it. And I tried it a couple days ago.

A: Finally. It will work wonderfully. I have one person on the diet from Nevada City, bear of a guy, huge guy. And he was very antisocial. It was like he was on his period every day and had headaches every day. And not a nice person. And he became a landscape artist so that he didn't have to deal with people. And, you know, plants aren't going to hassle him or he doesn't have to communicate with the plants. So no problem there. So he got on the diet and was on and off, very moody as he always was. And I said, you know, you've got to try the high meat to see if it changes. It changes people's lives, even the first time they have it. In 10 to 20 minutes you'll know if it works for you. I said, and there's only one person I heard of that didn't do a thing for them, that they weren't depressed anyway. You know, but it didn't make him giddy like it makes most people who are depressed. It makes them happy. And so he finally did it. And this is an antisocial person. For him to come to a workshop was a difficulty. He was back in a corner away from everybody. And he was a big guy, like six foot and a bear, you know, like 230 pounds. Like you, you know. I like that. But he was even bigger because he had fat on top of his muscle, you're all muscle. So all of a sudden he called me and he said, I'm eating two pounds of IV today and I've been doing it for a month. Is that okay? Will I hurt myself? If that's all you ever eat in your life, that's fine. There are animals that only eat high meat. Alligators, crocodiles will take their kill and bury them in the bottom of the lake where they start bubbling and blistering and full of putrid bacteria. And then they'll eat them because they're predigested. A lot of animals will do that. A fly spits its acids and bacteria on what it's going to eat and dissolves it before it sucks it up into its proboscis. So it's not a bad thing. So the next time, the next year, he had six months of eating it every day, and that's all he eats. He's so big, he eats two pounds of meat a day, and it's all high. Every bit of it's high. And I went to the workshop, and there he is with three number 10 girlfriends. All of them were model-looking girls. And this guy's only a six, you know. But he became so funny and had such a great personality. He had three girlfriends that were in the same room and liked each other. That's personality. So that's what high meat can do for you.

Q: And gaining weight?

A: The high meat won't help you gain weight. The only thing that's going to help you gain weight is milkshakes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: But milk won't help you gain weight fast. Milkshakes do. The cream, the egg, the honey, and the milk.

Q: What about lubes, don't they make you gain weight with the butter?

A: For some reason, some people they will, but some people they won't. They don't affect me. Milkshakes do. A lot of people, the lubrication formulas actually lubricate and don't add weight. But he's got so much muscle mass, he needs a lot of fat. So it'll probably turn into fat on him.

Q: Sometimes I drink the milkshake, I love the shake. Sometimes I get bloated.

A: That's the cream, it's difficult to digest. It usually means that you're not producing enough bile or good quality bile. So the things that help form bile are a combination of leeks and beets. Leeks and beets, juice. Two ounces of each or one ounce of each a day is usually enough.

Q: So if you want to drink your milkshake but you don't want to get fat.

A: The leeks and the beets just have to be together.

Q: If you don't want to get fat, maybe you don't need to, but I don't think I need to get fat. So could I just like leave off the cream?

A: Yeah, you can.

Q: I can do that?

A: Yeah, you can do that. Because there's enough cream in the milk if you don't need to gain weight. But if you need to gain weight, you have to add the cream. 

Q: Sometimes you said just eggshakes with more eggs than milk.

A: That's when you need a lot more protein and you don't need a lot of, you know, you need to build muscle and have energy and clarity. And that reduces the amount of weight you will put on.

Q: She has a question about high eggs.

Q: Well, I was just wondering, you know, I've cracked some eggs and they were like, like sometimes an egg will be like gross.

A: Oh, yes. Wonderful.

Q: Yeah, you know, I just don't think I wanted to suck an egg out of a shell that's gross. I think it was just like...

A: Well, break it into a glass and then drink it.

Q: So it doesn't matter...

A: But do it out of the house because it will stink up the house for a day.

Q: What about you? Will you smell for a day?

A: No, it doesn't for some reason. I mean, it's on the breath for about 20 minutes and that's it.

Q: Is it sulfur?

A: No, the sulfur doesn't make that odor. It's actually the bacteria, the types of bacteria that break it down. But by creating that odor, the byproduct is an oil that will transform the body and not smell that way. The body can digest it like that.

Q: He had one and it made him throw up right away.

Q: Yeah, I had a smoothie and I put six eggs in it and two of them were high. I mean, it stank in the house, but I drank it down anyway.

Q: But you had one that made you throw up one day, didn't you?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Why does it make him throw up so fast?

A: Well, if the body uses the bacteria in the stomach lining to dump poisons.Anytime you vomit, it's from the poisons dumping into the stomach, usually not what you eat unless they're chemicals.

Q: Pulling them in there real quick.

A: Yep. Anytime you eat, the poisons in the stomach lining are going to dump a little bit at a time into your food, poison your food. That's why I tell everybody to eat a little bit of cheese before they eat anything. And then wait ten minutes. If you're eating an egg after that, you can wait five minutes. Sometimes I tell people wait five minutes because it'll pull more toxins out. I don't tell them that, but that's why I tell them if I tell you to eat eggs five minutes after the cheese, I'm intending to pull some toxins out of your stomach lining. Otherwise, you have the cheese, you wait ten minutes, it'll just dump into the cheese and never get into the food.

Q: I just have a question, actually. We eat a lot of starches. We kind of got into that for some reason.

A: What kind?

Q: He said rice.

Q: Potatoes and rice. With butter.

A: Yeah.

Q: We wait until it cools, and then we put lots of butter on it.

A: But why do you have a lot of it?

Q: I don't have that.

Q: We crave it. We're trying not to. We want to know how good or bad it is.

A: Well, it's not good to have a lot of it, because you have the acrylamides that will form, and all the other sugar byproducts, carbohydrate byproducts that form, including the advanced glycation end products. They collect and Columbia University proved that they collect in the human body 70% to 90% for a lifetime. Of course, if you're on this diet, you're going to be able to break down a lot of it and get rid of it, but it takes time. It takes nutrients and it takes energy from your body to do it. I have maybe a half a cup a year, and the only reason I do it is because if I don't get milk in Asia where I'm traveling, I get too hungry, and I'll have just three tablespoons of rice with a lot of fat. It's either pig fat or beef fat or some kind of coconut cream that I'll have with that rice, and that cuts my hunger for weeks, two weeks. Then I don't have to worry about it, or even three weeks. So I have about a half a year, half a cup a year. But you're having like that probably every day?

Q: Not every day, but every other day, definitely.

Q: Why do people crave starch so much on the diet?

A: Because it does absorb toxins. I prefer using clay, I prefer using cheese all day long to absorb the toxins rather than the cooked starch.

Q: In your book, you say, to have the sourdough bread with butter.

A: Not a lot. There were seven mentions of it in the book, and I went back when I rewrote it, and I said, use the nut formula and use cheese, yes, preferably. If that doesn't work over a long period of time, have a little starch and only use it as necessary, medicinal. But I've learned a new trick, and that's the clay, pre-soaked for four or five days, mixed with milk. It really works. And eating cheese all day long. Those are good absorbers and you don't need to cook starch. Somebody's tape clicked off over here, one of these.

Q: I was going to ask a question, but then I'll wait.

A: I will go grab some milk with the dog.

[unintelligible chatter]

A: You go ahead and ask your question please.

Q: When I was on the program that you had me on, for about three and a half months, and I was doing really well, sticking with it, and then all of a sudden I just craved sugar like I've never craved before. And I'm not a sugar person. I was compelled to eat sugar. Like pastries. Yeah, it was really pastries is what I was craving. It was kind of bready and sweet at the same time.

A: Cheesecakes. Go for cheesecakes and sweeten the hell out of them. them with either honey or fruit.

Q: I don't know, it was awful.

A: Anytime you have a sweet tooth like that, it means you're lacking enzymes. So honey is the best thing to pig out on.

Q: But what if you have diabetes?

A: What does it say in my book? If you have diabetes, you better drink a cup of honey a day, eat a cup of honey, half a cup of honey a day if you have diabetes. When the bee collects the nectar, the bee swallows the nectar. It produces an insulin-like substance which converts 90% of the carbohydrate into enzymes for digesting and assimilating, utilizing fats and proteins. Proteins first, fats second. So you've got an insulin-like substance in it which diabetics can use. That's why I wanted them to have a half a cup. And I've proved in many situations, in 8 out of 10 diabetics, it lowers it rather than raises their blood sugar level. Question, Allison, do you have a question? Okay. Joseph? Okay, well, let me know when you remember. Okay. Your question?

Q: Oh, my question. Oh, I'm sorry.

Q: I thought he was looking at me.

Q: He probably was.

A: No, I wasn't. I was looking at you.

Q: Oh, okay. Sorry.

A: Am I cross-eyed?

Q: You were squinting.

Q: You mentioned in your book not to eat frozen meat.

A: Frozen anything but fruits, the only thing that can be frozen. 

Q: Because we live an hour and a half from [unintelligible], which is the freshest fish market I understand here, so, and I remember you mentioned that you pack your meat, if you pack it in jars, you can save...

A: Weeks.

Q: For weeks.

A: Months.

Q: Your son will not get sick eating...

A: Correct.

Q: Kidney failure.

A: Well, he needs lots of bacteria. There's nothing that brings your kidney back faster than bacteria.

Q: So he can eat fish that's a couple weeks old?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Wow.

A: Should be eating it. Yeah. One of the problems with the kidney is it stops producing ammonia, and that's the ability to separate red blood cells out, because the job of the kidney is to remove H2O from the system, because it either has gotten too toxic, or the body's cold and needs to get rid of fluid. So the kidney's job is to separate the red and white blood cells, so you're not pissing out your red and white blood cells, and you go anemic every time you urinate. The kidney does not separate anything else, and it produces ammonia to do that. The pharmaceutical house says, oh, it's cleaning the blood. It doesn't clean the blood. That's what I said, that it cleans the blood. It's absolute bullshit. It does filter out the waste products and dump it, some of it. But it's really not a dump site. We're not supposed to be eating stuff that's toxic.We're not supposed to have all those poisons in us. Everything we urinate and defecate should be able to be eaten by other species that eat fecal matter and urine. And of course, everything in the ground eats urine. It's nitrogen. And in the ground... There are lots of animals that eat feces, human feces, dogs, birds. Many animals eat feces. We shouldn't be toxic. So the kidney has taken on a job of cleansing the blood while it's trying to separate the blood and the red and white blood cells from the serum so it doesn't dump the red and white blood cells because you'd be anemic. So the body produces ammonia to allow the separation, the natural separation, the easy separation of the red and white blood cells. When the kidneys stop producing ammonia, it can no longer separate the red and white blood cells and the body is not discharging the fluids properly. But even if your kidneys didn't work and you were on a proper diet your whole lifetime, you wouldn't have that toxicity. You'd be perspiring it so your skin would have more of an odor.

Q: So you wouldn't have to be on dialysis?

A: No, no.

Q: If you perspired it out. But that's the key.

A: Anybody comes to me on dialysis, I have them taking 2, 3, 4 baths a day. Perspire it out of there. They sip fluids. They're not allowed to ever gulp. Because then too many fluids will go to the kidney and the kidney can swell. But eventually, and they can eat kidney with the ammonia. They can also eat aged shark, aged stingray that produce natural high ammonia content. And that tissue, because the bacteria in that tissue makes the ammonia, it's the same as it does in the kidney. So by eating it, you replace, you introduce the ammonia-producing bacteria back into the kidney, into the body.

Q: You had told him he could eat anything except, any type of seafood except that that's in the Gulf.

A: That's in the Gulf.

Q: Yeah, in the Gulf.

A: The toxic Gulf of Mexico, yes.

Q: Otherwise he can eat anything.

A: Well, I didn't say any kind of, you know, any, yeah, ocean food, ocean cod, yeah.

Q: However, I was told that halibut is very high in parasites. And this one friend of mine said that a friend of hers got elephantiasis from eating infected halibut. The parasite affected her brain and she developed this.

A: According to the medical profession, you can only get elephantiasis from the filaria worm that supposedly comes from certain mosquitoes. I got elephantiasis one time and it was after a fast. I had done a 32-day fast. And I had eaten my body apart. And I got the filaria to start eating up all the toxicity I had destroyed in my body by fasting. And let me tell you, that elephantiasis was a terrible way to detox those dead cells. My whole legs and feet were swollen this big all the way up. And it was difficult to walk for three months. And finally I said, screw it. So I went to a health food store, bought some hydrochloric acid, went to a clinic and stole a hypodermic, took some grapes, juiced them, because grape juice doesn't have to go through the digestive barrier, go right into the blood. So I juiced them, put the hydrochloric acid together and diluted it with water, put it in my leg and shot it. Filaria was gone in 24 hours. I was too sick from all that fasting and I couldn't catch up. I was also a fruitarian at the time, not eating dairy and meats.

Q: So you disagree with the parasite?

A: Coming from a fish?

Q: Yeah.

A: Like I said, it's all...

Q: The worms in the halibut that you can see?

A: In the laboratory test that I did with animals, feeding them meats that were infested with various parasites, none of them got the parasite that they were eating. Not one of them.

Q: Maybe she said elephantiasis, but I bet she meant encephalitis.

A: Probably.

Q: Brain swelling.

A: Yeah.

Q: So is that possible to get?

A: Not from fish. If she has a very toxic brain, her body's going to produce it. You have to understand the body is naturally inherent with worms and bacteria, fungus, and parasites.

Q: So it could have been circumstantial then. She ate the halibut. They're relating it to the halibut, but it could have been toxic.

A: Completely coincidental.

Q: So basically, we can buy the fish, we can put it in the jars, we can take a week, we can have to eat it. Is it going to be high? Is it going to be gross? 

A: Not if you kept it refrigerated. The fish will last maybe 10 days before it starts getting a little rank. But it's still good for you. I've had beef last up to, well, I made some deer for Y2K just in case. I didn't believe it was going to happen because I was a computer programmer, you know, in my early 20s. So I said there's no way it's going to create the calamity you're saying. It's just another way to steal money, the government putting in programs and doing stuff like that. And, you know, like Perot made a fortune on it. He made another $1.5 billion on his programs to eliminate that. In other words, another hype, another way to pay people's stuff. But I took my last out ten years later and it was fine. But I had soaked it in peanut oil and some in olive oil. And it had stayed good all that time.

Q: How many years?

A: Ten years. I made it in quarts and pints. I would eat one a year, each year, and I ate my last one in actually 2009, so it was ten years. So that's when I made it. I made it in December of 2009, I mean 1999. And I had my last in November 2009.

Q: In the refrigerator or out?

A: Out. Not in the refrigerator. In a dark cupboard low to the ground so it's cooler, but it wasn't refrigerated. And I've had meat, you know, with lots of air space in the refrigerator, ground and whole, for three to five weeks. As long as you don't keep opening the jar, it's not going to get high quickly. It's not going to get high quickly.

Q: You have to get like a four ounce jar.

A: Four ounce is pretty small.

Q: But I can only have three quarters of a cup anyway, a day.

A: Well, three quarters of a cup, then you use, you know, an eight ounce jar.

Q: Eight ounce jar.

A: Yeah.

Q: So it doesn't really matter when you eat the meat, because you're either eating it regular or high, right?

A: It's good high.

Q: Forever.

A: Better high.

Q: Yeah. So that's just to eat it, right?

A: Yeah, but some people just won't eat it.

Q: They won't eat it high. Because you're afraid of the bacteria.

A: Well, it took Allison how long?

Q: Her stomach.

Q: Took me a while.

A: A year?

Q: Yeah, it took me. I finally did... But, you know, it doesn't taste, it tastes like grain to me. It wasn't as bad. I made a big deal about it, but.

Q: We do it like this. [unintelligible] then have a little green drink or something after, milk.

A: In the book I say, you know, put a swimmer's nose clip, but don't drink green, don't drink green drink.

Q: No, it's milk, is what we did. Milk, is that okay?

A: Milk is okay. Sometimes the high lactic acid in it will kill the bacteria. But if your meat's aged long enough, you're just going to get the...

Q: Only a month.

A: It's not very long.

Q: How long?

A: I mean, you know, like in Ripley's Believe It or Not, I had it up to a year and three months old.

Q: Yeah.

A: Did you see that episode?

Q: No, I didn't.

A: Me on Ripley's Believe It, I think you can download and see it on YouTube.

Q: Is that when you had your hair down to here?

A: Yeah.

Q: I saw the doctors.

A: Yeah. That was just a year ago, February. But this was in 2001, July 17th. So the most aired episode that Ripley's had.

Q: Really?

A: And they repeated it because everybody was so... Because I have gangrenous meat with worms, flies, and all of these jars with all this different high meat and glands. And I've got it all lined up on my back porch on the railing. And they've got a health inspector there. And he's saying, oh, you're going to get sick. Don't anybody do this. I said, how do you know? How do you know? All these people postulating shit they don't know.

Q: So you ate with the worms and all?

A: Yeah.

Q: It doesn't bother you to eat the worms? Eat the worms, eat the worms.

A: There are tribes that only eat maggots.

Q: I know, I've seen them eat them.

A: And they can run as fast as a horse. They can run and catch a horse in full gallop.

Q: So what makes a chicken so much more bad versus a beef? Is there a certain bacteria in what you're eating?

A: Yeah, there is a bacteria in poultry that is like that in a kidney that produces an odor that's strong. It's on the order of ammonia, but it isn't.

Q: It's a good bacteria. It's not salmonella, though, is it?

A: No, it's campylobacter. The campylobacter is good, it's part of our stomach. There's this whole crap about campylobacter breeding in raw cow's milk. I mean, people believe the wildest fucking story, I'm sorry, but it's absurd. You cannot breed campylobacter in milk. I've tried it dozens of times, and now that's what they're claiming. There's this big now come down on raw milk. It's about cases of people with campylobacter. It is a natural bacteria in your stomach. 

Q: So what is the status on the milk thing? Is it still battling?

A: Oh, forever. It's on its way out. It's really on its way out, except in private. You know, I'd say that. Sally Fallon's attorneys are selling all the farmers out.

Q: Why?

A: Let me tell you, I think she's on the other side. I don't know about that, but at least I know her attorney's on the other side. So I got a call from one of my farmers, one of my Amish farmers. And he said, I'm cutting a deal through, you know, Kennedy. This attorney Kennedy that works at the, was it a farm thing for farmers? You know, a legal defense farm. Farmer's legal defense farm fund that Sally Fallon set up. This is Kennedy, this attorney's running it. I've never liked him from the get-go. I've kept telling him all these years, I've continually told him all these years, that if you use my lease program and there's precedent and you don't use cow shares, you will never be fighting the government. They have no jurisdiction over it whatsoever. I've had every case thrown out of court. I write the briefs, 62-page briefs. I give it to the farmer, take it into court. The health departments walk out of the room. Walk out. They don't even want it dismissed by the judge. So as soon as that is read, my brief is read, the health department has walked out of the court without ever asking for dismissal or anything. The judge doesn't want to dismiss it. So they just walk out, they tear up the charge and it's all gone, it just disappears. I want them to come in and say, case dismissed. There's no jurisdiction here. But they continually won't do it. They just say, no charges. We drop the charges. And that's it. Instead of dismissal, you know, not valid, no jurisdiction. Which is what I say in my brief. So, I had one of my farmers from Illinois called, and they supply several of the co-ops in Chicago. And the Chicago co-op is bigger than Rawesome here. So they said, we can't get milk this week. And I said, well, you have David call me. Because he's an Amish, so it's hard to get him. He's not around the phone, and it's in an outhouse. The phone is in an outhouse. It's got to be a separate place. So he called, and I said, David, what's going on? He said, well, I can't produce the milk. I've talked with David Kennedy. David Kennedy is making a deal with the FDA. So what kind of a deal? Anytime you make an agreement with them, you've given them power over you. And they have no jurisdiction over you. What are you doing? He said, well, that Attorney Kennedy said I have to do it. And I said, wait a minute. You're under contract to Right to choose healthy food and the co-op for two years. You've got another year on that contract. I will own your farm and your herd. We already own your farm and your herd from the lease. You can't do a thing about it. You're our servant. You take care of us. You service that. He got it loud and clear, called Kennedy, and Kennedy sent me a note that he copied me into the FDA and said, you have to contact Dr. Aajonus Vonderplanitz about this issue. They haven't contacted me because they already know. I've already battled with them and won. So they're not going to touch them. They don't come near my farmers until they go to this Sally Fallon garbage legal defense fund. It's an absurdity. They're destroying a lot of the farmers. I've watched them destroy at least 15 farms in the last year.

Q: What's going to happen to us?

A: The only way you're going to do it is to use Right to Choose Healthy Foods lease programs, whether it's for a flock, whether it's for a herd, no matter what it's for, to get your meat. They have no jurisdiction, absolutely none. The only way that can change is if they have a bill go through Congress to change it. But that's against the Constitution, because we have a right to private contracts. But that doesn't mean Obama and the rest of them are just wiping out all the Constitution. That doesn't mean we can't fight it. We can. And all we have to do is have juries of our peers, you know, who have common sense. But then they can stack the juries like they did when I sued the city of Los Angeles. They put a juror in there. When the jury went out, they were all for me and all against the city of Los Angeles and the police department for hassling the runaways and teenagers on Venice Beach, forcing them into drugs and prostitution, instead of art and singing on Venice Beach. So I sued them for that, and what they did was they put an alternate juror on after the jury was out, without my permission or anything, who had worked for the police department for ten years. And this person convinced the jury there was no smoking gun, and there was a smoking gun. And then three of the jurors waited for me after and said, so sorry, we made a mistake. This woman buffaloed us. The appellate courts wouldn't even hear it. Wouldn't even hear it, because that trespassed into their own defense. Their own legal system was corrupt. But at least they didn't hassle the runaways on Venice Beach for eight years. Now they are again. Okay, do you have a question?

Q: Are you going to come back to me after?

A: No, you're not going to get one. Go ahead, yes. I'm teasing you. Go ahead.

Q: My question is that a few weeks ago, I started getting like a sciatica pain. And it was just, I mean, I was just sitting like this and all of a sudden it would come out of the blue.

A: Sciatica's back here?

Q: Well, I don't know, I mean, yeah, like here.

A: Now it's in the sciatica.

Q: Well, it's not.

A: Sciatica goes down here, the whole belt of sciatica goes down here.

Q: There was, I don't know, it felt like it was coming here and it would go all the way down like, and it would come. And then, and then now, and that happened for, I don't know, a couple weeks or something and now it's just stuck.

A: You had some toxins moving through the, out of this joint down this muscle. The nerves in the muscle. It wasn't a localized charley horse, it was an extended charley horse.

Q: So it was just like a, like a, it didn't feel like a charley horse, it just felt like, you know, like a nerve thing.

A: Yeah.

Q: So nothing...

A: No, well you, if it were lactic acid that had built up in the joint and it was discharging through the muscle, usually it would cause a cramp on something else. Moving out of this joint, down your leg, out your foot, trying to, leaps into skin, discharging through the skin, or under the skin, discharge through the skin. So let's say if it were lactic acid, I would say drink whey. Have some banana with some cottage cheese, or banana with butter, or pineapple with the same. And that will help that kind of a situation. [unintelligible], is it that late? Wow, okay. Alright folks, I'm going to have to end it. Yeah, I've got too many readings, and then I've got consults.

Q: Did we collect the cash for the day?

A: No, I didn't collect any cash.

A: Thank you very, very, very much. Well, thank you everyone for coming. We'll try to do another one in May.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah, because I'm leaving again in June. I've got a house that's being built, and I'm not there for it to be finished, and I hate not being there. In Thailand. Pardon?

Q: Are you building your house into a health center?

A: It will be a center eventually, a spa, but right now it's just going to be a house for me to live in.

Q: How long will you be gone for?

A: I'll be gone for another three and a half months.
