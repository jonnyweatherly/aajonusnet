A: Hi, my name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz, and what I'm about to tell some of you people will be very new and very startling, and you may think I'm from another planet or crazy, one or the other. 30 years ago, I was dying of multiple myeloma, which is cancer of the blood and bones, stomach cancer, started with stomach cancer, and I had angina pectoris, diabetes, psoriasis, all those ugly diseases. I started off as a very sickly child. I couldn't play with other children, so I never got into sports or exercise. I had a very violent brother who was very jealous when I was born because he was still in diapers and he never forgave me for taking mother's attention. By the time I was 10 years old, I had developed peritonitis after my third polio vaccination, which is a perforated intestine. At that time, about 40% of those who were infected by it survived. I happened to, I don't know why. By the time I reached 15, I had diabetes and angina pectoris. Angina pectoris was so bad, the muscles would spasm around my heart and I would collapse and lay in the classroom for 20 minutes on the floor. They didn't know what to do, they would just leave me there. Also, I had two other problems that I was born with. I was borderline autistic. I did not even learn to communicate with other children until I was in my early teens, early to mid teens. I had dyslexia so badly that if I looked at the printed page, it spun. I got vertigo and I would vomit or pass out. At that time, they didn't know what it was. They thought it was all in my mind and too bad for you. If you don't learn to read, you're punished. So, I still didn't read. They wouldn't let me hold the page down with my finger because that would actually stop the rotation. I didn't understand that they said it would slow down my mind. Yes, that's what I needed, but they wouldn't let me do it. I had to cheat my way through school. By the time I was 16, I had found somebody who finally loved me, so I got married at 16. I had a child at 17. He was born the first week of my senior year in high school. I was a very good cheat because I had to listen, and I had to cheat because I couldn't spell. So I would look over people's shoulders and I became an excellent artist because I could copy the graphics, and that's what writing was to me, was graphics. By the time I got into college, it was good because a lot of the professors understood and gave me oral examinations. They said that I would never ever be hired into a large company without being able to read, though. However, I was hired by Carte Blanche Corporation as an assistant analyst. As long as you show intelligence, somebody will always take you under their wing to an extent and give you a chance. In that three months there, they gave me a project that they assumed would take a year and a half. Carte Blanche had been bought out by Avco Corporation. They thought, well, these are two financial institutions. We'll take all the collections and transfer them over to Avco. Why double it? The assistant analyst, which I was, said, let's cut out the extra expenses. It didn't work. So they had to transfer it all back, and that was my job.

I did it in three months. Then they offered me a job they had been working on for six and a half years with the top sales people, which is called the reinstatement department. I had organized and developed that all in six months. Hired new employees, made $300,000 to the company in the first six months. This was from somebody who was autistic and dyslexic, who didn't read until I was 22 years old. At 19 years old, I came down with a stomach ulcer. I went through the regular medical therapy, which was drinking Maalox, you know, that chalky stuff. I consumed anywhere from two to six bottles a week. Within six months, I developed a tumor around that ulcer. So they decided to commit surgery, remove the tumor, cut the vagus nerve to my stomach, so I would never again secrete hydrochloric acid, never again digest properly, and stretch the duodenum, a vagotomy pyloroplasty. When I came out of that, it was miserable. Anything I ate, I broke out. Every day, my system got worse. I was already sick. The incision became keloidal, which means it became tumorous. It got to be about this wide and deep all the way to my stomach, about a half inch, inch to a half inch off of my stomach. See the air conditioning here? I'm going to have to take off my clothes in a minute. You want to see that? That's all that's left, this little bitty thing. Thank you, that's nice. Anyway, it keloided, and they said, oh we've got to irradiate that, because if it grows, it could choke your stomach off your esophagus and you will die. So I underwent radiation therapy. My teeth nearly fell out, they were dangling, my gums bled, they turned purple. I got very sickly, of course radiation prevents cells from regenerating, so that means you don't heal. And they irradiated me all over. My cavity here. I developed multiple myeloma, cancelled the blood and bones. And they said, oh gee, now we have to poison you to death. But they didn't tell me it was poisoning, they said chemotherapy. They wouldn't use it by its correct name, poison. For every one cell, one cancer cell that chemotherapy destroys, it kills one billion healthy cells. That's like me killing everybody on the planet because I don't like six people. Pretty barbaric, isn't it? The medical profession is ill. And they create illness. So by the time three months went by in chemotherapy, I was an invalid. To get to the bathroom, I would roll off the couch, I would roll across the floor. When I got to the doorway, I used my elbows to pull me through. Then I'd roll until I got to the bathroom, and then scoot in there again, and then climb up on the toilet. I was so chronically fatigued that if I stood up, or even crawled on all fours, I would pass out. The diabetes didn't help. It made the sugar problem horrendous. So what did I do? I decided to die. I stopped medical therapy and said, get away from me, you have destroyed my life, even more than it was already destroyed, and no thank you.

So a hospice, you know, lovely people with volunteers that help you die as comfortably as possible, came over, and they really give assistance. They cleaned my house, they purchased food for me, sometimes they prepared food, if I could even eat. Because usually if I got anything near my stomach after the surgery and after the chemo and radiation, I usually vomited everything. One of the volunteers brought a book about a woman who had cured herself of cancer by drinking a gallon of carrot juice a day. I thought, she was... yeah, where's this person from? I had been raised in a very academic environment. My father was an inventor and scientist. He invented the first bearing computer when he was at Purdue in college. My mother was an RN. She has seven brothers and sisters who are RNs. I have three uncles who are doctors. Well, only one still alive. I had no idea that nutrition had anything to do with health. I didn't have a clue. And I thought raw carrot juice, you've got to be out of your mind, got to be the worst tasting stuff in the world. Because all I'd ever eaten was cooked carrots and they made me vomit. And I hated them. But after he persuaded me a little bit, I tried it. And it was tasty. And I thought, well, what do I have to lose? So I began drinking the carrot juice and all of a sudden I could read. I said, wait a minute, what's happening here? My dyslexia is going away, the vertigo. So I continued drinking the carrot juice and I continued reading. And I got full of myself and I thought, I'm just getting better, you know, I'm blessed. All my prayers were being answered. So I stopped drinking the carrot juice and the vertigo came back and my dyslexia settled again. I drank the carrot juice again and it disappeared. I stopped drinking the carrot juice and it returned. So it was obvious to me that it was carrot juice. I said, why would carrot juice do that? It brought all kinds of questions to my mind. So I began studying nutrition. I got a tutor for three and a half years who tutored me here in Los Angeles. I went to the colleges. I went to UCLA. I went to Santa Monica City College. I went to all those colleges trying to learn something about nutrition. And they didn't have a clue. Not a clue. This was back in the late 60s and early 70s. Not a clue. No matter where I went, nobody had a clue about nutrition. So I had to go to all these unusual places and learn. Unusual books. And of course I directed my interest toward raw foods. Because cooked foods didn't do the same for me. They didn't make me feel any better. So I concentrated on raw foods. By February of 72, I had a phenomenal experience with my girlfriend who had developed peritonitis. Which is the same thing I had at ten years old. Oh, and they had misdiagnosed that peritonitis as appendicitis. So they took my appendix out even though it was fine and in excellent health.

Just in case it caused me problems in the future. That's the medical thinking. Be prepared. Go by fear. Destroy. It's like a military thinking. Attack and destroy. Before. If there's any fear, get rid of whatever it is you're in fear of. So as I began experimenting more and more, I decided that cooked foods were definitely out. Meat was definitely out. Because when I ate cooked meat, I had the worst experiences of any other food. Besides vomiting. Meat didn't make me vomit. Cooked carrots were, and peas and stuff like that. But the cooked meat would make my psoriasis unbearable. My face looked like raw hamburger. So I pooh-poohed food for a long, long time, meat. So I was a raw food vegetarian. This was great. I cleaned out, I got healthier, I got skinny, but I got healthier. I still could not get over all the damage done by the radiation chemo and surgery. So I thought, well, I'm gonna live out with wild animals and find as primitive people as I could find to find out what they are doing. Because I had read here and there, heard here and there, that certain tribes had no degenerative diseases and I was gonna find them. I heard that animals who lived in the wild and did not have their food source damaged by anything or anyone had no degenerative diseases. I wanted to experience such a thing. So I took off on a bicycle, lived out of a sleeping bag for almost three years. I lived with coyotes, I lived with alligators, I lived with American Indians, I lived with Eskimos, I lived with a lot of different people. I had been told many times, let's say three times altogether if I can recount correctly, raw meat's the thing to eat. You want to heal quickly, raw meat. I said, no way, do you know how poisonous raw meat is? Are you insane? So at the end of two and a half years of living outdoors, my multiple myeloma resurged. I was weak, my CFS was horrendous, I decided that I would go ahead and die. So I decided to fast to death. And you know how long you can take to fast to death. Some around 60 some days. And I had already fasted, the longest fast I had ever done was 41. So I knew that I could go a long time without eating before I would die. And I'm not for fasting unless you're just not hungry and you're not anorexic. Because that fast took me about two and a half years to recover to where I was before that fast. However, at this time the multiple myeloma resurged, CFS was one of the bad side effects of multiple myeloma. And as I was fasting, a den of coyotes befriended me and they brought me a rabbit. Ooh, now you're saying this guy is really spaced out. Let's leave the room quiet. Let's go out of here. And I ate that raw rabbit thinking because of what my relatives have said, my medical relatives, never ever ever ever ever ever ever eat a raw rabbit. I mean a wild rabbit, cooked or otherwise. They contain bacteria that will kill a human painfully in 24 to 48 hours. And that came back to me at that point and I said, ah, 24 to 48 hours, that's pretty good.

You know, I've been suffering most of my life and I was almost 30 years old at this time. So I thought, that's pretty good, I'll take it. 24 to 48 hours and I'll be dead. So I sat down to eat the rabbit, hadn't eaten meat in six and a half years, it came right back up. Here was this little bunny rabbit, I was eating it raw, bloody, warm, everything. And I, one of the reasons I became a vegetarian was not only because of the ill health that I thought it bred, and it does cooked, but because I loved animals. I mean, I couldn't communicate with people, but I could communicate with animals in my autism. Animals I could communicate with. I played with snakes, I played with all kinds of animals, not humans. So I stopped, one reason I stopped eating meat was because of animals. But this one was going to help me die. So I psyched myself up, I sat down for five minutes and said, okay, wimp, let's eat this thing. Let's do it. Hold your breath, chew, rip, swallow. So I did. And I didn't chew much, I swallowed. The more I ate, the better tasting it got. I ate three and a half pounds of that jackrabbit, and it was about seven pounds. The coyotes shared the rest and left. I went back to my campsite to die, painfully. I laid down in my campsite, felt euphoric, and I thought, I am dying. I died three times before. I died twice on the operating table and once in a drug overdose. It was a recreational drug. It was supposed to be a fun trip, but it wasn't quite. And I knew what leaving the body was like. It was euphoric. If I ever came back, still a question. So I was lying there with that meat in my tummy, that rabbit in my tummy, feeling euphoric and good, and knew I was going to leave my body and never come back. Woke up the next morning and I was still in the same place. Felt pretty good, until I stood up. Then I didn't feel good again, but still, I felt better. Three days went by, I didn't eat another thing, just had some water. And I still felt better than I had before I ate the rabbit. I thought, oh, all this time, natives have been telling me to eat raw meat. So I, first thing I did was found a rattlesnake, and I popped its head off the way the Indians showed me, and I, and it ate it. Does not taste like chicken, it tastes like fish. Maybe cooked it tastes like chicken, but it tasted like fish. And it was pretty good. So I began killing birds, snakes, whatever I could. Then I went down to the farms and began shoveling goat manure, so I could get goat milk, eggs, chickens, whatever I could. All of a sudden, I started putting on weight. In a matter of three months, I put on 30 pounds. I started eating tremendous amounts of fat, where I could get raw cream. And I felt incredible, so I ran back to Los Angeles. Well, bicycled back to Los Angeles to spread the great news. And you know what everybody said? You are out of your mind. Raw meat? What about the bacteria? What about the parasites? Your brain will melt. They will chew it up. So, I had been raised around that, and I thought, Oh my god, yes, I have to deal with that. And, okay, I feel better. Nothing else has made me feel better. I will eat it until my brain melts.

That was in 1976. September of 76. What year is this now? I think my brain is functioning, maybe not. I don't know, it doesn't seem to be a problem. What I found in my lab experiments with animals is that the body, when it cleans itself, will create a solvent. It will dissolve degenerative tissue, and that's just a long process. The by-product of that is almost identical to turpentine, and it is as toxic. When a bacteria is utilized by the body, it takes half the time to break that degenerative tissue down, and it's less toxic. When a parasite does it, it does it in five times less time. However, it does it so quickly that if you don't eat raw meat, you'll never keep up with the regeneration that needs to occur, and you'll have ulcers and possibly die. So I found that parasites and bacteria are the best things you can have. When I did the experiments with animals, it was phenomenal. When I tried them with myself, I tried to introduce parasites into my body so it would happen quicker, so I could get well quickly. I ate pinworm-infested salmon. I ate everything you could imagine, and not one parasite would take in my body. Now this is real unusual because the medical profession put me in the category of octogenarians who are in danger of death, they say, like the Hollywood horror film. Death, because you do not secrete any hydrochloric acid to destroy these parasites and bacteria as they enter the body. They will take over you, and you will die miserably. I was waiting, I was hoping, didn't get one parasite. Had my feces and blood checked for 10 weeks, not one parasite would take. So I had to do it the long and hard way with bacteria and with the body's own solvent. So it took me a lot of years to recover. And how about that news article that came out on CNN two weeks ago that said, oh, gee, oh gee, we're science and we're sorry. Do you know that salmonella eats away at tumors and reduces the size of tumors? But we have to genetically engineer it to do that. That's bullshit. I've had 238 terminal cancer clients, 232 of them reversed because they eat raw meat, raw eggs, everything with salmonella that can occur in it. And I encourage them to let it get old. Just because I know, my lab experience showed that bacteria and parasites reverse disease. That is their job. They become active and yet we [unintelligible]. Anything that rots will create worms. You can take a freshly slaughtered animal, put it in a hermetically sealed environment, at body temperature, and you will spontaneously see worms develop. Why? Because that's a natural part of animal tissue. You are all full of worms. The seeds of worms. And when you die you will decay and they will eat you unless you're embalmed. Or put in some kind of oxygen deprivation tank where they cannot survive. That's a natural process. When you get rid of degenerative tissue, who do you call on? You call on the natural bacteria and parasites in your own body. It works 95% of the time. In all cases. One disease that I have not been able to reverse in any case is Alzheimer's. This is the 3rd and 4th stage. Or I should say, I reverse it. The diet reverses it.

Lots of raw meat, lots of fat. Lots of fat. Boy, you say, this guy's the upside down man. He's backwards. He doesn't know his butt from a hole in the ground, right? Well, take a look at the estimates. 80% of their caloric intake is fat. This was 100 years ago. No degenerative disease. 99% of their diet was animal matter. And here the medical industry is telling you, stay away from meat. Stay away from those animal products. Those will get you. They'll get you good. You know why? Go back to the industry. Industry doesn't want to admit that all the chemicals, all the processing, everything they're doing is creating your problem. Isn't the animal matter. The Maasai tribe, what do they live on? Raw meat, raw blood, and raw milk. They'll mix fresh, warm, raw milk with fresh, raw blood, equal portions, and drink it. And eat raw meat. Healthiest tribe documented in the world. No osteoporosis, no heart disease, no nothing. Their intake is phenomenal. Eskimos had their first case of dental caries in 1886, I believe it was. No degenerative disease. Their first case of cancer was in 1934. We've all been fed a lot of hogwash. Now, there's a lot of diets that work for some people. So, what do you know what works for you? Well, take a look at your whole anatomical system. A lot of dentists will say, well, we don't have carnivore or feline-type teeth, which were all ripped, you know, they were for ripping. We have those grinders for chewing, you know, grains and nuts and fruits. However, you look at all the tribes who lived on meat, when they started gathering, they developed osteoporosis. The more grains and nuts they ate, the more degenerative disease they got. The American Indian, the Koster excavation. The Icelandic excavation. All of them show that once they settled in, they developed osteoporosis.

[audio cut]

A: Carbohydrates, grains, nuts. The digestive tract on a human is two and a half times shorter than any herbivore. The stomach of an herbivore is two to four, we have one. They have 60,000 times the enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule and get the protein and the fat from it. By the time the vegetation hits our sigmoid colon, we are just then beginning to fractionate that cellulose molecule to get the fat and the protein. All we're getting before that is vitamins and enzymes and minerals, which goes back in trying to make digestive enzymes to break down the cellulose. Doesn't happen. I've only met eight people out of 1,800 vegetarians who did well as vegetarians, and all eight of them were men. They all had one thing in common. They had three overactive glands. Usually they were the gonads, the adrenals, and the thyroid. For some reason, it created a very acidic bloodstream where red blood cells generated very easily without eating meats. Nobody else I've ever found does besides that type. So, it sounds like the media that's telling all these stories told and formulated and theorized by the medical and scientific industry are all wrong. I eat a hundred times what they say is healthy eating fat. Now, fat is great. It lubricates you. It'll stay supple. It'll stay fluid at body temperature unless you heat it over 104 degrees. Then what happens? It's just like clay. Clay is very malleable. Once you fire it, once you heat it, even at the lowest temperature, it becomes brittle and will never again be shapeable. That's what happens to a fat molecule. And when it goes into your system, there's no more ion exchange. So in a period of 10 to 50, 60 years in the body, it hardens like a crystal. Just like glass. Just like if you fired clay at a very high temperature. No wonder people get a hardening of the arteries and cracked veins. Split their brain cells. Get aneurysms. Because you're eating cooked fats that cannot exchange ions and are doomed to become brittle in your body. And if they've been a part of the elasticity or the lubrication within the cell, then the tissues get lesions. If they form a constituent of brain matter, then you're going to get clotting in there. And transmission will not occur, like in Alzheimer's. The Alzheimer's clients that I've had, their bodies will reverse. They'll get very young. The wives did not have to take care of those men any longer or any worse than the time that they went on the diet. Their bodies get young. In fact, younger than most people's get. One of them was 76 years old and in a period of 5 years on the diet, he lived 7. In a period of 5 years on the diet, his body looked like a teenager. His wife was astounded. So thrilled that he didn't get worse. His mind didn't get worse, but it did not improve either. Balding is another one that escapes me. People have reversed their hair, but it's not something that happens more than 60% of the time. So those are the only two that I have seen that don't normally and regularly regenerate somewhere around 85-90%.

I've written a book titled, We Want to Live. It's two volumes in one book. The first is a story. It tells about when my son was in an automobile accident when he was 22 years old. Damaged one-fifth of his brain. They said that nobody would ever live with that much brain damage. He came back, he's normal, he went to college, graduated and he's fine. It tells the story of what I did, where I got to where I got to be able to help him do that. No paralysis, no stuttering, no nothing. Perfectly healthy. Then the other volume of the book is healthfully and it tells the facts. What to eat, under what conditions. I cover about over 200 common diseases and thousands of raw food recipes that help reverse those conditions or ameliorate them. The publisher said that I should put it on sale today for $27. It's normally $29.95 plus tax which is $32.42. If you come to booth 129 you can get a few copies. There are only like seven left today. There will be some more tomorrow if anybody wants to buy some tomorrow. There are only seven today but in booth 129 or you can call 1-800-247-6553 from the bookmaster to the distributor and you can get it over the phone. But not for the price of $27. There will be about 36 worth of shipping and handling. I'm going to take a few questions. Can somebody give me the time? Okay, so we have 10 minutes. Yes?

Q: Do you recommend people only eat raw meat? Do you recommend vegetables as well?

A: Well, no, I don't recommend vegetables because they're so difficult to digest. Vegetables are excellent for people who eat cooked food because they need a broom. They need to sweep some of that stuff through. They also need alkalinity to help balance the over-acidity caused from eating cooked foods. If you eat cooked vegetables on a raw diet with raw meats and all raw foods, it over-alkalinizes. It makes it more difficult to digest the meats. So I don't recommend eating after a while. Your whole body is always over-acidic if you've been eating cooked foods a while. And at first, if you eat a little bit of vegetation with it, it's not going to be harmful. But over a period of years, maybe two years, a year and a half, you eat vegetables on a completely raw diet, it's going to create constipation. Have you ever heard of that? Vegetables cause constipation, even raw. Yes, they do.

Q: Do you have an alternative source besides Stubies or raw milk?

A: There is a dairy in Northern California called Claravale. It's illegal to ship it in because the L.A. Medical Milk Commission says that you cannot import milk into L.A. County unless it is a contiguous county. That means San Bernardino, San Diego. The milk has to be produced there. And Claravale is way up in Northern California, up near San Francisco. And they say it has to be certified. And the California law says that raw milk can be sold and made available as long as it meets grade A standards, which is not anything like the L.A. Milk Commission is forcing. Now, we're about to file a lawsuit on them and some other charges against the L.A. Milk Commission. I appeared before the Board of Supervisors last week telling them that the Milk Commission was operating illegally and that it should be disbanded and discharged because of Assembly Bill 2612, which was ratified last July 20th, which said that retailers' ready food can be sold if it has raw eggs and raw meat in it, which again we're talking E. coli and salmonella, as long as the person seeks it out and that there's a warning label on it. [unintelligible] But right now it is available at some of your wild oat stores and Santa Monica Co-Opportunity. Stueve's is going to be back online in April. The problem that Stueve's is having is that Alta Dena bottles for them. Alta Dena is owned by a French conglomerate. They don't give a darn about you. They are interested in profits. They went down so many times because Stueve's could not produce the milk that they only allow Stueve's product in their tanks one, two days a month. Stueve's is working on developing their own creamery so they should be back in operation and normal in April. Let's keep on it. Now at the booth 129 there is a letter to the Board of Supervisors that I wrote last night which takes in all the Assembly Bill 2612, everything. Go down there and sign one of them, print it under your name, your address. I will turn it over to the Board of Supervisors. I will make a copy and send it to Ray Davis, the Governor. Please go down and do that. We have got them running wild because I've already given them 712 letters already and they are nuts. They have already come out with a public statement saying we are not trying to ban the milk anymore, we just want to make it clean. And I say, don't make it clean, I want that salmonella. I don't want cancer, I want salmonella. Back off.

Q: I'd like you to tell again, if you would, the story of that caribou stew the Inuits fixed once a year that you partook of.

A: Yeah, the Inuits, the Eskimos would take caribou and they beat it into a mince raw, they dry it out, dehydrate it like jerky and they beat it into a mince, then they roll it in raw whale or seal blubber with the hot sun, melt it, and then they bury it six inches under the ground and let it rot for about six weeks. And when it smells for a half a mile, it's ready. The E. coli content of that is enough to kill five herds of elephants according to science and medicine. I didn't even get diarrhea from it. What happened was, I had been very, very cold my entire life. I mean, I could not stand Cincinnati, Ohio, because of the cold weather, the snow. I was tortured by it, especially the bone [unintelligible]. And that's probably one reason I so easily got multiple myeloma, blood in bones and blood. So, it was torture. Cold was torture for me. When I ate that rotten caribou, I had body temperature that just made me comfortable. And I was in sub-zero weather. We were already getting into late summer there, and it's already on its way to really cold. And I didn't get cold once for the rest of that month. This lady up here is so energetic. You.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I kept the microphone up here. Really, have I done that? No, I don't think so. Maybe this hand has been. Maddy. I think it's okay. No, I don't have any other tapes other than what they do at these places. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, maybe the reason I don't eat fruit very often, maybe two a week in the winter, fall and winter, and maybe one a day in the summer, is because of my sugar problem. And I don't recommend it for any of my clients who have sugar problems, and I don't recommend it for women. Because they get more emotional, and I found that if you take them off the sugar, they don't get as emotional. Very calm. They don't even have PMS. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Like I said, no. Vegetable juice is where I get my vitamins and enzyme supplementation. If you get a bottle of vitamins, normally 82 to 92% of it is toxic. It is garbage that will chelate and clog your intestines and other tissues. So you can use maybe 2 to 12%. And for that, that it may balance in your system, the side effects over a long period of time degenerate the intestinal system and the glandular system. If you drink vegetable juices, you will get everything without any toxicity. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I don't recommend anything, I don't recommend carrot juice in high amounts. No more than 10% of a juice because of the high sugar. That can also create the same effects as fruit sugar, fructose. Someone here was asking?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you know, that's what I recommend, but I have a lot of clients who don't live where you can get organic and they eat regular meat right out of Safeways, and everything out of Safeways. They do wash it first.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I find good raw meats. I go to Wild Oats and get Coleman or I go to Whole Foods and get the New Zealand. New Zealand beef is good, it's all grazed. It's not grain fed, so it's less fatty. But it's real healthy tissue. So a combination of both is best. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: For about 10 years?

Q: Yeah, and my hair was falling out. [unintelligible] My hair stopped falling out. [unintelligible]

A: He eats raw meat, raw milk, and lots of raw butter and all that good stuff. He says he eats about one stick of raw butter a day, one to one and a half pounds of raw meat a day. I eat, if I don't get raw cream, I may eat two sticks of butter a day, one to three pounds of meat a day. I have not exercised in 20 years as of this April. This is all just from eating meat. It usually takes about two, two and a half years for a body to develop naturally after being on the raw meat. But I was always sick as a child. I never got into sports, never got into exercise. I'm not against it. It's just that I was never conditioned, never able to do it, never well enough. Now that I am, I don't care about it. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I'm 52 years old.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: OK. OK. I've got a woman... Right. Well, maybe you could be better. I've got a woman 76 years old who came to me a year ago, chronic fatigue, having all kinds of problems. She's into it. She goes to every health resort and tells everybody because now she has this energy. She changed her whole life around.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You came in late. You're just going to have to get my book or get the tape. Get the tape. Get the tape. Get the tape. Don't bother these people with that.

[laughter]

A: All right.

Q: What is your blood type?

A: My blood type is O. Okay. That doesn't make any difference. I have about probably 40 clients who are A. And they tried going off of meat, red meat, and do D'Adamos. They got very weak again. So, D'Adamos might be appropriate on a cooked diet because the cooked proteins, because they develop the protein toxins and you have the lipid oxides involved, create an entirely different enzyme reaction. So all my A's eat even red meat and do very well with it. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, lots of eating meat with olive oil. You know, carpaccio, the Italian way. That'll help get rid of it. Usually people have that kind of indication that they've taken a lot of aspirin. Is she an aspirin taker? Well, there are aspirin in some kind of things that she may have been taking. Also caffeine does that to some people. Somebody got a question over here about teeth? Well, ask this gentleman right here. He doesn't have any teeth and he eats the raw meat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, the Eskimos never chew. He's saying raw meat is soft. Not a problem to eat. Now the Eskimos, they take these big chunks of caribou. Three chews at the most and they swallow it whole. Raw meat's not a problem. It's cooked meat. Take a look. If you have an animal, lots of animals eat bones. Raw bones. They never get splinters in their throat. The animals who get that are from eating cooked bones. It's like clay. You fire it, it becomes glass. It no longer is porous. The hydrochloric acid cannot melt it, so it punctures and slits. When it's raw, it dissolves.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, about 96 degrees, I say the fat shouldn't go over. 96 degrees outside of the human body.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, I don't take any of those. The only thing I take is vegetable juice. I haven't had my cholesterol checked since 84. We've got to break this in three minutes. I haven't had my cholesterol checked since 84, but it was around 148 the last time. I have clients who come to me with high cholesterol, about 380, somewhere around there. Within six weeks, they're normal. However, I do have one Olympic gymnast. She's 24 years old. She has to maintain a 324 cholesterol level, or she can't work out. When she did it on cooked foods, she would get ill all the time. She was constantly going into detoxification, which were flus or colds. Now that she's been on the raw diet, eating all the raw fats, getting her cholesterol, she can work out 10, 12 hours a day without getting fatigued.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I would have to say because bats do more than any other nutrient in the body. They lubricate, they cleanse, they stabilize, and it's the strongest fuel you can get. Pardon? Raw unsalted butter. Yeah, will have that reaction. Fish and chicken are wonderful. Right now I'm on a chicken gag. I eat, you know, maybe four chicken legs a day and just a little bit of beef.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, I get Rocky Jr. I like the Rocky Jr. because they feed it more corn and it's sweeter. Okay, that's it. I've got a workshop after this in room five. I do personal things. I take a look at you and help you out on an individual level. Thank you very much. Bye.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Hi, my name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz. For those who weren't in the last seminar, the lecture, and who haven't read my book, is there anybody here who hasn't done either? Okay, so we have two people. You did hear part of the lecture?

Q: Yeah, the last ten minutes.

A: Basically, usually in the workshops I will go over a certain amount of that information. Probably some of you don't want to hear it again, but because that's usually part of it, I thought maybe we could skip it, but we can't because there are some people who are interested. I was a very sickly child. I had a lot of problems. I had dyslexia so badly that I could not look at the printed page without getting vertigo and getting sick, so I was not able to read. I was autistic to the point where I didn't learn to communicate with other children until I was in my early mid-teens. By the time I was 10, I developed peritonitis that was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. They found the appendix in wonderful condition but decided to take it out anyway in case it caused me problems in the future. By the time I was 15, I developed diabetes. Oh, and that peritonitis was in response to my third polio vaccine. It was a trauma. So anybody who thinks badly about vaccines, you should. They create a lot of problems. 

Q: When you work at a school, do you have to get them?

A: No, you don't. Not in this state. All you can say is it's against your religion and you don't have to do it.

Q: They wouldn't hire me unless I did it at a medical health hospital.

A: That's a different situation. If you go through the law and take your 9th Amendment and the 14th Amendment, you can get around it.

Q: They would fire people if they wouldn't do it every year.

A: Yeah, well, if you did that, you could own the hospital. If you know the legal arguments, you could own the hospital. It's discrimination against your 14th. It's better to just get that scratch. TV scratch. Just get the scratch, put the egg yolk on it, it won't harm you. People do it all the time. Put the egg yolk on it immediately as soon as they walk out that door.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They shoot it into the skin?

Q: Like the little bubble thing?

A: They used to do the scratch, they don't do it anymore. They don't do it anymore. That's too bad. They do it somewhere. Maybe at your hospital they didn't. Go to some other place else to get it. But put egg yolk on it right away. Draw it out. Not if it's a deep vaccine, it won't. Just eat tons of eggs and what you have to do is eat moldy raspberries or moldy some kind of berries. Like blackberries, boysenberries, raspberries.

Q: I'm allergic to mold.

A: Well, those molds you won't be allergic to. It's molds from cooked foods. People have allergies to it. Not molds from raw foods.

Q: I've intuitively felt there's some huge healing power in the mold you get in oranges.

A: Yes.

Q: What do you know about that?

A: I found that it will help reverse tumors. Also help eliminate radiation. The oil. The molds help break down the oils for people who don't digest oils properly. The livers don't function properly. And the molds help break down the oils so that when you eat them they're already pre-broken down. They're already fractionated.

Q: And you can eat that stuff generously?

A: No, because then you get chronic fatigue. Your body can only handle a certain amount.

Q: Like what, a couple teaspoons maybe?

A: Well, it depends upon the condition in the person. I would say, you know, I have one client who ate them without, you know, thinking about it. Ate the mold from corn every day for a 30 day period. And their chronic fatigue that had existed for 15 years that finally got rid of, returned. So that's not a good thing. I recommend it when I recommend it. I recommend it in my book for vaccinations. But people should only take it once every year and a half. And no more than half a cup of moldy berries or moldy whatever food they are working to reverse some problem. I think I'm going to have to have some butter, folks. Now how many people have you seen just reach in and get butter? My food is now well lubed. I'm going to cut to the chase. By the time I was 15 and a half I developed diabetes and angina pectoris. By the time I was 19 I developed an ulcer. With the medical treatment of Maalox I developed a tumor next to it. They performed a vagotomy pyloroplasty on me. Severed the vagus nerve through the stomach so I would no longer secrete hydrochloric acid. Stretched the duodenum, cut the tumor out and then basically just ruined my ability to digest anything. Then that became tumorous. The scar, the incision all the way to the stomach all became tumorous. They irradiated that to prevent the cells from regenerating. That gave me blood and bone cancer. Then they said, now we have to give you chemotherapy which is poison. They gave me chemotherapy for three months. I was an invalid. I traveled around the house by rolling on the floor and crawling with my elbows because the chronic fatigue was so bad. I decided that I would die. I decided not to do anything about it. One of the volunteers at the hospice introduced me to a book by this woman. I think her name was Shelton, who had cured herself of uterine cancer by drinking a gallon of Keryus a day. She talked me into exploring and experimenting with raw foods. I thought the carrot juice thing was crazy, but it did reverse my dyslexia. That encouraged me. When I stopped drinking the carrot juice, my dyslexia would return. When I would eat it, it would go away. Three times that, I knew that they were related. I explored raw foods after that mainly, and had a nutritionist tutor me for three and a half years. It took me a long time to get into raw meat, because I went into raw, fruitarian, and vegetarianism for six and a half years. I lived off of a bicycle for two and a half years at that time, traveling all over trying to find natural remedies, living with animals, coyotes, alligators, chipmunks, wild cats, anything I could, and lots of Indians. Trying to find something that was maybe a secret out there in nature that man didn't know about, and living with different native tribes. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I didn't need money. I ate off the land. I ate fruits and vegetables off the land. I had long hair and beard because I lived outdoors and it was very cold. People fell on their knees and thought I was Jesus or something sometimes and would give me money. They didn't even ask for it and they would give me money. Then I would stop at a health food store and I would get some raw cheese if they had it. Or I would go to a store and get five or six or seven avocados and I would eat them all at one time. Living with the Indians, they told me about raw meat. I pooh-poohed it because I was close-minded about eating meat of any sort. Both because I didn't want to kill animals and because I thought it was poison. Then when I was dying, I was introduced to eating meat again, a raw rabbit. I ate it. It made me feel better. I recovered. I started eating lots of wild things I would kill and eat. It restored my health over a long period of time. But I knew I was getting better from that point on.

Q: Can you just say briefly what the Fruitarian vegetarian diet did to you after six years?

A: Well, it basically gave me osteoporosis. It started degenerating my bones again. It made my psoriasis unbearable. It made my diabetes unbearable.

Q: But it was an improvement over where you were, right?

A: Yes, up to a point. But then it got worse, downhill with everything. The multiple myeloma resurged, the blood and bone cancer, so I was chronically fatigued again. So it took me to some place and then when it got me as clean as it could get without rebuilding, regenerating, then it was downhill. And that's the problem with eating high-carbohydrate diets that you cannot contain and utilize the minerals because there's not enough fat. The fruit sugars burn it up, so then you have a mineral loss and bone degeneration. So here I am, 31 years after I was supposed to be dead.

[applause]

A: Thank you. And out of all the seven incurable diseases, I had no symptoms of any of them. I certainly am not going to go to any doctor to have them poke and x-ray me and give me something. So I just trust that I have none of those diseases. No diabetes, no nothing. Of course, I don't eat any fruit to cause a diabetic reaction. 

Q: I get headaches from fruit. I can't take carrot juice, hardly any. So I stay away.

A: I suggest that most people don't eat much fruit because I found it nothing but bad all the way down the line. Especially for moods, women and moods. Men and moods too, same way. It cuts way down on that moodiness, way down. I have some clients, one chronic fatigue individual, that she'd been chronic fatigued from the age of 16, I believe it was, until she came to me at 26, I think it was. Been on the diet about two years, very slow progress. Finally got her moved to a warm climate from Oregon where it's always raining. She's a person who is well affected by sunshine. So I got her moved down to San Diego a couple of months ago. She's doing better, but she got in touch with somebody else who I work with occasionally who thinks this of any carbohydrate, no matter if it's fruit or anything, says it's poison. The Bible and the apple, that's the poisonous food. I thought it was a little crazy, but I started hearing stories that I hadn't heard before, getting to places where I hadn't heard before, by doing such a thing. Fasting only on meat. Now, it isn't fasting, it's feasting. You don't eat anything but meat and water. And it's working in some situations. So I could no longer deny it. So then I started working with cutting out most fruit. And I find it works incredibly well in most situations. Carbohydrates, even carrot juice, keeping it way, way down.

Q: If you balance fruit with some kind of protein, like nuts or almonds or something, would that help?

A: No, it's very difficult to ingest any of the proteins and nuts, because it takes a vegetarian animal to really break the protein down properly.

Q: Even if you soak it?

A: Even if you soak it. It's even worse, because then it starts to react into a vegetable, because it starts to grow. Once you do that, there are enzymes which are prohibitive of certain digestive functions. Like, if that didn't react, all birds would eat all seeds, and there would be nothing growing. They wouldn't go to insects or anything else. There are books about it now, there are enzymes that occur in sprouts that there's an acid that prevents other foods from being digested properly, and you develop an allergy to these sprouts for that reason. If you're going to eat fruit, and I tell everybody, if you're going to eat fruit, eat it with lots of fat. Raw unsalted cheese, raw unsalted butter, avocado, peanut oil, pressed below 96 degrees Fahrenheit, raw cream, any of those things.

Q: Many nutritionists tell you to eat fruit alone.

A: Well, those nutritionists basically come from a fruitarian, vegetarian background. When you're a fruitarian, vegetarian, you have very little protein. That means you will develop very few enzymes of an unusual nature. So the longer you're on that kind of a diet, the less you will be able to digest. So it gets to the point where you have to eat mono meals. I was there, I know. But once you start eating protein, all of a sudden you can mix just about anything. I don't recommend that people eat sweet fruits of any kind with red meat, because it mainly turns it into pyruvate, which is a protein sugar, and your body cannot use it for regeneration. And red meat is very important for regenerating the glandular tissue, especially liver. This workshop is about living disease free, so I'm going to give you the clues. The body cleans out garbage with fats. It makes solvents, just like in the industry we make solvents with fats mainly. We put a little bit of alcohol in it, or a little bit of some kind of other thing to break down the fat to make it more soluble. The body does the same thing, about 8% alcohol. You can get 8% of alcohol from eating for a whole week, all that you will need from one piece of fruit. So you don't need much.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The body uses about 8% alcohol to make solvents. 8% of the whole body, about 12-15% protein, and almost 80% fat. In the fat utilization cycle, for energy it's almost the exact same proportion. But fats are the primary substance for cleansing and for fuel. Also they chelate, they bind, the body makes lipids and cholesterols to bind with toxins, to take them, break them down in the lymph system, then discard them into the bowels or out the skin.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Sure, go ahead.

Q: Well, you mentioned in the lecture how you eat one stick of butter a day.

A: No, that was Daniel, I eat two sticks a day. Unless, if I have raw cream, I may drink 16 ounces of raw cream a day and eat no butter.

Q: Well, my question is, you know if you have something like a macrobiotic counselor, I mean I've done a lot of stuff.

A: I did macrobiotics for a year and a half.

Q: And my impression of too much butter, meaning a stick or two a day, and cheese, is that it eventually will cause ovarian cysts. For women, it just accumulates, it's too heavy and clogging.

A: There's no way it could do that unless you cook it.

Q: It has to be raw.

A: It has to be raw.

Q: I guess I'm thinking of pasteurized butter.

A: Yeah, no, I'm talking about raw butter that stays soluble and stays malleable and stays fluid at body temperature. Once you heat it to pasteurization temperature, it no longer changes ions and it will dry out and harden in the body. 

Q: I thought raw butter just looked like regular butter.

A: It does. It's firm only except at room body temperature it melts. It melts. At 80 degrees it will get soft and melt.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Raw unsalted cheese. If you've been a macrobiotic for a while, you're going to have problems with any diet change.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: If you can't get raw butter, can you have olive oil?

A: Well, let me explain this to you. Your pressed oils, no matter what they are, they are mainly solvents. They will break down toxicity in your body, degenerative tissue, scar tissue. They will break it down. They will not lubricate you and protect you and make you strong. There was a Russian general that wrote in World War II in his journal, as long as my men were able to eat the dairy, and it was only raw back then, in World War I, as long as my men got dairy, their hair and skin stayed supple and brilliant, resilient. As soon as we had to resort to, as soon as they had to resort to, he said we, as soon as we had to resort to olive oil and other pressed oils, their skin and hair dried out within three months. It's a great, those are great oils to clean out your system. But remember, they're remedial. They are medicines. They are not to be consumed too much at a time.

Q: What is cod liver oil?

A: Cod liver oil is an animal product. It's not a pressed oil. It's an extracted oil, but it's not a pressed oil. It's not from vegetation or a fruit. It's actually an animal fat, and it's wonderful. As long as you can get... You have to talk to the chemist, whoever makes it. Make sure that they extract it at no higher than 82 degrees. And they cannot use a solvent to do it.

Q: Do you know of a brand that's that way?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do you know of a brand where they do it that way?

A: Not anymore. You have to call. I haven't investigated because I don't use supplements anymore. It's better just to go out and get the fish. Have the protein with the fat.

Q: The doctor in Florence, I figured, does that. Dr. Marshall, Bob Marshall.

A: Bob Marshall, okay. Do you have a number for him?

Q: I can't to tell you, but I know it's available.

A: Okay. But I would still check into it. Talk to the chemist. Don't accept anybody's word except the chemist. When I ran a health food store from 1977 to 1978, we had about 2,300 supplements on the shelf, 2,300 to 32. I tried to whittle them down as far as I could get them. Of course, the owner of the health food store was not happy because that's where he made his money, in the vitamin department. I talked with every chemist at every lab in this country and in all others where we imported and sold them, and this was in Aunt Tilly's health food store. There were only nine products out of all of those that were good. Four of those, well there were two of them. There was Aunt Tilly's, two at Western and Los Feliz, and then one at the Pacific Design Center. Now, they only have nine products. They only make three of them now, I think. Only make three. Everything else is a chemical. Ninety-nine percent of the vitamin E out there is a byproduct of Fuji and Kodak. They get the tocopherol, right? It's a molecule that is identical to vitamin E, only it's alpha tocopherol, not D-alpha tocopherol. So it's a chemical. And they're selling it as a vitamin. Ninety-nine percent of it. If it says D-alpha tocopherol, that means it's from soy or some other source. Wheat germ oil or something like that. And they use a solvent to get it out of there. And it causes headaches and degenerative thyroids and pineal glands.

Q: Could that create low thyroid?

A: Yeah, absolutely.

Q: May I add one?

A: Yep.

Q: Where did you get the idea that does it?

A: From observation, watching lab animals and people.

Q: Do you have lab animals or things you work with this way?

A: Yes, right. I paid over a million and a half dollars to have a lot of tests done in the last 15 years.

Q: Is there any way that I can get some kind of a copy of this?

A: No, you can't. Because at the time that I was doing these, I was doing them underground. And you were supposed to have a doctor's supervision over it. I went before the medical board on charges of practicing medicine without a license. Although I had nothing to do with medicine and they were going to use that evidence against me. So I don't let it out. Nobody gets it. You just have to take my word for it. I've got no reason to lie. What reason do I have to lie? It's absurd.

Q: So when they say like organic vitamins, organic, like Dr. Scholl's organic mix of spirulina, green chlorella.

A: Well, that's a food. That's a living organism, a living substance. That's a little different. Now there's one company, I forgot what they're called. They take those same chemicals and they feed them to microorganisms and call them natural. I don't know how they can get by with it. But that's the only one that I know that comes close to anything remotely really bio-organically active.

Q: New chapter does that.

Q: I can see if I can understand what you're saying so far on the basis of breaking it down into protein, carbohydrates, fat basis. Now fats you say provide fuel, purify and lubricate.

A: Strengthen.

Q: And if I understand you correctly, carbohydrates except for the enzymes you get from vegetable juices, they aren't too important.

A: Correct.

Q: What about protein? What does that do?

A: The only thing I've found that helps regenerate tissue and keep you young is raw protein.

Q: So it's a building block.

A: Yeah, it's a building block. Unless you mix it with certain foods, which then will be used as a pyruvate, which is a protein sugar. So it will be used as fuel instead of a rebuilding block.

Q: But you said there were problems with pyruvate, didn't you?

A: There's no problem with pyruvate. You only need 15% pyruvate in the citric acid cycle of utilizing fat as fuel. 15% protein, which is a pyruvate, and you have 5-8% citric acid or carbohydrate.

Q: I don't quite understand what you're describing there. I know it's the citric acid cycle, but where are you starting? With the intake of protein, 50% protein you put in your mouth?

A: No, that's in the cellular breakdown, cellular level. That's when it gets down to the cellular level. However, it works out to about the same proportion if you're looking at calorie-wise. The Eskimos ate 80% fat as their caloric intake. The rest was almost entirely protein. They rarely ate any vegetable matter, fruit matter, or grain matter except in the summertime.

Q: [unintelligible] Their minerals.

A: Fish? Lots of fish. Oh yeah, fish is concentrated in those minerals.

Q: What is a typical meal for you, like say a breakfast meal?

A: That's jumping ahead.

Q: Oh, excuse me.

Q: How about nuts and seeds? 

A: Well, like I said, those are difficult to digest in the human body. If you want to eat some nuts, now if I crave a starch, I go for nuts. I will eat almonds or pecans because they're very soft and they're easier to break down. I can utilize the starch in those better, and most people I've found can. Walnuts, I mean almonds are a little bit more difficult even if they're germinated because the enzyme is created.

Q: You said almonds and pecans are soft. Can you give me another?

A: No, walnuts. Excuse me. Walnuts and pecans. Walnuts and pecans. Yes, almonds are very hard. Walnuts and pecans. Those are nuts that I go to. Also, pine nuts. Very good. Very expensive. $16 a pound.

Q: Are those exceptionally digestible, pine nuts?

A: Yes.

Q: How about cashews?

A: If you don't mind paying $16, $17 a pound. Cashews are irradiated. They have the hardest shell on the planet. They fire a laser beam into it, heats it on the inside, and explodes it open. It's irradiated. That's why most people who eat them get indigestion. They can't digest it. It just sits in the stomach. And they say raw, and it's a lie. Macadamia nuts are great. They may heat the outside up to 100 degrees, 110 degrees. The inside usually doesn't get over 105, and that's okay. If you can find a local, because they do farm them up in Santa Barbara. If you can find some local people who don't do that, it's even better. Most of those in Hawaii put them in kilns and dry them about 110 degrees.

Q: If they're high in fat, is that a good fat? Is that a kind of fat that we can use?

A: You can utilize it to an extent, but as I said, it's a difficult fat to break down. Animal fats are, I find, the safest and the best to eat in large quantities. Without putting it on, properly digested. And I encourage people. Everybody that I've helped reverse a disease quickly have been those people who don't mind or swallow their vanity and get fat. And I'm talking about only maybe 15 to 20 pounds over their normal supposed weight. If they will do that, you will heal so much faster. If you don't, you will never be able to keep up with the body's needs. Different wardrobe, all that stuff, but so what?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Over their normal charged weight, what they're supposed to be. No, what you do is you go on a cycle, that's what I'm getting into. You go on a cycle, you go up with that weight and you take it off. In a five-month cycle, four to five-month cycle. So it takes you a few months to put it on, it takes you a few months to take it off. What happens is the body fills up with fats, takes that toxicity, dumps it out. It's like changing the oil on a car every six months. Only you do it every five months. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I suggest that people do it for the rest of their lives. Gain weight and lose weight. I still do it. I've been eating the raw meat since 1976. Not on a daily basis until December of 1982. So I do that still. I am right now 30 pounds over my chart weight.

Q: You are?

A: 30 pounds, yes. Most people my size, 5'8", on the chart should be about 155 max. I go from 172 to 180. That's my normal weight. Because on the raw meat the density of tissue is a lot heavier. So you are always going to be overweight anyway on this diet. With raw meat. You are naturally going to have that. Now my fat content is about 27%. When I have these people who do the test and say, Oh my God, I can help you, I can help you. This is mainly chiropractors. They freak out when they see a fat level that high. And they are there and they are not healthier than me. And they are telling me they are going to help me. Now this is the mindset that our science has basically put people into. The Eskimos did it. 80% of their caloric intake is fat. In the Andes, take a look at the Maasai. Maasai tribe. Blood, meat, milk. That's all they eat. Blood, meat, milk. Well, up to 20 years ago. Now they eat the other crap that white man has brought in. But they had no degenerative disease. Tremendous amounts of fat. And they are in a tropical place.

Q: Are they heavy too? Like Eskimos?

A: No. No, the Eskimos were never heavy. They wore these coats with a fur on the inside. It kept them warm. But they were never fat. They are all fat now. Because they are on a white man's diet.

Q: [unintelligible] aboriginals must be the same?

A: No, your aboriginals... I just located a book. Somebody sent it to me from New York. That has books written in the 1700s regarding aboriginals. But I haven't gotten to that chapter yet. So this is the first book that I have gotten actually before they were really corrupted. So I don't know how much. Aboriginals from what I understand mainly ate cooked. Cooked meats. So they had degenerative diseases and a shorter life. Their life expectancy at the longest was 80 years old. You have heard stories about the Eskimos living 50 years old. However, Vilhjalmur Stefansson, the anthropologist who was hired by the United States government to study cancer among the Inuit and other Eskimo tribes and North American Indian tribes. What was your question again? I'm sorry, I'm going to have to eat something.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: But I was going to go somewhere with that. Longevity. There was only one colony that was reported to have a lifespan of about 51 years old. He got reports and he studied and wrote to the doctors and the missionaries and all of these other settlements of Eskimos and they lived 105, 100 years old. Some of them died young just like every other place who was eating white man's diet. But that's all that they could do statistics on at that time because the British and Russians had come in there in the early 1800s and introduced cauldrons to cook with. So that was up to that point. But they say that the Eskimo, the propaganda is still out there, the Eskimo lives about 51 years old, short life. There was only one colony that had that report. And science and medicine love to take the statistics and ride with them to serve their interests. Just like they're saying, you are living longer. No you're not. They're taking the statistics from New York City, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, those cities that were cosmopolitan, lots of people, no refrigeration, no electricity, no transportation. So when they got their food, it was always rotten. They always overcooked everything because it was full of worms and everything else. The people who lived on the farms, 105, 110 years old. Sure, some people died younger, there were accidents on the farm, there were accidents with animals, there were miscarriages, there were bad births because somebody didn't know how to birth properly, they were eating too much cooked foods and it didn't work. But there were lots of people who were living very old on farms. It was the cities that were taking the statistics and saying, you're living longer, we're making your lives better. Only refrigeration has done that and transportation of fresher foods has extended the life in the cities. In the rural areas, no change. In fact, it's worse.

Q: What do you attribute the longevity of the Georgian Russians and the Vilcabambas in Ecuador and Hunzas?

A: That's a good one. In January 1973, the National Geographic came out with an article that showed the oldest living man alive, 168 years old, lived in Georgia, Russia. Another man was 148, his wife was 122. They had been together for 102 years. Imagine being married... He had his arm around her, loved her, happy, great. I thought, oh, I wish I could have that for two weeks. I finally have it. I've been enjoying it for a year and a half now. But the longevity there, I don't know. Nobody has given me any material on what they ate for long periods of time. I do know that the Hunzas ate a lot of soured raw milk. When they ate meat, they usually ate lamb or goat. They ate mountain goat and they usually ate it cooked. Really, I don't know. I haven't been able to discover those. This new book I have has some matter in it, so I won't find out. But it has references in bibliography of books you wouldn't imagine that I'd love to get my hands on. And I don't know if they are in existence, 1700s and 1800s.

Q: What about soured milk, like yogurt?

A: You know, soured milk is what your body... Your body pre-digests milk by souring it. Nothing wrong with it. It doesn't putrefy unless you cook it.  When you cook anything, it putrefies. When you just... The Eskimos let the meat rot. Other tribes let their meat rot. The Turks let their meat get green. Gangrene before they eat it. Because it's pre-digested. It's naturally with its own bacteria. It pre-digests.

Q: And they eat it raw?

A: And they eat it raw. They used to eat it raw. They don't eat it raw as much anymore. Kibbeh. You know, isn't it? Raw lamb. Mixed with bulgur. You know? Steak tartare. Cappuccino. Every civilization had their raw meat specialty.

Q: What about eating raw insects?

A: There are instinctos that do. Now, I met some people from Peru. They lived in the jungles. That was their protein. Because in those concentrated tribes sometimes, they were over-hunted. The animals. So then they had to resort to insects. I mean, I have one girlfriend from Peru. Up to ten years old. Lived in the jungle. And, you know, she just takes the worms off the, you know, the caterpillars off of the corn. And she goes for the worms and pops them. You know? Down there in the Amazon, she said that they had worms this long and that big around. And those were specialty. Pop them. You know, right down. I'm sorry. I haven't been able to do that. I've eaten, you know, red ants. With dates. And that's all that I could do. And I didn't do that purposely. The ants got into my dates at a very hot time in the desert. And I was sitting here chewing. I said, hmm, these taste like caramel. These are really good. These are regular old deglet noor dates. Why do they taste so good? And I'm chewing away. And all of a sudden I'm getting full. And I break it open and all these red ants are crawling out. But at that time of the day it was like 140 degrees. So the ants kind of just stay where they are. And I had taken them up into this old coyote den because it's cooler in the caves. But the dates were still hot. So the ants didn't know until I broke it open. So I made sure that I ate my dates at that time of the day. For those red ants, because they were delicious. Absolutely delicious.

Q: You ate them again?

A: Oh yeah, every day that I was there.

Q: Did the ants bite you?

A: Never. I don't know, when they touch the fluid in your mouth, paralyzes them. Never bit me once. And I ate a lot of them.

Q: Pork?

A: Pardon?

Q: You eat pork?

A: Yeah, if I really crave it. That's something I don't crave very much.

Q: Raw.

A: Yeah. But you can get organic pork. You can go to a health food store and get organic pork.

Q: And no trichinosis?

A: No. Trichinosis is, again, something you naturally have in your body. If you've ever eaten pork in your whole life, cooked or raw, you have trichinosis bacteria in your body. It's just waiting for enough of the decay of that particular tissue to become active.

Q: [unintelligible] If you're cooking at 300 degrees or whatever it is, I would assume by that time bacteria is dead on cooked pork.

A: It's dead for that period of time. But once the meat absorbs moisture and other fluids, it goes into degenerative tissue again and it will create bacteria. Even trichinosis. I've seen this over and over again. However, if you cook it at 700 degrees and make it leather, it will not. It will mold and degenerate after that. That's the highest temperature that I've found that I could not get a bacteria to, between 600 and 700 degrees were the times that I cooked meat and never found bacteria to re-flourish. And it's leather at that point. Who's going to eat it at that point? So you get bacteria.

Q: This isn't some pre-Pasteur spontaneous generation you're talking about. This is just saying, I guess, that 212 degrees for 15 minutes really doesn't sterilize your meat.

A: It does temporarily.

Q: Temporarily.

A: But once it is out there and starting to rot and decay again...

Q: So you're saying that organisms really survive the heat in some sort of state.

A: Well, either that or they're introduced.

Q: Introduced from where? You're talking about a hermetically...

A: That was one test that I did, but that was not cooking the meat first. The other tests that I did were not so extreme as that.

Q: So you are not sure where the organisms can suddenly appear from?

A: Let's say I go out and kill a goat and he rots in the field. We have worms that will show up, we have vultures that will show up, and we have crows that will show up. The crows and the vultures are not indigenous to the tissue of that animal, but they will come and eat it. But do you blame the crows and the vultures for the dead carcass? No. That's why you can't blame the E. coli and the salmonella and the trichinosis for the dead carcass. They just feed on it. It is their job to degenerate tissue that is in degeneration.

Q: My question is, if it has to be at 300 degrees for x minutes, where does any life appear from in it?

A: It could appear from extraneously. It could be introduced.

Q: Like fruit flies that just come out of nothing.

A: From what I understand of fruit flies, they spontaneously are part of fruit for some reason, because you can hermetically seal that and have the fruit contained in an isolation chamber and never ever exposed to any insects and all of a sudden the fruit flies will appear. So that to me is like the worms and the parasites. They are natural and indigenous to fruit tissue like the parasites and bacteria are indigenous to animal tissue. But the crows and the vultures aren't, but they will come and feed on it. Animal tissue. Yes?

Q: What about salt and any other spices?

A: Salt creases the sodium ions pretty heavily in the blood and the body eats by the process of ion attraction. So let's say you have a potassium ion maybe carrying a carbohydrate or a protein molecule. The cell opens up, attracts that ion that's carrying that nutrient and gets to eat. If it's a sodium ion, most of the time it's carrying water, H2O. If you eat salt, I don't care if it's sea salt, Celtic salt, whatever it might be, it causes clumping of the sodium ions. That creates such a magnetism outside the cell that often when the cell opens to get the H2O, instead of the molecules being drawn in, they will be ripped out of the cell and the cell can never eat again, it will shrivel up like a raisin and die. I even learned that in high school from my biology teacher. He showed us that one grain of salt can kill two million red blood cells by that clumping, no matter what kind of salt it is. This guy was way ahead of his time, this was back in the early 60s.

Q: Someone did a dark field on some blood cells of mine and all the blood cells were all clumping together. And I had no idea what that was about. I also had the feeling that this guy was generating electrical fields and that would clump cells that way.

A: That would happen too, but there are many things that can cause cells to clump. There are thousands of things, it depends upon what you ate a couple of hours before, that day or the day before, even what fields you may have gotten into, electrical fields. Those blood cell analyses change every moment. How can you base anything on something that is so changeable within moments? I don't know, I don't understand it. 

Q: Dates and raisins.

A: Dates and raisins, yes, they are fruits, however because they are not high fluid, they digest slower.

A: If I eat dates, and dates are a great brain food. I had a lapse there a moment because my blood sugar got low, and if it doesn't kick back in I would go eat a date and butter together. Two dates, three dates and butter together, and then I won't eat any fruit for three or four days, and that will be enough to carry me through.

Q: How about figs?

A: Figs are great, but not fresh, dried. Fresh figs are good too, they have a tendency to alkalinize the blood more than any other fruit. That isn't so good in my state of raw foods. So when I eat a fig, I don't eat many, if they're fresh. I can eat more dried figs than I can fresh.

Q: So raw eggs and un-refrigerated eggs with salmonella... 

A: Do you know the Chinese have the century egg, they take eggs and they bury them raw, pull them out anywhere from 5 to 25 years later and they have them either white with mold or black with mold and you pay $100 an egg and you eat those raw, and they strengthen your immune system. Eat them, great. Rot your eggs, get some bacteria, get well quicker.

Q: I've had the experience when I've gotten raw fertile eggs, if I have one of them cracked from the store there, I got diarrhea on three occasions, so I will not eat a cracked egg at this point. I say hey, something's wrong here. This thing is getting bacteria or whatever it is.

A: Yeah, but that may be a good thing. That bacteria may be going in there and pulling something out of your intestine that's very good.

Q: Well, the diarrhea didn't bother me until I was just four hours sitting on the can. I didn't get sick, I didn't feel bad, I didn't have a bad experience.

A: Then I would say that you were expelling something from your intestines that needed to leave. Let me give you an example. It's in my book, one of the appendix. There was a woman who had a daughter, 14 years old, who had polio. The doctors were crippling her more and more every day, giving her lots of antibiotics, lots of penicillin, lots of anything to destroy the poliomyelitis in the blood. It was eating up the nervous system and paralysis was resulting. Now, the woman came to me and said, my daughter is getting worse. They say they're keeping the poliomyelitis level down and it looks encouraging, but my daughter is getting worse. It's going to come to the point where they have the old saying, we cured your daughter, but here's the bill, she's dead. Cured her of what? How is poliomyelitis the problem? Again, poliomyelitis exists in everybody's nervous system. That's like syphilis. We all have syphilis. It's known. You all have syphilis. You all have poliomyelitis. What makes it active? Degenerative tissue in those areas on which that particular bacteria will feed. So I said, well, let's take the other viewpoint. Let's jack the poliomyelitis up. Let's get her as full of bacteria as we can. Feed her the raw meat and see if it changes. Her daughter was up and walking around in six weeks. The higher the poliomyelitis was in the blood the more she healed. 

Q: Like a natural vaccine effect?

A: It's not a vaccine. The bacteria goes in and eats up degenerative tissue so that you can get rid of it to regenerate new tissue so you have live cells instead of dead cells or sick and decaying cells. 

Q: So you are saying that polio went in to fight the bacteria?

A: That's what the polio does. No, Poliomyelitis is a virus. It goes and feeds on tissue but only degenerative tissue, nerve tissue. If it cuts something off to the brain of course you're going to be paralyzed but it will be temporary as long as you're eating raw meat or if you're a particular person who can't regenerate tissue from cooked meat you won't have paralysis. It will only be temporary. But if you attack it, attack the body then that degenerative tissue on which the poliomyelitis was feeding stays there and rots. You cut off the channels forever and you have permanent paralysis.

Q: So you are saying you put more polio in?

A: No, all you do is do nothing to stop it from growing.

Q: Let it run its course?

A: Yeah, let it run its course. That's why I believe you should let anything run its course.

Q: So there's nothing to regenerate the tissue except fats and meat?

A: Fats do not regenerate tissue because in my experiments with people with cancer and all of the kinds of diseases they did not get younger, they didn't show signs of getting stronger other than the cleansing that fats created. Only 60% of my clients with terminal cancers reversed on high fat diets without the raw proteins. So that to me tells me that in a situation of cancer, fats are the predominant importance. When I added raw meats to it 96-98% reversed. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: What I found is that in a case of cancer, cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to discard dead cells. I found in 90% of all the cases that I've looked at it follows a breakdown of the liver. You're eating cooked foods and garbage fats with lots of lipid oxides, you tax the liver. Day after day, year after year, you're taxing the liver. Finally the liver says, I gotta take a break. It's usually 13-18 months that the liver may stop forming certain lipids to take care of dissolving toxic tissue, dead cells. So then the dead cells will just start collecting in the body. Where does it take them? If they get inundated all over in the tissues evenly, what happens when that gets overloaded? Especially if you're eating a lot of cooked meat. If you're eating a lot of cooked meat, you're putting dead cells of another animal in there. Your body can't even take care of your own. How's it going to take care of a foreign animal's tissue cooked on top of it? So what happens? It builds tumors in the system. Some people do not go into reversal right away because they've got to regenerate the liver back to health to be able to make the lipids to break down the dead cells to eliminate them. But the concentration is on fats. Then you say, wait a minute, the fats are the problem the liver is having with it. It's cooked fats that are the problem. You eat a little pineapple with your fats, you'll digest it. Your liver will have a fine time with it and be good. And then over a period of maybe six to ten months it'll reverse and then you'll stop building tumors. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, I had a client, as I address in my book, had sixty-three tumors in her body when she came to me. She had a week to live according to the doctors. And she was maybe four days away when she knocked on my door, from that time limit. And she was thirty-five years old at the time, she was as white as your coat, and she was just like this, shook. And the flesh hung. I was only thirty-five years old and this woman's flesh hung like I'd seen people in their eighties. And I told her that I couldn't help her. I'd never helped anybody in that condition before, scared the hell out of me. And I said, I can't do it. And she said, but you've got to. I've got a thirteen-year-old boy, I've got a husband, I've got a life to live. And I said, okay, you'll have to eat raw meat. And she said, no, I'm a vegetarian, I've been a vegetarian fourteen years, I eat all the right things. I said, if you eat all the right things, what are you doing with sixty-three tumors? And she said, but I follow all the right protein, you know, I don't mix these foods, and I eat the right things. And I said, wait a minute, if you're eating all the right, why are you here? Why do you have all this cancer? You know, thought it was nerves, thought it was her religious, you know, cross to bear, because she was into this Buddhist religion, you know, that said that the woman is the servant and serves the man. So she had all this guilt and thought that that was it. And I said, no, your liver is broken down, you're eating shit food, and you need to eat right. But if you're not going to eat meat, there's no way I'm going to help you anyway. She would not eat dairy food, she would not eat eggs, she would not eat anything. And I said, well, then I can't help you at all. She said, okay, okay, I'll eat dairy and I'll eat whatever else you say, but I won't eat meat and I won't eat eggs. There's no fish, no chicken, no fowl, no beef, no lamb, no nothing. I said, listen, you know, I'll help you if I can, but I don't think so. I don't think it's going to work. So I had her eat two coconuts a day. Now she had been allergic to all foods when she came to me. She was even allergic to water when she came to me. She had been eating for 30 days only grapefruit juice. That was the only thing she could eat. And the day before she came to me, she became allergic to that and water. She was absolutely, could not eat anything without hives that were just, I mean, these hives would just blister on her. It was horrible. I got the coconut out and avocado and some cheese and some nuts and I sat her down and I said, eat these. She said, no, I'm allergic to all of those. I'll break out in hives, especially those where I have a terrible time. I said, just try it, just do it. I can't help you if you don't at least experiment and explore it. She ate for three and a half hours without a bad reaction. She needed the fats, raw fats, so badly. It took her eleven years to dissolve sixty-three tumors. She had sixteen in her liver, thirty in her spine, six in her uterus the size of her fist and lots in her brain. All gone in eleven years. She is now a nutritionist, fifty-three years old healthy as can be. Didn't have any medical therapy. 

Q: Does she eat raw meat now?

A: Oh yeah. It took her a year and three months and when she ate it, it was a very interesting incident. All of a sudden we were in Kansas at the time. I helped nurse her because she was so ill. I was just so fascinated with the whole episode that I nursed her through it. I had eaten a poison mushroom so she helped nurse me to a certain extent too. I ate a death cap mushroom, enough to kill fifteen people my size. It nearly killed me, literally. It took me about eleven years to recover from it. We were in Kansas and all of a sudden I went to a Mennonite butcher. They grow everything organic. I got a brain and I got some liver and I got some beef for me. I got about a seven pound filet mignon. I'm eating away on the brain and she decides that she wants this craving, taking her over. I'm saying, okay, okay, here, good, good. She ate three and a half pounds in forty-five minutes of the filet mignon. I'm not encouraging you eat filet mignon. The hunter tribes think that filet mignon is dog food.

[audio cut]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Their folklore was that filet mignon creates weak tissue, so they always threw it to the dogs. Because it's so tender. They go for the tough meats, brisket, ground, chuck, all that stuff, that's the top meat. In my experiments, because I was eating filet mignon, the brains and all that, I had muscle tissue but nothing like I have now, until I started eating muscle meat. This is without having exercised in almost twenty years, it will be twenty years in April. I keep solid muscle because I eat lots of muscle meat, mostly muscle meat.

Q: How about liver?

A: No, that's glandular. Muscle meat is steak, chuck, all that stuff.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, but those are more tender. You go for the tough stuff if you want hard solid tissue. She ate seven pounds, she ate that whole seven pounds in twenty-four hours. Exactly ten days later, she went into contractions like labor. Every time she had a contraction, blood shot out of her uterus. I mean, I'm saying, let me take you to the hospital. She's saying, no way am I going to the hospital. She got very psychic at that time. Whatever that meant at the time, she felt very intuitional. She said, I'm not going to go to the hospital. I perceive this will take three hours to go through this. Let me be. Just help me. Go get a bowl with a little bit of water in it and a towel. Wring it up, put a piece of plastic under me, put towels under me, wring it up. So I followed her instructions and I mopped up in three hours three quarts of blood. Do you know how many quarts people have in them? Four to five. I'm here just trying to keep my cool. Thinking I'm going to jail at any minute when this woman dies. In the same house with her because I didn't rush her to the hospital. I'd be negligent by anybody's standards. Sure enough three hours to the minute her contraction stopped. She says I perceive you should take me into the bathroom. Run a bath about three inches high. Let me kneel in it. I said whatever you want. So I ran a bath. I carried her and put her in it. She got on her knees. All of a sudden one more contraction. The blood spit and a squamous cell tumor shot right out of her uterus. Right in the tub. It was about this long. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh yeah, I picked it up. I had a lab check it. She did that eight times in six years. Eight times out the uterus. Her body probably got rid of 50% of her tumors by building them into the uterus and sending them out. Amazing. The body is phenomenal.

Q: Did you say building them in?

A: The body started dissolving tumors everywhere else in her body and depositing them in her uterus building tumors there and then she passed them out. If she hadn't had that seven pounds of meat. She couldn't have replaced that much blood loss and her body just came over her. She had to do it. Instincto. I don't know if I ever finished answering the insect thing. Some people do very well with insects. I have such a problem eating insects. If I were starving and had no meat, I might. I might eat insects, I don't know.

Q: You were saying, way back, that the liver gets too toxic so then goes on strike, goes into a particular phase. Could you go into that a little more? Also did I understand you to say that tumors have the purpose of enclosing all these toxins so they don't destroy them?

A: Collecting dead cells.

Q: Could you go again through what the liver does at that stage?

A: It's like you're exhausted, you're overworked. All of a sudden your body collapses because you're exhausted. You can't work another minute. How long does it collapse? Days? Hours? Well, the liver never stops working like the heart. It never stops working. So when it fatigues and goes down, the liver may go down anywhere from a month, which is 30 days, all the way up to 18 months, I've seen them. Absolutely stop anything but basal lipid formation. 

Q: So it's rebuilding itself at this point?

A: It's working on getting rest and regenerating itself. And it's not taking care of extra, you know, it's not taking care of hormonal, it's only taking care of prostaglandin activity. 

Q: So you need tumors to fill in for its function at that point?

A: No, it's just that the body uses lipids, certain kinds of fats to dissolve dead cells to remove them from the system. And if the liver can't make those lipids, the solvents to break down those dead cells, the dead cells collect.

Q: So the tumors are the cells?

A: Well, the tumors are the dead cells. See, your cancer cell, there's only about, per 50 cells around, there's only one live cancer cell, and that's like a hermit. He's an asthete. He doesn't have to eat. He can stay alive and stay in communication with the brain and the nervous system. A tumor that is malignant will dissolve. A tumor that is fibroid, that is non-malignant, will not dissolve easily. A malignant tumor, you can dissolve quickly. And I've seen them dissolve anywhere from 30 days to 10, 15 years. A fibroid tumor that is non-malignant is very difficult to dissolve and get rid of. So your cancer cells are your friends, not your enemy. The problem is getting your liver back in shape so they can get rid of the dead cells that are collecting in the body.

Q: How do you do that?

A: You have to feed good raw fats to that liver. Good raw fats. Yep, raw meat fat is the best. You get sirloin fat, you call the butcher and say, hey, when you cut all the trim, all the fat out of the way today, put it in a plastic bag, I'm going to give it to my dog. Don't tell him you're the dog.

Q: My question, what about handling your family and friends when you're eating this stuff?

A: Hey, you know, that's part of the social opprobrium you'll have to suffer.

Q: My family thinks I'm a nut. Well, my dad is a physician [unintelligible] Don't tell the rest of the family about it, keep your mouth shut. Your brother thinks you're nuts, your other brother thinks you're nuts. I'm not sure about them, I tell. But I know you're trying something [unintelligible]. Go ahead and give it a shot.

A: It was 25 years that I did the things that I did before my father said I'm proud of you. You are incredible. You don't age, you get younger, and here you get older, and all I do is be more feeble. I don't know how you do it coming from where you've been. It was just in the last 8 years that my father acknowledged that. Hey, you can't please people. You've got to please you, your own health. They're not living your life, that's for sure.

Q: [unintelligible] I don't know whether I'm willing to try different things. A lot of the things I've tried I've been disappointed in, but I'm willing to try them. I'm willing to talk to other people. You sort of get this thing where you can talk to other people who are on your wavelength, but the other people, you don't want to talk to them.

A: The best thing you can do is say, you know, you mention the tribes of Maasai, and you mentioned the Inuit, the Eskimos, before white men came around, they had no degenerative diseases and they lived on raw meat. They had no cauldrons to cook with before white men came around. They ate all raw meat, 99% of Eskimos diet, raw meat. The Maasai before the white men introduced toxic foods to them ate nothing but animal matter. No vegetables at all, ever. No fruits at all, ever. Healthiest, strongest, most athletic people in the world. Now they are skinny and getting sick.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, they were tallest race, strongest race, fastest race. Now they aren't. So and also let me give you a story. My father and mother retired to an island, Jekyll Island, Georgia. On this island, all the group, the inner group, had a party. Each couple would have a party for all the other couples on the island. There were only 8,000 residents and 90% of those were workers at the hotels and the golf courses. It was the land of golf courses. The few there couples, the well-to-do, had parties for others. There was one or two parties a month thrown by these couples. I happened to be in town when my father, mother, and father were throwing theirs. My mother invited me to the ballroom for the banquet. She said, what do you want? I said, what are you serving? She said, roast beef and fillet of sole. I said, I'll have the fillet of sole raw. My father slammed on the brakes to the car and yelled at me, you're not going to embarrass me with that. You're not going to do that to me. I said, Dad, this is 1981. People eat sashimi. People eat sushi. It's okay. You're not doing it. You're not going to embarrass me. I said, Dad, I don't care how it makes you feel. It's my body. I know what feels good. I know what helps me. I'm not going to tell you what to eat if I invite you to my party. So please, let me have mine. So we ended up at the table and I'm eating the raw fish and my father is going... And their priest that they invited said, oh, you're having sashimi. Oh, you're having sushi. And it got around. And then my father just relaxed. You have to go through these things. It's part of people growing into you, into your new you. If you're thinking about exploring this particular avenue toward health. It's in a program that's out there, especially with the bacteria and parasitic phobia out there, which has no basis whatsoever. It's all theory. Yes?

Q: What about children?

A: It's great. I have children born on it. I've got a couple in Connecticut. They have a one year old and they have a four year old. They're both girls. The four year old has been brought up on soda pop and all the regular garbage. The parents are now eating the raw meat, the raw milk, everything. They can get it there. It's legal to get the raw milk from a farmer. So they can go right to the farmer and get the raw milk and cream, which they do. They make all this available. The four year old will drink the raw milk only. It took her a few days to get there. The little one year old, she'll go up in the refrigerator and the first thing she gets is the raw meat. Wakes up in the morning and goes in the refrigerator and gets the raw meat. The child won't eat any cooked food. The one year old instinctively will not eat any cooked food. If you put raw or cooked in front of her, she goes for the raw food. Some kids are just already a little too corrupt like the four year old to do it easily. But she'll eat lots of raw eggs blended with banana. The four year old, she loves those. 

Q: Do you subscribe to the different metabolic chemistries of different blood types and what they will do well with and what they won't?

A: The D'Adamo method applies to cooked foods. You have different enzyme and toxic reactions from that and there are enzymes which bar the digestibility for type A for red meat. I have 40 clients that are type A and any of them, we tried it. We experimented. When they went off the red meat, they did not do well. So that may apply to cooked but not to raw. I haven't applied it with raw, I mean cooked, so I don't know. I can't say that his system works at all, but it doesn't work with raw.

Q: The diet you propose is much different than the diet Gerson Therapy and Contreras and [unintelligible]. What do you think about them and what do they think about your kind of diet?

A: Well, Issel's and Gerson have, you know, a lot of people who have left the Gerson therapy, they're not improved, gone to my diet and gotten well. I say that Ms. Gerson right now is in denial because of the last 17 people that I saw come out of the November cycle. One of them became my client and she's still alive and the other 17 of that group are all dead. Now, Max Gerson knew that the raw liver was an important factor. Raw glandular tissue reverses cancer quicker than anything that I've seen. It doesn't have to be liver, but liver is a great tissue to eat to reverse cancer because it's 80-90% fat, hormone active.

Q: What about Contreras?

A: Contreras, I really don't know a lot about Contreras' stuff. From what I understand it's mostly immunology. It's a chemistry lab again. I don't know any survivors that have come to me from that. He may do okay, but according to Hardin B. Jones' research, who was professor Emeritus of Stanford, no Berkeley, of medical physics and physiology of Berkeley in the 70s, he says, after all my research with cancer, I found that the people diagnosed with cancer who refused any treatment, any of the three treatments that the medical profession utilized lived an average of twelve and a half years. All of the people who were diagnosed with cancer and had one or all three lived an average of three years. That means 76% of your life had gone because of medical therapies. They tell you they are going to extend your life. It's a lie, according to Hardin B. Jones. If you look at, if you extend the properties of that, you say that as long as you leave cancer alone, your odds of surviving are 76%, if you leave it alone. That goes along with my research which shows, wait until the liver kicks back in, it will go away. Those people who don't recover are usually alcoholics or people who have been into excessive drugs and have destroyed their liver pretty much permanently.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah. It may not come back. Exactly. So all these people taking credit for people being alive because they haven't gone to medical therapy, they came to the Gerson Clinic or the Contreras Clinic and say, we're still alive because of this therapy. I have to say, uh-uh, according to Hardin B. Jones, if you don't go to any of those therapies, your chances of living 12 and a half years are pretty good.

Q: So these people may drop dead down the road.

A: Exactly.

Q: I have a friend who went to the Gerson and he's made it 8 years and he's at this point healthy as a horse. But he has commented to me and he says, well, it's still there somewhere and it's still not yet. And I said, you might try some meat on some things. I was not thinking about your thing but more than a vegetarian thing.

A: Right, yeah. Well, I waited, you know, I waited a lot of years before I wrote the book and came out with it. I wanted to make sure that mine extended beyond the norm. If you live, the doctors say, if you live five years beyond your cancer date, you're cured. Bullshit. According to Hardin B. Jones, you live beyond 12 and a half years, you're cured. Well, I'm 31 years beyond the time I was supposed to be dead. So I can say, yeah, I can say I've done it pretty well. And I had just the multiple myeloma alone, which is blood and bone cancer, 0.01% ever survives. Survives five years. 0.01% survives up to five years. And here I am 31 years.

Q: I read that cancer tumors shrink in the presence of a fungus. Can you explain that?

A: Fungus helps dissolve tissue. Fungus is again a property that helps decompose stuff and it doesn't go to necessarily healthy tissue.

Q: So tumors are degenerative tissue and the fungus eats that?

A: Most tumors are made of dead cells, degenerative or not. A mold will make them degenerative, which means they can leave the body. Most dead cells become mummified, scar tissue and they can't be broken down easily unless a mold is introduced or salmonella or some other bacteria that will go in and cause it to dissolve and degenerate. But if you have a mummified cell, it is hard in there. There are not many things that will do it naturally. That's why I introduce molds. That's why I introduce bacteria to make it quicker.

Q: As far as the meat that you consume, can you just take a meat grinder and grind it all?

A: If you like. I don't suggest a meat grinder because most of them are made out of pot lead. So take a Cuisinart or a food processor, slice it up, put it in there and chop it up that way.

Q: What kind of water do you drink? Do you drink like filtered water?

A: I drink carbonated waters only, naturally carbonated, Gerolsteiner, Perrier. The reason is that like hydrogen peroxide, it will increase the oxygen level of the blood. 

Q: [unintelligible] headache, why?

A: You must have a lot of salts that you could be pulling out and the salts cause, as soon as the old salts are out of your system. But if you go to the book under headaches and follow the formula, put some little honey and a little lemon juice in there and it usually will arrest the salts. Lime juice will do it too and that will take away the headaches, usually within 10-20 minutes.

Q: Naturally carbonated water like Perrier?

A: Naturally carbonated, yes. Naturally carbonated means that in the well there is a whole carbon dioxide area that is filled just above the water level. What they do is they run a pipe out for the water and a pipe out for the gas, the carbon, and they shoot them both back into the bottle. If it is chemically done they make a chemical reaction with sodium carbide or some other chemical form to cause it and that causes headaches on its own without pulling salts out from the body causing the high blood pressure. What time is it?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh my God, ok, let's go.

Q: Where do you buy your meat?

A: Right now I am buying mostly the New Zealand beef because it is grazed fed from Whole Foods, not frozen. I still buy Coleman at Wild Oats. Let me go right down the line. Stand up here, let me see your hands. If somebody would like to write these things down for each other, it would be a good idea. Relax your hands. Your sex glands are very overactive, your adrenal glands are very overactive, your pancreas is overactive on one side and debilitated on another. You don't do well with sugars, I don't suggest you have more than one piece of fruit a day. This will be on tape so all of you who want to get it just buy the tape and then you don't have to worry about writing it down. Most of your glands are overactive, it shows that you produce red blood cells, you produce red blood cells pretty well. You're a person who normally would do pretty well on a vegetarian diet. However, you have lots of glycotoxins stored in the body and formed in there and they need to be gotten out. You need about, I'd say, 50% red meat for about two years. Lots of chicken, raw chicken. Rocky Jr. is probably the better. Do not eat the skin, it's been dipped in boiling water to get the feathers off. Please listen, because some of the stuff I say I'm not going to repeat again because we don't have the time. You might need a little cooked starch. If you find you get temperamental or a little angry or a little impatient, it's because you have so many hormones dumping into your blood at one time, it's difficult for you to relax. You might have a little bit of cooked starch, like a half a baked potato with a whole stick of raw unsalted butter or a good piece of meat fat with it. Try to use soft nuts first, walnuts or the pecans, and if that doesn't work, then meat. If that doesn't work, then go for the half a baked potato with lots of butter. Suggest, like I said, 50% red meat, 50% white meat for a couple of years, and then lean more toward the white meat after that, and then fluctuate on your own instincts. Your liver, there's quite a bad condition in your liver. Right now you have lots of bacteria throughout the liver. Encourage that, but you want to give them lots of fat to help it out, so eat lots of meat fat. And if you have to call the butcher and say, put it aside for my dog, then go do it. Be very helpful. Your red blood cell count, like I say, is very, very good, but the red blood cells aren't transporting oxygen well, so I suggest that you drink about one cup of the sparkling water a day, and that will help that. Again, limit fruits. Like I said, eat as much raw milk as you like, and get most of your fluids from that. Juice, 60% celery, 20% parsley, 10% carrot, and 10% cucumber. And if the cucumber isn't organic, peel it. Okay, next.

Hi. Your sex glands are also overactive, and so are your adrenals. Most of your other glands are underactive. Your parathyroid on the right side is overactive, so that helps balance for the low thyroid on both sides. The right thyroid is okay, it's just not very active and there's an infection in it right now. The left side of your body, the circulation is very poor. Did you take birth control pills at all?

Q: No.

A: Did you take anything to restrict circulation? Any hormones or anything?

Q: No. I take niacin to boost circulation.

A: The problem with niacin is that it's the by-product of vitamin B3, it's nicotinic acid, it's not really B3, it's used B3. So it tells your body that you've had plenty of B3, so it gives you the niacin rush, but however it degenerates the tissue that relies upon B3. So if you want to kick that back in, if you can get some non-chemically treated tobacco, chew on a little bit of it and that will help, but it has to be non-treated, no saltpeter, no nothing in it. Also cantaloupe, but cantaloupe will have another problem, a sugar problem, you almost have a system like a diabetic, so you have massive sugar problems.

Q: I do.

A: So I would say if you're going to eat a piece of fruit it has to be with lots of fat, three times the fat to the amount of fruit that you eat. I suggest that you eat mainly red meat, about 75%, 25% white meat. You need lots of fish too, out of the white meat the majority of it should be fish for about three quarters of a year and then after that you can have more chicken. You need some pineapple because you're missing some enzymes in the liver. Pineapple would be helpful. So that's the fruit that you're going to eat whenever you're going to eat the fruit, okay, and with lots of fat.

Q: Pineapple.

A: Correct. Raw cream when you can get it, try to have a lot of it. Okay, you need to gain about 15 pounds and then you'll be stronger. It looks like you're going into massive chronic fatigue. 

Q: And that's what I was concerned about, liver and bones because they're too [unintelligible].

A: Well, your liver is not bad. Your liver's fine, it's just not getting what it needs. You've been fat deficient for so long it is starving to death. It's not diseased, it's not deteriorating, it's just weak from not being fed what it needs. So that's not a problem. Now I'm giving you what I can just from the glandular system. The eye can tell me, the iris can tell me whether you have drugs stored in the body, where there's damaged tissue anywhere in the system, what's wrong there. I'm just doing the best I can from just the hands which is part of this one. If you want a full consultation and you need extensive help then I can help you better by doing a full consultation with that. So I'm just doing what I can for the glandular system here. The left side of your spine is very contracted. You need to do the plow on the opposite side on the left side to stretch that left side because it's causing circulation to really be blocked here. Okay, next. Everybody here has overactive sex glands. We've got a lot of sex maniacs here. I like that because I'm one too. The adrenal gland is very low. You don't handle sugars very well at all so I recommend that you have fruits maybe once a day for a while and make sure they're with something to slow down some fats. Do not have grapes. Pineapple is good for a while. Watermelon is very good but not a lot at one time. If you're going to eat it, eat it in small portions throughout the day. If you have a piece of watermelon that's say this size, break it up into about four pieces. I know that you're going to crave the fruits like crazy but if you start eating the meats, that will balance. Your body will start relying on the protein instead of the fruit sugars. It will go for pyruvate and that will throw you back in line. Right now you have the symptoms of a lot of people who get gangrene and lose limbs as they get very old. That kind of diabetes, that's severe because your tissues are very weak and susceptible to molds. So the raw fats and the raw meats will strengthen that. There's an anemia that has set into your system. The red blood cell count is on the low side but the red blood cells are very very weak. So predominantly you do red meat. 

[audio cut]

A: These things that I'm saying does not apply to you because these things I'm catching for her. But when I explain certain things I want you to pay attention. You know like some things about mixing and...

Q: Like what was wrong with grapes that watermelon and pineapple is okay?

A: Grapes, they'll go into your system too fast and your insulin doesn't produce properly anyway. I mean your pancreas doesn't produce a good quality insulin to work that fast to catch the fruit sugar in the grape. It'll turn into a glycotoxin, advanced glycation end product and start melting your tissue. 

Q: But watermelon is okay?

A: Watermelon won't do that. But like I say, eat a small amount at a time with some kind of fat. Cheese, raw cream, raw milk, avocado, coconut. Coconut would be a very good thing for you. You can juice coconut and get the cream. There's a part in my book that tells you how to get the coconut cream out of the meat by juicing it. And a champion or a green power, one of those, an angel juicer. I suggest that you eat anywhere from three quarters to one and one quarter pound of meat a day. Work up to that. Even if it takes you a year and three, you know, a year and seven months or something like that. Just work at it. You've got time.

Q: The muscle tissue or the glandular tissue?

A: Both.

Q: All of it, anything from the cow?

A: Anything from the cow or a sheep.

Q: Okay.

A: Fine. Okay.

Q: Okay, thanks.

A: What time is it?

Q: Quarter to.

A: Okay, nobody's coming in here after, so they're going to keep the show open until seven o'clock. So, don't panic people, please. Is there anybody who has to leave at six o'clock? Okay, just keep me informed. If you see it's getting within, you know, fifteen minutes of that time, let me know. Okay. Your pancreas is very active on the right side, but on the left side it's pretty degenerative. It's probably a total of forty percent active. So you're not doing so well with sugars, and that includes cooked carbohydrates. You need to stay away from cooked starches. My recommendation. Oh, anybody who has all those overactive sex glands, if you don't have a partner, enjoy yourself. Because those hormones that build up can create a hormone that makes you irritable and anxious. If you release them with orgasm, they turn into endorphins and help you relax and feel better. Ellis, what was his name, Dr. Ellis, way back in the 60s discovered that in his chemistry labs. That's why he said, masturbate, masturbate, masturbate, get rid of most of depression in the world. I didn't believe him then, but I believe him now. All of your glands are overactive from here up, so you're very mentally acute. You probably are anal retentive because of that. It means you always have to reason everything, always have to find explanations, relax, go out and enjoy some nature. The rest of your body part is kind of, separate the two. You've got to integrate your mind and your sensuality, you've got them in conflict. Your red blood cell count is pretty good, I wouldn't say incredibly healthy because your glands are overactive and they're not overactive because they're healthy, overactive. You've got a lot of fat storage in there and if they don't keep active they're going to solidify and develop, it looks like conditions that I see develop sclerosis, multiple sclerosis. So eat lots of fat, you also need the enzymes in kiwis and pineapple, eat those with fat, especially raw cream, helps soothe those tissues, get the toxic fat out. You need to eat, I would suggest that you eat a cup of olive oil a week, a half to a whole cup of olive oil a week with red meat to help clean out those glands. You also need the other fats to help you. Now if you really want to get well fast and reverse where you're going toward, you need to gain, even though you're slightly overweight now, you need to gain another 15 pounds. Not happy for you aesthetically, maybe, but screw aesthetics when you're healthy. Probably for about three and a half years you'll need to do that and they'll start coming off. Did you have a cesarean?

Q: No.

A: Then it's fine. Probably three and a half years you won't have to do that. Like I say, I did say cycle, five month cycle, put it on two and a half months, take it off in two and a half months. One way to take it off is eat eggs, two eggs, one or two eggs blended with five ounces of vegetable juice. Vegetable juice should be 80% celery, 20% parsley. One or two eggs depending on if you're a male or female or a large person. If you're a small person, one egg. If you want to lose more weight, one egg. Next day, only meat and water. As much meat as you like and you'll take it off with a sound mind and a sound body. You need to put a hot water bottle on your tummy at night, not too hot, but you've got a lot of congestion in there and the circulation is poor in your intestine and that will help put it back together. Watermelon is also good for you in the summer. Okay. Another person with very overactive sex glands and adrenals. Pancreas is almost completely shot, it's about 10% active, so you're also basically a diabetic, which means it screws up circulation. Your red blood cell count is okay in your extremities only. In the rest of your body, the red blood cells don't seem to be able to work properly. It looks like you've got a lot of improperly constructed insulin in your system. A good way to help remove that would be Jerusalem artichokes. Grate them and eat them with a little olive oil and some cheese, and that will help chelate with them, break them down and remove them.

Q: Goat? Dairy? Cow?

A: Cow.

Q: Not goat?

A: No. The reason is goats don't relax, they're not very calm animals, and I found that in a situation like yours they have a tendency to make people anxious. Not everybody, but why take the chance? If you want to take the chance and experiment and explore, go ahead, but make sure that some objective party is doing the observing, because diabetics usually don't have a rationale about what's really happening. Your liver isn't in great shape, so I suggest that you eat pineapple, also with fats, mostly red meat, probably 60-70% meat for about three years, red meat for about three years, and then the rest of it chicken and fish, mainly fish, and then after about 3-3.5 years go into a lot of chicken and cut down the beef to maybe 50%. You need to eat about five sprigs of parsley every other day for about three weeks at a time and go into five-month cycles of eating it, also eat whole cucumbers, if they're not organic peel them. A little bit of zucchini is also helpful. Milk early in the day might give you a little bit of CFS, chronic fatigue, it might make you a little difficult in getting your digestion going, so make sure it's after 1 o'clock and then have your milk then. Stick with juice in the morning and you can mix your juice and have a few bites of cheese before you have some juice. The juice I recommend for you is 80% celery, 10% parsley and 10% carrot juice.

Q: Okay, thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: I don't know if this is [unintelligible]. Is this psychic or oriental diagnosis? [unintelligible].

A: Yeah. Just let me see your hand. It's not psychic.

Q: I've been to people I don't trust. I don't know.

A: Your parathyroid is overactive on the right side and on the left side. Your thyroids look fine.

Q: I'm on thyroid medication.

A: Yeah but I mean there's no degenerative tissue in there and they're not inactive.

Q: So what I'm doing, they must not be working if I'm taking thyroid every day.

A: That means your thyroid will never work if you're taking supplemental. Your thyroid just may have gone into a lull just like the liver does sometimes.

Q: When you mentioned the vitamin E, I used to take 300IU and I used the vitamin E. What do you do for the thyroid?

A: It may be toxic but they're not atrophying.

Q: Spider veins, varicose veins, could I do anything about that? Because I have been taking tons of Vitamin C.

A: Vitamin C is the worst thing you can do for it. Vitamin C robs the blood of fat and calcium. If it robs the fat, it's going to rob the calcium, it's going to rob all the minerals, it's going to degenerate your tissue. Vitamin C is one of the worst things you can do psychologically, emotionally, physically. Unless you're a fat person, and you are not a fat person, none. So vitamin C is the worst thing you can be taking. If you want to kick your thyroid in, go get thyroid tissue. I've had a thyroid tissue problem, I mean a thyroid problem since I was a child. I go to a buffalo ranch or somewhere and get a thyroid of a calf or something and I will take the thyroid and cut it up into three parts. I'll blend it with milk and it tastes like clam chowder. Put a little red onion in and blend it together and it tastes like clam chowder. I only have to eat that once every year and a half to once every two years and it takes care of me for that whole time. My clients are that way too. It only takes eating one whole thyroid once every year to year and two years.

Q: Do you have a calf thyroid?

A: A calf or a buffalo calf, yeah.

Q: What do you do for the spider veins because they are breaking continuously. I take the vitamin C and it makes it slow down. When I go off it, more break. It's from a side effect of all the drugs I took. [unintelligible] But how do you reverse it, or stop the process?

A: Well what happens is it creates mutant yeast and molds, antibiotics, and they normally go into the bone, but if the bone is not strong then it could go into the veins too and that can create it. So they're constantly molding, deteriorating and they break. The best way to get rid of that is eating lots of fat with meat, lots of chicken. I found that the glands regenerate quickest with red meat. The skin, the tissues throughout the entire body mainly regenerate best with fowl, chicken, turkey.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The tissues throughout the system except for dark glandular tissue. The blood is very important with red meat in most people, in some people not, but the white meat is the best thing you can do, white meat and fat.

Q: What about fish? What is that special for?

A: The fish I found is great for the nervous system, it mainly rebuilds the constituents, not the myelin. The myelin is about 80-90% fat, so the fish fat can aid the myelin, but the actual epidermis of all tissues is helped by chicken the best.

Q: [unintelligible] When you eat the chicken or any of this raw stuff, do you have to marinate it or buy it and wash it and just dig in with your knife and fork?

A: Whatever recipe you can come up with, you can do it. You can put lemon on it, you can put lime on it, you can do what the Tahitians do. When I was on the island of Moorea, which is right next to Tahiti, they had a recipe. They take coconut meat, they wring the fat out of it, they mix lime and coconut cream and diced tomatoes, and they fold it all together with either chopped meat or chicken or chopped fish. It is so delicious, it is incredible. My girlfriend said, she was a neighbor, she bought my book, and she said she had chronic fatigue since she was like 20 years old and all kinds of problems, she got on the diet, doing better. She said, but one thing I will never do is eat the chicken, I can't eat raw chicken. So I invited her over for lunch the next day and fed her that meal. She said, this is so good, what is it? I said, I'm not telling you until you finish. And she's been eating raw chicken almost every day since.

Q: So you can just have raw without doing other stuff?

A: Absolutely, yeah.

Q: They like to avoid parasites, like the Japanese, they marinate it to avoid tapeworms or something, you don't believe in that?

A: No. But if you want to do that, they do it because it digests faster, not because they're trying to get rid of the worms.

Q: So you don't get tapeworms, a parasite from raw?

A: No. Tapeworms live in individuals who mainly eat grains only. Third world countries and they're not fed any proteins. So they're feeding on all of that carbohydrate, that advanced glycation end products that would melt their body. If they didn't have those tapeworms in there, they would be in real worse shape than they already are. Okay. Hi. Relax your hands. Your glands are overactive also, your sex glands. Your thyroid gland is normal. Your pancreas is almost inactive. So stay away from fruit and carbohydrates, even carrot juice, unless it's in very small amounts. Lots of red meat, about 70% red meat, 30% white, fish, chicken, evenly. You can lean more on the chicken if you want. The chicken really makes the skin wonderful. You have some really severe intestinal problems.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's still leaking. It's still bleeding. Yeah, it is. That's what I'm saying. You need to get cabbage, juice it, drink a cup of cabbage juice a day, 4 oz. at a time. Break it up. Be sure and put it in 4 oz. jelly jars when you juice it. Cap it. Put it in. It's really 5 oz. that fit in it. So you can put a little unheated honey in it if you want, and that way it will preserve and it won't oxidize. You need 8 oz. of that a day to help stop that, because you have leaking in your gut and that can cause peritonitis and all kinds of serious problems. Lots of chicken. You need lots of chicken, but you also need the red meat. You really need to stay away from fruit. You could have carrot juice as long as it's no more than 2 oz. at a time, with cheese or raw cream or avocado or something like that. You have great recuperative ability once you get the raw meat into your system. That will heal very quickly, you just need to stop the bleeding. And it's green cabbage, not red cabbage. And you need to be creative. Do something more creative as an artist or something like that for your own relaxation. It looks like your whole stomach came about because of tension. You're burning up your B vitamins and proteins and you're not eating enough to supplement it. Lots of meat, you'll feel more relaxed and better and do something creative. And drink lots of milk too.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You're welcome. Hi. Wow, really overactive sex glands, the anadrenals, the right side of the pancreas is starting to develop. It's edemic and swollen. The left side is mostly degenerative. Your glands are very active. All of your glands are active except for the pancreas, overactive. Red blood cell count is okay, not great but it's okay. I would say 60% red meat and 40% white, mainly chicken, some fish, about 10% fish, so that means 30% chicken. Your body looks like it's storing its dead cells in the skin, which is a good place for it. It won't  cause much damage in the skin. I suggest that you have a half to a whole cup of olive oil a week with either chicken or fish. You can have a half a cup of chicken and a half a cup of beef and help break some of that storage in the tissue down, in the skin down. Pineapple also, you could use one pineapple about every 10 days.

Q: A whole pineapple?

A: Yeah, but every 10 days go through one whole pineapple, but don't eat it all at one time. You know, about a half inch circular slice every day. You can cut it circularly and put it flat on a plate like that and it will seal itself. So you can keep it for quite a while. You can put it in the refrigerator too if you like, on the plate. You have a little bit of a mineral problem, so I suggest eating lots of raw unsalted cheeses with equal amounts of raw unsalted butter. You should try to eat about, work up to two pounds of meat a day, because you are just not regenerating tissue very well, and this will help you regenerate tissue and reverse the aging process.

Q: Will it revive the pancreas too?

A: It looks like there is something in the left side of the pancreas that is causing a block and there is some kind of toxicity in there. So I doubt that the left side will unless it cleans out, but you don't need it. The right side is pretty strong, even though it is a little inflamed and edemic. Just don't eat much fruit. One a day is fine.

Q: Thanks.

A: You're welcome. Hi. Relax your hands. Your whole uterine area is drying up. You are not breaking down fats properly to lubricate yourself properly in that area. Everywhere else you seem to be fine. What it tells me is that you are storing salts or some kind of chemical down there. Are you taking any medication that might be causing that?

Q: Synthyroid for thyroid and Zoloft for depression.

A: Okay, so Zoloft would be causing that. Lots of raw meats will help reverse that.

Q: What do you recommend for lesions, like I have had a few blisters and just like mild acne? Do you say that is for hormonal or is that?

A: That is usually toxicity coming out of the tissues like the byproducts of your hormone supplements. There is no way you can get around that without eating tons of eggs, lots of raw eggs. Maybe six to ten a day. Your sex glands, all of that are just drying out.

Q: Really?

A: From here to here. So eat lots of eggs and raw fats and your meat of course. You will find that most depression, 90% of your, anywhere from 80 to 90% of your depression will go away as long as you are eating meat.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah.

Q: Is that for everybody?

A: Well, most people. That is for most people. It will go away with eating the meat. There are some cases with chronic fatigue it doesn't work as high as that, maybe 60%.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh yes, that means that nobody is going to get this recording, the rest of it. Okay. You need which microphone?

Q: It's got to be locked up at a certain time, sorry.

A: That's for the room?

Q: Yes.

A: Okay. I will speak louder. More loudly.

Q: Yeah, he's still recording. Everybody is going to have to leave this side of the building soon.

A: Okay. It shouldn't take much longer. Which is it you want? Okay. Terrific. All right. All right. Okay, um...
