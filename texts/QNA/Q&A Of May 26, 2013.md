Q: So just don't worry about it.

Q: What about if you put clay on it, can that help?

A: Usually it just dries the skin out.

Q: Oh, it just dries it out.

A: Hardens it, and you can never remove it. Or not never, it just takes a lot more.

Q: I've actually seen you again, I don't know if you remember.

A: I do remember.

Q: How many hot water bottles did we buy?

A: I never forget that.

Q: I think it was seven or eight.

Q: We have to sleep with all these hot water bottles.

Q: Good diet, keep you happy. Still really aging, though.

A: So what?

Q: We're aging.

Q: No, you know, I saw you 12 years ago and you looked just the same.

A: Almost the same.

Q: Really? Really?

A: Well, your skin's better. You look drier, really. You look older. You look younger.

Q: Yes.

Q: It's not just the food, though. I like to think it's my practice, too. You know, the spiritual one.

Q: Well, it's a combination.

Q: It's a combination.

A: When you put the spiritual practice with the food, you've got a recipe.

Q: I'm turning 54 in five days.

Q: Oh, wow!

Q: Hey!

Q: Happy birthday!

Q: Happy birthday!

Q: Hey, Aajonus, he was asking earlier, there's no food club down here in San Diego that you know of, is there?

Q: In Antonega?

Q: Yeah, right.

Q: I mean, there's your food club in LA.

Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: They deliver.

Q: Oh, OK. It's the co-op from LA.

Q: It comes down here?

Q: We get it twice a month.

Q: Where do you pick it? Marilyn?

Q: Joseph knows the people that he picks it up from, just in Antonega.

Q: And it's not here?

Q: It's not here. It's in Antonega.

Q: You mean Marilyn comes this way?

Q: Marilyn. Yeah. Her son actually delivers. Yeah.

Q: Yeah.

Q: You're lucky.

A: This is one of the best potlucks I've ever tasted.

Q: Isn't it? Isn't it?

Q: I like everything.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: It was the amino acid. He used it as salt. A little bit of salt.

A: I wouldn't eat that.

Q: Yeah, right.

Q: Have you come across that new coconut amino?

Q: The amino has the salt in it, is that why you don't eat it?

Q: No, this one's not salt. This one's just coming from coconut sap.

Q: I just think it's pasteurized.

Q: No. It's raw.

A: If it was a raw coconut, it would get sour and get nasty very quickly.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: You have to process it.

Q: And it does have salt in it, I think.

Q: It does?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Anyway, it's made from coconut sap. Have you been hearing about it? But it's probably processed.

A: It has to be processed.

Q: Yeah. No, but I have to agree with you, Aajonus. People really did a good job today.

A: You're as bad as I am Joseph, you don't like dirty plates around you, you clean right away. Get in here, leave that for me, we'll do it all together later.

Q: You know I'm worse than him, I clean straight away, he puts it in a container and says I'm not doing it today, I'm cleaning straight away. Normally he collects everything for a whole day and he's got a pile of jars and everything, but I clean on the spot and it's like I can't handle it dirty.

Q: Don't you put butter on your hands, Joseph, for the water?

Q: He's got a mixture, he's got apple cider, salt and coconut cream, he washes in that.

Q: I just use the raw butter, it's okay, you use the water.

Q: Apple cider vinegar, salt and coconut cream.

Q: For your hands?

Q: For washing the dishes.

Q: Wow.

Q: For the salt, what is it? What, coconut cream?

Q: Coconut cream, apple cider. You need a tape recorder.

Q: Turn on your tape recorder, Kathy.

Q: It's in the kitchen.

Q: Come on, Kathy, go and get it.

Q: Okay, I'm going to go get it.

Q: Okay, is everybody finished?

Q: Because I'm going to pack them up. Okay.

A: Who made this one?

Q: Me.

A: I like the pineapple in there, that's very good.

Q: Yeah, I got it from this Aajonus guy.

A: Weird guy.

Q: Can everybody bring their dishes to the kitchen?

Q: Before I go, did you say that the hot water bottles would go this way, facing my skin?

A: No, you just put both sides, like you take a hot water bottle and you put it both sides.

Q: Oh, both sides. Oh, that's covering the skin.

A: It doesn't have to touch the skin, you just have to tent the heat in with a towel wrapped around your neck.

Q: Oh, so hold it folded like this?

A: No, no, no, no.

Q: You have the hot water bottle, you fold it.

A: No, you take two hot water bottles.

Q: Two of them?

A: You put them on both sides, one on each side. You take a towel and you wrap it around.

Q: Which way is the bottle?

A: The bottles are going this way.

Q: Oh, I have, but it's going to go around this way, the hole.

A: The hole?

Q: It's just facing this way.

A: Look, you take a hot water bottle, here's a hot water bottle.

Q: Yeah.

A: Put one here.

Q: One here.

A: It extends this way, and one here that extends this way.

Q: Oh, oh, the spout, the spout is going to be facing down?

A: Well, up or down, whatever way you want it.

Q: Oh, I thought it has to cover this red mark, this red mark.

A: You have to be heated all the way around, and if you wrap a towel around it, you will...

Q: One towel is going to hold it?

A: Many times around, or three times, two and a half times around.

Q: On each leg.

A: Yeah.

Q: So I'm going to need one, two, three, four, four, wait a minute, I have to have one, five, under my arm, six, seven.

A: Seven, yeah, that's what I use, seven. Or if you have one on the head, you've got to have one in the head.

Q: You don't recommend elevation for that?

A: Yeah.

Q: Oh, you do? Okay. Does it bring toxins back to the heart or anything like that, or anything bad?

A: If you're on a bad diet, it can travel, toxins can travel in your blood, everywhere, but mostly, it'll just allow the toxins to get to the lymph glands.

Q: Oh, right.

A: That's where you want it to get to.

Q: And you want it on the hips, too, for the hot water on each hip?

A: Yeah, you can do that.

Q: Does it have to go...

A: I'm going to go to the toilet, I'll be back in a minute.

Q: Does the hot water...

Q: Did you ever sweat?

Q: No.

Q: Does anybody know what happens to...

Q: And you said one on each hip, you said on one thing, on each hip?

A: Yeah. But I'd say until you get to... You've got a lot of poisons moving up to your legs and feet at this time.

Q: So don't concentrate on the hips.

A: I would concentrate anything but on your legs and feet at this time.

Q: Yeah, do you need a piece of paper?

Q: Feet, well, I don't have to wrap my feet.

A: You know how long hot water bottles are. You're this long. How much space are you going to cover?

Q: That much.

A: If you have... Excuse me for putting my foot up here. If you do your foot like this, and you have the hot water bottle like this, and you wrap the towel around, you're going to get your whole foot in this area.

Q: Then you have to have the other hot water bottle on the other side.

A: Well, yeah. So, I said on both sides.

Q: Two hot water bottles on one leg.

A: Wrap them around.

[unintelligible chatter]

A: So, what time was it? 241.

Q: Wait a minute. I have to go get my [unintelligible].

A: So, we're not going to start for 15 minutes?

Q: We're going to start straight away.

A: Oh, that's right.

Q: What's she doing?

A: In LA, it's 3 o'clock.

Q: Do you want to start?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do you want to start?

A: Yeah, let's start. Well, let's wait until they're in the room.

Q: Can I get that pen?

Q: He's going to wash that.

A: We'll wait. We'll wait.

Q: So, if everybody can write their email address down, put your money down, and then I'm going to send you this recipe by email.

Q: Okay.

A: But no salt.

Q: What's a good substitute?

A: Onion is salty, tomato is salty, cheese is salty.

Q: Yeah, I don't know why they want to use salt.

Q: What are you drinking?

Q: It's hibiscus tea.

A: Which one?

Q: Hibiscus.

Q: Fermented with honey for a few days.

Q: What do you think?

A: Pardon?

Q: What do you think?

A: It's fine. As long as she doesn't steep it in hot water.

Q: No, I mean in the sun.

A: Pardon?

Q: In the sun.

A: Yeah. I have that remedy in my recipe in my book.

Q: Hibiscus?

A: No, steeping.

Q: Steeping.

A: In the sun.

Q: Because that's how they used to do it. They used to just steep things in the sun.

A: That's all they had.

Q: Yeah.

Q: You don't take a tea bag then, right?

A: No.

Q: No.

A: The flowers.

Q: Flowers.

Q: Well, it's pretty rich, huh? How long did you steep it for?

Q: A couple days.

Q: Yeah. Well, you know, if you're really in the desert, you'd get like, within a day, you'd get...

Q: It turns color instantly.

Q: Yeah.

Q: Yeah.

[audio cut]

Q: I don't know how to use that. I bought it, I don't know how to use it.

A: August 11th, I'll be at my farm.

Q: In which country? The Philippines?

A: Both. Thailand and the Philippines.

Q: Is that when you go?

A: We go ten days here, ten days there.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They told me that the government won't let me in. I have to buy a vehicle. And it's not...

Q: Don't push any buttons because you'll turn it off.

Q: One thing before we start. How did you like the flyer I made?

A: It's good. To the point, good size.

Q: Word out. But one thing Mike Murphy said, I have to use the word geoengineering with a chemtrail word next to it.

A: Yeah, a lot of people are not going to know what that means.

Q: Yeah.

Q: What do you think is behind all this?

A: I think it's all about keeping us in control. Same way Hitler used fluoride and a lot of other chemicals to control the people.

Q: If we get the fluoride out of the water, we have to have a...

A: Before San Diego was the last one, you know, you should have hung your board of supervisors.

Q: Portland doctors.

A: Pardon?

Q: Portland. I mean the first doctors.

Q: See? They can do it.

Q: Whenever anyone has a referendum, it's like the people always say no thank you.

Q: Yeah, 60% of the time.

Q: Yes, and that's the majority.

A: Well, I mean, San Diego fought it for, what was it, 15 years? It wasn't until a certain, forgot his name, got on the board that, you know, he streamlined it through. Which is a real shame. Thank you, Kathy.

Q: Thank you for all you did.

A: You're welcome.

Q: The battle for the raw milk.

A: Yes, that was such a great win. You know, that was a whole state. And in that situation, they didn't have the little county DA there, they had the DOJ attorneys. Department of Justice of Wisconsin down there in this little, you know, town, farm town.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, they were. After I got off the stand, I went over to, they had a federal one. They had an FDA attorney flew in for it. And I went up to him and I said, you ought to be ashamed of yourself. Just like that.

Q: If we don't speak up, Bill, we never get what we want.

A: Yeah, if you don't speak up, you're not going to be heard. Okay, let's begin. Let's begin here.

Q: I'll pass and I'll come around.

A: Okay, Michael.

Q: Well, I've had some unfortunate dental needs. I've got a couple of cavities. My dentist wants to use TPA, translucent polycrystalline aluminum oxide. As a filling.

A: Because?

Q: That's what he wants to use.

A: Just get a regular composite, is this on the top side of a molar? Or is it facial?

Q: It's on the front, it's number 27. Actually, I've got smaller ones at 26 and one at 27. He also wanted to use dycal initially. And I've checked that against the Clifford testing that I used, and that's to be counter-indicated for that material. And this is an aluminum type ceramic, but I don't know...

A: Well, it's ceramic. He actually wants to put a ceramic filling? Because any time you use a ceramic, you have to drill out twice as much tooth, and you snap it in, and it causes cracking of teeth in many situations. I used to recommend porcelain and ceramic, but because they have to snap them in, too many teeth crack, too many people have extended pain from it, because of the pressure in the tooth, I stopped recommending it. I just say do the composite, the hard plastic. Some of it's high in aluminum, but it's solid there in the plastic, and you use the light to solidify it.

Q: Yeah, that's what he has here.

A: Yeah, that's good, that's fine.

Q: What about using porcelain instead?

A: You can't use porcelain, it's hard. They have to snap it in, stretches the tooth, cracks them.

Q: You can't put porcelain?

A: That's what I mean, that's just what I said. You cannot put a hardened substance in there. You have to put a soft substance in, it will harden. 

Q: And the soft substance is the composite?

A: Composite, yeah, the hardened plastic. They use metal to harden it.

Q: They have a different type of drilling technique. They use a laser, a water laser. Supposedly, you don't have to make the anesthetic for that. It's the highest tech that they have.

A: Well, they have what they call glass, but it's sand. Sand and water. They have the laser in water. And they have the regular drill bit with water jet.

Q: My guy is really old. He just has a drill.

A: Look into somebody else, because you'll have no pain as long as you've got a water jet. Whatever they use, it doesn't matter as long as there's a water jet on it.

Q: So porcelain to high noble metal is no good either?

A: You can't use porcelain. It's got to be hardened. You've got to snap it in. You have to remove a lot of tooth to do that.

Q: So it's composite at the end.

A: Composite.

Q: And what is composite?

A: Plastic.

Q: Plastic.

A: Form of plastic.

Q: And there's aluminum in the plastic?

A: Depends upon the manufacturer or the brand you're using. So aluminum, some of them use tin, but tin is highly poisonous. So they went to aluminum because it's lighter and it's strong, but not poisonous.

Q: Does it go in the body at all?

A: Not enough to ever detect a trace. It would take a year to, if you collected the amount of toxins that were released from the composite filling, it would take a year to get a trace. Collect a trace.

Q: But not enough to...

A: Not enough to do any damage whatsoever. There's no BPAs that are released, no phthalates.

Q: And what about over a 10-20 year period?

A: You still throw all that off. That's such a minute amount that you can get rid of it every day.

Q: Would there be a material for pulp capping? He wanted to use a dycal [Note: Calcium Hydroxide, a pulp-capping protective liner under filling material] and that seemed... He said that if you don't use something right, I guess this is over the nerve.

A: Well, I usually use BioCalex.

Q: What's that?

A: It's a type of calcium. Calcium rock that's powdered. And it's pretty non-toxic, BioCalex. [Note: Calcium Hydroxide with a setting agent marketed as a
safer alternate filling material to gutta percha in root canals]

Q: So who's your dentist?

A: I use Britton in Tijuana.

Q: Can you give us that address?

A: Go to brittondental.com. 

Q: How do you spell his name?

A: B-R-I-T-T-O-N Tomas, T-O-M-A-S. He's a third generation dentist. So I convert him into a pretty holistic one. A lot of my patients fly in from everywhere. He's a good looking, very big bear of a man. He's so gentle. Perfect.

Q: Is there anything you use as a pain relief while you're having this work done?

A: You don't really need anything. If you want to, you can take some ice and put it on there. That's about the best thing to numb it, if you want to do that. Because he has the water jet, the bit doesn't get hot. When I had all of my amalgams removed, I had 16 teeth that had amalgams in them. So I had to remove 8 one day and 8 the next day. It was 4 hours of drilling each day. There was no water jet on them in those days. So that bit would get real hot. It would burn the nerve. So I had a signal, I'd tap his elbow or something to get him to stop, cool the bit, and then go back in. But I didn't use any Novocaine, anything for that. It's pretty traumatic. But when you don't use an anesthetic, the pain's gone in about 6-7 hours, 12 hours at maximum. If you get any kind of anesthetic, Novocaine, Xylocaine, any of them, it causes swelling for months in that tooth and surrounding area.

Q: It's a carcinogen.

A: What's that?

Q: It's a direct correlation between lidocaine and breast cancer.

A: Yeah. And also heart attacks.

Q: From what?

A: From dental anesthetic. More people when they're seeing a physician get heart attacks from dental work, from anesthetic.

Q: How do you remove the anesthetic off?

A: It takes years and years and years and years and years. For one injection it takes about 6 years to remove all the poison. Because it's injected and goes into the bone and the hardened tissue and it's hard to get rid of. And it's responsible for almost all mouth cancer.

Q: So novocaine is what they call it?

A: Novocaine, xylocaine, all of them.

Q: They all gave it, even [unintelligible] would give a novocaine when you have pain. He gave it inside your mouth.

A: Well, you don't take them anymore.

Q: What about Demerol?

A: Well, Demerol, that's conducive to brain cancer and pancreatic cancer.

Q: How do you handle the pain?

A: Well, your dentist, that's why I like this dentist. He's so gentle, he's slow. I took Jeff Slay a couple of months ago to him, and he had cavities between two of his molars. So he had to drill down in both teeth, good part of the tooth as well, right down to the nerve, even bled, and Jeff didn't feel a thing. No, no cavities, didn't feel a thing. Because you don't, usually when there's, you know, unless he actually, he nicked Jeff's nerve, but Jeff didn't feel it, he said he barely felt it. Because the water jet is cool, it cools the area and keeps the nerve contracted. When it expands and swells, that's when you have pain.

Q: What about when you get crowns and stuff?

A: You're not hitting a nerve if you're getting a crown.

Q: No, I'm talking about, you know, like a crown, a good idea, because you have to glue, glue, glue them to the tooth, right?

A: Well, that's, I had, and when I had those teeth done, I had to have five caps on them, because there was so much tooth gone. And when they popped out, I took beeswax, and I took a round edge of a spoon, and I pressed them on a plate, and I put that inside, just so it fit in, you know, just fine, thin inside the cap, put it on, and I bit down on each one of them. When I went back to have them removed, they couldn't remove them. And the ones that had been put on with glue and didn't come off, popped right off. But the ones that I had put on with beeswax, he couldn't get them off. We worked for one hour just getting one of them off.

Q: So you can have them put...

A: He won't do it. You know, a dentist won't do that. But that's what I did when they popped out.

Q: Why didn't you just leave it on then?

A: Pardon?

Q: Why didn't you just leave it on? If it was so hard to get off.

A: Well, I had, the tooth was... The metal, the chip, it was like 25 years old, 20, 25 years old. So all of the porcelain had chipped off of the metal and I could taste the metal. So I didn't want that contamination in my mouth 24 hours a day. Boy, that one was a really hard one. That was the first one I put on with beeswax.

Q: So when you do have porcelain, when you do have even a plastic crown infused to high noble metal...

A: No, no, I use porcelain on a cap. I wouldn't use plastic on a cap. Just in a filling.

Q: Okay, okay, so crowns need to be porcelain. So when you have pure porcelain, is that okay?

A: Well, what they do is they have full porcelain, they want to take most of your tooth away.

Q: So you're saying that then if you're going to have a crown, it's best to have porcelain infused to high noble metal?

A: To gold, yes.

Q: So that's the best thing? Why?

A: Because gold doesn't deteriorate as easily. It's a strong crown, and you don't have to get rid of as much tooth.

Q: Well, see, the thing is, you're saying that it can be infused to pure gold?

A: No, no, no. Pure gold is too soft.

Q: Yeah, so it's going to be...

A: But it's completely covered by porcelain.

Q: So it's basically high noble metal is a mixture of gold, tin, aluminum...

A: No, tin they can't use. Tin is highly poisonous.

Q: So it's aluminum?

A: Aluminum, some type of stainless steel, and gold.

Q: So then that's OK? That metal is not going directly on the gum?

A: It shouldn't, if it's a good crown.

Q: And so what was the reason not to have pure porcelain crowns?

A: Because they have to take so much tooth away, they crack and chip very easily. Porcelain is not strong.

Q: But you're saying it's not toxic to the body to have crowns, porcelain infused to high noble metals. It's not toxic.

A: You've got enough porcelain over it, over the metal. But if it started like in mine, it started chipping away, then my metal was exposed. My acids in my mouth, because they're much higher, because I had the vagotomy. So the acids that used to build and be in the stomach are in my mouth. That's why my teeth deteriorate.

Q: What did you call that? You had vagotomy?

A: Vagotomy pyloroplasty.

Q: Is that like stomach acid?

A: No, you have all these vagus nerves that attach to the stomach. And that helps generate hydrochloric acid into the stomach. All of mine were severed at 20 years old in that stomach surgery. So a lot of my acids back up into the mouth. 

Q: You could taste that?

A: Oh yeah, but you know, not good for the teeth. It eats away at the teeth.

Q: So what did you have to have done to fix that?

A: I just had to rinse my mouth with milk after I eat and stuff like that to make sure acids don't build up too much. But when I got those 3 injections when I was kidnapped 3 years ago, you know, I've lost 6 teeth because of that.

Q: Your coloring is so much better.

A: Yeah, I was grey for a while.

Q: I remember, you were so grey. It was scary.

Q: You said you lost 6 teeth?

A: 6 teeth.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah, 6 teeth.

Q: From all those vaccines?

Q: What's the connection? I don't understand.

A: You know, what's in a vaccine.

Q: Oh, mercury and shit like that?

A: Yeah, all that. Poison my whole body. My skin went grey. I'm just now getting back to...

Q: Oh, you should have seen him.

A: Yeah, I was still... See, this is more grey than that one.

Q: You see Steve's sweater that's grey? He was a bit darker than that.

A: Yeah, I was as grey as that.

Q: So basically, what, rotted the teeth or got to the teeth?

A: Well, it went into the nerves and damaged the nerves and went into the teeth. So I was popping teeth out.

Q: Wow.

A: Good teeth too. The nerve, just killed the nerve.

Q: Really?

Q: Scary, huh?

Q: That's the vaccine that everybody's getting?

A: Yep. I didn't do it on purpose. I was kidnapped and injected.

Q: You were kidnapped?

A: Kidnapped and injected, yeah.

Q: It was like a...

A: Well, I was speaking out internationally against the swine flu hoax. So they caught me in a hotel room, injected me with three of them to say, see, he died of the swine flu. But I happened to wake up, you know, when they were injecting me. And I caught them, so I knew what to do the next morning.

Q: That's like the government? Is that what you're talking about?

A: Could have been the pharmaceutical industry.

Q: That's wild.

A: Yeah. It's traumatic, because I'm just now getting... I still have tremendous pain in this arm. Right there, all the way up into here. It's been eight months now. Like when I was a kid and got tetanus shots and everything. I could never lift an arm this much without excruciating pain. It's been that way on some days. Like right here, the pain is pretty sharp. Up here, it's okay. But right about there is where it really is painful, all the way to the joint and deep into the joint.

Q: I would think as strong as you are that you'd be able to withstand that.

A: Pardon?

Q: I would think as strong as you are, that you'd be able to withstand that.

A: Three? Three of those injections? How much mercury did they inject into me?

Q: Then he'd be a dead man.

A: I should be dead.

Q: Totally.

A: But the reason I only survived is because I went out and found the stingray that was two and a half days old. And the high ammonia, see if you get natural ammonia, it'll bind with mercury and other substances so it doesn't go into the blood cells. Because that's what it would do, it would destroy my red blood cells and I'd die.

Q: Yeah.

A: So as soon as I woke that next morning and realized it wasn't a nightmare, I had three bubbles there with a hole injected in it, a little serum coming out. I ached in every joint, I was sick, I started vomiting. As soon as I tried to sit up I vomited, I had diarrhea. I called the hotel and immediately I said, I need a driver. And I said, I need one as soon as possible. So the driver came, it took him about 30 minutes. I did my vomiting, ate some cheese, ate some butter, vomited all of that. And then he came and I said, I need to get to a wharf and I need to find shark or stingray as soon as possible. And I wasn't going to explain why, but he could see I was pretty sick. And I mean, he had to help me walk. If I walked for five minutes, I was on the ground out. So when I got that way, I had to get on my knees fast and get on the ground so I wouldn't hurt myself from falling. So I had three of those just to get to the van. Three times I did that. I passed out in the van multiple times as we were driving to different wharfs. And we found a baby stingray about this big, been dead for two and a half days, they were getting ready to pitch it. Perfect. Chopped that thing up, ate it, vomited. Finally got some of that to stay down and digest it. And then as soon as the pneumonia started binding, chelating with those poisons in my blood, I was able to breathe again. I stopped passing out. But that went on for almost two days.

Q: You ate any particular part of the stingray, or just the whole thing?

A: I didn't care that it was the stinkiest ammonia, that's what I picked.

Q: Could you use urine, because it's got ammonia in it?

A: It wasn't enough. You need some strong ammonia, like from shark or a stingray, for that. And my urine would have been highly toxic.

Q: Yeah, absolutely.

Q: Somebody else's urine.

A: No people.

Q: So, ammonia is the one thing that removes a lot of toxicity?

A: It doesn't remove it, it binds with it, so it doesn't get into the cell.

Q: Anything else binds with stuff like that?

A: Not like that. Well, you've got amino acids in raw apple cider vinegar. It's very helpful with that. It's got the amino acids that bind with those substances. Joe, you're missing all this stuff.

Q: He's been taping it.

A: Oh, he's been taping it, OK. 

Q: He would have forgotten about that if I didn't tell him.

Q: Would you recommend that for people who've been forced to take vaccines like military?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Just the same as you just described.

Q: In the formulas of apple cider vinegar and amino acids, how would you take it for the vaccine?

A: Probably with coconut cream would be the best way to mix it. Coconut cream and a little milk. I'd probably say if somebody had a vaccine, one vaccine, probably three tablespoons of vinegar a day. But one at a time, so space it. And about three tablespoons of coconut cream and two tablespoons of dairy cream. Protect the nerves, or about two ounces of milk. And have that three times a day. If you've got military, I would suggest two tablespoons three times daily for about nine days. But if you're going to have that quantity, you have to eat about three tablespoons of cheese with two teaspoons of honey four to five times a day to make sure you don't get demineralized. 

Q: What about the novocaine stuff for dental? What kind of mixtures can you assist to get rid of that?

A: That's injected deep into the bone structure here, so the body will not circulate when that stuff's injected. That's why it causes so much cancer.

Q: What do you mean by it won't circulate?

A: It doesn't. They stab it right in near the bone.

Q: And then how do you get rid of it?

A: A lot of eggs, a lot of heat around the face.

Q: Would the pulling help with that?

A: Pardon?

Q: The coconut cream, coconut oil pulling?

A: Well, that'll definitely help.

Q: That'll definitely help.

A: Absolutely definitely help.

Q: So with coconut oil...

A: Coconut cream, you can pull with anything.

Q: You need to do that on an empty stomach, you said, right?

A: Pull?

Q: Before you eat anything, when you do that the first thing in the morning.

A: It's a good idea if you're going to pull the first... 

Q: You should have had cheese beforehand so that it...

A: Well, you can have some cheese. I pull with cheese. I get the cheese all melted and just keep it so I know it's locked in there. And then I'll spit it out after about five minutes. Then I'll down an egg or down just a little cheese and then I down an egg or two after that. And then go back to the cheese pulling.

Q: Cheese pulling.

Q: So, if you have metal in your mouth, like from high noble metal, even crowns, in the pulling, does it pull any of the metal?

A: Your metal isn't exposed.

Q: I don't know. That's why I'm trying to get the information. So you can do the mouth pulling and you're safe if you've got those crowns of high noble metal.

A: Can't get through the porcelain. Only if it's liquid. The metal's not liquid, it's solid. And the porcelain is solid. Now there may be some metal in the porcelain. They're not allowed to use lead in that. And they use aluminum, like I say, a trace amount in a year. And your body's handled that.

Q: There is something with the subject of dentistry was that, I don't know, 10 years ago, when I was considering removing my amalgams, I talked to the engineering school at UCLA and they were working on ultrasonic imaging. And it has come out, according to the dentist that I talked to, it's not very clear. But if they have the possibility of doing an A-scan, you'd have to know something of sonics to know what I'm talking about. You could probably detect cavities or cracks or whatever in the teeth. So it's new technology that is the future, maybe promising. Just had to mention it.

Q: I didn't even understand that. What kind of technology is that?

A: Ultrasonic imaging, instead of x-rays.

Q: Oh, is it my turn? You went around already?

A: Yes, it's your turn.

Q: I'm just trying to tell people, you know, the reason I got into the chemtrail issue, this was about 2006, is because I developed breathing difficulties. I had heart palpitations and I couldn't get enough air. Even now, I was a few days ago coming home. I know it's that because I can look up and I can see, and what you're seeing is not a picture, because I recognize that many people have this problem. We once announced on Russ Tanner of the GlobalSkyWatch.com, he said, it's been tested on rats that it can induce heart attacks. Now, what I'm asking, the question is, what do you take for this? You suck on garlic?

A: I put it in my newsletter, all about the chemtrails and what to eat.

Q: I have a copy. Maybe these people, I don't know, they tell their friends or something.

A: But I mean it's in the newsletter. I go into it in detail of what to do. It's better just to get it from there, because that's already written, that's out there.

Q: What date is it, is it?

A: Probably three years ago.

Q: Okay, I'll look it into it.

A: Two and a half, three years ago, do you remember it?

Q: Three years ago comes to mind.

A: Yeah, three years ago.

Q: Well, I actually heard from somebody chewing garlic. Is that validity at all?

A: What's garlic going to do? It's got some oil in it that, some of the esters might chelate with some of the toxins, but that's not going to change. The problem is, when those poisons get into the lungs, they get into the red blood cells. The red blood cells can no longer transport oxygen to the cells to generate energy. So even though you're getting oxygen in the lung, you're not utilizing it in the body for the red blood cells to deliver it to the rest of the cells in the body to produce energy.

Q: That's because of the chemicals from chemtrails in the body.

A: Eating something with high ammonia will help that, so they don't get into the red blood cells.

Q: Coconut cream is ammonia.

A: No, it doesn't have ammonia in it. You'd have to get some rotten fish.

Q: Or apple cider vinegar.

A: Apple cider vinegar is also... That's the way I do it with apple cider vinegar.

Q: With the fish?

A: No.

Q: Just apple cider vinegar.

A: Just apple cider vinegar.

Q: Just drinking some, a tablespoon by itself?

A: I talked about having a tablespoon with coconut cream.

Q: You've taped it.

A: You were asleep when I talked about it. But anyway, it's having coconut cream and some dairy cream or milk with your apple cider, raw apple cider vinegar.

Q: A tablespoon of each?

A: No, I've got it all, it's taped on there so you can get it.

Q: Do you think chemtrails have anything to do with my kind of fatigue?

A: It can have a lot to do with it. Well, your red blood cells. You've got great red blood cells, you shouldn't have any problem with, you shouldn't have any fatigue unless the red blood cells are not delivering the oxygen.

Q: So I should look that chemtrail thing up and do it, see if that makes a difference?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, you have good red blood cells, I can see it in your skin. Your red blood cells aren't transporting oxygen.

Q: So again, the source is the chemtrails is what you're saying?

A: Well, it can be a lot of things. It can be the old injections that you had, because you've got a lot of grayness in your skin, so that means you've got heavy metals in your skin. They're getting into the blood, and of course they attach and affect the red blood cells, and they can't transport oxygen. So you need to get something in there to bind with those poisons so they don't attach to the red blood cells and prevent them from utilizing oxygen. 

Q: And so go back and read your article about the chemtrails and what the... 

A: Or just what I said, too. You can use the raw apple cider vinegar with the milk or cream and the coconut cream.

Q: No honey?

A: You don't want honey with that. You don't want to absorb it. Honey would make you absorb it.

Q: You can just gulp it down, is it okay? Do you drink it regularly?

A: It's quite tasty, you know, so I don't know that you want to gulp it. I sip it. I like to taste it.

Q: You gave the exact amount?

A: Yeah, exact amounts, yes.

Q: Well, that's the end of my question. I don't think I need to...

A: Well, you got to tee it up, too. You could have just said, I'm afraid of chemtrails, are they affecting me, what do I do about it?

Q: Well, everyone has a different reaction to it. This guy, Russ Tanner, on the show, he can actually smell and taste it. Not very many people can do that.

A: When chemtrails are heavy, they would not go outside without a mask.

Q: What mask do you use?

A: I use my Israeli gas mask.

Q: Why is that so heavy?

A: I don't care. I don't want that crap getting into my eyes and my nose and my mouth.

Q: You can walk around this area?

A: Yeah, I've been pulled over. I've been pulled over even by the Border Patrol.

Q: I only use that I Can Breathe mask, that's all I have.

A: The what?

Q: I Can Breathe mask, that's a cotton mask.

A: That's not going to do a lot. It'll help. You're gonna have to wash it off. When I've got chemicals like that, a little cloth isn't going to help. I use that cloth, that kind. In fact, I triple mine. I'll show you what I use on an airplane.

Q: What do they say to you when they pull you over?

A: They think I'm a terrorist with a chemical bomb. Nobody uses a gas mask like that unless they're a terrorist, right?

Q: Where did you get all those masks?

A: I had this made in Vietnam about ten years ago. This is an organic cotton handkerchief. I roll it up, fold it, and then roll it like this. This goes here. I don't like the thing covering my whole face. I breathe through my nose and out my mouth. So I go like this, put this on like this.

Q: Can I do the same if I can breathe?

A: I have so many layers that all the poisons have to get through. The benzene in the airplane is not going to get to me.

Q: But I can wear that if I'm protesting with a sign or something.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, it completely covers the nostrils in many layers.

Q: So you use that when you fly?

A: Yeah. The whole trip. Once in a while if I smell something, you know, and I'm in the car, I have my bag with me, I'll pull it out. Anytime I smell something, it's a problem.

Q: Where did you get organic cotton handkerchief? Just online or something?

A: I got this probably ten years ago when I had this made, too.

Q: See, that's the thing. Ten years ago, all the cottons were just so totally different, all free of GMOs.

A: Well, you can still get organic cotton.

Q: Yeah.

A: Pretty easily.

Q: You can get it in cotton clothes.

Q: So, Aajonus, are there a lot of chemtrails in the San Diego area?

A: Well, yeah. You've got quite a bit today. I watched them streaking the sky. I mean, not like you do in Los Angeles.

Q: It's true, Nancy. Whenever you see the streaks, I think they're doing their thing.

Q: But can I get that? I have the I Can Breathe mask, and if I go out, just hold that cotton handkerchief and do it that way?

A: Yeah, you can do it that way.

Q: Okay. That's what I want to know.

A: And if you're talking, then you want to have the mask covering your face because you have a tendency to breathe through your mouth.

Q: You want to have it covering your face when you're out there?

A: If you're talking, see, like this, when I have this on, if I talk, when you talk, you have a tendency to breathe through the mouth. So if I'm going to talk in an airplane, I've got it down here, and I will talk through it like that because everybody breathes through their mouth when they're talking. But otherwise, I breathe through my nose and out my mouth. I've even trained myself where I can breathe through my nose and out my mouth while I'm asleep. Because I sleep on the planes. I force myself to stay awake. As soon as that plane starts moving, I can be asleep like a baby. So I force myself to stay awake until I get to where I can take my seatbelt off because I don't like that radiation being attracted to that buckle. So as soon as I get up there, it's off, sometimes I don't make it. I'm sleeping... I wake up three hours later with the seatbelt still there. But I've learned to breathe through my nose and out my mouth while I sleep. It took a while. Okay, somebody's just turned off here.

Q: What?

A: Whose is this?

Q: That gal, that gal, where is she? She's walking around.

Q: We can just flip it for her.

A: Okay.

Q: Jack, come on.

Q: Do you see my...

Q: Don't touch it. Don't touch it.

Q: Don't touch it. Just give it to me. What?

Q: You've got no recording. I told you to press the red button.

Q: I did!

Q: No you did not.

A: She's turned it off.

Q: I just turned it off.

A: She just now turned it off.

Q: So check it out.

Q: Oh, okay.

Q: Why'd you turn it off?

Q: Because we were waiting for this one to turn over. Yeah. So come on. Bring it over.

Q: It's spinning again.

Q: Joseph! Bring it over. Randy can ask a question.

Q: What's that you're drinking?

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: Benzene.

Q: Did you take it back to where it was? You're not going to wipe that?

Q: I took it back to where it's not important.

Q: Okay. Thank you.

Q: Don't touch it.

Q: Well, you know, there's so much going on.

Q: Give it to me.

Q: Okay. All right. Question, Randy.

A: Okay. You have a question.

Q: Oxidized cholesterol, the only way it comes would be from cooking it? Oxidized?

A: Well, you can oxidize by ozonating. You can oxidize by cooking food, eating cooked food, smoke, inhaling chemicals. Many ways to oxidize.

Q: Chemicals too?

A: Yeah. Many ways to ruin the oxygen in your body. A lot of people will ozonate. And, you know, you eat ozonated olive oil and stuff like that, you're just robbing yourself of oxygen.

Q: Even those ozone machines in the room?

A: You don't use an ozone machine in the room while you're in it awake and breathing. You can do it ionizing machines and ozonation machines in a room you're not in. But you don't want to be in the room when they're on.

Q: One quick question. Did you say that your handkerchief is organic cotton? They have to be organic in order to buy it?

A: No. Well, I would buy organic cotton. You're going to be breathing these particles? I'm going to be breathing. I want it to be organic cotton.

Q: Do they have it online?

A: Yeah, you can get organic cotton in many places.

Q: Handkerchief?

A: No, just go get a piece of cloth. Go to a material store and get some organic cloth. And just cut a section and roll it up like this. And if you have a sewing machine, bind the edges so it doesn't fray it. It doesn't fray.

Q: That's it.

Q: That was it, Randy?

Q: Okay, I've heard from different people things you've said about the baths. Like, you know, we don't walk anymore. Jim sent me that email. He sent me about doing the pineapple. So I was wondering, my question would be, can you give us an update on changes in the baths since you wrote the book?

A: Okay. Before I used to say, drink that pineapple mixture right before you get in the bath or while you're in there, when you first get in. I find that that isn't efficient over the years for a lot of people. I find that if you eat it at your normal fruit meal, it's going to be in your blood and in your digestive tract being absorbed by the time you get into the tub at night. So, I used to want the fresh juices, you know, activated, but I find that those aren't as good as when you're getting into the mixing it all in the blood and in the digestive tract with other nutrients. When it's bacterially assimilated and worked on better with the bacteria in the intestines. So, I found that eating the pineapple mixture for your regular fruit meal and doing the baths at night is better.

Q: What if you take your bath before your fruit meal?

A: Not such a good idea, but if you do, then you eat your fruit meal at a different time of the day.

Q: A lot of times I'll get up in the morning and after I've had my green juice, all of a sudden I just want to take my bath and be done with it.

A: Well, then I would eat your fruit meal in the middle of the night.

Q: That far ahead of time.

A: I find that five to six hours minimum is better. Eight, nine hours is good, too.

Q: Okay, and the question was basically, anything else has changed in the baths since the book?

A: Well, I used to say do it in the afternoon. Nobody can do it in the afternoon.

Q. What is that?

A: The hot baths.

Q: Oh.

A: So, do it in the evening. I say to everybody, if you get your 90 minutes in, first 30 minutes you go in there, do it at sleep time. It's time to go to sleep. Get in the hot tub. If you have a hot tub, it's great because then you can go to sleep in it, no problem. Because it will stay at that temperature. If you've got a bathtub, you're going to have to wake every 20 minutes to let some water out and reheat it to get hot. Also, when it's so hot, it's hard to sleep when it's 110 degrees. When it's 105, it's okay. But if you get heat prostration, you have a bowl of cold water with ice cubes floating on top and a wash rag in it. When you get heat prostration, you just can't take it, you don't want to be in there anymore, take that cloth, wring it just a little bit, put it down. Cold water will run down your head and your face. And then put your fists, not tight, open fists, into the bowl up to here, to your high wrist. And you hold it in there for only two minutes. Now, it's the brain that doesn't like to get hot. So that will go from the bone right up into the skull bone. And it cools the body pretty quickly. And the body loves heat. The brain doesn't. So that chills it fast. You've got another 20-30 minutes. Usually, when that happens, you do that. You may only do it one time and you don't have to do it again. 

Q: The problem with a lot of people, they just fall asleep and they don't wake up in time to change the water.

A: They need a timer for every 20 minutes then. A little kitchen timer, 20 minutes.

Q: I found that just room temperature water, pour it on your face a little bit, and it feels fantastic. Because there's still so much difference between how hot you're heated. Just room temperature water, just pour a little bit.

A: I find people don't work... It doesn't work for a lot of people.

Q: It won't cool you down too long, but it feels so good.

A: Yeah, it does. But it doesn't work for... Some people just can't breathe and need to get out, and I don't want them to get out.

Q: I got frostbite from putting a gold pack on the side of my face.

A: You're not supposed to put a cold pack. You're supposed to put a cold rag on there and not all ice cubes in an ice pack.

Q: Well, I put a cold pack on top. I have a cold pack I put on, you know, the old-fashioned kind. I put ice in that, and when I get too hot, I just put that here for a minute or so.

Q: It's not to rip those skins off.

Q: Why would they not be okay?

A: Well, it can actually damage your skin. Like he got frostbite. Not a good idea to use the ice directly. It's a risk. 

Q: What's the temperature of the hot tubs?

A: 105 to 110. It's up to you how hot you want it. No, not above 110 because at 111 you start destroying the vitamins and enzymes in your skin. That's why saunas and steam baths are horrible for the mucous membranes in your eyes and your ears. 

Q: 105 is minimum. 

A: 105 minimum, 110 maximum. But, you know, when you're doing a hot bath and you have a heater, you get down to 102, then it's time to change it unless you want to do it every 12 minutes. Then you start at 110, 111, it goes down to 105, you know, then you can heat it again, but that means heating it about every 12 minutes.

Q: And what about the walk at the end that you have in the book? Someone told me...

A: You don't have to do that anymore.

Q: Which one?

Q: The walk at the end of...

Q: Oh, the walk.

A: Most people can't do it anymore. You don't need it.

Q: It's still a good thing.

A: Oh, it would be a wonderful thing if you could do it.

Q: Do you do it?

Q: No.

Q: It's only because people can't do it, not because...

A: Not because it isn't better not to do it.

Q: Oh, okay, okay.

A: It would be better to do it if you can do it.

Q: Get the lymphatic going.

A: But there's an advantage if you don't do it too, because then you get right under the covers, and you stay warm the whole night. So you're going to be perspiring more. Of course, if you're walking hard, but then you're going to be using your nutrients to deal with the lactic acid that's building up as you're exercising.

Q: Can you rebound?

A: Yeah, you can rebound.

Q: What happens with the lactic acid?

A: Lactic acid?

Q: Yeah, you just said...

A: Well, when you have lactic acid, your body has to use a lot of minerals to neutralize that. Change it over.

Q: What would you recommend for somebody... Because you remember Dave, right? Dave who had to consult with you when I did?

A: Dave who?

Q: Dave Sher.

A: Oh, yes.

Q: He's extremely sensitive. Dave Sher. Extremely sensitive to heat. He can't... His wife takes a bath. He can't put his hand in there. So how would you kind of get him up from not being able to take heat?

A: Put hot water bottles under the covers.

Q: Yeah. Okay. He's doing that, actually.

A: Good.

Q: And as far as... Would you recommend him doing, like, 98 or building it up to 105 or what?

A: It won't do much good. Better he just gets... Uses the hot water bottles and heats the bed up at night. Airspace in the bed.

Q: And if someone did start doing the baths, could they start at 102 and do some good?

A: Yeah, absolutely. 

Q: 102 is okay? 102 would be the absolute rock-bottom minimum, is that right?

A: It's not going to do anything at all under 102.

Q: Okay. But 102, you get a little bit out of it.

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay.

Q: What is it in the hot baths when you can't breathe? What's that?

A: Lactic acid. I mean, you're moving all the poisons, all the nutrients. The red blood cells are getting highly contaminated. You can't utilize the oxygen properly. The brain is starting to throw off a lot of chemicals, especially aluminum.

Q: So what's a good way to clean out lactic acid?

A: Whey, you know, the sport formula.

Q: I always have a tendency to gulp it because it's so dry in my mouth.

A: You just got to learn to only, you know, sip at a time.

Q: Then you don't finish it when you get out of the bath. Let's say you have that much and then maybe it goes down to that much left.

A: If you're having, let's say, a tablespoon a minute, you're 90 minutes, that's 90 tablespoons. That's, you know, we've got 45 ounces. That's more than a quart.

Q: That's how I should sip it. But don't bring a straw in.

A: Yeah, you can take a straw in, absolutely, if you like a straw. That's how I train myself to sip. I only drank through a straw.

Q: Oh, really?

A: For a while, yeah. That way I couldn't drink, I couldn't gulp.

Q: Because you're too gulpy.

A: And I use a thin glass straw, you know, so you got to really suck a while.

Q: I have that glass straw, so you...

Q: Where would you find one of those?

A: I got it at a medical laboratory. They have different ones that are different sizes.

Q: What happens to the body when you do gulp the fluids?

A: Well, any kind of fluid that you gulp has a lot of... The H2O that tends to go to the kidney, and it's not carried with the nutrients to the cell, so it causes dehydration. Especially if you're drinking cold fluids. 

Q: I better use a tablespoon in order to get the... because I have a wide glass straw, and it's going to...

A: Well, then put your tongue up against it, so you've got pressure. You have to get beyond the tongue to do it.

Q: Put your tongue on the straw.

A: Put the straw on the tongue, so that it makes the hole smaller.

Q: There's two ways. You can just have a little spoon and just feed yourself a spoonful at a time.

A: Yeah, but when you're sucking, when you suck, you have all the enzymes, like in a baby. All the bacteria that comes out of the salivary glands. So you digest better. So I suck.

Q: What's the maximum number of sport drinks during a bath?

Q: You're gulping it down, I've noticed.

A: I don't think there's a limit.

Q: You can have as many as you want.

A: Yeah, but as long as you're sipping it.

Q: Then you're not going to be able to finish.

A: Let's say you sipped, you know, a tablespoon every minute, you're in there 90 minutes, that's 45 ounces. That's a quart and a half of fluid.

Q: Well, I've been gulping.

A: I go through two quarts easy maybe. So you're pissing out probably too much.

Q: Yeah.

A: You're probably pissing out two-thirds of it. You're not utilizing it.

Q: I've been drinking three times as much, so.

Q: You're doing the cheese. You're having the cheese in between the sports formula. You've got to wait 10 minutes from the cheese to get the sports formula. So every 20 minutes you get in the bath, you take a piece of cheese. So there's very little time you have, any time to finish it.

A: Well, then do two tablespoons a minute.

Q: Of what?

A: Of the sport formula.

Q: You don't need the straw.

A: Why would you not drink it through the straw?

Q: Because you're getting the two tablespoons. You're measuring it. You know exactly how much you should take.

A: Okay, put a tablespoon of fluid in your mouth and see what it feels like. Get a sense of how much volume in your mouth the tablespoon is.

Q: We could just dispense with the cheese while in the bath, couldn't we?

A: That's a good idea, even if you're not waiting to have some cheese, just to make sure.

Q: I have cheese in the bath.

A: Because you're going to be throwing up toxins in that hot bath.

Q: Oh, okay. So we still should keep, because I wouldn't take it.

A: I do, absolutely do, while I'm in that bathtub. Poisons are going to come out in galore.

Q: Because I can't wait ten minutes after the cheese while I'm in the bath. I can't wait.

A: Well, that's okay. Just, you know, four minutes later or five minutes later, whatever it is. You can only do that while you're in the bath.

Q: Yeah.

Q: You have cheese in the hot bath.

Q: Wait a minute. You take the cheese and don't you have to wait ten minutes?

A: Well, I just said that when you're in the bath, the rules can change. The rules can change.

Q: Oh.

Q: I went to Glen Ivy, and I took your detoxification formula before I did.

A: The vegetable juice?

Q: No, I guess the lime juice and the coconut cream.

A: Right.

Q: Is that the penicillin formula?

A: No, that's not. It's a, it pulls out industrial chemicals.

Q: Which one is that?

Q: That's the mango kiwi formula.

A: Well, it depends upon the person.

Q: Oh. So what was his detoxing formula?

Q: It was lime juice, coconut cream.

Q: That's it?

Q: No, that was the main ingredients. But what I wanted to continue is that the only thing, the problem that I had was it seemed like it affected my lungs. That when I was, that was the only discomfort that I had was that it was...
 
A: Then you were throwing off metals through your lungs. And industrial chemicals out of your lungs. Other people, it affects their livers or their, you know, wherever you have the metals collecting and loosed is where you'll feel it. So yours are in the lungs.

Q: If you get palpitations, would that be, it's going through the heart?

A: It's going through the heart. You got metals in your heart.

Q: Yeah.

Q: Is that a Glen Ivy thing, now don't they check your bag so you can't bring any glassware in there?

Q: That's true. What I did is I brought plastic and some ice water and that they let me take in. It was a plastic container of ice water.

A: That's bad because ice and plastic causes the phthalates to discharge.

Q: So what could you do with that if there's new regulations?

A: Well, I take my doctor's letter and I say I have to take my food in unless you're going to provide that food for me.

Q: Oh, we need to get another $100 for the letter?

A: You've got one for flying?

Q: Yeah.

A: Then you use the same thing.

Q: Oh, but it's only good for four months.

A: It's good for four months.

Q: Yeah.

A: I mean, they might, at Glen Ivy, they may take it once a year. But for flying, sometimes they'll say, you know, you've got to have it on fresh four months.

Q: Yeah, I actually had it work. Once, if you're in Denver, when I was coming back from Denver, they actually accepted the letter. The first one, when I went out in Burbank, for whatever reason, at Whole Foods, for the salary, I guess the woman was wearing something or something, they swab. And if it's positive in the swab, and it was positive, oh, they went nuts. Yeah. Even though my luggage went through the x-ray, they double-checked it. They tore up my, oh, really something.

Q: What did they find that it went off?

A: They swabbed the nitroglycerin.

Q: No, nitrates. 

Q: What nitrates.

A: Nitrates, that's...

Q: What nitrates.

A: What nitrates means that there may be nitroglycerin.

Q: Well, what is in a nitrate, in milk?

Q: I don't know.

A: Honey, usually it'll be in honey or in manure, so if you've gone to a farm. That's why when you get those things at the airport that says, if you've been on a farm, if you've gotten in contact with animals, they want to know if you're going to set the alarms off with the nitrates, because of the nitrogen that's in there. And they use the nitrates and nitrogen to tell whether you've been exposed to nitroglycerin. And if you've been exposed to nitroglycerin, unless you have a heart condition, they'll usually ask if you have a heart condition. No, your machines are allergic to honey. There's lots of nitrogen in it. So I clean, any time I go on a plane with honey, the jar and the lid is completely clean, spotless. And then I put the lid on tightly.

Q: And the machine doesn't pick it up.

A: Right. Boy, if there was honey on the outside, it can pick up the nitrates in it. It'll send the machine crazy. Then they go, you know, tear everything apart. Absolutely everything. They'll go through every compartment of my bag, they'll pull everything out. They'll go through absolutely everything.

Q: The funny thing is, the really thing that upset him was my shaver. An electrical shaver. And that, I can't, the life of me.

A: Wait a minute, don't everybody talk until somebody else is finished talking. And they did what with it?

Q: No, they said the, there was, I guess the electric shaver had high nitrate level. Which I couldn't, it didn't seem to make any sense.

A: Well, if you have, do you eat honey at all?

Q: Lots of it.

A: Okay, it's in your hair. And as you cut the hair with your shaver, the nitrates are going to be full in it. A lot. If you didn't eat honey, it wouldn't do that. Unless you were spreading manure on your beard. Then it would show up. I know people who do that.

Q: Does coconut cream have nitrates?

A: Not enough to detect anything.

Q: Was that a remedy in the book? You said the coconut cream in lime juice? Is that in the book?

Q: I could look that up.

A: It's in one of the newsletters.

Q: Oh, it's in one of the newsletters?

A: You have the newsletters. You can run a scan on them. You have all of the PDFs in a file. You just go on the file and search there.

Q: Under what, industrial chemical?

A: Lime juice. You'll see every time lime juice pops up. That way you'll learn what lime juice does and all of its context.

Q: Yeah, there's a side benefit.

A: Steve, do you have a question?

Q: Yes, I know soup is cooked, but it seems like there might be a benefit from pulling things out of the bone to actually drink?

A: It's all cauterized. The only thing you're going to get that's whole and active are the poison metals in the bone.

Q: What if it's organic?

A: It doesn't make any difference. Once you cauterize them, you're causing free radicals. See, minerals naturally, in a raw form, they work together in a perfect balance. Once you cook them, the calcium, the phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium are crystallized and hardened into either like a rock or like glass, depending on the temperature. So they are no longer active. It takes 20 times more calcium to do what calcium needs to do, and it still doesn't do it very well.

Q: Is there a way to pull out those minerals in a different way? Like soak them in something, or is that...

A: Not necessary. Eat your cheese and honey together.

Q: There's nothing in a bone...

A: That will do anything different and better.

Q: Oh really?

A: Yeah.

Q: Did you mention the marrow? You wouldn't be sucking the marrow out?

A: Oh, the marrow's different. Yeah, the marrow is the only place you're going to get a lot of stem cells.

Q: Yeah, right.

A: Yeah, so that's good for that.

Q: But you can get most of it just by pushing it out anyway and just eating it.

A: Yeah, yeah.

Q: You don't need to leave. I mean, the marrow's not really within the bone itself.

A: It's in that center.

Q: It's in that center. Okay.

Q: I need another tape.

Q: I would think for people on a cooked diet, soup would probably be somewhat beneficial for them.

A: It would be. But what it's going to do is create... You remember John Travolta and how thin he was?

Q: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

A: And how thick he is now? Well, that's what it creates. Remember Kevin Costner? You remember him, No Way Out? Skinny. Thick now. Thick all over.

Q: And Val Kilmer?

A: Yeah. Same way.

Q: What about him?

A: These people eat lots of bone soups and broths and stuff like that because of Sally Fallon. So then they have all these minerals they can't use in the fluid system, so they go into the bone. So they keep developing all this bone and thick tissue.

Q: So you're saying John Travolta followed that diet?

A: He does pretty much, yeah.

Q: With Sally Fallon?

A: Yeah.

Q: Oh, I didn't know that.

A: A lot of the stars did.

Q: Who's Sally Fallon?

Q: Price Pottenger.

A: Price Pottenger. Well, the Price Foundation.

Q: Yeah, right.

A: Price Pottenger. She left because of me.

Q: She did?

A: Yeah. There are 12 board of directors at Price Pottenger. And nine of them, when my book came out, nine of them wanted to go gung-ho on mine and dump hers. She, Mary Enig, and another person on the board, after a year and a half of fighting, the president and all the other people wanted to do my, favor my diet was better.

Q: Wow. 

A: They left. So Mary Enig and Sally Fallon went off and created the Weston Price Foundation.

Q: What was the original board that you're talking about?

A: The Price Pottenger Foundation.

Q: Oh, this is the Western Price Foundation.

Q: I thought they were basically the same thing.

A: No, no. Completely different organization.

Q: Interesting.

A: Pottenger is out of D.C.  This one is out of, where is it, La Mesa? Yeah, La Mesa.

Q: Does she recommend bone broth?

A: Yeah, probably half the foods are cooked.

Q: For what reason?

A: Well, you have to read her book. We're not going to discuss her here.

Q: Oh.

Q: It's a novel.

Q: It's a decent book.

Q: Yeah.

A: It's a disaster. So the broth, you know, will allow you to absorb a lot of minerals in the bone broth. But not in the right form. But it's going to create thickened, hardened tissue.

Q: Right.

A: Not to help, you know, clean lactic acid out of the body, not to help neutralize anything in the blood or over acidity.

Q: Is there a way to soak bones in warm water with some kind of, like, maybe apple cider vinegar that would actually pull out some kind of nutrients that would be...

A: Might take months to get a balance out of it.

Q: You could just let it sit. I mean, it's kind of like a high meat. You just let it sit?

A: No. It just hardens. Dehydrates and becomes...

Q: But in a liquid?

A: Yeah, in a liquid.

Q: Yeah.

A: Steep it.

Q: Okay.

A: For months, that's good. And I would probably put, if you've got a cup of water, I'd put four drops of apple cider vinegar in it.

Q: In what? In the bone marrow?

A: I just said, you've got eight ounces of water. You put four table... I mean, four drops of raw apple cider vinegar into the water, and then you put the bones in that to let it sit for a few months. Then you're going to get some of that out.

Q: You've never tried that? You were saying that in a...

A: Well, it was so much time consuming and a hassle, and I kept checking and checking.

Q: You did actually do that?

A: Oh, I tried it. I've experimented with it.

Q: Yeah, yeah, it sounds like it.

A: Probably the thing that worked the best was I took fresh bone, and I had a good stainless steel hard grater, and I grated, shaved the bone. And then let that soak for a week in some apple cider vinegar and drank that. I could tell the difference.

Q: You wouldn't be getting a sharp part of that?

A: Sure, but if you've got enough mucus, you know...

Q: It'll be okay.

A: Yeah, it'll be fine.

Q: Just break it down anyway.

A: Yeah, the hydrochloric acid will break down bone. If it's shaved and thin like that. Of course, if it's soaked in the vinegar water, it's softer.

Q: Oh, that's true.

A: Yeah, it is. It's softer.

Q: How many months did you do it with?

A: Well, that was the longest in experimenting with hard, solid bone. But the grated, you know, the longest I ever waited was probably two and a half weeks.

Q: You leave it outside in a jar?

A: Yeah.

Q: With a sealed lid?

A: I did it sealed and unsealed. It didn't seem to make a difference.

Q: So you just grated the bone?

A: Grated the bone.

Q: How much of it did you grate down?

A: I grated it down a lot, you know, just because I was doing... I put it in different jars and experimented with different ways. I did it with lemon juice and lemon juice helps fermentations and it helps bacterial breakdown and fermentation, but it doesn't work with bone very well.

Q: What would that do for you?

Q: Are you saying that bone marrow, raw bone marrow is as effective as what Steve is saying?

A: No, no, no, we're talking about minerals.

Q: Okay, so you're talking about minerals coming from bone?

A: Yes, minerals from the bone.

Q: You're not talking about bone marrow?

A: No.

Q: Just the minerals from the bone?

A: Yes.

Q: Which particular minerals are you talking about?

A: All of them.

Q: All of them.

Q: I'm just saying that a bone has so much that you really can't extract in any other way, it seems, but heating, but I guess you could from putting in something acidic, I guess?

A: Shaving it and putting it in something acidic.

Q: So are you saying that if you're cooking bone...

Q: That's what I was saying in the beginning, that it seems like that's the only way to extract those.

Q: So you're saying if you're cooking bone in water, that it actually extracts the minerals?

A: Yes, it does. It breaks them down and they don't bind together anymore. It destroys the ion attraction and magnetic sealing of it, so then they all break, fragment, just like any cooked food does. And if you're doing it in water, you know, of course you've got water penetrating in there, you know, as a solvent, so you've got it all coming apart. You know, so you've freed up those minerals, but they're cauterized. Sort of good for building bone and hard skin, but not live skin, not live bone. It's like, let's say, like you live in the desert, okay, and you go barefoot. You look at these Arabs and they've got an inch and a half to two inches of callus. There are no live cells in there. That's all dead cells, like a fibroid tumor. Well that’s the way when you build that kind of mineral content, you don't build live cells you just build mummified tissue... and it expands the girth but not the life.

Q: It would be hard to get rid of that once you grow that.

A: Yeah absolutely. You have to start eating tons of vinegar to start dissolving and getting rid of it and you're going to dissolve your teeth and your nerves and you're going to have a lot of imbalances.

Q: It's not a good idea to do it then?

A: No, you don't cook your bones to get that kind of minerals.

Q: No I mean to grate it, I'm talking about.

A: Yeah..that's fine. That's a good way to get those minerals if you want bone minerals. But, eat cheese and honey.

Q: Yeah that's it.

A: So those actors are big because of all the cooking and the broths and stuff like that....all that minerals that can't be in live tissue because it’s cauterized. Then they build it into bone and it thickens the skin.

Q: So the body is not using the minerals?

A: Look at me. I'm the same size as I was when I was a teenager. Same bone structure, nothing's grown.....I just saw my cousin today, I'm a year and a half older, a year and nine months older than he is. His skin is thick, he’s broadened, his nose is huge. I don't get all that because I don't eat cooked food.. I don't have all the cauterized minerals to add all this adipose tissue to my body.

Q: You're saying that the body's not using the minerals.

A: Well they're using it to build tissue, girth, but no life. Dead calcium... everything.

Q: So the body's not doing anything?

A: No it's just like adding plaster.

Q: It's not alive.

A: Yeah.

Q: I guess that would be me too then, because as a teenager I was a skinny kid.

A: Yeah but I met you and you already had girth.

Q: Yeah.

A: You haven’t gotten bigger, in fact you've gotten slimmer faced. So you're losing some of it... and your arms, your forearms, your wrists are smaller. I'm watching you over the years. I get to see you often so I watch you. And I love that you always keep a big tummy. When I got that big 47 inch waist, it was the best I ever felt and I had never gone up above 39 before that, so when I went from a 39 to a 47 I had never had to put my pants down under my tummy before but I felt so good.

Q: It's very nurturing, isn’t it?

A: Oh, it is phenomenal!

Q: I was talking to Joseph, he saw mine, I said I've always had it, I always want this maternal feeling around me.

A: Well, you know, since I got these injections I feel the pain, I feel nauseous all that stuff I never used to feel, like I felt after chemotherapy, and when I got fat that was the most relaxed I have ever felt since those injections.

Q: Do you recommend in the summer going down or going up in weight?

A: That's up to you, I say keep your fat and don't get rid of it, but you know I go to Asia and I start to do actual physical stuff. Like I just got a swimming pool, you know I built a swimming pool to the shape of a mango, you know different levels of it so you can wade in it, you can do the deepest is 9 foot and I've got a diving board to dive into it, so its fed from a stream where I put a dam in it so it goes in and I built - I had designed - they built it a waterfall and I had all these mechanical things made for jets to run a belt and wheel and I got a generator made to create power. So just with filling up the swimming pool that goes down into a fish pond and that goes into another fish pond, I use all of that water in multiple ways and I have no filter on the swimming pools, so it’s great algae. There's always new water flushing in, it doesn’t get so green you can't see down in there. But still green full of algae and algae eats metals, so algae gets into the skin and eats the metals and pulls them out, so that's why I had that and I was able to, two weeks ago I was there, not even 8 days ago I was there swimming in my swimming pool for the first time.

Q: Algae, what about drinking algae?

A: Wonderful.

Q: What’s the form of algae to drink?

A: Well, algae isn't alive in water, its just gonna pass through you like vegetable fiber. So algae if you're eating it in powder form is not going to be digested. Every time I check the feces of people who ate it, I always found 98% of it in the feces. Only 2% seemed to absorbed or was hiding in the feces you know, where I couldn't detect it. When you test like that, you have to dissolve the feces in water and then you have to use something to separate the algae from it - a certain type of filter. Like a thousand micrometers to get the whatever you want out of it, so its like mining for gold and its sticky and messy. So you have to do it by hand. I always found 98%, it could have been 100% but at the best its 98% but in chlorella I found 7% was not found in the feces. So 7% of it, so what that means is if you are only digesting a fraction, only have a tiny bit of chlorella, you know. Have a BB amount of it or something like that; have just a tiny amount.

Q: Why is that?

A: I just said, because you won't digest or absorb it. Otherwise it's waste, expensive waste. And when it's in dry form like that, you're not going to digest it anyway. So put it in your vegetable juice. When you make your vegetable juice, put a little bit into each vegetable juice and then when you get to it, it will already be liquid. So when you put it in the body you can start breaking it down. When it's dry, that kind of bacteria we have - we're not cows, we're not horses, we're not goats or sheep - they have the enzymes which are highly fluid. And they'll go into dry vegetation and break it down. We don't do that. That's why we don't handle vegetation raw. So you drink vegetable juice so when you hydrate that chlorela, it's already starting to come alive again and the bacteria eats live things in our bodies. It eats live things we eat. That's why the Eskimos even though they make pemmican every year, dried meat, with fat, they'll make a 90 pound block of it for each person, in case they can't find food in the winter and its just in case and when the spring comes around, if they haven't eaten it, they bury it. They won't it eat. Enzyme deficient. When enzymes are deficient you are not going to digest the vitamins as well. You're not going to digest everything as well. So your health is going to decrease. Eskimos won't do it. They'll bury it.

Q: So how do you get fresh algae?

A: You have to get chlorella, or you just have to find a pond that you...

Q: Yeah.

A: You can do it where you are. Don't put it where the chemtrails can dump into it, but just have a bowl of good drinking water, and if you've got Gerolsteiner, shake all the carbonation out of it, because the carbonation will destroy anything. It's like a natural hydrogen peroxide; it can bleach, like if you take Gerolsteiner or Perrier or any of them and put it over an old blood stain, it pulls it right out, even an old blood stain. But if you leave it on it will also start taking the dye out of your clothes. Or your furniture, wherever it is, its a natural form of hydrogen peroxide, so if you use that it won't let the algae grow. So let some water sit, let it start, take a little vegetable juice, a few drops in it, that will help.

Q: Could I put it under an umbrella?

A: That would help. Just remember, algae eats rock. So you have to put rocks in with the water or you have to make some kind of a clay vessel where algae can eat away at the metal. You don't want any glaze on it; concrete, you can use concrete that doesn't have excessive lye in it.

Q: What about just a glass of water?

A: That will never never turn algaeic. Algae eats rock.

Q: Okay so what kind of container?

A: Like I said, clay, concrete, porcelain. But if its porcelain it can't be glazed, or fired. But you're not going to get as much algae growing in porcelain because there's not a lot of metals in it.

Q: I ordered some chlorella and put half a teaspoon.

A: That's too much, you would never digest that much.

Q: Well then, how much?

A: Maybe an eighth of a teaspoon per 8 ounces of vegetable juice.

Q: Eighth of a teaspoon, then you just stir it in and drink it the next day?

A: Or days later, when you make vegetable juice, how many days do you?

Q: Three days.

A: Okay then some of them will be three days old.

Q: Only put it in one then?

A: No, I'd put it in all of them. But you're just putting a small amount.

Q: And then you mix it in?

A: Correct.

Q: You said better to put on weight and hold it? What about the weight loss thing?

A: Let your body go into a flu or a cold and lose it.

Q: Don't go on the weight loss you are saying?

A: Well, I don't mind because you've had so many vaccines, so much medication injected into you, probably the most I've ever seen besides military people. Your mother really did a job on you.

Q: She didn't do it on me I did it on myself when...

A: You did on yourself?

Q: I had different vaccines for flu and anything.

A: Your mother didn’t get you vaccinated you when you were a child? You are in Californian?

Q: Yeah. I had to go to school; I took the polio vaccine - the polio sugar cube.

A: Yeah, but that was a cube. I'm talking about injections. If you're in California, at your age you had to have at least 18 vaccines, now it's 48 or 58.

Q: So you're saying that if a person has been vaccinated 20 times or more, it's good to put on weight and reduce, put on weight and reduce.

A: Yes, force it out.

Q: I didn't quite understand what you meant about the rest of us....

A: Better just to keep the weight on and go into a cold or a flu for it to take it off.

Q: Oh, because I don't take off weight when I have a cold or flu, I don't think I do.

A: You don't?

Q: Maybe I just didn't notice.

A: Weigh yourself.

Q: Yeah.

A: When you start a flu weigh yourself at the beginning and weigh yourself at the end. You probably lose about 4 pounds. 2-4 pounds.

Q: So forget about doing the weight loss.. because I was going to do it again this winter?

A: Weight loss in the winter? Do weight loss in the summer. You need too many nutrients in the winter.

Q: The reason I do it in the winter is because in the summer it's so hot, I'm so thirsty, I just drink tons of milk and I can't lose any weight.

A: Oh I see, that's because you gulp. You get a straw, a glass straw and you suck it through. You're going to find that you drink less, you're going to feel better, and you're not going to be as thirsty. When 80% of the water is leaving your milk and going to your kidney and not getting in the cells, you're dehydrating. You've got all this incredible amount - it's like eating cheese - its going to dehydrate you. You've got all these minerals and all these nutrients to get to the cells and they need to go in and hold water to do that, and then the cell gets the water. But if you're gulping, most of that is just going right to the kidneys.

Q: So gulping makes me more thirsty?

A: Yes. That's because the body says (gasp) I need this water! And then all of a sudden it doesn't get it cause most of its dumping into the kidneys. You are giving your body a false promise.

Q: So should I forget about the weight loss thing?

A: You're not in a bad shape. This poor girl is in a bad shape so...

Q: Oh my god.

A: I wouldn't worry about it. When your body wants to take it off, it will go into a cold or a flu. If you go into a heavy pain cycle you could eat a little bit more, your honey butter or the pain formula to get through it, and then when that's over you might want to go through a short maybe three or four week weight loss period, take advantage of that. Otherwise, just let a cold or a flu take it off of you, let your body decide when its ready. Her body is so confused I have to force her, force the body.

Q: But when I have a cold or flu I don’t change my diet for weight loss, I just do the cold and flu remedies.

A: Yes, cold and flu but that's a different diet all together.

Q: Yeah.

A: That's a smoothie and milkshake. And if you sip them you won't take as much. 

Q: I have to buy a glass straw.

A: A glass straw, absolutely.

Q: What about a spoon I think if you did a spoon it would...

A: No, because then you're not getting your saliva and all your bacteria in it.

Q: When I use a straw it goes straight in the back, it doesn't, I protect my teeth that way, so I'm not really getting the saliva when I use the straw.

A: Then run it over the top of your tongue and through your teeth. So you're really sucking hard and you'll find all that saliva passes into your mouth with the fluid.

Q: So I put it in my mouth and swish it around; it's more beneficial.

A: Yes absolutely, but you have to understand that these glands are made to secrete fast by sucking. You know you swish around you have to swish it around but if you're sucking, it pours out.

Q: If you suck?

A: It pours out. So you don’t have to swish it around in your mouth.

Q: How do you suck on it? Do you take the straw do you put your tongue in the center?

A: No you put it on, give me the straw....

Q: Okay.

A: I don't worry about bacteria, suck it out so you don't drip it all over. I will put the straw on my tongue.

Q: Oh on your tongue on the tip of your tongue.

A: Suck it off the top, and when you have a narrow passage like that, boy that's a big straw, that's for sucking soups. I've got different sizes of narrowness.

Q: You said you suck it off the top? Oh, okay and put your lips on it. Exactly like that?

A: Well, not with my tongue hanging out like this. Like I said mine are half this wide.

Q: I should get the narrower straw?

A: Yeah, half of this.

Q: Why? Isn’t that a good one?

A: There is no strain on the glands to bring some up if it's that big.

Q: It doesn’t come up, nothing.

A: Okay then put it in front of your teeth, suck it through your teeth. See?

Q: So do you want some air to go through the side like how you are showing?

A: No, you wanna suck. The power of sucking.

Q: If I do that, yeah that would be good.

A: Yeah. When the fluids hit your tongue the whole body reacts. But I mean when you are sucking it through your teeth onto your tongue it's going to be the same way. See the way she's doing it right now. See? You know if I had a big straw like that my tongue would be in front of my teeth and I would be sucking very hard, stream through my teeth and have to stream over my tongue. When you see me drink this, you never see me do anything other than suck. I go like this [slurping noise]. I am sucking over my tongue, I’ve got my teeth and everything, lips and everything hard together. So I will be getting barely a stream.I had no more than a tablespoon just then. I suck.

Q: I’ve been working on my health all of my life. I teach and do a lot of body meditation. That’s how I got my health back by from being dead for a year and a half in 1995. So I built my body back slowly but none of the things that were advised to me worked so… But as my energy is coming back stronger and stronger, I’m getting jittery so I went to doctors again and all the ideas given to me are going well. That’s hard to do. So I came up with don’t eat sugar, don’t eat fat, don’t do this, don’t do that. And with all the food allergies it’s like OK, might as well go back to meditating. Anyway, I got your book about two days ago. So I tried your nuts with unheated honey and raw butter – I’m not supposed to have anything sweet…fat. So I said ‘OK, I’m going to try this and meditation’. So every half hour I would try it. I was sore first time because of this esophageal thing. By the second and third time I thought ‘this feels kind of good’. So I meditated for 3-4 hours and at the end I thought ‘this is working’. I thought, ‘wow, I can have some fat and sugar. This is like the most thrilling thing’.

A: Unheated honey is not sugar.

Q: So then I tried eggs. I’m allergic to eggs. Tomatoes. That’s the problem with being so educated, you know, in quotes. Tomatoes aren’t good with type A. There are lecithins that aren’t supposed to be good for you. I thought ‘I have the tomatoes. I have the eggs. I have everything here. Let me try this one’. Of course, I didn’t have the exact ingredients. That felt kind of good, too. My boyfriend said that is way too rich. And, I thought, it feels good. So, I guess, tomatoes are OK for a Type A. Then I’m allergic to eggs. You know, that whole thing.

A: That’s cooked.

Q: Well, that’s my question. The jitteriness has been going on forever and I think it’s because when I was very young I had the world’s worse acne. I don’t know why but they x-rayed my face for that but didn’t put any protection over my throat. So the thyroid was affected. So I don’t know if every time I do something good I get jittery because something unresolved or…

A: You’re way off balance. Look at your hands, your skin. You’re a high adrenalin-estrogen-testosterone individual. You create a lot of hormones for physical activity. If you don’t utilize them in physical activity, physical expression, you’re going to put it out in emotional expression. You will be jittery. So, when you get on this diet and get the raw cream and the nerves start settling down and you exercise enough, you won’t be jittery any more.

Q: You don't mean like tai chi, or that kind of exercise?

A: Any kind of exercise you enjoy, dancing, singing; singing is the most strenuous.

Q: Do you know how you get in these blockades where there is really not a choice, like I have one hip because I was born with two shallow hips so a lot of exercise is not particularly good.

A: What did I just say?

Q: Singing!

Q: Oh singing, I didn't hear that.

A: 20 minutes of singing is an hour on a treadmill.

Q: He told me that like three years ago and the chanting is just healing.

Q: So, what I’m thinking. I bought your workshop DVD and I’ll work with that for a little bit and then come and see you to fine-tune.

A: Always explore and experiment first and you’ll find out the truth. Get that stuff out of your head. Everything you’ve learned is wrong.

Q: Would you mind saying a little more about the testosterone?

A: Well, certain people create a lot of hormones for physical activity. And you can tell that by the activity rings. Most Iridologists call them stress rings. Only stress rings if people who don’t exercise, don’t utilize those hormones for physical activity. If you don't utilize them, spend them in physical activity, You will spend them in anxiety, which causes ticks, nervousness, anger and anxiety of all sorts. And I can't tell without photographing your eyes to see how many activity rings you have, but I can tell by your skin, you have high activity hormones in your skin. Your whole life, and everybody who has them, there's no change in their life. If they have been debilitated, you don't get the joy of utilizing your physical hormones for physical expression, you are utilizing only your bad health, because hormones are 60-80% fat; the body will use them for chelating with poisons if you don't eat enough fat.

Q: I haven’t been able to eat any fat since 1995.

A: That’s because you didn’t have raw butter and unheated honey.

Q: I had each of those things but not together. What about cheese. I think I can’t possibly eat cheese.

A: Unsalted raw cheese and honey will stabilize your nerves.

Q: Where?

A: You have to mail me for it. Some stores carry, I think, an unsalted cheese – Organic Pastures.

Q: No. The ones I’ve seen in stores the past couple years have salt.

A: They're not ordering it. You have to ask them to order it.

Q: Anyway, I do appreciate all the research and work you do. And, your book is a very good read.

A: Thank you.

Q: I get heartburn a lot now, especially at night and in the morning, and I never used to get that. Only occasionally, and all of a sudden I'm getting it almost daily. How do I stop that?

A: Well, you can't really. You have acids and poisons that are dumping out around the heart all around the esophagus, into the esophagus, so the only thing you can do to help it move out faster is to eat milkshakes. Build lots of mucus so it will pour out the mucus.

Q: During the day?

A: All the time, just make a couple of milkshakes and all through out the day, just sipping on it.

Q: So from this to this?

A: Might, but that's what you need. That's how much you need to bind those poisons. Like these poisons I just couldn't handle anymore so that's why I went for a 47 inch waist, felt the best I had felt since I was injected 4 years ago.

Q: So milk shakes?

A: Yep. Build the mucus - because those poisons are going through your esophagus. That's burning the esophagus lining, that's what heart burn is. So if you had mucus there to absorb it and pull it out of your esophagus you won't have so much burn. It's when metals pass things through, because you don’t have enough mucus.

Q: So if I think I'm allergic to milk, you're sure raw milk is fine?

A: Yeah, you just have to remember don’t drink it cold. And sip it.

Q: You mean bring it out of the refrigerator room temperature?

A: However long it takes for yours to get to room temperature. I take mine out at least the night before sometimes 24 hours. It's up to you.

Q: What is the combination for the milk shake? For his specific?

A: It's what is in the book. Its fine. And don't put ginger with it, like I tell a lot of people to do. That will thin the mucus.

Q: Do you know why bone marrow has more red in it, more blood in it, and sometimes they're white.

A: That particular area is generating a lot more red blood cells. Normally you have a balance of red and white blood cells. See, that’s where your red and white blood cells divide, mature, and then they enter the blood stream. So that place where you have a lot of red is where it's going where the red blood cells are entering the blood stream.

Q: Okay and that's good?

A: That's wonderful. Just more concentrated in red blood cells than in white blood cells in that area.

Q: How much value lost by freezing bone marrow?

A: 80% of the value, it's better to eat it rotten and stinky. Protein could be more, but fats are 80% and bone marrow is predominantly fat.

Q: Everybody freezes.

A: Well, everybody’s not well.

Q: How about about refrigerating? Does refrigerating do anything?

A: It lowers the bacterial levels, considerably. That's why you leave it out to get room temperature, to get the bacteria going.

Q: Beef bone marrow, I didn't like the taste of it. [unintelligible] sometimes I mix a tiny bit of honey with it and it makes it taste so wonderful. Is that okay to put tiny bit of honey with it. Please say yes?

A: It's risky. 

Q: Oh, why is it risky?

A: Because the honey will alter some of the protein. And it will alter the stem cell effect. It will just act like butter and honey and it's a heck of a waste of stem cells.

Q: How about tiny little drops of lemon or lime with it?

A: Lime no. Lemon would probably be okay. Lime is antibacterial. Antimicrobial.

Q: But it's okay to put on fish.

A: No, lemon is, lemon incites bacterial fermentation.

Q: I know, but today he put some lime with the lemon on the fish.

A: Its okay, it's better you don’t put lime on any kind of meat.

Q: So my whole life I have suffered with constipation and digestion issues and its better on the Primal Diet, but there are still sometimes that I don't know how to bring in a lot of food, if I drink a lot of milk shakes...

A: Slowly?

Q: Not really.

A: That will dehydrate you and you're going to urinate it out. The way you can tell is if you're drinking a quart of fluid a day, you should only be urinating a cup. So if you collect your urine for the day and how much fluid - if it's not one fourth of what you've consumed – you are chugging your fluids. You should be absorbing and utilizing 75 percent and only 25 percent urinating. Otherwise you are drinking your fluids too fast and that will cause dehydration.

Q: … and that causes constipation?

A: Yes, absolutely.

Q: I think sometimes there’s a blockage when I go to the bathroom, like sometimes a squeeze through this thin thing,

A: That's not blockage. What texture is it?

Q: Its soft.

A: You're not constipated, your body is robbing everything out as it can.

Q: I had the same issue and found that eating an avocado in the evening...

A: Well avocado is very difficult to digest...

Q: Avocado is not good you said?

A: Well it's good but half of it is just going to pass out with the feces.

Q: Well at least it helps with going to the bathroom?

A: Yeah, right. I wouldn’t suggest it. At least not for her....no she doesn't have the dryness that you have.

Q: Then what would be the difference then, what would she...?

A: Well I just told her she needs to sip things and it helps a lot. If your fecal matter was coming out very hard and then soft, it would mean that your colon is just starved for fats, fresh fats. So you could just inject some raw cream or coconut cream and butter into your rectal area and let it all absorb in there so you get the fresh fat.

Q: Like an enema?

A: Yeah, like a suppository. Just take like three tablespoons of butter, three tablespoons of cream and coconut cream, 1/4 teaspoon of honey and put it in a jelly jar, shake it, put it in a bowl of hot water, not hot enough to burn your hands for about five, six seconds. It's long enough if it doesn't burn your hand but makes it a little uncomfortable, it's perfect. Then after about four minutes, you take a bulb syringe if you've got an eight ounce. And you got four and a half ounces of fluid. You want to squeeze it all out and suck it up only till you have all the fluid in there. Don’t open it up because then you'll have a lot of air in you. And that can be painful so you open it up until you have enough of the ingredients in there and then you, on all fours, bark like a dog, squirt it in yourself and then when you're down, get down and you know get down on all fours. You can put it this way or this way or any way you like after its in there and you go down on your face this way, on your hands and knees and roll your stomach like a belly dancer, up to your descending colon, and then lie on your right side for about four minutes and you don’t have to do it fast or hard, lift your left leg and roll your stomach again. And move over to the transverse colon and down the ascending colon.

Q: Okay.

A: Just four minutes on each side, so four, four, four. Four minutes in the hot water, four minutes down on your stomach, you know, while you are down on your face and your buttocks up in the air and right side. Do that, left leg up. Its a four ounce jelly jar, so four, four, four, four. And when a person does that on high anxiety and have depression, that relieves depression sometimes like that for weeks and months, because the nervous system isn’t getting... see, the colon digests everything that goes to the nervous system and brain. So if that doesn’t get that, if your upper, smaller intestines absorb everything, your brain and nervous system don’t get much. So, when you feed it directly, the brain and nervous system get it all. All that fresh stuff, so it changes on you, if a person is depressed, give them the high meat they'll be instantly happy for a day, maybe two days. Maybe a week but they'll still go back into depression fast after. When you put the cream and the fats - the dairy cream - into the colon, you've got enough nutrients there for maybe two weeks, three weeks or one month. Feed the nervous system. 

Q: Does pineapple work for constipation?

A: For some people it does. For some people it helps them have movements. You have to experiment and see what things do for you. And if it's consistent it works, okay?

Q: Two questions. I’ve been experiencing heart fibrillations, and sort of the achy joints and I don’t know if that’s part of my RA (rheumatoid arthritis). How much fat of different kinds should I be eating daily?

A: You’re one of the dryer individuals that I’ve had but you’re doing better. It all depends on how well you digest - how much bile you produce. Your skin looks good. I see red blood cells, enzymes. You’re probably going as fast as you can. As you get better, eating pineapple will help that.

Q: With my fruit meal?

A: No. Well, if you want, you can have a chunk with your meat meal. No more than an inch x inch cube. That would help you digest your fat a little bit better. Are you doing beets in your vegetable juice? Use about 10% for fourteen days and then drop down to 5%. Unless it works for you, then stay on 10%. Beets are the highest food in natural chlorine that is predominant in hydrochloric acid. So, it helps build hydrochloric acid for better digestion. It also helps the liver make better bile. Pineapple helps both, too. Beets and pineapple both help with the digestion both in the liver and with hydrochloric acid in the stomach.

Q: How much fat should I have?

A: In terms of fat, I would say you’re doing pretty well. Are you nervous or depressed?

Q: No.

A: I’d say you have a pretty good balance. If you want more fats, then push everything equally.

Q: Okay and what about the aching with my joints, that just sort of comes and goes?

A: That's when you have poisons. Look how gray your skin is. You're throwing poisons out the joints. So the sports formula - you just sip on that through out the day and that’s going to help neutralize those poisons coming out the joints.

Q: Okay and that in addition to the bath or are those two separate things?

A: No, a bath helps get rid of that stuff faster out the skin so that it doesn’t fill up the joints. So it doesn’t hang up in the skin.

Q: The milk is building mucus?

A: Only when it's involved in a milkshake. When you have milk with egg, extra cream, and honey, you're going to build a lot of mucous.

Q: And if you have it by itself?

A: It takes care of everything evenly.

Q: So if I add ginger grated you said it will thin the mucus?

A: Thin the mucous, it won't stop creating the mucous.

Q: What does that mean?

A: Let's say you've got really thick mucous and you can't cough it out or it comes out in a thick glob you want to thin it a little.

Q: So is that a good thing?

A: If it's too thick to bring up its not good.

Q: Okay.

A: You need to thin it a little bit with some ginger.

Q: So it's good.

A: Yeah.

Q: Ginger, does it have to be juiced?

A: You can grate it in milkshake and blend it in the milkshake

Q: Okay.

A: That’s the best way to do it if you want to thin the mucus.

Q: Okay.

A: Otherwise it's just going to go in your stomach lining and irritate.

Q: So milkshakes are a good way to protect the lungs?

A: Absolutely. Just remember, all of your mucus membranes have to have mucus. The way I tell people is have you ever tried to have sex with someone without having mucus down there? You're gonna be raw and red and soar and abraised. If you eat food and you have no mucus lining it, you breathe, you've got dust in the air. If you don’t have mucus to keep the dust or the pollen or whatever it is from going into your mucus membranes into the tissue, You're going to have problems, you're going to have allergies.

Q: So you need mucus, not just for the lungs but for all areas.

A: Everywhere inside the body.

Q: Okay so is there any other thing other than milkshakes to produce healthy mucus?

A: That's the only one. Only one that I found.

Q: And to detox the lungs you got that egg and and orange juice formula?

A: That helps.

Q: Anything else that helps you detox lungs?

A: Well, I have egg - well it's an orange julius so it's cream, egg, and orange. Cut it and take the seeds out.

Q: Yeah and then you blend it with...

A: Milk, egg, honey, and cream. It helps the lungs detoxify. I wouldn’t have more fruit than that per day unless you have pneumonia. Then you could have one milkshake and two smoothies. Just orange julius smoothies.

Q: So what is the portion for the orange julius?

A: Depends upon the person, I give a ball park figure in the book.

Q: Which is in what book?

A: The recipe book. If I were going to do it per individual, I would go by how dry the skin is. I would go for a little bit more cream if the skin is terribly dry and you're bleeding in your nose and in your mucus then I would add a tiny bit of butter along with it into that orange julius. But I would make the orange no more than one third of the whole mixture. So let’s try to go around really fast. Simple questions.

Q: What is good for gums?

A: Cheese and honey.

Q: I had a real problem with cheese, made me very constipated for me, any cheese.

A: Yeah.

Q: I used to drink whey and I stopped doing that because it was so constipating.

A: You're just going to have to do suppositories; see you're almost as dry as she was when I first met you. And I think your body is still starving for fats in your colon. So using suppositories I think is the only way you're going to do it. And if you've done the suppositories and the cream, butter, and cream doesn't work for you, get rid of the coconut cream and just use more of the dairy cream and the normal amount of butter. So you use three tablespoons of dairy cream and three tablespoons of butter and that quarter teaspoon of honey. Leave out the coconut cream. That way, you wont be detoxing with the coconut cream; you'll only be strengthening and building your intestinal tract, your bowel. If you get constipated and you don’t have a block in your intestines - if you don’t have severe pain along with it, you don’t have a blockage - it means you don’t have a collapsed colon. That means your body is just absorbing so much of everything that you eat, and it's not getting enough fats in the colon to be satisfied so it's just holding on to your feces too long, pulling out everything. If you have a bowel movement every 24 hours and its getting that dry, that’s a sign that you've got good digestion. It's just not enough of the proper kinds of fats in your colon. So do that for this next time until I come back in July and let me know how it goes.

Q: I got a rash on my legs after the trips to Glen Ivy hot springs and your facial cream worked.

A: Yeah, good. See I tell you, you just need to get the poisons out of the body with the heat first and then the poisons are out. When they're trapped in the skin, they're going to keep doing damage to the skin because they're locking up in the connective tissue underneath the skin and passing through the skin a little at a time and it abraises the tissue. When you get into the hot bath like at Glen Ivy and you spend the day in there, you've got like five, seven, eight hours in there where you are constantly perspiring those poisons out. Now the next wave that comes under the skin again, if another wave does come, you need to do the same thing again because those poisons are either coming from your muscles or your bones and it has to get to the skin again, under the skin and then it has to pass through the skin. So if you move it fast with long hot baths and then put the Primal Facial body care cream there on top, you strengthen those cells while they're cleaning. And they get to absorb everything. But if the poisons are locked in the skin, the poisons have a tendency to hold on to the fat molecules.

Q: Could you divert it by eating cheese and divert it to the stomach? Instead of in the skin?

A: In the legs it's hard to do. Not too far away, it just doesn’t happen very often. That's the problem I had. I ate a lot of cheese trying to get it out from my legs. It stopped all of the bursting of my flesh here, but not in my legs.

Q: Coating the rash with cheese did help.

A: Yeah, it drew it out.

Q: What did you do?

Q: I coated a rash, I put some cheese on a rash.

A: Those are alkalanizing minerals to pull it out.

Q: On the leg or eating it?

A: On the leg.

Q: Cheese with honey… Do you spit it out?

A: No that’s oil pulling. When you have honey with cheese it’s to digest the cheese. You don’t digest no-salt, raw cheese. There are no enzymes and it’s just going to absorb poisons. So, to get your concentrated minerals, you mix a slight bit of honey with the cheese like 1:3. So if it’s three tablespoons of cheese, it’s three teaspoons of honey. I do less. Only one and half to two teaspoons of honey to digest my cheese. Then you get all this mineral concentration to help the nerves and the whole system. I have to eat a lot because of all the mineral loss from those poisons in my body.

Q: About thinning mucus again. I read in a book about horseradish and lemon.

A: Yeah, but they can really cause irritation and so much mucus loss. They would rip the mucus off the intestinal lining. That horse radish should be used in very small amounts. And lemon demineralizes the body too much.

Q: Oh. I know what I wanted to ask you about was that mercury formula. I have been doing that five days a week now so that's going to take out vaccines? Or just mercury?

A: That will absolutely help. Just make sure you are eating that cheese still, constantly eating that cheese.

Q: Yeah, cheese 10 minutes before.

A: Yeah and also in between every 20 minutes

Q: After 30 minutes you told me.

A: After 30 minutes yes. Okay.

Q: Storing food in stainless steel? Yes? No?

A: You attract a lot of radiation to metal. It's not a good idea, use glass.

Q: What do you mean you attract a lot of radiation to metal....

A: What do you use as antennas? Metal is an antenna for any kind of radio waves, wifi waves, you name it.

Q: Okay, so the food is in the metal and it attracts radiation.

A: Yes and will just broadcast right through your food.

Q: CorningWear is good, right?

A: Yeah.

Q: What about the metal tops that are on the glass jars?

A: The food is not touching it, and won't broadcast through unless you fill it way to the top like you do in vegetable juice... but you also have the refrigerator and the walls are blocking it. But if you are carrying around a metal container with your fluid in it, you're going to get it into your body and your hand going up all through your body in your food and then you're drinking it too. You are just adding all that radiation to the body.

Q: So if you wanted something that was non breakable, a container to carry a liquid drink in, what would you use?

A: Lexan.

Q: That's a plastic.

A: A very hard plastic. I don’t like it, if it gets hot, if the sun hits it, the phthalates are going to move into it. So you have to keep it out of the sun; you can't let it get over 102 degrees.

Q: Do you take fluids on airplanes?

A: I take four quarts. I take four of these with me on my flight because I've got a doctors letter.

Q: High meat and high eggs, do you eat those on an empty stomach and you kind of separate them?

A: Well, I like to buy eggs and goodbye meat.

Q: What's that?

A: It's a joke, goodbye meat. You said high eggs.

Q: Oh, right, goodbye meat.

A: Keep everybody on their toes. Now, what did you ask about that?

Q: So, should it be separated from every other thing that you eat, or like on an empty stomach and nothing eaten afterwards, or... You can eat it with a regular meat meal, or...

A: You can eat it with a regular...

Q: So you can combine it, it's no...

Q: You make your own high eggs?

Q: Yeah, he showed us how to do it a couple of potlucks ago. Just tap it. I got one that was black, that was fantastic. Yeah, I just thought, humble would be a good...

A: You absorbed every bit of it.

Q: Yeah, but the other ones, I can't get black. I just have them like once out of six or seven.

A: You've got to tap them a few times around, all the way around, get it cracked all the way around. And you put it near the sun, where it stays warm.

Q: Oh, I thought you said, keep it in a cover.

A: No, not for that, no, meat.

Q: Meat in a cover. Eggs.

A: Eggs, you have them in the carton, the sun can beat on the carton.

Q: Oh, they're covered, out of the sunlight, but in the heat.

A: Yeah.

Q: How long does it take for the...

Q: I don't know, it took me two months.

A: Depends on the individual. I've had some up to a year and a few months.

Q: It's a little bit acidic, you know, a little bit sharp. It tastes fine. I dig everything out of it, too, because it kind of gets stuck to it.

Q: And it makes you feel good.

A: Oh, yeah, it feeds the brain and nervous system, instantly.

Q: The other ones are okay, that aren't black, but the black ones are great.

Q: So what does it make you feel after you've eaten the egg?

Q: I just have special energy, it's ridiculous. Kind of like how high meat does, a little bit.

Q: How often do you eat it?

Q: Once a week.

Q: If you want to do the egg, it's okay to do the high meat, then I have trouble cracking it.

A: I've got people who only do high meat and only do high eggs. They don't eat anything fresh. They're the funniest, happiest people in the world.

Q: No, I know, but I'm saying if you can't crack the egg...

Q: You can't overdo it.

A: Well, let me put it this way, I have a fellow who eats two pounds a day of high meat. And he's the greatest person I know. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes. It sounds like you're juicing and I stop juicing because of the, not sugar rush, but the rush. And I just do like a Vitamix thing.

A: Terrible.

Q: Those are terrible?

A: Yeah, because what it'll do is the pulp stays in there and alkalizes your intestine so you don't digest your dairy and meats well. And eggs.

Q: Even if it's done separately from your eggs?

A: It doesn't make any difference. The particles lag in the folds of the intestine.

Q: So, always juicing, not...

A: Always juicing, yeah. But you look like you don't need much juice.

Q: That I don't need much juice?

A: Yeah, you've been juicing.

Q: I don't think so. No, I don't juice at all.

A: Well, I mean...

Q: I've only been doing this with what you call the pulp, like the Vitamix thing. Did you say that...

A: Yeah, you just don't need much because you're over-alkaline right now. Maybe in, you know, six weeks, seven weeks, you can start having a little juice. But you need to get un-alkalinized. 

Q: Creams, milk, butter and...

A: Yeah, and meat, yeah.

Q: Did, Aajonus, did you say it's too much, the Vitamix is too much fiber?

A: Yeah. Yeah, in order to digest the fiber you have to have alkalinizing enzymes and bacteria, and we're acidic. So, everything that's acidic you're not going to digest properly if your body's gone to the point of making enzymes and digestive juices for alkalizing, alkalized material. Between a rock and a hard place, and you're not going to digest either very well.

Q: Has your eating schedule changed anything from what it's been before? Like, when you start out in the morning you should have some cheese first, and then juice afterwards, eggs. What is the current eating schedule?

A: Same thing.

Q: But start out with cheese because that's not in there?

A: Always cheese, yeah.

Q: How much?

A: Well, no, I mean from the book that's different than I do now.

Q: So what's the difference now?

A: You eat cheese first thing in the morning, depends upon the individual. And if you have honey, I mean if you have butter with it, if you have a tendency toward constipation.

Q: It what? It takes what?

A: I said if you have a tendency toward constipation, you have butter with it.

Q: How much?

A: It depends upon the individual.  So let's say you've got your size. I'd say two tablespoons of cheese, a teaspoon of butter.

Q: First thing in the morning?

A: First thing.

Q: First thing in the morning.

A: Next after that, to get the brain going, so you don't have a lot of sugar in your nervous system, so the brain functions and focuses properly, you need eggs, two to three eggs. For your size, I'd say, no, you have five to ten minutes apart.

Q: So for my size, it would be two or three?

A: About two, three, three would be better.

Q: And five minutes apart?

A: Five to ten minutes apart.

Q: And then go into the regular schedule?

A: Then go into your regular schedule. And then in between, throughout the day, between the meat meal and your fruit meal, you're sipping on the milk and sport formula and eating cheese periodically to absorb the poisons all day long. So the cheese is added and the sport formula is added.

Q: Early in the morning, why do you have the cheese?

A: To absorb all the poisons that are dumped into the stomach and intestines.

Q: And what quantity of that? Are we all the same?

A: All different. I would say for you, two and a half.

Q: Two and a half teaspoons or tablespoons?

A: Two and a half tablespoons.

Q: What would my size be of cheese?

A: Well, and also look at your toxicity, it's about two and a half.

Q: You told me only one tablespoon of cheese, I didn't remember.

Q: Two pieces, right?

A: That's different for you. I need your brain working faster.

Q: Thank you so much.

A: You're very welcome.

Q: Thank you.

Q: Thank you.

A: Nice meeting you.

Q: Nice meeting you too.

A: Okay, Kathy.

Q: Oh, okay. Now, when you have your little bits of cheese like in the middle of the night, do you need a little bit of honey with it too?

A: That's if I've given it to you as a mineral builder.

Q: My notes didn't specify so. For the middle of the night, I sometimes eat little cheese cubes, but I didn't know.

A: Did I give you a special diet?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay. Did I tell you to have the cubes with honey or not?

Q: I don't have any specific information on it. It just somehow slipped away. But, oh well.

A: Well, if I told you to have cubes, it's likely not honey with it. It's to absorb poisons.

Q: Even in the middle of the night. Okay.

A: If I told you to eat a tablespoon of cheese, if I said cubes, that means it's for detoxification.

Q: Okay.

A: If I tell you to eat a tablespoon of cheese with a half a teaspoon of honey, that's what you have to eat. If I said cubes, it's for poisons. Okay.

Q: The one with the honey is for mineralization.

A: Yeah, to absorb and digest the minerals in the cheese.

Q: So, I'm living in a house of eight people right now.

A: That's busy.

Q: Yeah, two out of eight people, two guys have chlamydia right now.

Q: Have what?

Q: Chlamydia. Chlamydia. And they've both taken two doses of antibiotics and it hasn't gone away. And I don't really know what to tell them. Because you don't really believe in STDs, right?

A: Well, it's not an STD, but any fungus can change bodies because fungus lives in the skin or in the tissues inside. So, that just... Joe, your tape just stopped.

Q: Okay, that's all there is.

Q: Can you get another one?

A: Well, we're almost finished. Anyway, fungus does live in the skin and can, but that's the only thing. That and crabs, you know, lice, they're contagious. So, yeah. But if you put lime juice, you know, where you think that you might be subjected to it, it'll kill it, it'll kill it.

Q: Put lime juice where?

Q: I don't know how they would do that.

Q: Where do you put lime juice?

A: Well, they'd have to have the lime juice formula.

Q: Oh, what would you do for the lice? My granddaughter has... some of the kids in school have lice.

A: Lime juice and honey.

Q: Just eating that.

A: No, put it on the body. So we'd use like a half a cup of lime juice, or three quarters of a cup of lime juice, and one teaspoon of honey.

Q: Did they eat that?

A: No, no, no, that's to put on the body. Wherever the lice is.

Q: Oh, not lice, that's really not good for chlamydia.

A: She asked me about lice.

Q: Oh, what about chlamydia? Chlamydia.

A: You could do the same thing with chlamydia, but you drink it. You drink like, three ounces of lime juice, with three tablespoons of honey, and one tablespoon of lemon juice.

Q: Does anybody have those cockroaches in their house?

A: And four tablespoons of coconut cream. You'd have to have that two times a day if they've got it really bad, for about maybe six days.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Antibiotics will just kill them. Five days of antibiotics destroy one percent of the body. On this diet, you can recover two and a half percent a year. If you're not on this diet, you won't recover anything. Every antibiotic destroys one percent... Five days of antibiotics destroys one percent of the body's activity.

Q: My daughter had lice once, and then I can just share this really quickly. They just got rid of them with salt water. The little eggs, they contracted.

A: Right, they'll dry out.

Q: And it was gone so fast.

A: But it really damages the skin, too.

Q: Salt water?

A: Yeah. But that's okay. If you rinse it off fast, it's fine.

Q: I've been going to the ocean a lot.

Q: What did your daughter have?

Q: When she worked at a daycare center, there were little kids and she caught lice.

Q: Oh, lice.

A: Yeah, it's good. It'll dehydrate them. It'll kill them. Shrivel them up.

Q: Yeah. Don't get it on your face or your eyes.

Q: What do you do to get rid of the cockroaches? I don't know.

A: Okay, that's it. Everybody's asked.

Q: No, I didn't ask.

A: Yes, you did.

Q: No, no.

A: You jumped though.

Q: She mentioned lice, and so I'm piggybacking on it because she was talking about it. So I guess my question is about the skin formula. One time at one of the potlucks, you said you'd changed that formula a little bit from what you had in the book, and I didn't catch what the change was.

A: The skin formula?

Q: Yeah, the skin formula.

Q: The primal skin formula?

A: The primal facial body care cream. It's the same.

Q: It is the same. Okay. I understood that.

A: Well, you can alter it. Instead of putting butter in it, you can put bone marrow.

Q: Okay.

Q: What would that do? That'll make it smelly on the face then.

A: Because it just adds stem cells to the skin. And that would be better for you. Put bone marrow in it.

Q: Okay.

A: In your primal facial body care cream.

Q: Okay.

Q: And that royal jelly, would that add stem cells? 

A: You can't get it unfrozen anymore. Freezing it destroys the stem cells. You cannot get royal jelly unfrozen.

Q: So it's no good to get the royal jelly? It's no good to eat the royal jelly anymore?

A: No good anymore.

Q: I'll tell Marilyn.

A: Freeze all of it.

Q: They freeze everything?

A: Yeah. So how many times do I have to say it?

Q: It's on Marilyn.

A: Would you ask me four times? Four times?

Q: Why do they have to freeze it? Do they have to do it? They have to do it?

Q: They freeze it?

Q: Oh my God. Why do they have to freeze it?

A: Don't ask me. Tell them, ask them.

Q: Can we make them stop the freezing? Can we have a petition?

Q: No. You just go to the beekeeper and say, I'm not going to buy it unless you stop freezing it.

Q: Where do I get in touch with him?

Q: With the beekeeper?

Q: I have to come there. Cancel the order. I'm going to cancel. I'm not paying their $22 anymore.

Q: Tell her you don't want it, if it's ever been frozen.

Q: Yes.

Q: Stand up for your rights.

Q: I sure damn well. If I have to scream it out, I'll scream it out. I'm not going to buy your product until you stop freezing.

A: I think you're eating too much of something that's heavy. Yeah. As I can see, your skin's all swollen.

Q: There's something in that potluck...

A: More cheese and honey if you're going to do it.

Q: Don't buy one of these.
