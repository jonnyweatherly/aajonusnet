Q: I'm Isolde Balswald, I'm president of the Palm Beach County Chefs of the International Association of Cancer Victims and Friends. We educate people in finding natural means of healing. I counsel a lot of people, and I put out this newsletter every month. My name is here on the front, and inside on page 2 on the top is my name, full name, and telephone number also again. If anybody wants to come, the next meeting will take place on February the 20th in the same building, just on the first floor. All you do is follow the yellow signs again. And then you will have Dr. Rodrigo Rodríguez speak from Mexico on healing with many, many illnesses. I'm always available for you. I will get more newsletters as soon as Aajonus is full [unintelligible], and I will keep you to the top. Aajonus Vonderplanitz is one of the most wonderful people I know. His diet is terrific. I'm on it. And those people who go up and down, yo-yo, do this for a while and then go up again, they will never achieve the result. If I wouldn't do what I'm doing, I wouldn't have the energy to work 16 to 20 hours a day and help my husband and everybody else. So you see, the diet works. It heals a lot of things. And with that, I'll just turn it over to Aajonus.

[applause]

A: Hi. I got my doctorate about a year and a half ago. [unintelligible] a Ph.D. in nutrition. Well, I was a very sickly child, born into a very violent household, white bread household. And I had a brother who was 18 months older than I. So when I came home, he was still in diapers and very unhappy that I took all the attention away from mom. So he started off by pushing me on anything rusty so that I would have to be taken to the doctor because my mom's a nurse. Of course, you know, she was lockjaw phobic. So if I got near a nail, you know, off to the doctor, I would go and get a tetanus shot. And at the time, tetanus shots were supposed to last a year. But they would take me every two to six months if I fell on something rusty, a rake or whatever it was. And I wasn't that clumsy at the time. My brother just kept pushing me on those things. So the third vaccine that I got at 18 months old went to my brain, my communication center. They call it the autism. So I was unable to deal with language at that point. I could not conceive of the arrangement of letters meaning context. My brain just didn't work anymore in that way. So I learned to parrot by the time I was eight years old. [unintelligible] So if somebody said a phrase that I heard in relation to something else over the years, that's how I responded. So I was throwing out sentences that had no relationship to what the person said or talked about or asked of me. So my teachers were nuns for the first 8 years and Catholic priests [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] In actuality, I had no idea how it came into it. So at that time, they had no idea what autism was. Even genetic, congenital autism, mine was developmental because it was caused by vaccines. And I don't know how many of you know, but 96% of vaccines have thimerosal in it, which is [unintelligible] of mercury, which is the highest known neurotoxin to any animal. And usually they have a large, equal quantity of aluminum, formaldehyde, and a detergent. And they usually grow in a very toxic substance of contaminated eggs. Not fresh raw eggs, but contaminated eggs. And they take that disease and sterilize it and mix it with this combination of superpoisons and inject it in you. Up until five years ago, well, up until a year ago, five years ago there was a ruling that they were going to have to make them mercury-free.

And the FDA is allowing them to call it mercury-free, when all they've done is taken it from 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury to 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury per injection. You can't even count to quadrillion in your whole lifetime. And they had 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury per vaccine, now 56 quadrillion and they're calling it mercury-free. It's not mercury-free. So if you give it to your children or you get them yourselves, it's going to have, you're poisoning yourself. The flu vaccines, the test came out of the UK two months ago. It shows that over an eight-year period with, I think it was something like 45,000 people, there was only, you know, 12,000 people for that test. There was only one percent chance that the flu vaccine worked. The flu vaccine worked. And you have to understand that viruses are retro. That means they constantly change. So in 72 hours, the virus will never be the same. And it takes them two years to manufacture, produce, and market and distribute a flu vaccine. So it's the biggest rip-off you can do. And it's highly contaminated to anybody who takes it.

Q: It also has mercury in it.

A: Pardon?

Q: It has also mercury.

A: That's what thimerosal is, mercury. Thimerosal is mercury. It's a good technical name that they use to avoid you knowing what it is.

Q: Yep.

A: So I was getting these vaccines regularly, the tetanus shots plus the other vaccines, you know, because my mother was all into the technological. My father was an inventor and scientist, so he was into anything technological too, anything that was new and bright and shiny and chemically oriented that was given to us. So I was very toxic. I got worse and worse. By the time I was about three years old, I had fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue. That means I ached in every muscle and every joint in my body, bending over was a chore. I was very uncoordinated after all that. By the time I was eight years old, my mother put me in ballet school to teach me some coordination. And, you know, I mean, for an eight-year-old, you should be able to do the splits. This was as far as I could get, and I was in excruciating pain in my hamstring. So that's how toxic I was as a child. So by the time I reached 12 years old, I developed peritonitis, so it was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. So they went in to look at the appendix, found it in perfect condition. Probably the only thing in my body was in good condition. They took it out anyway because it could cause me problems in the future, and that's the medical profession. They don't understand anything for, you know, it doesn't belong in the body if they don't understand it. But what the appendix is, the appendix is a library. It registers every chemical and every disease that's ever entered your body and the chemical response to deal with that toxin. And your body can do it in two hours, maximum. Without an appendix, the body has to re-evaluate those toxins every time they enter the body or you're exposed to them. Even the daily pollution that we inhale, the body has a response for registered in the appendix. If you don't have an appendix, 72 hours again, maximum, to register and to deal with that toxin. So the appendix is a very important organ. They were giving me a shot every two to four hours during that five day period in the hospital. And I was swollen, I was bruised everywhere. So my time went even quicker. I was a very fat person probably which saved my life as a child.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: And after that bout, it made me, you know, I was getting fat, so the fat helped buffer the poison. Until after that, the hospital ventures, then I started getting very skinny. By the time I was 16, I was very skinny. I was having a lot of problems with everything, so I began drinking coffee to give me energy. I started smoking at 8 years old also to get new energy. And by the time I hit 16, I was smoking two packs of Lucky Strike non-filter a day, 11 cups of coffee a day. And then I would drink alcohol to calm down at night. And that's the way it was every day. Then I got married at 16, found a girlfriend who was a year older than I. [unintelligible], I don't have a clue, you know, because I was an idiot. And I was [unintelligible] because the way I'd been brought up was brutality. And I'd grown up, you know, being at my mother's side because I was too sickly to play with other children. So I got to learn to how to sew and do all those feminine, gentle things. So I had a gentler heart than my brothers. And my family was a real macho family. And they abused women in any way they could. So I wasn't that way totally until we got married until I wasn't getting any attention at all. And I became just like them, macho shithead. And so that, of course, broke up the marriage. We had a son in the first week of my senior year in high school. And I had to go to school in the day. And all my schooling was cheating, except for math. I could look at a problem or write the answer with no resolution on how I got it. So they always thought I cheated. And that's the only place I didn't cheat. You know, like all autistic children, there's a [unintelligible]. So I was able to resolve complex mathematical problems without even understanding how I did it. However, I always picked the smartest, most sensitive girl in every class to sit next to. And then I copied her hieroglyphs, because that's all it was for me. It wasn't much but sticks and lines and curves to me, because I never [unintelligible] language. And sometimes, you know, transferring from there to here, even though I had pretty photographic memory, it didn't come out the same. So it was like, it wasn't even a letter. You know, like an H would be an entirely odd shape. So nothing was consistent. And they always thought, because I was a wise guy, I didn't look like I was, you know, a congenitally autistic guy who sits off and stares like that. And my parents would never let me stare off like that. When I did, they'd slap me in the face or head or back or somewhere. You know, pay attention. What are you doing? It was a violent way to handle it. 

So that's how I got through school. C's and D's. A couple of times I got caught cheating and, you know, got reported. And when they were talking, I had no clue what they were talking about. I knew that they were reprimanding me for whatever. I knew that. I never knew that they were reprimanding me for. Except that I knew I had to cheat. Because, you know, if I got caught looking at somebody else's paper, I got yelled at. So I realized that I was doing something I wasn't supposed to do, but I didn't know any other way to pass. Because if I leave my paper blank, then I really got it. So that's how I got through school. And then when I graduated from high school, [unintelligible] My mother took me to a trade school, to a new computer trade school. This was in 1965, and it's a computer, a unit record wiring equipment trade school. And it was interesting, my mother took me there, and one of my brothers, and you know, he completely failed it. And I got top grades because there was no grammar, there was no comprehension, reading comprehension. They wanted to know your geometric and mathematical understanding and abilities. So I got some of the top responses. So they knew what they had, they knew what they had, and idiot savant. They said, write a program, it could take six months for them to write, and I could do it in an hour, two hours maximum, with no corrections. Almost literally no corrections to it. So they planted me in big companies like the third largest trucking company in the world, IBC, Carte Blanche Corporation, and so they would do all the writing for me and everything would be re-executed in long term for other people to be able to follow without writing, but it was mostly systems analysis. So here I was, a young kid, making lots of money, but before that, when I was going to high school, finishing high school, in school in the morning, came home to take care of the baby, and then had to go to work at night, cooking hamburgers and, you know, cooking french fries and stuff like that. And then when I went into this trade school, my parents continued, or started supporting me again for that six months in trade school. And again, if the professors hadn't understood that, I would never have been, but they were right with me. They never gave me a written test. It was always mathematical or geometrical, and it just came to me. I could follow. So I always knew what they were drawing and playing with. So that was very easy for me. So the family started breaking up terribly because I was an alcoholic, you know, at night, and a caffeine and cigar addict in the day to give me energy because I was very sickly. The family's relationship broke up. I couldn't take it. 

I didn't want to stay in a cold place any longer. And I had an uncle who offered to take me out in California to study for his doctorate at UCLA in psychology. He had gotten a masters in journalism prior to that. So I went out to California, and of course, they transferred me out there with the Time DC Trucking Company, and then through Carte Blanche, after that, out there. So I was making a lot of money. I was an idiot. I had my own house in Beverly Hills, a two bedroom house in Beverly Hills. And I started, at 19 years old, I started vomiting blood pretty heavily. So I went to the doctors, and they said, oh, you've got an ulcer, and take Maalox. You know, you can drink as much as you want. Still autistic, but I understand what they were saying, and they were handing me medication. [unintelligible] And of course, I was unable to question anyway, because, you know, they said, you want to take this? I would take that. And I was throwing out dialogue that I had memorized. And it was completely inane for the subject 90% of the time. Once in a while, I would get something, or [unintelligible], and it was unusual. So, I drank a lot of Maalox. I was gonna turn into a chalk factory. And that caused me to have severe abdominal cramping and pain. And I had another set of x-rays, and then found a tumor had grown right next to the ulcer. So they said, well, we have to go in and cut that out. And they gave me a vagotomy pyloroplasty, whatever the hell that meant, I didn't know. Until, you know, years later. [unintelligible] and they severed all the vagus nerves to my stomach, so I would never again secrete hydrochloric acid. They put me in the context that people were octogenerians, who don't secrete hydrochloric acid. And then, several months later, the incision, the tumor got up to about an inch and a half wide, up to about three quarters of an inch high. And they said, oh, we have to irradiate that to stop that from growing. So they gave me ten weeks of intensive irradiation therapy that cauterized my spine. Everybody know what happens when you take malleable clay and you fire it and leave it at cone four [unintelligible]. You go higher and you're going to get glass depending upon how high you fire the clay. So my spine, my movement was about like this. It was very painful. When I was going to sit, it would take me three to five minutes to sit in a chair. I'd start and it would be very painful and then I'd have to go back up again and just work my way into a chair. Extremely painful. I guess what we're going to do is bring a few chairs in.

[unintelligible chatter]

A: Here's another chair that we can use as well. Okay, so there are two more chairs here. Would you like to take a seat over here? Okay. Okay, so we have some more chairs here for people who would like to sit. You can sit closer if you like, or even over there. So that radiation therapy gave me blood and bone cancer, multiple myeloma. It's known in fact that radiation creates cancer. Maalox can cause all of the calcium and other minerals [unintelligible] in your system, cause the mucous membrane cells to be destroyed and create cancer. All of these things are known, and that's what we give people for these other conditions that lead them into worse conditions most often. So after the radiation therapy gave me blood and bone cancer, they decided they were going to give me chemotherapy. So I went through three months of chemotherapy, and that completely paralyzed me from the pectoral down. All my hair fell out and came back and came all gray and in patches. I looked like a manged dog. And so I crawled around on the floor like a worm on my elbows. It took me 30 minutes to go from here to that area over there. So I no longer used my bedrooms in my house. I lived on the living room floor, defecated and urinated in pans and bottles. And a lot of times I was never able to make it onto the pan or into the bottle because of the excruciating pain in my spine and legs. So I stopped all therapy and just decided to die. And they were going to put me in a hospice, but I was autistic and there was no way I was going to go into an environment where I was spewing out phrases that weren't coherent to them. They think that I was being abusive to them or insulting them. So I refused to go to the hospice and die alone in my own home. But two volunteers from the hospice came to take care of me two to three days a week. They'd shop for me. They'd prepare my food. They'd clean the house, clean the buckets. And sometimes I'd be lying there in my fecal matter and urine for two and three days so the house would stink terribly. [unintelligible] And I didn't have the energy and the strength or the freedom from pain to be able to clean up after myself. So I just lied there on the floor for days. One of the volunteers was a young African-American who was 18 years old who worked for the Ford Motor Company, one of the going thing groups, which was a group of singers who went around singing about Ford, you know, Mach 1 Mustang and all kinds of things.

So he was a very happy young man. He introduced me to drinking carrot juice and carrot juice. And, you know, the only carrots I'd ever had was cooked carrots. My mother would overcook everything. She didn't use spices for anything, maybe a little salt. I was heavy on salt, so when we got to the table, he went around salting everybody's plate [unintelligible] salt. [unintelligible] So that's the way I grew up with that kind of food and vegetables. Most of them would make me projectile vomit. If they gave me Brussels sprouts, I could hit that wall over here, over there, literally. And they made me sit at the dinner table for an hour and a half to two hours every night. And I had to eat those vegetables. If I vomited they would put more on my plate. So I learned, you know, to take a half of it, you know, shut off my taste buds and mash up the... In fact, I'd mash all the peas and everything on the plate so it was partially masticated so I didn't have to do it in the mouth. And mix it with a little bit of milk. You know, I swallowed down the sliced bits because all I got was one glass of milk at dinner table. So I had to be able to get down all my vegetables in one glass of milk. So I became pretty good at it. But just holding down the vomit reaction was what took so much time because sometimes I'd have to sit there for five minutes and prevent the vomit. And then it would settle down and I could go on. So, when he said carrot juice, you know, carrots, I knew what carrots were. I knew that word combined with that food. So there was no way I was going to have any carrot juice, whatever that was. But I knew it was going to be in a liquid. So liquid, I could imagine it in a liquid. [unintelligible] But I couldn't ever believe that it would be good for me. So he finally got me to taste it, just a spoon of it. And it was sweet and delicious. That's the only thing that had a taste before the chemo and radiation. Since the chemo and radiation. So it tasted pretty good, so I started drinking it. And within about ten days of drinking it, he made it for me and would bring it every day. He brought it to me. And after ten to eleven days of drinking that, the autism switched off. All of a sudden I could understand language. I said, oh, oh, these are letters that make up words that mean something. Oh, I see a verb, a preposition, an adverb. I understood everything, the conjunctions and the whole thing. I didn't have a vocabulary, but then I understood. And I called my uncle, and I started having conversation. He said, this is Aajonus. Having a conversation with Aajonus? And I said, yeah. And he said, so what's happening?

And I said, well, I've been drinking this carrot juice. He said, oh, that's, you know, he's in the medical profession. Oh, that's, you know, probably since your mind finally matured and grew up. [unintelligible] And the medical profession wasn't helpful in doing anything other, all those years. And they took me to psychologists, psychiatrists, and they thought I was just a wise guy. Nothing ever helped. So I called Steve. I used up all my money for therapies. I had been, of course, working for a trucking company. I was a member of Teamsters. So all that insurance, everything was used up. Using up my money, and I had nothing left. I had to move from the house in Beverly Hills. So I asked Steve, the volunteer, [unintelligible] if he would fund some books for me. So he got a wheelchair for me and we went to a bookstore and bought $110 worth of books in 1969. That was a lot of books. Paperback cost around 50 cents to $1.95, and a hardback was anywhere from $0.95 to $2.10 maximum. So I got a lot of books. One of them was about mind over matter. The other one that didn't relate to nutrition was one my uncle had told me to get. He told me to get Siddhartha. He said it was about a young man who grows up in a wealthy family, becomes a prodigal son, and comes back and becomes a mystic, and, you know, a very wise man. And he said, you're a diehard Republican asshole. You need some other introduction into other behavior in your life. So that was the first book I read, Siddhartha took me a week, only like probably 90 pages, 100 pages at the most. And because I had no vocabulary, I was in and out of the dictionary. And without any really understanding of vocabulary, I'd have to look up the definition. And the definition of the definition, the definition of the definition, because I was learning all at one time. So it took me a week to read that very small book, and I spent 16 hours a day doint that, in between passing out, defecating, urinating, all of that. Smoking my two packs of Lucky Strike cigarettes a day, I still continued that. And during all that time, after the radiation therapy, it deteriorated the bone around my teeth, so my teeth dangled in my gums. So if I took bit on my teeth, I'd, boy, I'd lose about half a cup of blood. So I was blending everything. So I was blending my, you know, sugar-coated donut, RC Cola, and that's what I was, you know, sucking through straws. Because I had no introduction into what health was about until this young man introduced me to carrot juice. So, but I was still eating that along with carrot juice.

So I needed some substance. And I was a big cereal eater, and I don't know, I forgot to tell you, I turned diabetic at 15 and a half. Not long after that, it was about with the peritonitis, and I also turned angina pectoris, which means I started having muscle pains in and around the heart at 15 and a half. So I had 300 heart attacks between the age of 15 and a half and 22 when I started changing my diet. 50 of them caused me to pass out, but I never died. It took me to a doctor many times because [unintelligible] crawling over, the arm going limp and hitting the ground, passing out in the classroom, and they'd just let me lie on the floor. The doctors told me it was all in my head because when the doctors did the test, they looked for congenital malformations or clotting, clogging, and I didn't have clotting in my arteries or heart. So there was nothing wrong with my heart according to them. They didn't realize that all those vaccines and all that mercury and aluminum get into the muscles and it damages the muscles causing those spasms. So they don't acknowledge that because then it would be taking away from their profession plus they'd be sued. So they're not going to acknowledge anything, any disease that is caused by their own process. They're in complete denial. There are no tests being done on tissue samples. There was an MD about nine years ago who would always take his patient's samples whether it was vomit, diarrhea, or fecal matter or tissue samples, always measure it for toxicity and chemicals. He was tried and convicted and then robbed of his license.

Q: Oh, God.

A: So, that's how they quell it. Because they know what it is. They know exactly what it is. Not every doctor does, but the people who are in charge remember them all. They know what it's about. And the pharmaceutical companies took over the medical profession in the early 1900s when Rockefeller and Carnegie started paying universities [unintelligible] huge amounts of money to find the active ingredient in a food that would cause a health increase. So, they wanted that pill that they could sell. They had good intentions at the time to make people healthy, but they realized that after there was always a chemical change in structure, it only worked in about 20% of the people, and most often with side effects. Almost 99% side effects, but they were influenced so heavily and so financially, they continued the whole regime. So now, guess who writes the procedure manuals for your doctor? The pharmaceutical houses. Merck's is that thick, seeing how prejudiced and biased it is about their products. Conditioned drugs. Conditioned drugs. And the father of modern medicine, Hippocrates, said, let food be thy medicine. He cured juvenile diabetes 100% by putting them just on a raw milk diet. 100% of every case of diabetes [unintelligible] was cured by putting them on a raw milk diet. You know how much the pharmaceutical makes a month for a diabetic that takes their medication? $1,200 a month. For good. And you know how many diabetics we have? We have about 60 million diabetics. How much money is that a year? Those pharmaceutical houses. Tremendous movement. Trillions of dollars just in one drug worldwide. One drug worldwide. It's pretty incredible. So they're not going to give up their, you know, their condos and their penthouses and sailboats and yachts or whatever it is. And their airplanes so that, you know, you can have a natural happy life without injecting yourself and taking medication. They don't care about you. They care about their own welfare. And that's a very sad thing, but it is. A lot of your doctors, though, I would say probably 70% of the doctors that I've met are good people. But they're brainwashed by the pharmaceutical companies. So they don't know any better. And you think that somebody who goes through 12 years of study and research would have a mind, an intelligence like that, a tenacity like that, would have the genius to realize the stupidity of this medication, this search, find and destroy medication orientation, this bacteria microphobia. We're going to get into that in the workshop.

So, I became able to communicate better with the carrot juice and started pulling away and eating more of whatever Steve recommended. And he was recommending, you know, vegetables and all the stuff that I hated but raw. And the only thing I ever had raw was fruit, bananas and apples and strawberries and stuff like that. So, eating raw vegetables was uncommon in my family. My family ate everything cooked, except for fruit. A lot of fruit was cooked, too. My mother would make a salad and cook apples with marshmallows. You know, marshmallows. That isn't even a food. It's styrofoam. It is really, literally styrofoam. You take an oil and hydrogenate it and it has the same molecular structure as plastic. It is styrofoam. Marshmallows are styrofoam. They take the oil and sugar and corn syrup and what do you have? You have plastic. You have a sugared plastic. And that's what they were making ice cream. They started making ice cream. They were basically making the same thing in what? Mid-1960s, late 1960s, ice cream became styrofoam. And the only place that you didn't get styrofoam was like Ben & Jerry's or Brockmeyer's or something like that. It actually came from dairy and not corn syrup and the hydrogenated vegetable oil. So he introduced me to other foods. I started getting a little better. I was supposed to die within a few months. The medical professional said that they wanted to pull all my teeth so I'd stop bleeding and I had a few months to live. They want me to suffer for the last few months of my life as a distraction. It would take me at least three months to recuperate from having all my teeth extracted. So of course I didn't do that. I was waiting to die at home. And I started getting better and better at eating these things and starting to drink raw milk. Then within... That was from 1969 at that point when I started using my mind. And then the mathematical ability left. So I had to go do something else for my life. So the only little place I knew you could be an idiot was as an actor. Not that all actors are idiots, but you don't have to know what you're saying. And I was good at that. I could memorize the lines. I even became an altar boy by being able to repeat. So I didn't have a clue what I was saying in Latin, but I could repeat the prayers. And in queue, because I knew when to say them, because I had to say them every day. You know, so it wasn't a problem. So I became a good altar boy. So this was like being an altar boy. You memorize the lines. It doesn't matter what you say. It's how you feel and how you express yourself.

Of course, memorizing lots of pages was impossible, because I didn't have that kind of ability. So, you know, I got parts that we didn't have a lot of dialogue [unintelligible]. And guess what my first television show was. Medical Center. They put me in a fucking hospital. So that was, you know, [unintelligible]. It was fun. It made me a lot of money. [unintelligible] an artist, because my grandfather was a professor at Pratt. He taught music, painting, and theater. So it was obviously in my blood. And when I was a child, that's the only way my mother could get me occupied. And out of my depression and all of my illnesses, she had a tutor for me in art. So I took art for four years. And then watching my grandfather paint and talk and draw. So I learned all, and I watched him use, you know, with that and paint and paint with oils and different textures and different mediums. So I learned quite well. So I decided to be a painter, too, as well as acting. And they both paid very well. [unintelligible] So I could make 100 to 200 an hour. You know, I just, of course, acting was a lot easier. I could do commercial, make $10,000 an hour. You know, plus residuals every time it ran. So I began, you know, that's, you know, I started just making a living. I got into apartments. I didn't have the house anymore. [unintelligible]  I also lost a resort that I had owned up in the mountains. All of that went back to, you know, lost for lack of funds, repossessed. So I got an apartment, pretty nice, you know, old apartment. $100 a month or $90 a month, something like that, $150 a month. It was very easy. And it started, you know, because I owed somewhere around $120,000 to the hospital and the doctors. And then when I got down to $80,000, I told them to eat the rest, because I became a conscious individual by that time. And I said, you guys don't deserve this money. You gave me the diseases that caused me to have to have your therapies. So I said, you eat that. And I didn't pay. So they sent the IRS out on me and everything. And I let the IRS in my house and I said, you take anything you see. [unintelligible] So I was just barely getting along all of those years, but kept drinking lots of milk. Raw milk caused all of my bones to grow back over [unintelligible] within a year and a half. So I was able to chew again by the time I was 24. And then just kept getting healthier and healthier, eating lots of cheese, raw cheeses with honey and lots of dairy. And drinking, you know, juices, making carrot juice with raw cream. And I just kept getting better and better until 27.

I decided that the only way I was going to find out how to get really well and beyond all of the medical therapies again, was to go out and go wild, because all of those years of study, studying nutrition, and I had a tutor for three and a half years who was one of the best, you know, in Los Angeles, probably one of the best in the world, who ate 70-75% of the raw foods. He and I had a conflict, you know, he thought that fat should be very limited, and every time I ate fat, I felt the best, and the fatter I got, the better I felt, the more upset he got, because I was getting like him. He had a weight problem, so he did not want me to have it, he was projecting his stuff on me. So, and every book contradicted everybody else. I mean, every nutritionist had the answers. And they were all the right way. I didn't know what the hell they do. So, what was truth or not? So I thought, the only thing that's going to be truth is [unintelligible]. And that's when I left on a bicycle at 27 years old, with four saddled bags worth of biology, chemistry, anatomy, physiology books, and a little dog on the back, and a little crate. And we bicycled. Well, she ran off with a coyote six months later in Yuma, Arizona. Really, she went off and lived with a coyote, because she was a raw food dog. You know, and I was there when she was born, [unintelligible] dogs, and she wasn't doing too well in feeding, so I started feeding them raw dairy and raw meat. These dogs were phenomenal, so I got to take one out of the litter. So she went with me, and she was so healthy that she went off and lived with a coyote. And she would come back. This was when I was traveling. I spent a lot of nights living, you know, in my sleeping bag in the orchards where I'd work and make some money. And I'd make some money, and coyotes came up one night, and she ran off with them. You know, she looked at me, you know, go off and go play. So she'd go play, and after about four days, you know, she gave me that look that one night. Just, you know, goes off and comes back, and she's looking at me going like this. She's telling me she's going to do something unusual. I said, you have to do what you have to do. I didn't know if she was going to really stay with them. I thought maybe a day or two or something like that instead of just, you know, a few hours of the night. And then she ran off with them, didn't come back. So I stayed there ten days waiting for her to make a choice. Since she wanted to leave them and come back with me, of course, [unintelligible]. You know, a natural dog. Why would she want to stay with a human that's totally sick with him? Crazy, riding around on a bicycle freezing to death at night. You know, this was the dead of winter.

And, you know, it's pretty cold out there in the desert. [unintelligible] degrees temperature change from day to night. It's five o'clock in the morning and it's cold. And it would get below freezing sometimes out there. So, I stayed there and I'd hear the coyotes coming by. And her little yelp, she was a Lhasa, Hungarian, [unintelligible]. So, you know, she was about this big. And you could hear her trying to yell like a coyote. So then after about the tenth night, they stopped coming around that way. So I knew that she was going to live with them, so I [unintelligible]. So at the end of that two and a half years, I don't know, two and a half years, I was in Alaska living with a different Indian tribe. I was living with the Inuit at that time. And, of course, they eat raw meat. That's their only food, really, 99% of the year. And I lived with the Yaquis in Mexico. So I got my bike all the way down to the Yucatan. Those are the Mayan tribe, and they're in the woods and still live there. I mean, they come out to kill, so they still live in the woods. So they took me in for a month, a month and a half. The Yaquis took me in for a couple of months. The Sioux in South Dakota took me in for about a month. And then the Inuit took me in for about a month. All of them told me, raw meat is what you need. But after the surgery, when I ate meat, cooked meat, I'd break out in pustulations that were full. I mean, big, gnarly pustulations. All the way from my forehead down to my knees. So, you know, I'd break out within 24 hours. There was no way I was going to get into meat. I mean, everything else raw, yes. Raw dairy and everything, but then I got away from raw dairy. I lived outdoors because I met so many vegetarians in my travel, people that I really liked, who seemed very spiritual and kind, who would not eat dairy and not eat eggs. So I stopped eating dairy and eggs and became a complete raw food vegetarian. Of course, my weight started dropping like crazy, and I got down to 113 pounds. Consider right now I'm 185. So 113 pounds, I was skin and bones. So I denied all the raw meat stuff. So I went to their celebration, the Eskimo celebration, and they dug up this stuff wrapped in hives. They opened it up, and it was green and black and white and yellow, all this moldy stuff. It's so bad I thought I was gonna puking. The children are smelling it, and they think it's like cotton candy or something. It's horrendous and repulsive looking from my [unintelligible]. So there's nothing that I want. And they're saying this is the feeling. All the tribe does this once a year before the heavy winter, and they call it high meat. Gives them happy feelings and high and all that kind of stuff. [unintelligible]

So they buried them because they didn't stink a half a mile down there. So then they dug it up about six days later. They had the celebration. If I got within five feet, I'd want to vomit. I definitely had to restrain my tendency to vomit. So they ate some and they talked me into eating a ping pong ball sized amount. And I'd take cotton balls with musk oil, stuff it up my nose, just to be able to get near it. It was easy to eat because it was tender. It was like braised in brandy lamb, very like melted in your mouth. So it was easy to eat. It was just an ogre that was horrendous. So I ate it and getting out of the sleeping bag in the morning was usually a difficult time because the multiple myeloma, being vegetarian was starting to take its toll again. The cancer of blood and bones was becoming very excruciating. Temperatures would drop below 49, 50 degrees. I was crippled in pain. And it was getting that cold at night. This was only early September 1976. But still, in Alaska, it's cold already. Getting ready to snow. So after I ate that, getting out of the sleeping bag, normally it took me two hours with the sun beating on the sleeping bag for me to be able to be non-pained enough to move. And then I'd lie in the sun, beating on me for another 45 minutes before I could move comfortably or semi-comfortably. After that rotten stuff that they fed me, I was out of the sleeping bag in 45 minutes. In the sun, beating directly for only about 20 minutes, 30 minutes. So it was an advantage. So I went back and I said, OK, what were those herbs that you gave me that stunk so bad? They said, no, that was meat, high meat. And I said, no, no, no, no, no, no. Meat turns into worms or dries into jerky in the sun. Meat doesn't mold. And, you know, of course, I didn't have an exchange of language that was good enough to understand. But they were saying that meat molds too. Gangrene. Gangrene is a mold. But I wasn't aware of that and didn't know it. And none of our medical works except for dang green. So I didn't have a clue that it was really that. I thought that they were just not doing enough for the the white boy and the white boys just devastated all the Indian tribes on the planet. And they were not going to give this white boy as a recipe for health. You know, so I left. And I was getting pretty weak at the end of that time. So I hopped on the freight train to get back to California. I bungee corded my bicycle and then hung my hammock across the open door and watched the scenery go by. And I got back to California and decided to lay deep in southern California near Palm Springs. I decided to fast myself to death because I was not going to live in that kind of pain.

So I began fasting, drinking water every day, half a gallon a day, half a gallon to a gallon a day. And there was a stream near the canyon, the foothills of this old Indian burial ground where I was going to die. And coyotes would come down every night, wake me up about midnight and play this little game. And what it was, [unintelligible], all I could make of it. And I always had a rapport with animals, not with humans, because humans have to have dialogue. Animals have instinct and intuition, and they go mostly on that. So it was more easy for me to communicate with animals. So this was a game that the coyotes would play with me, and I thought they would be trying distract me from my pain and suffering. So after about 10th day, 12th day, maybe two weeks, they brought a rabbit to me, a jackrabbit. It was about 7.5 pounds, about a year old. And they laid it to me, bloody and all of that, and I was almost six and a half years at this point [unintelligible]. And what I ate maybe was chicken or fish, and not beef because I'd break out. So here was this, you know, one of the reasons I didn't want to eat meat also was because I loved animals. So here was an Easter Bunny on my feet. And he was just, you know, bleeding, and warm, and very nauseating. And I said, you know, these coyotes tried to give me food or something. And then, when my uncle had told my brothers and cousins, before they were going rabbit hunting, all that whole dialogue came back, which to me didn't make sense because I didn't understand language. And my uncle was telling my brothers that if you kill a rabbit, you have to cook them thoroughly until he's well done all the way through the center, no pink. Because there's a microbe in rabbits that will kill a human being in one to two days, 24 to 48 hours, and very painfully with intestinal cramping. So I thought, hmm, coyotes are going to help me die quicker? It could last 50, 40, 60 days. So I thought, okay. So I picked up the rabbit, took some bites, and of course came right back up. Ah, you know, all I eat is burned meat. I like my meat well done. So this was an unusual experience. This was all raw. So after about five bites, it came back every time. So I said, okay, I'm going to psych myself out. So I went back to that dinner table, you know, where I was raised in. I had to spend an hour and a half, two hours a night getting down those cooked vegetables. So I thought, you know, if I can do that, I can get this rabbit down. So I'm going to get this rabbit down. It's going to cause me to die.

So I psyched myself into it for about five minutes, and I started eating it, and after about ten bites it started tasting good. So I ate about three and a half pounds. And the coyotes shared the rest. I went back to my campsite to die, and I knew I was dying because I felt good. The only times I had felt good in my life were when I was in near-death experiences. Twice on the operating table, [unintelligible]. So, that was the only time I felt good, because my conscious was leaving my body. And I thought that my conscious was leaving my body because I was feeling light, and very little pain, and getting distracted from it as I was moving away from my body. But I woke the next morning, and I'm still in my sleeping bag in pain. I was able to get out of the sleeping bag again in 45 minutes, instead of 2 hours. And I didn't take that long for baking in the sun. And I waited 2 days, no pain, no cramps, felt better, felt more strength than I had ever had in my life. And then the third day went by, and I said, it's not going to happen. It's a fiction. You know, the thing about the rabbit stuff, it's a fiction. But the Indians, I ate this meat, didn't break out, felt good, strong. Raw meat is what they were telling me, and that's the answer, raw meat. So I, that moment, the sidewinder rattlesnake just happened by me. And I had seen many Indians just going for food. [unintelligible] So, instinctively, not even thinking, I'm hungry. The three days that I've eaten, so I just instinctively went over and put my bare foot on the rattlesnake, picked it up in front of the rattler, and started spinning around, and said, oh, shit, what am I doing? That thing's going to come around and bite me, and I said, shoot. Changing arms, deciding when to do it, can I do it, is it going to eat me? Am I going to eat it, it's going to eat me, you know, so I'm spinning around, so sore. I said, okay, [unintelligible], and the head just came right off like that. Peeled it back and started eating it. There's a lot of bones in it, and it does not taste like chicken. Raw, it tastes like fish. There's a lot of bones. Just like fish, a lot of bones. [unintelligible], shared with me, it came from the farm down below. Not enough food in the desert. I mean, I was trapping, you know, anything, tarantulas, or even the merged chipmunks. There's just not enough food. When you take the skin off, there's nothing left of any of those animals. You know, and you have to eat the bones, too. [unintelligible] bones and peel the meat off of it. My teeth weren't that good still. [unintelligible] So, then I said, I'm not going to get well eating this. So, I got on my bicycle and traveled around to about five farmers around. And [unintelligible] labor on their farms in exchange for food.

So, I'd get raw milk, you know, goats milk and cows milk, depending on what I was milking. And chickens and eggs and beef and lamb and goat meat. You name it, I ate it. In two and a half months, I'd gained 50 pounds, almost 55 pounds. So, I looked like someone from this skinny little thing that came out of Auschwitz. You know, to [unintelligible]. So, I decided I've got to go back to Los Angeles and spread the word. And I got there and said, are you out of your mind?

[audio cut]

A: Experiments with animals that showed when they ate raw meat, they got parasites. Guess how many I found at all the major universities [unintelligible]? Zero. Zero. So, they were postulating this great myth from their imagination. You don't get parasites from eating raw meat. Even if it's infested with parasites. So, I started doing experiments. All the money I was making with acting and commercials and my art, I put back into doing research and experiments. So, I've done many experiments up to that time, that 13-year point, but never directly to experiment with animals and parasites. So, I did. One of the experiments I did was with a lamb, sterile environment, just to get the room prepared was $16,000. And we had this, we slaughtered the lamb in a sterile environment, took the meat onto an opposite section of the room, which was isolated all hermetically. No air could get into that in its pedestal, and blowed a glass frame funnel that went up through a funnel that came onto the other side with a corn dracaena. It produces a lot of oxygen, and then there were three HEPA filters for it to go through. So no bacteria or parasite egg could ever get through, even if there were remote currents that couldn't come up in that environment anyway. And we kept the area on the other side with the meat at the lamb's body temperature, which was about 101.8. And in three days, guess what we found? There were parasites all over. So it made me realize that parasites are a natural part of every animal cell. And when you're dead, they come out of your own tissue to consume that tissue, and then they just go back to earth into dust. And they recycle stuff, just like crows and vultures and all those are your janitors to keep ecology moving, so things can keep growing, keep life alive. So you're all full of parasites. It's just that you keep poisoning yourself so that you don't have them. And I'm going to tell you all of the positive things about parasites and the actual tests that have been done lately and all the bacteria that make them good for you. And why the medical profession doesn't want you to have them, even though they're starting to breed them for medical therapy. So I'm going to get into the next session. This part of the session is finished. As you can see, I'm about to finish my 60th year in two months, and I was supposed to be dead 38 years ago.

And you don't see me crawling around on the floor, and I'm pretty flexible, you know, so at 60 years old, you know, I get younger every day. I feel younger every week, but I know that I get younger every day and feel more alive every day, which is a great benefit, coming from such a sick place that I was. So, in the workshop area, this is the end of the free part. Sorry it took so late, and we waited so long for chairs, and still the chairs never came.

Q: Yeah, they are out there, but too late now.

A: Too late, yeah. Okay. So, anyway, in the workshop area, what I'm going to do is go over the human body, so that you will understand what your body is going through at a particular time. So you don't have to run some doctor who's going to give you a drug, which is not going to get you well, so that you'll know what to do for yourself. You can use, in my book, We Want to Live, there's a section in the back that thousands of raw food remedies for hundreds of diseases. So that you'll understand how these work better, have a familiarity to be able to use it properly, use any kind of remedies properly to make it work for you. So you can get yourself well and independent. You don't need me, you don't need a doctor, you just need your own intelligence, and your own tenacity, and your own grips on your fears. That's the greatest thing you can do. Because they make you paranoid of E. coli, of bacteria, anti-parasitical, anti-bacterial, everything. And those are the poisons that are making you sick. Industrial pollution is 80% of what's killing everybody, killing people with disease. And 80% of that 80%, or 70% of that 80%, or it could even be higher, is medication going into your body, especially if you have [unintelligible]. So, I'm going to get into all that fully, how to use the food with combinations, how to eat a good diet, how to make sure that you can use your mental functions and physical functions by working with your body throughout the day, by eating the proper things at the proper times, and when to fluctuate and alternate between them according to the changes going on in your body. So, I'm going to cover all of that in the workshop area. That'll be about, probably, four and a half to five hours. At the end of that, we'll have a Q&A, which probably lasts about 30 minutes. So, hopefully, I get all of it. I hit every point so there's no questions. Don't ask questions during the workshop. The workshop, you know, usually a workshop, there's interaction. The workshop, the work that you have to do in this workshop, pay attention. Most of the time, I keep it entertaining, and we usually have two breaks of every hour and a half to two hours. You know, 45 minutes, two hours of breaks. Two breaks after this one. If you haven't signed up, see Pearl and sign up for the workshop and stay and enjoy. It gets you to get a grip on your life. And Joe here is a local farmer here in Florida, and he provides all this wonderful food for the diet. The only thing he doesn't have is meat today, but he has lots of fresh dairy and cream also. No cream today.

Q: Sold out.

A: Yeah, sold out. So there's some milk. There's yogurt, butter, cheeses. There's some things and some fruits that he has.

Q: I make smoothies.

A: Oh, he makes smoothies, okay, with eggs and stuff. So you can have any of that during this break. It shouldn't take more than 15 to 20 minutes to finish this break to get advice signed up. And if you want any books, the rest of my books are all sold out. I've got three at the hotel room. Anybody who's coming for private consults and wants one of those three books, just let me know. There's plenty, I think there's probably ten more of the We Want to Live. And remember, that is where all the remedies are. So that's a very important book if you don't have it.

[audio cut]

A: All right. First, I want you to have a good, clear understanding of the body. Now we have three circulatory systems. We have the blood, and everybody knows what it does, but I'm going to go into what it should do. If we were healthy people, the blood would have two jobs to do only. Transport oxygen and to remove carbon dioxide. That is the strict final job of the exclusive job of the bloodstream. However, in a toxic environment, we start detoxing through it. We distribute nutrients through the bloodstream, and that's not what it was designed to do. Then we have the neurological system, and that fluid system is concentrated with high-fat concentrated fluids, and we have the highest amount of fats in the brain and nervous system. The brain is 60% fat minimum, and lots of metallic minerals are needed in the brain because it transports electricity and transports, reflects light. So it takes metallic minerals to run the nervous system. So what does that mean in the toxic environment like ours with all these heavy metals, all these cauterized metals in the body that are free radicals? Most of them go to the brain and nervous system. In the other fluid system, it's less fluid than in these other two, and that's the lymphatic system. And the lymphatic system is connected to the lacteal system in the intestine. The lacteal system is called lacteal because the nutrients are digested properly in the stomach and the intestines. In the bowel, it looks like a milky substance, very milky and creamy looking. And as that gets into the lymphatic system, the lymphatic system breaks it down further and thins it out into a translucent, creamy substance. And so it's not really clear, but it's translucent. That's when all the nutrients are broken down into the smallest molecules. The lymph system then feeds every cell in the body, no matter where it is. It feeds every cell in the body. And it's responsible for removing all of the waste and any other toxicity that enters the body. It has to gather the toxin, it has to neutralize it, it has to break it down some more, neutralize it again, and send it out through one of the passages of the body. Now normally in the body, those waste particles are always nutrients for some other part of the body. There's never a toxic waste of an animal who is healthy. Only in our environment with our industrial poisons do we have lots of toxins. And they have to go out through the skin, the tear ducts, the ear wax, the gums, the tongue, the salivary glands, the mucous membranes throughout the body, sinuses, throat, lungs, intestinal tract, bowels, vaginal cavity, urinary tract.

It will even build, the lymphatic system will even send minerals, toxic minerals, to be built into the hair and nails. You can tell the different texture of the hair by the relationship of the toxicity in the hair. You can have very, very brittle hair that comes from a high amount of mercury and lead and aluminum. You can find most gray hair has high concentrations of aluminum, which discolors the hair, destroys the para-aminobenzoic acid, which is a B vitamin that regulates pigmentation. And that can even happen in the skin, the skin, skin coloring. You can cause yourself to change the skin coloring. For example, Joe, where did he go? Joe Cosmano, you know, before he went on his diet, he was gray. His skin was really gray. He looked like he was made of metal. Now you see him, he's got color through that grayness and lots of red flush color all over his body, and he was skinny as could be. Now he seems strong. He wasn't able to pick up those things by himself. Now he can pick them up by himself. He used to have help. So that's the kind of changes that can go on in coloration with the amount of metal toxicity in your body or other mineral toxicity. It doesn't have to be just the metallic minerals that cause the problem. You can have potassium chloride that could kill you, and you could inject two cc's of pure potassium chloride into your system, and it would kill you. And that's not a heavy metal, but it imbalances the system so much that it arrests pulmonary activity and heart activity. So both the lungs and the heart. So even the smaller minerals can cause a problem, even though they're not metallic-free radicals. So the lymph system is responsible for cleaning, detoxifying the system. Very simple. But with our complex nature, everything's crossing over. You find blood vessels being built into the bone marrow. And the blood vessels don't belong in the bone marrow. That's where the lymphatic system is connected. The lymphatic system is supposed to clean that. But we get so toxic with minerals and metals and the fat, and the fat's like in the brain and in the bone marrow, that the body is building veins in to get more poison out quicker, because we become too toxic. And we'll all get what? Anemia, leukemia, multiple myeloma, if we don't clean those substances out of the bone marrow. And you can see from, you know, if you look at some of the elderly people who don't eat well, and you see those people that are going across the street like this, they don't have a lot of cells alive and they're very toxic.

And you can imagine having maybe 22-25% of their cells alive, carrying a whole bulk of their weight. And those cells aren't healthy. That's a tremendous stress on those few cells that are alive in their body. Most people drop dead after 22% when they reach 22%, because the body can't sustain itself on 22% cellular life. Now let's look at the glandular system. Now, you see the heart? The heart's always pumping. That makes the blood flow. Deliver oxygen everywhere in the body so we can have energy. We're not trees. Trees, their fluid system, their bloodstream, could take a week to get from the roots to the top of the tree. And us, it flows through every few minutes. All of our blood flows through the entire body quickly. And we're able to be mobile. Roots, plants are rooted in the ground. They can't be mobile or functional like we are. Lungs, they take in the oxygen, which delivers it to the cells. And with that oxygen, the body can take nutrients, like fat, mainly fat, and transfer it into energy. If we look down the digestive tract and we start eating, look at the mouth structure. A lot of vegetarians say, we have an herbivore structure, or a frugivore structure. But have you ever compared your teeth with a horse or a cow? They have all molars. They don't have cutting teeth. We have 80% cutting teeth, only a few crushing teeth in the back. So we are meant, we have not four canines for ripping. So we are very much adapted for being meat eaters. Now in the mouth we have one alkalinizing enzyme, only one in our entire digestive tract. And that is ptyalin. Only the horse has it. And what happens is the horse eats a lot of sugar, a lot of carrots, a lot of corn. Their bones start disintegrating. That's why they are very sensitive. That's why when you look a horse in the mouth, you check its teeth, and you see if that animal's been on too high of a sugar diet. It needs to digest its sugars very quickly and rapidly and get them out of the system, and very little of it. The same with a human. Very little fruit. I'll give you more of that later. We'll get into the fruits and biochemistry. So the mouth is very structured for cutting and ripping. Crushing a little bit, like the Eskimos, the Maasai and Samburu. When they eat meat, they don't chew it. They crush it two or three times and swallow. There's no chewing with meat. Instinctively, they know if they chew meat for a long period of time, they're going to get too much ptyalin enzyme in it, they're going to digest too much of the starches and carbohydrates in the meat, and they're going to neutralize their ability to digest the protein and the fats So, when you eat raw meat, don't chew it. Crush it enough to swallow it.

Makes it very easy for you people who are finicky about eating raw meat. The more you chew it, the more fibrous it gets and you can't handle that. Well, when you don't have to worry about it, just swallow it. Who cares how many fibers are in it? Your hydrochloric acid was designed to dissolve that. Not in the mouth, in the stomach and in your small intestine. When food moves down to the stomach, the major nutrient there is what? Hydrochloric acid. And a lot of vegetarians will say, what do you mean? A carnivore, a dog or a cat, a feline, a feline family, they produce 15 times more hydrochloric in the stomach than we do. Yes, that's true. And a dog and a cat will digest their meat in 10 hours, 10 to 14 hours. We have a very long digestive tract. It takes 24 hours for food to move through us. But if you look at the rest of the small intestine, you'll see that we produce as much hydrochloric as any feline or canine does throughout the entire digestive tract. We are just designed to digest it slower than the other carnivores. So we are built very much as a system to digest almost anything, but the majority should be animal products. You say, well, we have a digestive tract like the pigs, the omnivore. You know why a pig eats everything? Because that's all that it's given on a farm. It's given slop. You see a pig in the wild? That pig is burrowing in the ground, eating rodents, insects, and its almost entire diet is meat. Very rarely does it eat high carbs. Sometimes it'll dig up roots and eat roots. If it's very hungry, it's not getting enough rodents and insects. Only when it doesn't have its prized food will it eat those carbs. Pigs are very hungry. They eat all the time and everything, if they don't have what they want. Just like a goat. A goat will eat everything. Absolutely everything. It's mainly an herbivore. A pig is mainly a carnivore, except when it has to be an omnivore. That's the same with us. If we don't have anything else, we can survive on other foods. That doesn't mean we will function and do well. When I get into biochemistry, comparing us with some other animals, you'll understand that better. So, when we get down to the bowel, the last stage of digestion, we have what? E. coli. Concentrations, millions and trillions of bacteria called E. coli. And we're supposed to be afraid of them. E. coli. Wash it. Wash it. All you hear. With what? An antiseptic. A poison. A chemical poison. They want you to put on your body and absorb it into your skin. To protect yourself from something that's part of your own body. Now, how many animals do you know go licking E. coli and fecal matter? Often so, and everybody else [unintelligible]. Do they have a problem? Is that E. coli really a problem?

They've been dealing with it for millions of years. Obviously, it's not a problem. You go in places like Cambodia, Laos. No toilet paper. They go from their hands to cooking things and eating things. Directly. And there's no problem. And they have no cancer. Except when we did all the bombing. And they have all these metals in their water streams and in their soil. So they eat all this contamination that the U.S. government has dumped. You know, we dumped more bombs in Laos and Cambodia than we did in Vietnam. And we weren't even at war with those countries. E. coli is not a problem. In fact, the E. coli is a very favorable thing. Because it is responsible for the final stage of protein digestion. It breaks the molecules of protein down into specific small substances that can feed the brain and nervous system. Take a look at the people who do lots of enemas and colonics. They are [unintelligible]. They're usually easily panicked. They have to constantly flush themselves out. Why? Because they've destroyed their ability to feed the brain and nervous system. Their brain and nervous system are becoming panicked and ill. It's like a thin person who's not feeding their whole body well. What happens is they don't get enough nutrients down to their bowel to digest. Their organs utilize them all. That's why I like people to be fat, not skinny. Fat is much better than skinny. I don't [unintelligible] what kind of fat you have in you, but I will get into that later. [unintelligible] So in the digestive tract, that last stage feeds your brain and nervous system. That small part of the bowel, which is only about a fifth of the whole digestive tract, is responsible for feeding your entire brain and nervous system. What happens to people who have a colostomy. Guess what? They will never feed their brains and nervous systems properly again unless they rotten meat. It means it's aged and old like the Eskimos did, like I talked about the Eskimos did. Why do the Eskimos do that once a year? Because they're getting into a time of everything's frozen that they eat. I mean, can you imagine, you make a hole in the water, you pull out a fish and it's a popsicle by the time it reaches your mouth. Literally, a popsicle. It's frozen by the time it reaches your mouth. When you eat food like that, you have no bacteria in it. It doesn't break down quicker than you can eat it. So what happens, it gets down into the [unintelligible] and out there and doesn't get quite enough for the brain and nervous system. So every year they have this celebration about September where they'll eat, each person will eat about two pounds of this high rotten stinky meat at a time. And that takes them through for another year.

Now I know people that have to eat it every day. They're so unhealthy and unhappy. So after we get out of there, of course we discard the matter. Now it's not supposed to be a waste product. All the other animals, it becomes fertilizer. And an important fertilizer. It helps worms, it helps any kind of bacteria in the earth. And we've been using it as a fertilizer for what? As long as the earth has had life. Fecal matter is a natural process of every creature on earth. And it's all non-toxic and becomes fertilizer. Now that we have so many poisons in our body, our fecal matter is entirely toxic. Extremely toxic. It causes all kinds of irregularities in the soil and in the plants that eat it. Eat from that soil. So you have to look at the consequences of everything that we do all the way around until the life is changing over. Because we're as connected with the earth as we are with other people. In the glandular system, the glandular system dictates our energy level. The thymus and thyroid mainly make sure that the lungs and the heart constantly work. The brain and pituitary and pineal gland mainly direct growth. And after growth is finished, it's for maintenance, for regeneration of cells throughout the body, no matter where it's needed. Getting into the glandular system, we take a look at the liver. Liver makes bile. That's almost an exclusive job. If we were healthy, like all the other animals that aren't fed garbage, aren't fed processed foods, the liver does one thing, it makes bile to digest fat. Now we have a gallbladder that accompanies that liver. And the gallbladder has one function. That's the storage of bile. Now, why in the world do we need a storage of bile that will break down up to 30 pounds of fat in 24 hours? Well, when you were out slaughtering an animal, running around in the rocks, you killed an animal and you ate it all. Or vultures and other animals ate it. So you could eat 10-20 pounds of fat, two to three days. You could eat 44 hours or 48 hours, one to two days. We need the gallbladder for that. Now we eat it all day long. You don't have to worry about gorging. Gallbladder isn't all that important. As long as you're eating your fat throughout the day. If you sat down to, you know, a whole bowl of ice cream, or a quart of ice cream like I do sometimes, then you better have a gallbladder. Otherwise you're going to spread your ice cream out to half a cup every few hours. And you're going to be fine with it. So that gallbladder is very important if you were living primitively and having to eat a lot of fat at one time. Or you're very skinny and you wanted to gain weight fast, you'd almost need a gallbladder to do it.

Then we have the pancreas. The pancreas, we're told in the advertisements, diabetes and all of that, is there to regulate sugar. It's not its job because we're not sugar eaters. But that's one of the main principles, one of the main functions, only because we force our body to eat mainly carbohydrates. [unintelligible] the cereals, pasta, breads, and lots of candy, and fruits. And I was in the wild. I lived out in the wild for three years. And let me tell you, there was no fruit available except in small portions here and there in any of the wild countries unless man's cultivated it. Very little fruit out there, and let me tell you, the fruit's not that delicious. You get some berries that are tart and sour. Even the wild strawberries are very tart and they're very tiny. We've had to breed the strawberries to this big fat thing that has almost no nutrient value and is full of sugar. Berries are probably about the only thing that they haven't been able to grow into huge things. They haven't been able to get the blueberry to get about this big. But normally it's a very small berry. Like when I was in Alaska and eating with the grizzly bears. I was going over a hill one time by myself when I first got there before it got to the Eskimos. The whole field of these wild blueberries. They're only in season for a month and a half. And that's it. It was the largest patch of wild fruit that I'd ever seen anywhere. And I started picking them and then I realized that all these little fur and brown things were all over. And these are all grizzly bears. About 30 grizzly bears. And I'm there eating, you know, blueberries with them. Well, you can see me back out. [unintelligible] for 30 grizzly bears. I was a little paranoid so I got the hell out. And they never bothered me but I wasn't going to stick around and find out. But usually I'll go up to a bear, you know, if it's one. One time I remember I went up to a brown bear, a pretty big brown bear, probably about 600, 700 pounds. And I started going up to him, talking to him, and my girlfriend was freaking out. Very crazy bear. And he went... and went away. Same to you. So I stunk, I guess. Took off. So in Alaska, it was the only place that I saw a lot of berries. And probably it's very important for those bears to be able to put on enough weight. And when they... you'd see them going in, they're skinny. And they would spend a week in that berry patch. And then they'd go out and start eating fish and everything else. And their weight gain is tremendous. Because they're eating all this oily salmon and seal. And the seal blubber, I mean, if you've ever eaten seal, it's incredible. I mean, the meat is black. And it tastes like cooked sirloin. And it's so tender. And the blubber is like this thick. And the oil that'll come out of it is tremendous.

I mean, it generates it. It's more concentrated than anything I've ever seen. When I went to ferment it, I got some at home. You got a seal from your eskimo friend who sent them down for our group. And there were about probably 15 of us that ate it. And of course, I bought the most because everybody else was a bit shy of the meat because it's so rich in the fat. So I got about 15 pounds. So I had to stuff myself for with weeks of this oil, rich seal oil. And out of a half a cup of that, I got three quarters of a cup fermented of this seal oil. I mean, it comes out of it. That's how concentrated it is. When you ferment it, it expands, something like cooking. So... Everybody turn off their cell phones, please. So this rich, rich food, the seal, is very different and unusual. The pancreas is not designed for the fruit. It was designed to exchange enzymes. Take enzymes out of food to realign them, to attach them, to conform them into a new chemistry and send it back to the intestines to realign proteins and fats and some carbohydrates into structures that are proper for your body. Just to give you an idea how your mind may be too isolated and constricted about that, let me give you an idea of the normal thinking of people out there about nutrition. They say, well, cow's milk is not good for a human because a baby, a human baby because the milk isn't from a human. And therefore it's not good. And I say, well, if you take nuts or you take any other kind of food, your body has to realign it. So it has to do a little bit more work with the cow's milk, but that doesn't mean it's not nutritious for a human baby to have cow's milk or goat's milk or whatever it is. It's designed for that, and a lot of people will say, well, wait a minute, you don't see any other animal suckling milk after it's reached adolescence. After it's reached adolescence. And I say, have you ever tried to feed animals milk? I said every animal milk. Every animal milk that they all eat, even vegetarian. Cows will drink their own milk. Horses will drink milk from a cow. Every animal I've ever found drinks milk. You know why they don't drink milk? Because how many of you women are going to let somebody suckle on you all of your life? Not many, the cow does. The goats do. Not half of all the goats don't. But the cows seem to have an OK time with it. But those are the only females on this planet, sometimes some people milk camels, but they don't like it either. I've been around camels. They don't like to be milked. Goats don't like to be milked. Cows will come to you to be milked. Whole different thing.

So cows seem to be a species that are appropriate for us to eat, and they were designed for us to drink that milk because they like to be milked. Who wants all those big udders, right? So when they're full, they like to be milked several times a day. So when you look at the design of a food, the pancreas is designed, is made to realign everything for your body, to make sure everything is digested and reassembled for the structure to make you healthy. Then we have the spleen. And the spleen does what? It holds red blood cells. The gallbladder holds bile, that's its only function. The spleen holds excess blood cells. Now why would the body need to hold excess blood cells? A good pint in that spleen, sometimes a little bit more. What happens if you got a cut and you lost a pint of blood? If you lost a pint of blood back in the caveman days, then you'd be pretty anemic for about three weeks. You wouldn't be able to run as well, you wouldn't be able to hunt, you would not do well. So you had to have a spleen in case there was an injury. Also, to cool and warm the body. Say your blood's too thin, you get cold very easily. The spleen will dump massive amounts of red blood cells into the bloodstream, thicken it so you can stay warm. Kidney works with that too. It starts eliminating fluid, water, H2O, from the bloodstream. And that's the only job of the kidney, normally, is to filter out water so we can change temperature levels. That's the only thing. Takes out H2O, and how does it do it? It filters out the red blood cells. Keeps red blood cells from dumping into the urine. Otherwise, the urine and the blood are identical, except for the amount of red blood cells. And the fact that urine has some ammonia in it. And ammonia is produced when what? When there are too many carbs in the body, the greater the amount of ammonia. The horse, the more grains you feed a horse, the more sweet things you feed a horse, the greater the concentration of ammonia. That ammonia acts as a antiseptic. So, you can use ammonia skin like the Africans do. When a baby is born into an African family and they don't have a lot of food, they're eating more fruits than normal. They'll take that baby and put it under a cow's urine. Coat the whole baby with urine. And the insects don't eat anything. When I lived outdoors, I was a fruit carrier. So, I would wait sometimes if I was in a very warm place, like on the Colorado River in the summer, doing a short fast, which I don't agree with doing any fast anymore.

So, I'd be lying there butt naked all night long, you know, in the heat, and I would wake and have 200 mosquitoes sucking on me at once. They love sweet blood. They love sweet blood. So, you can imagine all the tribes that stay away from sweet food. And in the Maasai tribe, it is the illegal to eat fruit. Ripe fruit. Why? Because it raises the sugar level. They are a very skinny tribe. They are the skinniest, but healthiest, smartest, tallest, and fiercest tribe in the world. And they live on 40% meat, 60% dairy products, and no fruit. It makes them overemotional, because they have no reserved fat. So in their tribe, it's illegal to eat the fruit. So you have to understand how fruit can damage your system. Why the carbohydrate level has to be low. Would you like over-emotionality? Go wild. Would you like insects to bite you and feed on you? Go wild and eat fruit. To give you an example, when I'm in Asia, I'll watch all the people around me getting bitten by all the mosquitos. They don't touch me until I eat fruit. If I eat half a cup of fruit a day with avocado or coconut cream, they won't touch me. Unless I eat a half a cup of watermelon. If I eat a half a cup of watermelon, I'm counting on getting bitten by five mosquitos that night. Just like that. If you eat any amount of fruit, it won't happen. For watermelon, it does rapidly. So if I eat just a small amount of fruit, I don't have to worry about that high sugar content. So there are many reasons that the human does not eat fruit normally. Can you imagine living in a jungle and having insects biting you all day long? I have friends that went down to the Amazon and took the boat trips to the jungle. And these were green people, you know. Conserve jungles, conserve everything. When they were coming out, nuke the jungle. Nuke the jungle. And these were people that never sprayed any kind of chemical on their skin. And they were putting it on every day, many times a day. Poisoning themselves. When they came back, these were different people. So if you were living in the wild, what could you eat and maintain without being consumed by the environment around you? You have to think about all those things. If you want to be a nature person, and you want to survive without bug spray and all those poisons on you, don't eat fruit for a week before you go out there. Keep any kind of carbohydrate out of there, bread and everything. They love it. Normally, mosquitoes eat on herbivores. They eat lots of carbohydrates. They feed on deer. They feed on antelope. They feed on cows. And for them, it doesn't matter. Have you ever seen a wild cow or a wild deer? The amount of ticks and fleas on them... Once, I didn't shoot it. My friend shot it, and I butchered it for him. The amount of fleas that were just on the head, in the hair, were thousands. 

Fleas and ticks on the head were altogether at least 2,000, just on the head. Can you imagine what was on the rest of the body? It was nighttime by the time this had happened, so I had to butcher it under a flashlight, you know, this whole deer. And I put the head inside because I wanted the brain and the eyeballs. So I took the head inside to butcher it. And there were all these creatures that came out of the hair, crazy, all over this counter. It was phenomenal. But this, I watched this animal for about 30 minutes before he was shot. She was shot. And she didn't have a care in the world to out there. Grazing, having a good time, not concerned with anything, crazy. And all these creatures were feeding on it. That is the nature of the herbivore, but not a human being. We have to control that. Our skins are very thick. We don't have coarse hair all over the body and coarse skin. So that pancreas is not responsible for all of the sugar craving and mass sugar digestion and realignment that goes on in the human body. Its job is to realign enzymes to help us digest what we need to convert it off of our energy of building and detoxification. The bladder, of course, is just a place to hold water so you're not peeing all over yourself all the time. So when the kidney is removing fluids, you're not just wetting yourself all day long as the fluids are running. It's a place to hold the water so that you can urinate and discard a lot. 

[phone ringing]

A: That's our host. 20D Mary. Okay, so you've been so busy. So the glands in the body, we've gone over about all of the functions of the system. Lymph glands and lymph nodes, I didn't go into more specifics about them, but I'm going to right now. You've got these little bitty lymph nodes, which can be anything from the size of a round pinhead, needlehead, to the size of a bean. If you're very toxic, they can get larger. Normally a gland is about the size of a bean or two, and they can get the size of a grapefruit, depending upon what's going on in your body. I had a patient who had started off with a lot of congestive and toxic lymph nodes, and just grew and grew and grew and grew and grew and grew and grew. And he kept calm most of the time. He said, you know, the [unintelligible] was growing on my face. I said, go on the diet, and make sure that if eat the diet, it's not going to connect with your jugular vein, it's not going to fuse to your bones. And every three months, I just watched him, showed him whether I could move it, was it connected to his bones, his jugular vein didn't move with it, or his nerves. So, about three weeks ago, I sent him to a surgeon. Got the surgeon, you know, the normal rapport of a surgeon is to say, oh, this is cancer, we have to remove all the lymph glands in the neck, and that's his immediate response. Think about it. Just think about it. Lymph glands clean the body. So, if you have cancer in the body, what part of your body is responsible for cleaning out the [unintelligible]? It's the cancer. The lymph glands. So, you're removing his lymph glands all over his neck. Where is the cancer likely to go? Brain? Lungs? Breast? Absolutely. So, I said, why don't you do something different this time? Here, you're the Chief of Surgery at Kaiser. Think about it. Think about what a great thing it would be for you to experience. Don't take any of those glands out of his neck and some [unintelligible]. Because you know, if they're not [unintelligible], that gland is not cancerous. It's doing its job. It's removing cancer. You're going to find cancer in every gland in the body. If there's cancer anywhere in the body, you're going to find it in the glands. In those lymph glands where it belongs. Yet, they'll go through and take all of a woman's glands. But what happens in six or seven years? It metastasises to the lungs, to the liver, and everywhere else. So what do you have? You get that. So all of this, oh, [unintelligible]. It's called metastatic cancer. So I got this surgeon to go in, agreed upon, not to remove anything but that one lymph gland that's [unintelligible]. And I asked the guy not to have it done for two and a half years. 

He was hoping for, like, everything I talked about, his body would resolve itself. I said, you're not a young man. You know, you're almost 70 years old. Your body has so much toxicity in it, you've only been on the diet two and a half years. Your body doesn't have the strength or energy to dissolve that and get rid of it. Just have it removed surgically and let your body go on with getting healthy everywhere else. So he agreed. So he went in for the surgery, removed it. It wasn't attached to his jugular. It wasn't attached to any of his nerves. It wasn't attached to the bone except the wound end that started adhering to the bone right here. And that was it. And he also agreed it was attached at any point on the bone that he would not sculpt away bone tissue. That he just scraped the surface cancer off of the bone. So he did everything we wanted. I talked to the guy five hours after he was out of surgery and he was the funniest, happiest guy. Lymph glands are very important. Remember if you have a question? Write it down. We're going to ask it at the end because I usually will cover it. So, that was the first person I've ever sent to surgery. He's the first person that I've ever sent to surgery. The only one that ever needed it. Everybody else I know grown them and dissolved. But this man was so weak and feeble. When it came on and he went on the diet he could never gain enough weight. He gained 45 pounds. But if you saw him, if you had seen him when he first went on the diet, he looked like somebody out of Auschwitz. Very skinny. So, it still was not enough to take him through the natural means of cleaning all of that. The natural means of cleaning all of that would have meant that he would dissolve his entire face and throat probably. Probably.Because a cancer cell is not your enemy. A cancer cell is a cell that surrounds itself with dead cells. 50 to 100 dead cells. It lives isolated. When that cancer cell dies, it lets off a serum. It's very much like a virus. And it dissolves anywhere from 50 to 100 dead cells. Dissolves it. All those dead cells you've been unable to discard? Because the cancer is the inability to dissolve dead cells and remove them from your body? The cancer cells allow you to do it. Now, what happens when the solvent is dissolving all that tissue? That's the very acrid solution that's left. And it will dissolve skin, it will melt away everything. Unless you have a tremendous amount of [unintelligible]. And a lot of fat on your body, and I mean a lot of fat. You protect yourself. And that's the solution.

So this man did not have the youth, did not have the energy or anything. I was not going to tell him that until it was all over. Because it came time to remove it when I suggested you were the surgeon to remove it. And he understood and he said, okay, wise idea. Now he is so happy. This side of the face, because he took all of these dead cells from his brain and all around here. This side of the face, after removing this huge tumor. And I mean it was huge. Huge tumor. This side looks 30 years younger than this side of his face. 30 years younger just by having it removed. He was able to collect a lot of [unintelligible] and remove it. And his brain works so much sharper. And he is much more clever and not as negative a person as he used to be. Very critical. Less thoughtful person. So, your lymph glands are very important. Don't you women fall for your lymph glands are going to cause you cancer. They will get rid of your cancer. They will get rid of the dead cells that create, that your body culminates together and binds together to make tumors. Save your lymph glands. Save your breasts. Don't have them lopped off because of some stupid medical concept. Okay. So, you have a pretty good understanding of how the body works. So, you don't have to be afraid of it. Just watch the movement. Now, how does your body clean itself? Now that we're so toxic from all this pollution, how does the body clean itself? It does a myriad of things, mostly in the liver. The liver has become a filter for a lot of toxins in the body. The liver's job is just to make bile. But the liver converts itself into a placenta. The placenta of a baby is its liver, and it's a filtering device. So the liver becomes the placenta for the whole human body, and it was not designed for that. Only to make the bile to digest fat. Your lymph system overworks. Your lungs become a place of discharge. Your throat becomes a place of discharge. Your sinuses. Why? Because the body can dump it into the mucous membrane and discharge all the poison into the mucous. Vomit. Diarrhea. All ways to discharge poison. To give you an idea of the concentration of what's causing disease, I'll tell you about one woman who came to me with breast cancer at a very early stage. She was only about 37, 38 years old. I think 37. Very thin. She gained 25 pounds on the diet. I wanted her to gain 35. She only gained 25. Stayed there. She wouldn't go higher. She was full-bodied. Had that extra 25 pounds. And I knew that there was something very toxic in her body. [unintelligible] was on the diet, 95%. Unless she was 100%, [unintelligible]. So, after two years, the body started dissolving into the skin blisters. [unintelligible]

She did not have enough fat on her body to handle it. So she started dumping it into the skin and dumping it into the stomach. She started vomiting three to six times a day. It was violent. It hurt to do that. Two months went by, still vomiting every day. Weeks, bedridden. Bedridden, [unintelligible]. And she had to eat. I said, after you vomit, you can only wait 10, 20 minutes. And you have to force yourself to eat again because you will waste away. I have 9 out of 10 cancer patients, and that's very few that I've lost. Only about 5% of the patients who come in with cancer have died. And 9 out of 10 of those, ultimately they're people who could not make it through that dissolution of the tumor. So, I wanted to see what was causing this girl. This girl was a little stronger, was happy, more positive. She always had a positive attitude, [unintelligible] cancer. All these, you know, La La Land people who have that concept. It bothers me because the first person I ever saw die of cancer was the most positive, spiritual, kind woman and aunt that I had when she died of miserable cancer. And I don't know anybody who's more kind than this woman. She died of a miserable cancer. So, this woman was very positive, too, and strong and happy. So, and after two months of doing all this vomiting and going into diarrhea now, I knew that it had to be something really toxic. So, I took four ounces of her vomit, I sent it off to a laboratory in Missouri that I like. They have some of the best equipment for measuring toxicity in the body. Thirty-two hundred dollars for one sample. That's how much it costs. And I sent it to a laboratory, and the general manager of the laboratory called me and said, you know, [unintelligible]. I said, what do you mean? He said, she has 3,000 times the lethal dose, got that, 3,000 times the amount that could kill someone, and that four ounces of vomit, of thallium. Thallium is a heavy metal, and it's almost as soft as lead, and almost as toxic as mercury. 3,000 times the lethal dose of thallium. So, her husband was one of the sweetest men I knew, and he was right there by her side, but she was a jewelry maker. She burned specialized, you know, everything was custom. She was right over that Bunsen burner, burning that metal, never wearing a glove, never wearing a mask. 3,000 times the lethal dose, in one vomit. Can you imagine how much she vomited? Two and a half months before she died. 3,000 times the amount that would kill a human being, in one vomit. And she was vomiting three to six times a day for two and a half months. That is what causes cancer.

[unintelligible] poison to your body. It's not the virus or bacteria. That's the pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry are getting you to follow their garbage recommendations. And not to be afraid of what you should be afraid of. All the chemicals in your environment. All the chemicals that they are giving you. Certainly, they can stop symptoms, but so did they with arsenic in the past. Bloodletting. All kinds of ways to stop the body from detoxifying, so you lose the symptoms, because the body is going to deal with the present symptoms of poisoning, which we just introduced. And they used to give people [unintelligible]. They used to give people formaldehyde as a medication. They give people vaccines. So what does it do, it poisons the system so much, the body stops. Any other kind of remedies that's going on in the system, any other kind of detoxification, so you lose your symptoms. So that part of the body is no longer cared for. Symptoms stop. You think you're well, and what happens a few years later, it gets worse. Varicose veins or spider veins turn into varicose veins. Varicose veins turn into thrombosis. And you're crippled. Hypoglycemia turns into diabetes. Diabetes turns into amputations. All because of the medical protection. All because of the chemicals. All because of this insulin that is not a true insulin. It does not break the sugar molecule down into the proper form. So that sugar, the glycogen, that gets stored in the legs and the limbs is highly acrid. It starts dissolving the surrounding live cells, and then the body turns to gangrene. The molds are there to break down that dissolved, dead, toxic tissue. It isn't the gangrene that's killing you, the gangrene that's trying to help you. What has poisoned you is that toxic glycogen from the toxic insulin. You never hear of a person who's been diagnosed with diabetes and refuses the insulin ever having an amputation. It doesn't happen. The worst thing that can happen to a diabetic when he doesn't take insulin, passes out, goes into a little seizure for maybe two minutes at the max, usually 30 seconds. That's the end of it. That is the worst symptom they will ever have in their entire life. Once you take the insulin, you're in danger. Deathly, deformed danger of losing your limbs. Where are you going and saying, hey, I don't have to do that. I don't have to go there. Do you know that the United States in health is 54th, 54th, 54th in health. Rated below third world countries where medical reality doesn't exist. Pharmaceutical industries are taking it there. I mean, I've gone into the jungles and the suburbs of Thailand and Cambodia. And they'll live in grass huts wearing their old garments. 

And they'll be out, you know, kicking a ball that they've made. And the chickens running around and playing too. And here they've got a TV in their house. They make 50 cents a day per household. How are they affording to run a dollar of electricity a day and to afford to buy a $300 television? General Electric is funding it. That's one of the companies that's funding it. Pharmaceutical industries are funding it. Why? They advertise drugs and food products. You talk about commercials in this country? I think that commercial is every five minutes and they run five, six in a row. And most of them are drugs, medication. There's no prescription for it in those countries. There's no law regulating it. So instead of going to food, they're going to a drug store and getting this stuff and then their symptoms don't go away. It's terrible. So you're being brainwashed. You are being brainwashed. Don't buy it anymore. Don't buy it anymore. You can take care of your health, and it's through food. But you have to protect your food source because what is happening? FDA is allowing more and more chemicals on your food. They're allowing them to falsely advertise foods as healthy, and they have nothing to do with health. They can be full of chemicals and allow it to call it organic. Every year we fight them. First, it was 5% toxicity they could have. So you go out and spray your crop once a year with a phenomenal poison. As long as it only shows up 5% in your food, it's okay. They can call it organic. They tried to make it to 15% 10 years ago. Again, 5 years ago, and again last year. The FDA keeps pushing for the chemical industry to damage and poison you with food so they can grow more food. So it will preserve longer. So the economy can grow. You get sick, doctors make more money, companies make more money, but you live in sickness. It's not a good move. So you have to protect farmers like Joseph. All the Amish farmers, you buy from them. Protect them, support them. And make sure that none of your farmers get raided by the health departments and the FDA. I've won seven battles this year. They came after my farmers in Michigan, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and California. Health departments shutting them down. And what I have is a cooperative from the Right To Choose Healthy Food. And that cooperative means that we make a lease with the farmer. So the farmer doesn't own the herd, doesn't own any of that produce. The club members own it. We pay them to take care of our animals and to get the food and give it to us. So it's not commercial. So when they came up to my farmer, I said, cease and desist. I filed a legal paper that said, we are not commercial.

Your only jurisdiction is commercial. This is not commercial. This is private. Get the hell out. So they had to get out. One judge in Pennsylvania, I wrote a 62-page document for Amos Miller Farms, Miller Organics, and a 19-page for his father's farm, Jacob Miller's farm, a [unintelligible] organic farm. And in those documents, I proved to the judge that we were not commercial, that we were all private. So guess what? The state of Pennsylvania had to back off. So they called in the FDA. Every one of those states called in the FDA. So the FDA got their nose in it, and I said the same thing. Look at the first paragraph of your law. You are in commerce only. This isn't commerce. Get out. Stop it. Every state since this last year, since 2006, were winning. So you've got to help protect your farmer. If Florida Health Department comes in, you're going to have to go to a herd lease program, a farm lease program. So you, the members, own everything on the farm as far as your leasing, you own. It's a lease ownership held up at any kind of court. You can lease a person. You can lease anything. So they can't combat that. Sally Fallon, her chair program has been annihilated in the courts because there's no precedent. The lease program is solid. They can't beat it because if they negate that one, they have to negate all of the other lease programs that are all throughout every industry area. So, know how to protect yourself. Know how to protect your food because you're going to get less and less and less natural food. Why? Look what's happened with this E. coli garbage noise. Bring E. coli, E. coli for all these diseases, the jack-in-the-box thing back in what, 96. 125 people affected. Do you know the real reason for that? They were experimenting with a new pesticide. I mean a new dewormer. They were putting it on the spinal cord. It made that particular herd very sick. So when those people ate, a lot of those people who ate that meat had an allergic reaction to the byproduct chemicals from that particular process. So guess what? And the government allows them to experiment. And the government will hide the experiment, just like it does for the military. Because they know if there's a lawsuit, the industry will be wiped out. So they hold their hand through it. And they blame it on E. coli. We know E. coli isn't a problem. Animals lick everybody's butts every day. Dolphins, cats, and animals who eat fecal matter every day. Human tribes eat fecal matter. Think about that. The herbivore takes 48 hours to digest its food.

It has 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fat and the protein from it. We digest one-third. And that one-third is what? Vitamins, enzymes, and minerals. That's about all we get from vegetation. And the herbivore has two to four stomachs also to help it do that. It takes 48 hours to pass through their stomach and their intestinal tract. So they have plenty of time to digest how much of it. 65 to 75 percent. You know, you look at a cow patty and you see all this fiber in it. [unintelligible] They can't. Well, what it doesn't do, it leaves partially digested matter with plenty of fat and protein in it for other insects and animals to eat. First time I saw a human eating fecal matter as a nutrient as their protein source was on National Geographic in 1972. And they did have an article, I mean a news clip, and they showed this beautiful woman, this very petite, small woman, black hair, blue eyes, from Georgia, Russia. Or Georgia, since [unintelligible]. So it was Georgia. Not in the state of Georgia, but the country of Georgia, near Ukraine. And they pull back on this woman and she's smiling, you can't see what she's eating, smiling, smiling, very nice disposition, buffalo tail, swishing behind her. You pull out and it's a huge patty. She's eating from, she's eating buffalo shit. What's she doing? Very happy. You have to understand that lots of, lots of, lots of people will do that when they don't have enough insects or other meat to eat. The cow has predigested it, the buffalo, whatever it is, the herbivore has predigested it. And they will eat it fresh and it continues the digestion and you check their fecal matter, it's almost entirely digested and there's no toxicity. And their brains and nervous systems are better than any other. Those people in Georgia have been documented to live 168 years. National Geographic did it in a 1971 February article. Those people were living 138 to 168 years old, eating shit. So they say eat shit and die. I say, you know, you got that wrong, you eat shit and live. That's going to be a comedy. [unintelligible] So you have to understand the warped ideology that's going on in our society. Fecal matter is not a dangerous thing. It isn't a delicious meal, because it stinks. It tastes like overcooked vegetables, but it stinks. Who wants to eat it as a daily thing? But in a crunch, in a position where you don't have any other food, any other high-protein source, or fat source, that's a heck of a good way to get it, because it still creates an incredible brain and nervous system. Can you imagine having such a nice, relaxed brain and nervous system that you could live with a person married for 138 years? Can you imagine being that relaxed that you could stand the same person for 138 years? They were interviewing couples that were together.

One was 138 years, another couple 126 years together, another couple 107 years together. They eat shit. [unintelligible] And they're happy and smart. And they'd live long lives. Why? Because they're working in balance with nature, not a chemical. So you have to wash away all of the garbage and paranoia that you've been told all these years and completely do a backflip, a reversal of everything that you've been taught. Don't wash your hands unless you handle something chemical. Rinse it off. Any time you've had a chemical on you, that's what you want to get rid of, not something that's a bodily function. And you go around and advertise as AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS, AIDS. AIDS was man-made. It was made in 1961 in UCLA. They made it to create cancer in laboratory animals to study cancer. A Dr. Strecker discovered this when he was hired by a company that bought another company in San Francisco that hired 60% homosexuals. And this was in 1979. He was hired to evaluate the relationship of illness with AIDS. So he did all this research and, you know, normal when you go into a laboratory, you fractionate a virus, put a certain enzyme factor on it, and it will separate into five portions. It's called fractionation. This virus did not fractionate. It kept splitting into two. And after a thousand, he said, hey, this is man-made. Only way to get a virus to separate like that, to divide, to get spliced. So he took the two opposite sides and bound the right ones together. And found that they had the leukemic virus of a bovine and the lymphonomic virus of a sheep. Not found in human beings. Spliced them together, put it in a serum of animal tissue to keep breeding that virus. And it will breed the virus. You don't breed a virus. The cells make virus. Virus is not alive. There's no nucleus. There's no respiratory system. So it's a solvent. But cells will constantly manufacture it to dissolve that toxicity in their body. And they make sure that toxicity exists in the serum so that the animal cells that they have in the serum will continue to make it as its own defense system. And I'll get into that shortly. So, here you have this man-made virus. A, how did it get into your population? Well, the scientist who checked that information and discovered and found the tests were done and it was made at UCLA in 1961 concluded in 62. He followed the trail and went to the War Department for biological warfare use and experimentation. So, he got a senator, he called his brother, who was a high-powered attorney, politically connected, and said, this is what happened, follow the trail and see where it leads. So, he followed it to the War Department, started asking for a bit of information, wanted the information about it, wouldn't let him in. 

They're rejecting him. National Security, can't have that information. So, he got a senator from Wisconsin, I think it was in Minnesota, one of these two states, and that senator started demanding the information that got somewhere. And then they were dead three months after they wrote the book, Bio-Attack Alert. I have it in the bibliography of We Want To Live. You can still get it. The military decided that homosexuals were undesirable and it was legal in America to experiment on them. So, they found that, how could they inject this AIDS into the homosexual community and find out what would happen? They found that in Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, San Francisco, and... New York, Los Angeles, Houston, San Francisco, Miami... New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, how is it, four major cities. They put it in the Hepatitis B vaccine because homosexuals, 90% of the homo... 90% of people who are getting Hepatitis or homosexuals because of these drugs, damaging the liver, enter the liver. And Hepatitis, in many strains of Hepatitis, the Hepatitis is the detoxification of the liver, the viral detoxification of the liver. So they found that homosexuals were getting it, and the regular thing to do was, well, you get the Hepatitis vaccine if they got Hepatitis. They were putting the Hepatitis vaccine [unintelligible]. Ten percent of the people who weren't homosexuals, they were heterosexuals. That's why ten percent of them, ten percent of the heterosexual community that received that Hepatitis vaccine got it. Now, it is transferable through blood. It's not transferable through semen or saliva or anything else. If you go online, you'll find a group of heterosexual and homosexual couples that have been together up to 28 years, unprotected sex, and not one of them has ever gotten it. Also, there was a movie out recently about this couple, and I think it was Thailand. Both of them had AIDS. Their baby didn't have AIDS. Even [unintelligible], it didn't have AIDS. It has to be injected into the body. It has to be injected by blood or in the serum. How did all those Africans get it? Smallpox vaccine. Why would the United States and UK give them $8 billion worth of free vaccine? Free smallpox vaccine. Another way of warfare to take over their resources. So what happened? Those cities were devastated. Those countries were devastated. So UK and American governments came up and said, oh, we'll give you all this medical support. But you will have to pay us for it. Those countries were never able to pay. 27 countries are now run by the World Bank under the auspices of UK and American governments. 

Devastated those African tribes and communities, by giving them that smallpox vaccine and giving them aids. If you look at the work of Horowitz, Leonard Horowitz, he's a PhD, he followed the track. Ebola is man-made. It was also given to the Africans in vaccines. This is all new kinds of warfare, for what. To satisfy greed. I mean, God, these people have so much. They have airplanes, they have houses and homes and mansions all over the world. How much do they need? How rich do they have to be? 

Q: Well, population control.

A: It's insane. It is absolutely insane. We have to look at that and say, can my heart go there? Could I do that? For a gain like that? These people have no conscience. Bush and these people have no conscience whatsoever. They'll go out and kill and murder and plunder their land for, what, uranium. The radioactive uranium will have a 500,000 year life. That land in Iraq and Iran and Afghanistan is poisoned for 500,000 years. Laos, Cambodia, parts of there 500,000 years. How can these people get into that state? I don't know the answer. You don't know the answer, but it exists. That is the play. Well, let's talk about virus and bacteria and parasites. What is the worst known parasite that everybody's been afraid of all these years?

Q: Trichinosis.

A: Trichinosis. Since I was a baby, I remember the word trichinosis with such fear. I didn't know what the hell they were talking about. I never saw a parasite until I was, what, 30 years old? I never saw a parasite until I was 30. I didn't know what trichinosis was. I mean, I began studying at that point, and that's why I knew, and I looked for it. Trichinosis, you have to cook pork thoroughly, or else you get trichinosis. Do you know what worm, parasite, lived in the human for millions of years? Trichinosis. What lives in the pigs intestines naturally? Trichinosis. About 18 years ago, Dr. Joel Weinstock at Iowa University, who's a gastroenterologist, he handles the digestive tract, and that's his specialty. He was raised as a farmer, and became a doctor. He saw that the pigs at the university were sick, very sickly. And he'd see some pigs wallowing around in the mud and the slop, and all of that, and being vibrantly healthy. And these pigs, kept immaculately, kept in immaculate cages [unintelligible]. So he did an experiment and gave them trichinosis, and it all livened up, and they all got healthy. They had no trichinosis. The pigs on the farm have all that trichinosis. So he went to the FDA after a few years of experimenting with this, and he said, I'd like to experiment on patients, human patients. And they said, okay, the criteria is, if you want to do that, you can only do it with no more than ten people. They have to have suffered beyond medical therapy for at least ten years. That means you have to suffer for ten years before any doctor can ever suggest an alternative for you. Ten years, you are committed to suffering. And that is it with cancer, any of it. So he got people who, he got six people who had suffered from at least ten years up to 32 years with inflammatory bowel syndrome, IBS. These people suffered so badly that if they drank water, they got intestinal cramps, vomited, or had diarrhea. No matter what they ate, they suffered. Of course, they had to eat. So they were always in pain, always in suffering. He gave them the trichinosis. You know how he did it? I've eaten trichinosis worms. Every, I've eaten every kind of worm to try to produce it. They always say it's because the hydrochloric acid dissolves the worms. I don't have hydrochloric acid here. Why didn't I get it? Well, I'll tell you that in a minute. But, these people were given the trichinosis. In five days, five out of the six were completely asymptomatic. Why? Because the trichinosis goes in there and pre-digests the food just like bacteria does in your body. Parasites can eat a hundred times their weight in a 24-hour period. They're like eating machines. They pre-digest it for you. And then you get all this nutrient.

So again, you're eating parasite shit and getting well and happy. Look at it. That is what life is about. It's a cooperation. It's a symbiotic relationship. What happened five, six months later, these people are back knocking on Joel Weinstock's door saying, More, more, more, my symptoms are coming back. You can go online now and buy that trichinosis in a vial. So Weinstock, Joel Weinstock, University, whipworm, or trichinosis, and, well, that's all you have to do. You put that in there, you're going to come up with all, everybody who's gone behind it, [unintelligible]. There's a team of eight full professors and doctors who experimented with his work for ten years after he did it. They now will sell trichinosis to you in a little vial. And you know how he got it? [unintelligible] body, beyond the digestive tract, beyond the stomach, he filtered out the eggs from the worms and put it in Gatorade. What is Gatorade? Highly alkalinizing fluid. So it neutralizes the hydrochloric acid and any other digestive bacteria that tries to eat it. And then it gets to live, and it isn't digested as food. The worms would naturally be meat for the intestinal tract. But if they start breeding, you know, the eggs, if they start breeding, then it can gain its dominance in there, not dominance, [unintelligible] work within the environment, you'll start eating its food. So let's take that and look at other parasites that are in the body. Anybody see the gladiator? Russel Crowe is, you know, the family's slaughtered. He gets there too late. When they attack him, they slaughter him, cut him open. He wakes in a cart, prison cage, and he's got all these maggots in his sore. And this African, you know, black African. The big guy says, come on, don't rush them away. The maggots eat up the dead tissue, the decaying tissue. You can heal properly. First movie that's put out any kind of sanity at all. It's true. There are doctors in Africa that use maggots to clean out tissue. One moment, her whole arm was gangrene. She had somehow severed the arm. Didn't handle it properly. Didn't slap mud on it or whatever it took. And she just kept washing it. And it kept decaying and rotting. She slapped mud on it, it would stop. She slapped meat on it, it would stop. It would heal itself. Honey, the same thing. But it went gangrene. So this MD, who grew up in a tribe, laid fresh maggots under a bandage and wrapped it. Five days later, took it off from the maggots and was ready to become flies. [unintelligible] The entire arm was completely smooth. No tissue. No sign of any kind of damage, except for the flesh and white teeth tissue. [unintelligible] 

Pretty incredible. Maggots. Did you see maggots? Oh my God. Dirty, dirty, dirty. No, they're not dirty. There are tribes that eat maggots. There are tribes in Africa, no it's Asia, that will hunt. They'll strip the meat in thin layers. They lay it out. The flies come and lay their maggots. Their eggs, the maggots grow. And at the fifth day before they become flies, they eat the maggots. They don't eat the meat. They will only eat the maggots. [unintelligible] No disease in that tribe. Incredibly healthy. Phenomenal. You have to take a look. [unintelligible]  But I'm just giving you the bounds of reality so that you won't be paranoid of raw meat, raw fish, raw pork, raw chicken. You don't have to be afraid of these things. The dirtier it is primitively, the better I like it. I mean, I go to Cambodia, you know, and, you know, there's meat [unintelligible] maggots and flies everywhere. You know, they have their fans where they're fanning it. You know, there's children sitting there with a fan, fanning it. And they see these white people, you know, going around that only eat at restaurants, you know, and I'll go right there and [unintelligible] all the flies. You know, that's a true story. And then I, you know, we go over there and, you know, I'm used to white people saying this. Give me that piece with the fat on it. You know, I don't speak Cambodian. [unintelligible] So they'd rip the fat off and they'd give me the, you know, the leg or whatever it is, they'd rip the fat off or the, you know, the throat area where most of the fat is, the tail area where most of the fat is, and they'd take it. So I said, no, no, no, that's what I want. So I put it right in my mouth. I put the fat right in my mouth immediately. My favorite fat is the chicken fat. The 14-year-old girl that's been brainwashed by modern TV jumped back. I mean, her parents laughed, and they thought it was great that I was doing this. They thought it was phenomenal that this white boy here was doing that. And not being afraid of all that stuff, their 14-year-old daughter, leaped, would not get within 6, 7 feet of me because I was going to contaminate her. She was sitting there, but because I ate it, she was sitting there around it. She wasn't afraid of it, but as soon as I ate it, she was afraid of me. Hello? This is what that kind of brainwashing with news clips does. It makes people afraid of monsters that don't exist. It was so sad to see that. And when I was going [unintelligible]. And I was visiting, and Vietnam is the worst, the Cambodian, Laos, and Thailand. Visiting the hospital for young women who were giving birth, and you would see the rate of stretch marks. And of course, I had to see their parents as well, take a look at their abdomens.

They maybe had four or six children, sometimes seven children. Barely any kind of distortion of the stomach tissue. These children having children, stretch marks that were plastic. Plastic. Because we're sending all this bad food that we don't even sell in this country anymore, and feeding it to them, and it's plastic. Hydrogenated vegetables, hydrogenated everything. Garbage packaged food, the worst you could get. They're feeding it to these people in third world countries, to keep them enslaved. Working slave class [unintelligible] with that kind of a diet, it's really sad and sick.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's okay. I'm giving you something to go eat here.

[audio cut]

A: All those good things, germs and viruses and parasites. So, we're going to continue. Remember I said bacteria can eat, I mean, parasites can eat 100 times the weight in 24 hours. And then what they discard, we can digest or anything else we eat, we can digest it and make good use of it. There are all types of parasites. There are parasites that help us digest our food, that feed or digest forests, and there's those that eat toxic tissue, like pinworms, that live in the intestines of birds. We have different parasites that will live in the human body, and dogs and cats, heartworms. Now that only happens when a dog will only get heartworms, and a lot of them get them because they get injections for rabies, which has a higher amount of mercury, goes into the heart muscle, damages the heart muscle. The worms are there to eat up the dead tissue in the heart muscle. If you stop that, they'll always have a weak heart. That's a dog that will always be very gentle, not thrive and flourish, and will die at a very young age. Because that toxicity will remain, and those dead, toxic cells will remain in the heart. So we have to look at these parasites as our friends. If you've been diagnosed with parasites, [unintelligible]. Because they can get rid of your dead tissue five times faster than any other way. How I know that is, I took a lot of animals who had parasites, and those animals that didn't have parasites, and we did different controlled experiments with them. Some we took that had the parasites already. We always pick dogs between the ages [unintelligible] 16 years old, because those with the most feeble will get the quickest results from either going toward death or toward life. So, the animals who already had parasites and couldn't have [unintelligible], and already got a lot of animals with parasites, fed them the homeopathic dewormers, pharmaceutical grade dewormers in the group, and no dewormers. And nothing other unusual about the diet, they still ate their cooked food. The animals who, we let their parasites work on them, they were a lot longer getting well, but they got healthier than the ones who we destroyed the parasites in, whether it was pharmaceutical or otherwise. And they had shorter lives. Then we got a bunch of animals, and then we fed raw food, and no dewormers, and the other group cooked food and dewormers.

The animals who ate the raw meat got healthy ten times faster, when at the end of their lives they lived almost two times more than the other animals, where we killed the worms in, and when we did autopsies on them, the animals who destroyed the worms in had grey and black, unhealthy looking glands and organs in their body. The animals who let the parasites run their course and fed them raw food, their glands were radiant. Like, have you ever seen a liver out of a calf? You know, the red is truly a beautiful, you know, deep red, black red, but it's vibrant, not just dull, you know, metallic black, that indicates degeneration of the gut, degeneration, dissolution of tissue, and rupturing and decay of red cells. So, parasites will get you [unintelligible], healthier, faster than any other creature. Now I mentioned that I ate thousands, millions of them, and I was never able to get a parasite, because every time I had my feces checked, it always had the AZT in it. AZT was what they gave me as chemotherapy, and it was outlawed the next year for cancer therapy, because it was too toxic. They put it in the vaults. They had, I think it was something like $11 billion worth of AZT in the vaults, in the pharmaceutical vaults, and they needed to get rid of it, so what did they bring out of the vaults when AIDS came around. No testing or anything. Oh, this is good for AIDS. So what have they been using? They've been treating people with AZT. And it's toxic and it's killing people. So, again, they don't care about the people. It's about the money. All about the money. So, bacteria eat 50 times this weight in 24 hours. Half as good as a parasite, but still bacteria can eat dead tissue. Take a lot more of them, a larger environment of them, but it still works. Now, when a parasite has an excrement, it only is about one to five percent of the weight. So it's like you eating 100 pounds of food a day and only having a one-pound fecal matter the next day. Pretty good, only five pounds fecal matters after eating 100 pounds. I mean, yeah, it'd be pretty tremendous if you utilized all of it. So, can you imagine the waste products that they are taking with them? Building into the body? Toxicity? They were not able to thrive in me when they ate my tissue because it was so full of AZT and radiation. You know, when they give you radiation therapy, they put a contrast on you so that the radiation works even stronger. So, they had injected me with barium and iodine and then there's radiation therapy to kill more things. So, I was a chemical toxic waste dump where no bacteria or parasites could thrive.

So, I had to do it the slow way, the viral way. Viral, like I said, virus are not alive. There's no nucleus and there's no respiratory system. If you put virus in a petri dish that is sperm-wise, it will not multiply. The only time you could find an increase in the number of virus is when they're [unintelligible] cells put in the environment. Now, that serum that they have is a toxic environment. And that serum, they purposely make that serum cause cells to generate more virus. Why? Because virus are the normal environment for live cells. Live cells that can't get bacteria or parasites or those microscopic kind, the sub-cellular type. They are too toxic, their bodies use viruses. Those cells in their bodies use viruses, like we have to when we're too toxic. And parasites and bacteria, I mean parasites, and, yes, parasites and bacteria and molds would die if they eat our tissue. Viruses are solvents, they are soaps. There are 300,000 varieties of viruses, and they're all very specific. Let's say I want to clean out just the outer membrane of my artery. There are about 25 viruses, 26 viruses, just for that tissue. Pulling apart different parts of that structure, because if they pull apart all of it all at once, you have no artery. It'll disintegrate, you'll bleed through that. So that's why there are 300,000 varieties of viruses, and each of them are specific to a certain part of the body. They will detoxify that tissue so that you can rebuild that tissue. And those viruses never live more than 24 hours. 72 hours after, 3 days after, that virus has changed. It is completely a different virus 3 days later. That's why I said that about the virus, the flu vaccine. It's the biggest scam in the world. That virus was gone 2 years before that. [unintelligible]... it's a big scam. So, don't be afraid of viruses. However, viruses are more problematic when your body uses viruses. Why? Because it's like any solvent. You use the solvent, you dilute it with water to make it work. Say you're pulling up the grease off of your garage floor because your car has deposits of grease under it. So, it's all sticky and greasy and dry and it has other oil deposits from the car. And it's sitting on the garage floor, eating into the garage floor. So, you put a solvent on it to break it up and thin it out. Then you have a big bucket there. So, now what do you have? You have maybe two gallons of water that's contaminated.  Same thing happens in the body. When your body uses a virus, it dilutes it and spreads it throughout the body. That's why spinal meningitis that is viral is dangerous compared to bacterial meningitis. If you have spinal or cerebral meningitis that is viral, there is mass swelling. It's bacterial. The bacteria are eating those things and reducing the waste. So there's a lot less likelihood of anybody having permanent nerve damage and seizures.

However, when you have all this mass swelling with virus, massive seizures, paralysis, all kinds of things can happen. Brain damage, because of that excess swelling, can cause ruptures and tears. And the nerve tissues, the neurons, the ganglia, the axons, any of those places in the brain can split and explode. So viruses are not the ideal way to clean and cleanse, but they are still a cleanse. They are a detoxification of toxic tissue. But remember, preferably, it's your worst nightmare, parasites are the best. Second, bacteria. Third, molds. Gangrene, yeast infections, which women hate, men hate it in the rectum because they itch all the time. But you have to understand that these molds are third to the other two, which are parasitical and bacterial. And they do break down tissue. Now you talk about sheaths. Sheaths are made from molding. They pre-digest. It's a different way. When you have bacteria pre-digesting, acidophilus is a bacteria. It pre-digests the milk. But the acidophilus mainly pre-digests the sugar, which we don't need many of anyway. We should be encouraging the Bulgaricus and Calcoaceticus, which digest the fat and proteins. So that's what we should predominantly use. But people like sweet food. We are so conditioned to like sweet food, so we use more acidophilus. Not necessary and inappropriate. Our milks and foods, if they're pre-digested, should be more tart and bitter rather than sweet. And most people don't like that, because we're conditioned to like the wrong thing. Hundreds of years ago, it wasn't that way. When I was in France, I lived off and on in France from 93 to 96. And mostly in Paris where my girlfriend lived at the time. And I would go there three months out of the year, a month at a time. And when I went out to the farmer's markets, even in Paris, sour cream that was sweet or cream, fresh cream, was always sour and bitter. And if you wanted sweet, they looked at you like you were a madman. So none of the milk, anything, tasted good there, because it was made to be tart and bitter. It was healthier, and there's nobody healthier than the French. Who else can drink that much and get away with it? All the fat that they eat, you know, they eat all that cream and butter, all that rich food, because they eat the alcohol, and guess what? The alcohol attacks the fat, and not their liver. So that's why they get away with drinking wine every night or all day. They eat all that fat, and that's very protective. Back to the molds. Cheese is made with molds. All cheese is moldy dairy. So there are different ways to break down dairy, and each one of them provides a different use.

Milk is probably the most sacred thing that there is, because each form changes its quality. Let's finish with the parasites and the bacteria molds. And those yeast infections you get? They're so itchy, and they have such a high odor, because you eat too much carbohydrates. They thrive on it, Candida. All of them thrive on toxic tissue full of carbohydrates. They thrive on it. And you discharge all that mucus. Now, there's a lot of women that go around, you know, thinking, you know, they have this penile envy, is what I'm told, in psychology, and stuff like that. Because they like to have the strength of not all that discharge, mucus discharge, and problems. However, healthy women don't have those kind of experiences. They don't have the cramping with it. It isn't highly odorous. It isn't very much, like the tribes in Africa that eat all raw foods. Their menstrual cycle is maybe one and a half, two days, and probably isn't more than a half a cup, altogether, over the entire time. Plus, when they have a baby, it's two contractions. Two contractions. The women who are on this diet for five to seven years, who have babies, two contractions. When I was so sick, I couldn't do much of anything, so I decided to take a job as a film editor. So I edited a motion picture, next to this other man who had made a documentary called The Beginning. He won the Academy Award for it, I think it was 1972. It was called, his name was John Goodell, and related to Jane Goodall. They just pronounced him differently. And he followed the apes long before she did, and he showed me some of the clips. And The Beginning was about, he followed all the animals and showed them giving birth. So, with him, pregnancy and all of that. The different species. And he lived with a gorilla for 30 days. And you see this gorilla when she goes into labor. She's out in front of the cage like this. Goes off to the corner.

A: ...the end of a very long detoxification could have been taking place for two years. Mostly it's a year and a half. So you have some tissue. And if it's flu, it's mainly viral. It used to be this way. Now they've changed it. I was just discussing with a nurse last week in Philadelphia. They are told now colds and flus are mainly viral. With 40 years ago, when I studied it, colds were mainly bacterial. Flus were mainly viral. Now we are so toxic that guess what? We can't use as many bacteria anymore. So now most of your colds are even viral. That shows our degeneration is getting greater and greater. It is terrible. So, colds and flus are the process, are the end, the culmination of this long detoxification. It is taking out the garbage. So you start blowing all this mucus out, having vomit and diarrhea. Just expunging yourself of all this toxicity that has been broken down in a large way over that period of time. Of course, your body is throwing some of it off all the time. But the majority of it comes out at the end. And you get a fever. And they say, oh God, you have to stop the fever or do the brain damage. Who the hell have you ever known that got brain damage from a fever? I've met millions of people who've had fevers. Not one of them got brain damage. Another myth and fiction. Myth and fiction. What is a fever? A fever does not allow the body to generate any more parasites, any more bacteria, nor manufacture any more virus, nor molds. It's the end of them. It's saying, okay, I'm going to shut the detoxification processes down, and we're going to go on to healing binge. Well, when we do that, we have to take all the nasty poisons out of the body. They've all been broken down over this long period of detoxification, so that when we heal, we don't have all those substances contaminating the healing process. Also, that's when the temperature of fever just reaches 100 degrees. No parasites, no bacteria, no molds, fungus can grow. They can't multiply. When you hit 101 degrees, you're in an intense cellular division state. The higher you go, the faster your cells are dividing. Why the hell would you want to stop that? Because they don't want to help you. They know this. Every military person who's been a scientist in NASA, they know everything about raw diets. They know it all. Do you think they're dispersing any of it to you? No. What is the water that the astronauts drink? Urine. They drink their urine. They recycle their urine. That's what they drink.

And there are a lot of countries that are mainly vegetarian. Guess what they drink to recycle their protein? Their urine. Now, if the astronauts can do it, why are they... And they only use it through a filter process. 

Q: The Indians, the Egyptians, they all do it.

A: There's no sterilization or nothing.

Q: The Indians, the Egyptians, they all do it.

A: They all do it, yeah. So, why don't they tell you that? What is nitrogen that they spread as a fertilizer? Urine from these dairy cows. Collect all this urine. They dilute it. They put a little extra, you know, their chemicals in it. Extra minerals in it. And then they put it out in the field. And the plants grow and fill out and they [unintelligible]. Much too fast. Because it's so diluted. But it still makes things fertile. So then, won't you be afraid of urine? Oh, you'll go out there and you'll touch your penis and you'll wipe yourself off? Put chemicals on your hands. Destroy the life in your hands. Because you're afraid of urine. There are people who eat urine all the time. I was giving a lecture on Jekyll Island, Georgia, in 1982. And there was a man, elderly man, his wife owned a health food store, which started off as a vitamin supplement store. But after they got on the diet, they got more into the foods. But he stood up at one of my lectures when I was talking about urine. He says, you know something? He said, I'm devastated. I'm a retired police officer from the Miami Police Department. And he said, pre-1928, if we found somebody who was shot or in an accident and bleeding to death, we urinated in a cup and poured it on them and it stopped the bleeding. Just like that, even if it were a serious jugular vein cut. Poured the urine, he poured it on while he held it, and it would seal itself, cause clotting. You seal it. He said in 1928, they outlawed it, and he said he watched thousands of people die because they weren't allowed to do it. It was outlawed as unsanitary. By whom? The medical profession. Who is, who are all of your health officials? Medical people. And that's a stance. Bacteria, the bacteria theory is their whole paradigm. You have to understand it holds no water. It is wrong. If it were right, there would be no creature on this world alive. This would just be a rock planet. In fact, rock, rock required molds. That's what rust is. Rust is a mold. It breaks down rocks so that plants can eat. And then it's a bacterial reaction. It goes on and on. It creates life. Rust, molds, bacteria create life. And it keeps going. So that's not to be afraid of. So, at the end of that detoxification and fever, don't kill a fever. I tell you how to do it in the book for those people who freak out. If you get 105 fever as a child, this baby is going to be healthier than ever if you let it alone. Some mothers will just panic and take their baby to a doctor. The doctor, of course, is going to put him on IV antibiotics. Pack the poor baby in ice like they did me. And I mean packed in ice. Packed in ice.

Oh, it's traumatic. I mean, that causes brain damage. Packing my head in ice. Freezing all over my body. It's painful. You know, dastardly. Here I was trying to finally repair from, you know, a deep and long detoxification. So my body did not get the ability to do it. So I tell people, eat tomatoes and some things. They will bring the fever down. Don't need to do that. Not unless you panic. But don't panic. You're going to get well fast. Cellular division requires it. The higher the fever... And I've had children on this diet that have gotten up to 106.2 degrees. They've never had brain damage. Heck, they're smart. I've got one kid now who's five years old and just entered the fourth grade. I've got one kid who's 17 and just graduated from Yale. And he went on the diet at one year old. So you have to take a look at this. All the children who grew up on this diet are incredibly smart. And all of them have had very high fevers from some time in their healing process. So do not be afraid of fever. That's your healing.  The healing crisis. The spewing of mucus and vomit, that's the detoxification crisis. That's the end of that. Now, the healing process can go on for months. There'll be a lot of lethargy, tiredness. You want to sleep a lot. Maybe not even eat very much, but you have to. When I get into one of those sleepy states, I force myself to eat up to three pounds of meat a day. Because I'm an opportunist. I want to make sure that every cell that divides has plenty of protein. So I get healthier faster. When I go through that kind of experience, once I'm out the other side, a few months later, I am healthier than I was before. Now, it takes 40 years, according to Howell and Pottenger's work, for you to go from disease to optimal health again. That's what Pottenger found with cats and Howell found with the rats. Here's another interesting little study, a [unintelligible] study. Now, Pottenger used cats, 900 cats over a 10-year period, fed them different diets. Once he put them raw, had no diseases, led many into a cage very peacefully. The more processed the food got, like in powdered milk, condensed powdered milk, any of those, the worse the diseases got, the more acute, chronic the diseases became. When he took these diseased animals and put them on a good diet, it took five generations to get them to optimal. Five generations of our cells, seven to seven and a half years to complete the cycle, so that's 38 to 40 years. So for us, that's 40 years from the start of a perfect diet, lingering on that.

Now, I've only been eating raw meat on a daily basis since 1982, December of 82. So I counted my state of perfect diet from that point on. Before that, I was eating meat only three times a week, raw meat three times a week. Not enough to heal the body. So all those years that I was a real raw fooder, from 72 to 82, maybe I cleaned a little bit, but I certainly didn't heal my body very much, even though I was eating a lot of dairy. Dairy doesn't allow for regenerative cellular division very well. So, I'm only, how many years into it? This is, pardon? 27 years, that's right, 27 years. So how many years do I have yet to go? 13 years, before I finish my 40. So I look in pretty good shape. I'm a little bit more than halfway there. I still have 13 years to go. Well, at the end of this year. 14 years [unintelligible] is in December of 82. So take a look at it. Finish my 60th year in two months. I'm just more than halfway, I'm already satisfied. Can you imagine what's going to happen in the next 13 years, 14 years? Am I continuing that? Can I get healthier every week? I feel healthier every week. Because know my markers from week to week, the improvement that I have. Daily is too hard to mark that, but I can mark it by week. So it's pretty incredible. Most people are deteriorating as they get older. Degeneration and age are synonymous when they should not be. No other animal in nature is that way. Look at the Andes tribes in the mountains, the Andes Mountains in Chile. They eat all this raw meat and raw insects. And I mean, caterpillars, big fat worms. I mean, huge fat worms. And they make this as their diet. Rarely do they cook. And they have this exercise they do once a year. This is in the Andes Mountains, way up there. They kick a ball for 100 to 200 miles. And they take about 10 of them per group. And the one in front will kick the ball. Once he's kicked it, he'll fall to the end. And they just keep switching like that for 100 to 200 miles. 90-year-old people are in there. 90 years old. I've got an American buddy here... When I used to pal around with him, he was an actor. And he would do a 100-mile run once a year. And he'd train for it, run 13 miles a day. And he lived on two bottles of aspirin to get through it. And he had to isolate himself three weeks in his house after the run. Because what happened with the aspirin, it made his skin like toilet paper. He could actually go just like this and peel his skin off. This much pressure, the skin would peel off. So he had to eat intense amounts of milk and cheeses to help build his skin and tissue back. Somebody punched him, he just bleeded inside. So he could not leave the house for three weeks. And he still had these very sensitive [unintelligible] for another six months.

He would do this to himself once a year. These guys in the end didn't do that. They had no pain when they were doing that whole thing. And he wasn't even running with a ball, with a group. He's an isolated individual running a free path. So, take a look at the health and where we're going. I listed in the recipe book, in the last 50 pages, all of the toxins that are formed from eating cooked food. I listed 32 of them. Those are the only known toxins that are produced. The three of the major ones that are carcinogenic are the acrylamides, which are getting a lot of press right now. And let me tell you, they're trying to fool you. They're telling you, only foods that are cooked in saturated fats have a high level of acrylamides. These foods, fried, are high in acrylamides, especially if they're high-carbohydrate foods. So changing the oil or fat that you're boiling your potato chips in and your french fries and anything that's carbohydrate, any chips, any bread that's fried, doughnuts, is not going to change and reduce the acrylamide level but maybe 5%. So this is all to think that they are making you better. What happened when that whole team of full professors in Sweden came out with that test about six years ago. Full professors, bright men, all working together, found that in all the tumors that they inspected, almost 60% of the tissue in it was contaminated with acrylamide. So they held a press conference and said that all cereals, donuts, potato chips, french fries, and all the slight substances needed to be outlawed. Man, that hit the press. You know who came out of the woodwork the next week. The food industry came out of the woodwork. The government came out of the woodwork. Those full professors didn't check with the Board of Regents before they held that press conference because they did it on pure passion and understanding of what they had done. What they had found. And of course they were going to be publicly punished for this, they are all working in high schools. These were full professors. Some of the most brilliant scientists in Sweden reduced to high school professors or high school teachers because of that work. Now, because a lot of people are doing the research and finding out it's true, they're coming out. New York City outlaws, you know, certain kinds of saturated fats keep boiling, you know, foods in. And it's all a scam again because it's only going to reduce about 5%. And, you know, we've got these medical doctors who are filing suit against McDonald's and all these people. Again, it's a big scam, a big fraud. They're going to use a different oil to boil it.

They're going to be making the same foods. And they reduce the acrylamides by 5%. But when you boil a carbohydrate in oil of any kind, whether it's a small chain or long chain fatty acid, if you've got a concentration of acrylamides, it's outstanding. 1,500 level... It goes from anywhere from 270 to 1,500. And they want to reduce it by 5%, to protect them. Bullshit. Absolute bullshit. And nobody's calling them on it, because the press is owned by whom? By big industry. General Electric. Gulf and Western. That's who owns the media. [unintelligible] chemical company. So, you have to be aware of this, take care of yourself. Okay, let's get into food. Now, the foods that are important, we know fats. I always start with fat, because fats are the most important nutrient in our toxic society. Like I say, where do you find toxins? You find them in the fat. So, what does your body need? Lots of fat to protect itself. Thank you, Joe, wonderful. I don't know, but I need to be illuminated so I see your faces. So, the fat is so important, but you have two other functions of fat. Not only protect you and isolate and bind with the toxins, but that's where you have your greatest amount of fuel. If you take a calorie of a carbohydrate or a protein sugar like pyruvate, it has two and a half times less energy than a fat does. The same calorie of fat. So, fat has two and a half times more energy will give you two and a half times more energy than any carbohydrate or protein will. And it happens in the citric acid cycle. Citric acid cycle is 80% fat, 15% pyruvate, which is a protein sugar. Sugars that are made for protein. And then carbohydrates, either from citric acid, like vitamin C, that's in oranges and other foods, or even in meat. You know, there's more vitamin C that can be absorbed in a pound of meat than five oranges. That's why the archaeologist Vilhjalmur Stefansson, who worked for the government, found out the quickest way to reverse scurvy is to eat raw meat. You can reverse scurvy in one-fifth the time than if you're using oranges or lemon juice. Pretty phenomenal, huh? But they don't tell you that. They want you sucking all this orange juice so that you'll be demineralized, and that causes demineralization. High concentrations of fruit causes demineralization because of the citric acid cycle. Your body is built to identify citric acid and fruit sugars as a way to utilize the fat. Only. And that's only 5% of the process. So you should never eat more than 5% carbs. 15% protein, maybe, if that's just what you were using. That protein was for fuel to help utilize the fats, when we use protein mainly for regenerating cells, for cellular division, for building cells. So we need a lot more protein. 

Now, the different tribes eat various amounts, and each one of them looks differently. And all the tribes that eat raw dairy and raw meat have no disease zip, not even dental caries. The first time that Eskimos had a cavity was in 1886, and that was with an Eskimo that was living in the German and British colony there, and was for 50 years eating the cakes and the sugars. The first case of cancer was 1936, among the Eskimos. That was after 100 years of living with the white man's community and white man's food. Can you imagine? A whole civilization didn't know what cancer was, right here in the Americas, in our same continent. The Maasai, the Samburu, and the Fulani tribes in Africa, no disease. The Fulanis have been experiencing a heavy drought because of all of the British and American governments' experimentation with weather in Africa. They got away with it there. Now they're getting away with it here. So the Fulani tribe has gone from this incredible thriving community to now eating these grains and all this garbage that the American government and British government are giving to them. [unintelligible] with their own natural culture. They're giving them these diseased foods, these toxic stuff, instead of helping them with drought that's killing their herds. Because the Fulani tribe is a tribe that lives 90... excuse me, 60% on dairy, 10% on leaves and vegetables, and then the rest on meat. The Maasai tribe lives about 40% on meat and about 10% on vegetables and 50% on dairy. The... no, excuse me, that was the Samburu. The Fulani live 90% on dairy. Each tribe looks different because of their diets. The Maasai, because they eat so much meat, and when they also... they keep their herds at a smaller amount. So when the calves are suckling, they... then you'll have to do blood. So they'll take a huge bamboo shoot, cut off the sharp angle, take a huge slingshot, and then go up to a bull and then shoot it right into the jugular vein. And I've seen that, you know, the bull's down there eating his grass, it's shot into its neck and it goes... right back to eating again. Looks like it doesn't even hurt him. They've got this huge bamboo shoot, jammed into its neck so they put a cork on it, from a rubber tree. And then what they do is they fill a bladder, a cow's bladder, which is pretty big, with half milk, and then they bleed it and they put half blood in there and it tastes like milk. It doesn't taste anything like blood. 

Once you get some blood and milk together, it's like ice cream. So that's what they drink three months out of the year while the calves are nursing for the newborns. And that's the only time they eat that mixture. But they are very tall. I think the smallest of the tribe is something like 6'3". And the tallest is like 7'11".

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, the higher meat eating ones. That's 40% of the time. And they're also considered the smartest, most fierce tribe in the world. Also, they got so smart 20 years ago, what was happening. Shirley MacLaine was going to give them the doughnuts and canes and garbage. And so were a lot of people. So the Maasai tribe realized that it was starting to make them temperamental and starting to pull the tribe apart. So they went to the government and asked the government to outlaw the white man anywhere within 20 miles of the tribes. And they capitulated to it. The Maasai tribe offered every day to march 20 miles out to do the rituals and sell their goods to the white man. But they weren't allowed within any range to give them any kind of toxicity. So the tribe people who did that never took anything that they were given. They would accept it, but not utilize it. And they'd go back to their tribe and bury that stuff. Never utilize it. See, that's why they're the smartest tribe there, too. The Fulani had accepted there was a British guy that filmed them for the 35 years that he helped them get into agriculture. Changed them, just disturbed the whole tribe. They never fought. I mean, if they had a little argument, the children at night would gather them together and do a play and reenact the adults' behavior. And everybody would laugh having realized how silly it was. Now they're quarreling, they're jealous, they have intermarital sex and all kinds of things. Now all this jealousy is involved. All this stuff that used to make them a very tight-knit tribe that was beautiful and glorious and happy is now all disintegrated into tractors, pollution. They've got gasoline all over their homes from running tractors. They've got oil on their property. They're getting into the agriculture. They've brought chemicals over. And they've destroyed the Fulani tribe. The British have destroyed the Fulani tribe. Now, yeah, and now they're trying to do it to the Samburu. And the Maasai aren't having it. They're smart enough not to have it. Of course, I met a Maasai last year in Los Angeles. And he still drinks lots of raw milk when he can get it. But he was taken out and put in the white man's community to learn from them and take it back to the tribe so that they could make the same mistakes. But when he went back, he didn't want a meeting. And when I met him, he wasn't so healthy. [unintelligible] stayed within the tribe. So a lot of people will say, oh man, can I eat some cooked food? If you only ate one raw food in your life, you'd be adding vitamins [unintelligible]. 

You'd be doing your body a favor. Every time you eat something that's cooked, you're adding a toxin. Like I said, I mentioned the 32 that are identified [unintelligible]. You have the lipid peroxides, and heterocyclic amines, and those are the free, most cancer-producing, so they say. And then there are 30 others that also produce diseases of varying degrees. So whenever you eat cooked food, you're adding to the toxicity in your body and taking your chance on developing diseases. And it's not an easy crapshoot in our environment. Because you're having to deal with so many just in your environment. So let's say you're wearing synthetic clothes. Do you know what you're breathing in? You're breathing in plastic, polymer, and PCB. Eighty percent of the population, the female population in Vietnam wears synthetic clothes. The highest rate of lung difficulties in any country. I've never seen a country like it. Almost all women look like they're running around in pajamas. And they're wearing these polyester clothes. Polyester clothes. And the lung disease is terrible. It's astounding. You have to realize, they do rugs. Plastic rugs. So, if I breathe the lint, what am I breathing in? I'm breathing in plastic, which is made of polymers and PCB. But what are PCBs? They're dioxins. Well, why would they put dioxins in the plastic? Is the plastic made of vegetable oil? Of over-hydrogenated vegetable oil? Yeah, it is. But what happens with vegetable oil? What happens? Why was the reason that plastic was not used right away when it was discovered? Because it molded. In a year, the moisture, plastic seats, plastic anything grew this mold. A mold. Black and green molds. So they couldn't use it. So they tried heating it to phenomenal amounts of degrees to the closest they could get to without disintegrating it into ash. Still, six to eight months later, a few months later, the molds were forming again. So they created dioxins to poison the plastic so that no living thing could ever survive it. And guess who now breathes in all the [unintelligible]? All the dioxins in our environment so we can have plastic. Plastic everything, including plastic clothes. So when you get a fiber [unintelligible] in your lungs, what are you getting? Your body has to digest it to eliminate it, unless it's going to vomit it out and cough it out in huge streams.

So imagine that. Stay away from anything that isn't silk, cotton, or flax, or linen, and wool. Those are natural substances from our earth and they can be broken down organically. Especially if they're organically produced. You will not have toxins in them. Plastic is a real problem in our diseases today. And it is everywhere. So fats. Very important for everything you do. Energy. Cleansing of the body. Your body makes the majority of virus in conjunction with the fats. Of course the proteins are usually the structure of the virus, but that's usually the skeleton of the virus. Its proponents are predominantly fat. So, fat is very important in many ways. You say, well, what kinds of fat? Well, let's take a look. Everybody's been praising vegetable oils since the 50s. Now, what happens with vegetable oil in the human body? It solidifies, it hardens. The animal fats don't cause hardening of the arteries. They told you, you, everybody in here that meats, red meats, and the fat in the red meats, beef, causes arteriosclerosis. Heart disease, hardening of the arteries. Bullshit. The New Guinea tribes, the, even the cannibalistic tribes, who ate plenty of cooked meat, have no arteriosclerosis and no heart disease. None. Nil. They have gout, they have arthritis, they have rheumatism, they have osteoporosis, and they have thrombosis. Those kinds of diseases. But they don't have cancer, they don't have heart disease, and they don't have arteriosclerosis. People who eat a lot of vegetable oils have arteriosclerosis and heart disease. Because in the human body, the temperature in the body is 98.6 and lower. Except a few times a fever a year. When trying to heal. Trying to cut down on the intoxication process. For a while. An herbivore has a body temperature of 101 to 105 degrees. So it keeps vegetable oils fluid in the system. In our system, it hardens and crystallizes. Especially with hydrogenating. It has the same molecular structure of plastic, because that's how plastic's made. That's the styrofoam that they were making into ice cream and marshmallows and everything else. A lot of other stuff. So, animal fats are your best fat. Each one of those fats from dairy does a different thing. Different specific thing, very sacred on this planet because each way it is altered creates a whole new therapy. Raw milk, straight, room temperature when eaten can completely reverse diabetes, high blood sugar, low blood sugar, hypoglycemia, hyper and hypoglycemia. Both. Both. Like I said, I was type 1 diabetic, I was a juvenile diabetic. I stopped taking insulin at 21 years old.

And when I went on to a fruitarian diet, sure I was going into diabetic shock all the time, but it never killed me. [unintelligible] the slight seizures would be over. And then when I started eating meat, almost all of them went away. When I stopped eating high amounts of fruit, I haven't had one diabetic shock since 1986. Not one diabetic shock. I'm completely well. Three years ago, a bunch of doctors, cardiologists, were studying raw food diets at Washington Medical School in St. Louis. So they asked me to come in. They were studying vegetarians and they heard about me. They thought, oh, we've got to see this guy. He eats all this butter, all this cream, all this meat. His heart must be a frickin' wreck. He's eating raw foods. So I went in there and I agreed to all the tests. I'd even agreed to the glucose tolerance tests. The first time I'd eaten sugar since 74, I think it was. I mean, I was shaking from it. I almost went into a real diabetic shock from eating that sugar. It was difficult. I had to slowly calm myself for those five hours. They would take my blood every 30 minutes. But they found that I had the healthiest pancreas that they'd ever come across. Most people produce a certain amount of insulin and lower the blood sugar when it goes rapidly high and you lose that much glucose down to 104 right around when it stops. I had so much insulin and all four varieties of insulin. And some insulin they hadn't come across before that lowered that sugar level, that toxic sugar, down to 54. They'd never seen it before. So it was like they'd shot it right out of the water. They said no type 1 diabetic, juvenile diabetic, can ever get well. They'd have to take insulin for the rest of their lives. Absolute lie. And I proved it there. And everything else turned out to be, you know, they were doing the ultrasound to check my carotid arteries, my heart and everything. And they used a video system at the same time to do that, to check. So they were recording it. They recorded, they had hundreds of them from all these vegetarian diets. And they kept spinning, you know, usually it takes 10 minutes, 15 minutes maximum. They were 20 and 25 minutes on a particular [unintelligible], trying to find the congestion in my system, and they couldn't find it. So they were very surprised because of the amount, the fat, the caloric intake, the fat was unspeakable [unintelligible]. So then they said, OK, we have one more test for you to do. You didn't agree to this one, but we'd like you to take it. It's just some stress exercise stuff. I said, sure.

So I signed some more releases. Then we'd go up to their gym. And this is a cardiac gym. They've got all these electrodes that they put on me, you know, my heart, around the head and wrists and ankles. And it was all on Bluetooth. So, you know, I could pretty much go run around and do what I wanted to do. They have their own treadmill. And my heart normalized in three minutes completely after running like five minutes straight. Then they had me on these machine, weightlifting machines. So first they put me on a bench press where I'm lying down, looking up, pushing this stuff up. So, you know, they said, how often do you work out? And they looked at me. I said, I haven't worked out since 1979. You know, once in a while I'd get with a girlfriend and have sex. But I hadn't had a girlfriend in three years. To that point, so I said, I haven't done any exercise, absolutely, in three years, except on my computer and carrying my groceries. Yeah, sure. So they start off with 20 pounds at a time. I'm getting bored. Something like that. So we get up to 190 pounds. And then I start putting just a little bit of strain on it. And they say, OK, it's enough. I said, I'm just now starting to strain. Well, if you haven't done exercise, we don't want to cause cardiac arrest. So they ended it right there. My heart rate was normalized in two minutes. Most people take somewhere almost an hour for their heart beat to get normal again. Then they put me on the leg press push, whatever that is. I started off with 40 pounds. You put that 20 pounds each time. Then I got up to 280 pounds. And I just started straining on that one. I was hiding the strain. I got up to 240. I started stressing a little bit. But I hid it so they wouldn't stop. Because I wanted see what I could get to every time. So I got to 280. And my heart was normalized in three minutes. Even after that. So they were astounded with all of this. And I was very pleased with it. Heart rate normal in three minutes. Let me give you an example of what it does for other people. I have a martial arts expert who came to me. Or a martial arts contender. I guess he's an expert. He's been in competition for about, I think, 13 or 14 years before he came to me. And in his category, he always came in, anywhere from 34th to 50th place. Out of the world competition. So, that was pretty good. This man is 51 years old. [unintelligible]. Then he went on the diet, and he clocked his progress. The charts he brought to me showed his heart rate level after his exercise routine that he does three days a week.

He exercises every day, but each day he does a different exercise. But three days a week he jumped rope. And he clocked it, you know, his heart rate, after five minutes after the exercise, the jump rope. And it was right around, on average, about 175. It went as high as [unintelligible]. And down to 167. So, one day a week, he jumped 2,600 jumps. And he has to do it, he has to do it, each time as he gets through the week, he does it all within an hour. The next time, he does 7,000 jumps, 7,200 jumps, in an hour. The third day of the week, and he always has a day in between all of these, he does 12,200 jumps in an hour. And his heartbeat at the end, after a year on this diet, was right around 110 after three weeks. Can you imagine? That strenuous workout, and it would be normal, almost normal, in three minutes, down to 110? Pretty incredible. Pretty phenomenal. You see what this diet can do if you watch it. So again, you want to eat the things that are best for you. Of course, raw food is always better. Sure, you can cheat, but you're just cheating yourself. I have no judgment about it, because some people's taste buds are more important than their health. And I don't judge that. I've had many people come to me before the book was out, and they would hear my lecture, and they'd have severe cancer, and they'd say, oh gosh, [unintelligible] suffering cancer, and then I would change my diet. I said, hey, that's a choice, you know, and it's okay. It's not my life. That's your decision. I've got no say-so over it, and I certainly won't judge you. I've spent most of my life diseased, so who am I to judge, you know? So that's what you learn. If diet and your foods are more important than your health, have at it. Have at your disease all you want. It's not a problem with me. I'm not an evangelist. I'm just here showing you that there's a different way, which you don't have to go out that way. You don't have to live that way. But if your taste buds for that stuff is more important, let me tell you, there was nobody that wanted to give up their sugar crisps and powdered donuts more than me. And my RC Cola, and my alcohol, and my cigarettes. Out of everything, if I could still do it, I'd still smoke. I love to smoke. I [unintelligible] I'd still be doing it. And I just love smoking. But, there was a choice. Health, energy, stamina, vibrance, feeling good and positive, not depressed all the time, not negative all the time, not cynical all the time. In my head it was non-communicative. I don't want it in my life. It's not worth it. I mean, I spend maybe 5, 10, 15 minutes maximum eating one of these foods.

When I have lower energy and [unintelligible] focus for a day or two, it's not worth it. But for other people it is. And I don't judge anybody for having that choice. That's your choice. It's not a problem with me. So, no one should feel guilty about their choice and just realize you're living the life you chose. From here on out, if you suffer because of what you eat, it's your choice. It's absolutely your choice and it's okay. You'll learn. Like everybody else does. And maybe that's what you want to experience. Maybe the disease is something you've chosen to experience like I did. Because I did not know what I know now. And I don't expect many people to go on this diet a hundred percent. There may be a thousand of us that do it nearly a hundred percent. And there are twenty thousand people and more who do the diet. To whatever extent. Fifty percent. A hundred percent. Twenty thousand. Probably more than that now. Because we've sold twenty thousand books. Or more. Twenty thousand books. So at least that many people who tried it. So, raw foods make you healthy. Cooked foods have a tendency to promote disease. Like I said, most disease comes from industrial pollution. Processed food, not just cooking. Remember the tribes that ate what was normal to the human, mainly meat, still have five diseases. Gout, arthritis, rheumatism, osteoporosis, and thrombosis. Those diseases are normal to our cooked food diet. Thank you. So it's up to you how far you want to take this and what you want to experience. And I wrote the recipe book, and there's lots of recipes. The cheesecakes are delicious. All these sauces to make foods more enjoyable. When you eat a cooked food, when you cook something, it usually turns bitter and flat. Everything tastes like cardboard unless you spice it. Raw foods are a little different. I mean, if you have warm meat, you know, more like I do sometimes. I'll put it in a jar, warm water, not hot enough to burn my hand. But you heat it up to about, you know, 100 degrees for it to taste good. If you eat it cold, it tastes flat. So you always eat, you know, a sauce with it. Any food that's raw will have a lot more taste. You can chew it 500 times, and you'll have flavor. When you eat a cooked food, you lose its flavor in five chews, unless it's heavily spiced. If you ate most of the food that you eat cooked out there without spices and flavorings, you wouldn't eat it. You wouldn't eat it at all. You'd much prefer raw foods over anything like that. But that is the way food is delivered to you. Highly chemicalized flavors, flavorings, colorings, you name it. And all those things are highly toxic. And those create the worst diseases. So that's what you have to be careful of.

When you eat cooked foods, eat them as clean as you can get, most unprocessed you can get. But your best tool to get well and healthy on every day is to eat the raw foods. And then the balance is proper for the human body. So we talked about which foods are healthy for the human body. We talked a little bit about the fats. Butter helps lubricate and protect every part of the body except the brain and nervous system very much. It still helps protect the brain and nervous system, but a small amount compared to cream. Cream helps the nervous system and brain ultimately. However, cream is very difficult to digest. It takes a lot more enzymes and different forms of bile produced by the liver to fractionate that cream molecule. And then what the liver does is convert two-thirds of that into like butter. And one-third of it into cholesterol to feed the brain and nervous system. So you still have to have the cream to feed your brain and nervous system. However, butter is very easy to digest. It gets to every place in the body where you can't normally get the bones, the cartilage, the connective tissue, the skin. All of those far-reaching places. Because when you eat fat, when you go on this diet, your glands, your organs are starving. Starving for wholesome food. Starving for those water and fat-soluble vitamins and enzymes and minerals which are destroyed by cooking. Even as low as 118 degrees. And so are all the enzymes. By the time you reach 138 degrees, you've destroyed all the vitamins. So you've crippled them at lower temperatures. But that's the destruction. That's the labile point. And the oil, the essential fatty acids are destroyed somewhere between 178 degrees and 171 degrees. All the way to 210 degrees. Olive oil and coconut oil are the highest. You have to take them highest before you can see that destruction of the chemistry. But they start warping at very low temperatures, as low as 96 degrees. So having the labile point, which Sally Fallon uses, as a safe point to take your fats, doesn't mean that they're healthy. It's less destructive, but doesn't mean it's healthier. It's better to keep your oils, if you're going to have pressed oils, around 96 degrees at the highest in process. Now, any kind of pressed oil, whether it's olive oil, and olive oil is not a vegetable. Remember, a vegetable is a leaf, stalk, and root. So any oil from that, or from a seed, is basically a vegetable oil. And any oil that's from a fruit, like avocado or olive oil, those are different kinds of oils. They mainly, they won't harden in your system as easily, but they will harden in the system, and they can cause arteriosclerosis, but your body's less likely to use it, unless that's the only fat that you're going to use. 

If that's the only fat that you're eating, that's going to be what your cells are made of, and they will harden in your body as you accelerate. It takes about three to five years for this to start crystallizing in your body. Any kind of pressed oil is mainly for detoxification. It helps your body make soaps, virus. It helps your body produce virus and soaps. So it's heavy in cleansing. Cream and butter, cheeses, they all help the body. They nurture the body. They stabilize the body. They strengthen the body and do a little bit of cleaning. Maybe 25% at best. If you're really sick, maybe a third of those fats will be used as cleanser. But most of them are to make the body stronger and nurture it and stabilize it. So those animal fats are very important. Even the fats that you have with meat, it's very similar. It helps stabilize and keep the body alert, happy, stable, and protected. Not just cleansing. So when you use any pressed oil, whether it's flax, again, flax is a seed oil. So unless you're just using it medicinally, a tablespoon at a time a day is all you should have. If you're going to have olive oil, you can have four ounces a couple of days a week. Or one tablespoon every day in the sauce. But don't use a lot of it. Because it's a solvent-reactive. It is for cleansing, not for stabilizing and healing the body. When we get into protein, a lot of people say, oh, nuts are high and beans are high in protein. However, what happens to nuts and beans and grains? You get phytic acid. And the phytic acid interferes with mineral absorption. And if you've got an imbalance in mineral absorption, what else don't you absorb and digest? And utilize properly, protein. And if you don't digest your proteins well, you don't digest your fats well. So it's a whole chain reaction. So, it's best not to eat grains. However, in my first writing of We Want to Live, I had for some people to eat a lot of, or some, cooked bread. Like, you know, [unintelligible]. Not baked with oil or anything with additives.

[audio cut]

A: [unintelligible] that are produced by the neurological system. They can make people crazy. [unintelligible] But I found that when you eat, they would take that [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] So I found a lot of people storing a lot of advanced glycation end products in their intestinal tract. The rest of your body, if you're on the diet, 100% and [unintelligible]. So these acrylamides were making their intestinal tract worse. [unintelligible] So I had to find some way to alter that. To get rid of the phytic acid, and so you didn't have to cook it to do that. So I started using nuts as the basic point because nuts have the starch in the best form for the humans to bind with those neurotoxins, neurotoxins, that are created during trauma, induced trauma or upset, and nervous system produces hormones. And when those are utilized in the system [unintelligible], there's a byproduct there that's highly toxic. And it takes the starch to bind with it. And when that happens, according to Dr. Elnora Van Winkle, who is the world's most brilliant neuroscientist, she catalyzed all of the chemistry of the brain and nervous system [unintelligible]. And she did it for 57 years, something like that. She used to do all the chemistry of the nervous system. And she found that when her girlfriends or colleagues had these emotional tensions [unintelligible] their life, she found those toxins moving in their blood. So the body would keep toxins in from [unintelligible] in the body to get rid of it, and they created the same emotional turmoil as when they were created. And she said, she went on my diet. And she found that, she agreed with me, that the bread [unintelligible]. And though I went into using nuts, I found a way to utilize the nuts, so you didn't have to use the cooked food, except in some people where the nut formula doesn't work. So what I have is, you take the nuts, you grind them until they become a flour, and then you add the eggs and butter, and some other fats, butter's preferable, and a little honey. [unintelligible] so you will still digest the starches in the nuts, but we don't digest the fats and the proteins in the nuts very well, because we don't have an herbivore system. It'd take an herbivore to digest nuts, and we receive properly. Birds mainly eat seeds. [unintelligible] We are not. They're built to handle phytic acid, [unintelligible]. We are not. So, but using the nut farming is preferable. [unintelligible] So, and if you're going through that, and you find that eating the nuts only once a week isn't enough, have it twice a week. Have it every other day if you have to. But try to keep it down, because it's still not a good food to digest easily. [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] everything is digesting slower and slower.
 
[unintelligible] So that covers most of the foods. Your proteins, like I say, in the nuts we don't digest it well. Meats are the only place where you can get a higher concentration of protein. Dairy is next. When I talk about meat, I'm not talking about beef. I'm talking about any flesh food, whether it's poultry, fish, seafood, any of the red meats, beef, lamb, sheep, buffalo, venison, whatever it is. Those are red meats. Now, I made a mistake. I have a misnomer in there called white meat. White meat, all poultry is white meat, all fish is white meat. Then you've got salmon, which is a very pretty color. [unintelligible] You've got tuna, which is red, very pretty color, not white. You've got ostrich, which is dark as liver, red as liver. That's not white. So, I called it white and red meat, misnomer, as it is. So, whenever I talk about white meat in the book, it just means fish, seafood or poultry. And you can get rabbit. Rabbit is a white meat. But they're usually fed processed alfalfa pellets. So, I stay away from it. [unintelligible] So, they put them in these big cages with no grass. And just throw in processed alfalfa, alfalfa pellets,  processed food. So, usually rabbits are not very healthy. Unless you know some farmer who's raising them in the grass. And that's mainly what they're eating is grass and vegetables. So, I've covered the starch character, which I call the protein. I mean a category, a food category. However, it is in a high carbohydrate bracket. I still call it because [unintelligible] the psychological hormone byproducts. So, we've gone over the fats. We've gone over the proteins. We've gone over the carbohydrates, I mean the starch carbohydrates. We have the fruit carbohydrates. And I went over that quite a bit about how they cause a lot of, you know, psychological problems. They'll cause insects to chew you. They'll cause all kinds of things. So, let me give you an example of what can happen. I had a friend who was calling me. You know, he was one of these guys with [unintelligible]. He's been experiencing this for 32 years. [unintelligible] he was depressed all the time. Especially the last 20 years of his life. Suicidal a lot. Very, very skinny. And a chiropractic doctor brought him to the Whole Life Expo where I was speaking. And he came up for a mini consult with me. I read the mounds of the hands, how the glands work. Suggest a brief diet for them. And I said, you should be 220 pounds. He looked at his chiropractor, and said, this guy is just full of shit. And walked out. He didn't have any other choice but to try the diet [unintelligible]. So within a year, he was on the diet, gaining and gaining weight.

He's 215, five pounds away from it today. And that's only because he won't eat as he should. And he never did. So he just likes to stay trim. So he's still only five pounds away from the weight he was supposed to. And he gave me a call a couple years after he was on the diet. And he said, Aajonus. Back into that state of depression, anxiety, and anger, and easily short-tempered. And I said, look how much fruit you're eating. I said, what kind of fruit are you eating a lot of? He said, pineapple. I said, how much, he said, a pineapple a day. I said, well, enjoy your craziness, because you're going to have it. Pineapple causes the most over-emotionality of any other fruit that there is. So he said, do you really think that could do that? No, that couldn't do that. It couldn't make you feel this badly. And I said, well, the only way to experiment with it is to stop eating it for the next two days. He called me two days later, and he said, I haven't eaten in two days, and I'm fine. Six months later, he called me back, and he said, I'm going to be depressed again. I can't stand it. I said, what are you eating? Oh, yeah, I'm eating pineapples. [unintelligible] He stopped doing it, depression and anxiety go away. You have to understand that when you're eating bad things like sugars and fruits, your brain is going to leak you. Your memory is not going to work. Even with raw fruits, you have a high level of advanced glycation end products that form in the body. At Columbia University, they found that in the human body, the body stores 70 to 90 percent of the advanced glycation end products that you produce for the rest of your life. For the rest of your life. That means they just collect and collect and collect all the fruits. Surely, it's a prime place for cancer and [unintelligible]. And because you have that [unintelligible] and damaged tissue, you're going to create a lot of dead cells that you can't remove from the body, and that's cancer. That's why cancer seems to thrive in a sugar environment, because the sugar, it breaks down the mineral balance in the body, and then the tissue starts getting very fragile. And then it dies, and what do you have? A mummified cell. Collect mummified cells, what do you have? A tumour. So, these advanced glycation end products in your food is a problem. It's the problem with your concentration and focus. What happens if you start the day off eating carrot juice, or sugar or something heavy and sweet, lots of fruit juice, the neurological system and blood are going to be very high in advanced glycation end products. We can handle a very small amount of that a day. And you're flooding the body in the early part of the day with it. So you're going to build it. So what's the body making its glycogen with? Its brain and nervous system fluid. [unintelligible]

So, the cells, the blood, red and white blood cells, stick together. They don't move properly. It's sticking fluid, everything is slow. In the brain and nervous system, the same thing. The neurons and axons and ganglia, you know, during the synapse firing, can just go to the wrong place. Because they get stuck on the way. It won't bounce off the wall properly. It doesn't bounce off of other electrical minerals, you know, that it reflects from. It goes in different directions, the wrong direction. So it makes thinking bad. So, of course, this guy, he [unintelligible], his brain goes and he forgets. And it happens with everybody. It would happen with me if I weren't disciplined, but I'm disciplined. The only thing that can really poison me is direct chemical inundation like last night. I went into a hotel room where they have no frickin' window that opens. And I get there at almost one o'clock or twelve o'clock at night and there's no other hotel to go to. And I mean, I take my tools with me in case this happens. Open the window and they've got it sealed on the outside. So I can't open it. So I woke up this morning and my brain... It smelled like they had sprayed all those deodorizers and fragrances in there. So when I woke up this morning I had a headache. Last night I had a headache. People are going to sleep. I went for a walk at 2.30 in the morning trying to get enough oxygen to last me through. And today I don't feel as alert and as entertaining. And I'm not because I see people falling asleep. And nobody falls asleep in my workshop except for very old people. And there's nobody very old here to be falling asleep. Yet I've got people falling asleep. So I know that I'm not on because of those chemicals and what they've done to my [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, God. Oh, God. So, you know, I don't do it to myself, but sometimes other people do it to me. I'm living in that kind of environment.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's what Columbia found.

Q: Even on your diet?

A: No, no, no. They've never tested anybody on this diet. But I've seen it remove on this diet. On this diet, it will clean out the advanced glycation end products. Think about it. At 20 years old, 10% of my brain is alive. I have 80% of my brain alive. Most people, when they're 60, have maybe 25-28% of the brain alive, and that's it. And it just goes down from there. Different ages. So here I am at 60 years old, going from 10% to 80% alive. So you know I had to get rid of those advanced glycation end products. For my brain to function properly. So I look at iridology and I see how clean the brain is compared to what it used to be. I used to see all kinds of scar tissue in my brain, and now most of the scar tissue is gone. 80% of it. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Almost all of them. My eyes were brown and green 38 years ago. Now they're crystal clear blue, unless you blow them up. When I [unintelligible] an eye, I can blow up an eye this big so you can see a little spot. I've got one brown spot that exists in my bladder and prostate area. And I always wonder, what the hell is that? Why is that still there? All that brown is gone except for that one spot. It's just a dot. You can't see it unless you blow it up, huh? And two yellow spots in the brain from penicillin. Penicillin is one of the worst things we start our children off with because that mold regrows. Molds can live through anything. But if you sterilize that penicillin mold when it's in our bodies, six to 18 months later, it is growing. And it grows in every part of our body, and it causes massive amounts of brain damage and intestinal problems. Any kid, any person that has digestive problems starting in life, gets always antibiotics and 90% of the time it's penicillin. It shows up yellow in the eye. Very toxic substance. Horrible. So here's this brown spot. Been there, waiting, can't figure it out. It's right in the prostate. I've got an enlarged prostate. Nothing's a problem. And all of a sudden, last June, it's just coincidental. One of my patients got, you know, for two years he was dealing with bladder stones. And he was trying to dissolve them naturally, couldn't get to do it. Kept growing them. Because he was a vegetarian for 32 years, [unintelligible]. And he demineralized himself. All these minerals were collected, kept building stones, but very small. So he went to a urologist and he was screaming in pain because he wasn't doing it. So he went there and had them blast him with a laser. Took about 45 minutes. They were all gone. And the urologist said he'd never seen such bladder stones before. But he lived on soy chips.

Q: Oh, God.

A: That's what he lived on before he went on the diet. He lived on soy chips. You know, the mineral concentration there and the toxicity involved. So he was detoxing that all those years. It was causing crystals. Again, vegetable oils. In beans, you have a vegetable oil. It's a hardening crystallizer. So it kept collecting. So he had to have his removed about probably six months before this event happened. It was probably, I think it was, January, December. He had that done. And here it was, June. And I had some other people who were complaining of the same kind of symptoms. And I sent them to that fellow's urologist, because he would just use the ultrasound to check and see if there were stones. And none of those people had stones. It was just their urinary walls. They had some problems with toxicity, so they were causing the same kind of symptoms. Well, all of a sudden, here in June, I got back from Asia, and it was on a Friday night, and I started having some pain. I mean, my penis was aching. I couldn't urinate unless I lifted my leg like a dog. Literally, I had to go like this, or I had to go around the house with a jar, and go like this, to pee, so I knew something was wrong.

[laughter]

A: [unintelligible] a little bit of blood, just a little bit of blood. So I said, uh-oh, I'm going to this urologist. So, on the Monday, I went to the urologist. He looked at me, and he said, my God, I've never seen something like this before. My bladder wall was four inches thick. There was a stone in there that was bigger than my thumb, this big around. It had been growing for 58 years, since I was two years old. And I'd never noticed, because it was natural for me. It would take me, you know, three to five minutes, or three to three minutes to start urination, and it would take me that long to finish. My mother used to slap me on the back of my head. Hurry up! No other, none of your brothers take this long. You know, and I was just trying to pee. And he also noticed that I had a urinary tract that never evolved [unintelligible]. It was very fine in there. So all of that was blocking minerals from discharging into my bladder. So I had this huge stone, and I said, well, we're going to go and take that out. I said, you go in there with your laser and blast it. How long do you think it will take? Oh, he said, maybe 35, 40 minutes. He said, just like your friend, you have a lot of them, and you have them all down here. He went in there, it took him two hours to blast it apart. The whole center was full of mercury. It was the vaccines that I had. So my body started off making that when I was two years old. So the amount of vaccine that I had, the whole center was the size of a marble. It was black and [unintelligible]. We had the analysis done on the fluid. Concentration of mercury that would kill 5,000 people in a day.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, no shit. You think when I was in that operation room, they had shafts like this going up the penis, and they were metal rods. They had to put four things. They had to put a scope on you. [unintelligible]. They had to have a suction thing.

Q: I guess you were out.

A: Yeah, it was a laser blaster. So, yeah, I went out. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: Took him two hours to blast it. [unintelligible]. I was on a good diet. [unintelligible] the cell was getting larger. Because I was detoxing heavy metals all the time. Stuff that was in chemotherapy. So, they had to do it. So, but I mean, it was huge. I still, I can't believe this thing. The last time I went, he has the largest one. Every time, he has the largest one. Even the secretaries and the nurses. Can't believe the size of that stone. Well, it took me 58 years to grow it. And with all that mass toxicity. So, all that toxicity had gone back into my system. Because he took so long to blast it. So, the fluid had been going back in. So, I mean, I was breaking out, I had gray skin for a while. And, pardon me?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: This was just August. This was last August. This happened. Last August, I had to do it. And, while he was in there, he scraped two inches of the bladder wall. He made it smaller. And, [unintelligible]. So, now, I don't pee [unintelligible] well. But, that's part of the prostate gland. So, you know, I mean, I pee excellently. I pee like a horse now. But, when I ejaculate, it's just, you know, there's no... Because the prostate is the muscle that drives the sperm out. So, now, it's just... I used to have a strong muscle, not anymore. I don't know.

Q: I can help you. I can help you with it, Aajonus.

A: It's been seven months and that muscle is, I mean, I'm still...

Q: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: Only when I go to Thailand and I see my girlfriend, you know... You know, I guess exercise is [unintelligible]. But I'm not 
So, anyway, the diet. Now, let's look at times of day for diet. That's very important. You start off your day waking from a long night where your nervous system detoxes. As soon as that sun goes down completely, your nervous system starts changing its chemistry. It will start minorly detoxifying. By 12 o'clock, it's full on. Until 5 o'clock in the morning. The amount of toxins, the acrid substances that are in your blood are enormous. So when you wake in the morning, you've got a lot of acidic compounds in your blood. And you need to drink vegetable juices, green vegetable juices, with lots of minerals combined with those. Now the way your body handles poisons are by fat chelation. Fats chelate around those toxins. But more often, because most people are fat deficient, correct that, the body will use alkalinizing minerals like calcium, phosphorus, potassium, magnesium, with the highest concentration of calcium. And it will lock and wrap around like that. Oh, that mercury that was in my bladder, the amount of calcium that surrounded those other minerals were extraordinary because they were keeping that mercury from getting reabsorbed into my system and damaging my system. So that's how your body handles it. When you have plaque on your teeth, your body's dumping all the heavy minerals from the brain down the gum. Your body has to use lots of calcium and those other alkalinizing minerals to bind to it so you don't have dental decay. Dental decay never comes from bacteria. Bacteria cannot eat through dentine. Mercury, lead, thallium, those minerals burn and damage the dentine. Those dentine cells get damaged, when the tubule cells get damaged, then the bacteria comes in to [unintelligible]. Not the other way around. So, brushing your teeth isn't going to help if you don't have a high calcium and magnesium rate and that plaque should be very thick. Your tongue should be full of plaque on this side. And any natural therapist would say, oh, your tongue's coated, especially with the Chinese. Oh, your tongue's coated? Well, I sure hope it is. I've been eating badly all my life and my brain needs to detoxify. And when it comes to heavy toxic metals, I sure hope that my body shoots a lot of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium to bind with it. So I hope I have a white coating on my tongue. If I didn't, those heavy metals would do the same damage to my tongue that they do to the teeth. My teeth. Heavy damage. So when you have that plaque there, well, I think you should get it off. Definitely. Because if you don't have a thickness enough of the good minerals, alkalizing minerals, those metals are going to work their way through.

After they neutralize the alkalinity of those minerals, it's going to start damaging your teeth. So the body uses minerals to help neutralize some of those heavy metals or free radicals. And fat, ultimately, to arrest it. In some places, you just don't have enough fat to do that. You have to [unintelligible]. People get dry mouth not because they're thirsty, not because they're water deficient, because you have most of the poisons that rob the body of fat leave the brain and go out the mouth. The gums, the tongue, and the salivary gland. So your mouth is all dry and brittle because your whole face is fat deficient. So drinking all the water in the world is going to make it worse. The more water you drink, the more sensitive and mineral deficient you will be. The more damage is done. The [unintelligible] starts blistering sometimes and peeling even more. My favorite mixture here, is what I use, is coconut cream and honey. It's a great lip moisturizer, lip balm. It's ten tablespoons of honey to one tablespoon of coconut cream. Pass that around here and use it. It's delicious. Ten tablespoons of honey, one tablespoon of coconut cream. No, no, no, coconut cream. The difference? Coconut cream is taking the mature meat of the coconut and juicing it. You're separating the pulp from the cream. It comes out thick and creamy. You have to use a hot house. You have to use a hot room to do it in, about 80 degrees. Or you have to put the coconut ground, grated coconut or coconut pieces in a big jar and let it sit in the sink of hot water and let it heat. And then when it's warm enough and you put it through a juicer, the cream, the water-soluble, fat-soluble vitamins, and the enzymes will separate from the pulp. And you have a lot of cream. If you don't have a warm environment for it, cold, you get very little cream separating from the coconut. Here you've got a warm environment, not so bad. It's pretty easy to juice here. But in the cold climate in your house is 65 degrees. there's no way you're going to get much coconut cream out of it. The coconut cream is very different from the oil. Oil is very, very shallow in nutrients. It has only the fat-soluble vitamins, and it will smother your tissue. It can't breathe very well. It's good for [unintelligible], like I said. But the coconut cream is water, and water-soluble fats, and the fat-soluble fats, oil-soluble fats, and that helps clean everything in the body. It is the most valuable cleanser there is. If I take the coconut cream and I put it on this lid, it will turn this lid gray in about an hour. If I put butter on here, cream, olive oil, flax oil, something like that, it may take a week before it starts turning gray, ripping up the metal. Coconut cream will clean this the best.

That's why I use coconut cream so much in my recipe book and [unintelligible], helping people on the diet. The coconut cream helps cleanse their system. It helps break down fat deposits, mineral deposits, all kinds of deposits in the body. But you have to be careful, it can cause severe amounts of nausea. It starts breaking stuff down completely. [unintelligible] However, I left out the heating. I don't know how it got left out. The whole two systems got left out.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, about 95 degrees, including water [unintelligible], I mean about 105 degrees water. But if I just use a glass and heat my [unintelligible], it's only going to be like 95 degrees. [unintelligible] For about 20 minutes. And then juice it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You don't have to. You do it yourself. [unintelligible]. If it provides you with plenty of [unintelligible], if you have problems pooping, that'll help. That's not going to do you a lot of good.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, say you take the shell off the coconut.

Q: That's the hard part.

A: I tell you in there how to do it. You treat it like a hard boiled egg. You beat it on something, like you're cracking it all over. I use it on the concrete. On rocks. Other people use hammers. Different ways to do it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I bought some machines... He will. He'll be a few months. I found a whole set of machines in Thailand. I've imported two sets already and one set is on its way. We have them in Los Angeles. These things make five gallons an hour. Five gallons an hour. And there's a machine that can take the shell off the coconut in 3-15 seconds. And then they put the meat into a grinder and that grinds and grates it. And they put the gratings into this huge juicer with stainless steel that's about this big. It looks like a huge champion juicer with stainless steel. And it goes through that and separates the coconut cream from the pulp. So right now what you have to do is you take a, like I say in the book, you use an oyster knife that has a curve on the end. So that's the way you pry it after you're cracking it around a little bit and break it off. Then you cut that up, put it in a food processor, grate it, put that in a jar, immerse it in a stick of hot water, then juice that. And you'll get a lot more juice out of it. You can go from getting 2 to 4 ounces of juice per coconut to 8 to 10 ounces by one. That big of a difference. Huge difference. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That is processed and processed and heated. Well it's not terrible, but it will certainly cause you a little bit more nausea and problems because there's no vitamins left in it. There's no enzymes left in it. See, coconut cream doesn't last very long. It will ferment rapidly. So they have to treat it because it will blow up and explode. But the more fermented it is, the more it cleans the body. It breaks down crystals and stones and [unintelligible] and all kinds of things. As long as they're not made of steel like mine was. Mercury center, that was pretty hard. You should have heard the nurse. The nurse said, I had to constantly keep hitting his brow. He was pulling the laser up the highest [unintelligible]. So he had to be very careful because he could cut these pieces. He'd slip. The laser would rip through my skin. So he was just sweating like a pig or a horse. And she just had to constantly do that. Two hours. Two hours. He had to cancel his surgeries after that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, most of it got washed out because he had suction. He had three tubes. It was suctioned out. There's some of it... You should see it in all the [unintelligible]. I did my iridology, shot it. You can see all these metal fragments all throughout the digestive tract. All throughout the small intestines, it got reabsorbed. And I ate five pounds of cheese that week, to help pull it out of my system. And that's another thing. Cheese. Cheese is an incredible substance. In the human body, you will not digest it. But what it will do is act like a magnet and a. So as it goes through the stomach and intestinal tract, it magnetizes and draws out the heavy metals and poisons from the nervous fluid, the lymphatic fluid, and the blood stream as they flow through the stomach and intestinal wall. So it draws it out and it holds on to it like a sponge, so you defecate it, pass it out. Now that's toxic shit [unintelligible]. I don't want your animals to eat it either. Poison them to death. But the way you can do it, let's say you've got some osteoporosis, or you've got an infection in your tooth and you need a lot of minerals, or you're feeling weak in general, and maybe you're not very virile, you're not feeling very potent, you're not sexual, you want to increase that. In order to get a lot of minerals into your system, you need to put cheese and honey together in your mouth and you will digest it. You can eat cheese along with a milkshake that has honey in it, or honey in anything. It doesn't make any difference. The honey's already gone to doing something else, and it will not work on the cheese unless you're eating it together in your mouth. So if you have some kind of arterial or osteoporosis problem, bone problems, [unintelligible] problems, eat little amounts of cheese all day long with a little honey. And you're always going to have some toxicity, so you also eat the cheese without the honey throughout the day. But usually on a daily basis, just keep your mineral balance higher with your mineral supplements. About 30 minutes, 35 minutes after your meat meal, eat one and a half to two tablespoons of cheese with two and a half teaspoons of honey. Tablespoons of the cheese, teaspoons of the honey. And then that will digest, allow you to digest and re-mineralize your body quicker.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It will help, absolutely. It resolves all that problem. That's the only way she asked, will that help with a woman with her calcium intolerance [unintelligible]. It absolutely takes care of it, like in five days. And that's the only place you're going to get the proper minerals to properly balance the body. Because you're not going to get the concentrate of good minerals any other source. You take supplements, they're a rock. That's what plants eat, we don't eat rock. We eat foods that are fine. They already have to be in a bio-organic smorgasbord before our cells can eat it. When they're isolated, they cause all kinds of imbalances. And you eat rock, it's not the thing to do. So you eat cheese with honey and you get all these food minerals that are still too [unintelligible] in good nutrients in a smorgasbord, not isolated. So, first thing you're going to have in the morning to neutralize that toxicity, provide lots of minerals to bind with a lot of those toxins that are in the blood, those acrid toxins. You have green vegetable juice. I like to keep the carbohydrate level down, so I mainly use celery. Celery does not have enough carbohydrate in it to digest celery. So it's a negative. So you're going to add lots of parsley and carrot juice to it, And it will still come out as a very low carbohydrate substance because the [unintelligible] will be used to digest the celery. It's similar to a celery [unintelligible]. So, you know, usually 80% celery, 10% carrot, 10% parsley, or 10% zucchini, and 10% parsley. Some balance like that. I've got some recommendations in the book for various juices to have.

Q: In the amount?

A: In the amount. As far as quantities, I give a ratio for size and volume. So it's anywhere from a cup to two cups, depending on how large the person is. Like Joe, you'll have 12 to 16 ounces at first. Maybe more. If they're really toxic, I might give a person this size 24 ounces. Now, if you get sleepy, very sleepy, wiped out after drinking vegetable juice. Vegetable juice is not for you except in very small amounts. Two to four ounces at a time only. You just have to piecemeal it out. Get more of your minerals from the cheese and honey together.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you need more other things. [unintelligible]. Like I say, if you have a question, write it down. We'll get to that. So, after you have the juice, the next thing is we need to supply fuel and building material for the body. So, we know that we don't want high carbohydrate because we're all struggling with stickiness in the blood and brain series, and even lymphatic. So, what we want to do is put a high protein in the body. So, we have our first meat meal about an hour after the juice. Depending upon, you know, your metabolism, whether you're a highly active, hyperactive person, you need less red meat. If you eat a lot of red meat, you're going to pump a lot of adrenaline, and you're going to be more hyperactive. [unintelligible] irritable. So, and I have people that are so hyperactive that when they eat a lot of red meat, it causes them to pass out. Because the adrenaline level gets so high. It's like getting in a level of [unintelligible]. So, it is not something that's good to do, to eat only red meat, unless you are [unintelligible]. Even then, I think you should always eat white meat, white meat, together with the red meat. Even if it's a little. If you're a highly active person, and hyperactive person, 50-50. The higher your metabolism, you should go lower than 50% red meat. The more you're towards anemia or leukemia, the higher the meat should go. Up to maybe 80-90% maximum. And it's always best to eat the red and the white together. You'll always stay more balanced intellectually and physiologically. Always have butter with it, because your body is always going to be looking for fats for fuel. And it doesn't have it readily in the blood, and when you get up in the morning, let me tell you, there's very little fat left in the blood. The body is using it. All of it. So, the body's going to take most of that meat, turn it into a pyruvate, and then turn it into an acetate. Which is a fat. So, you're taking your meat, a very expensive item, which you don't like to eat very much, for some people. I love it. Most of the time. And then you convert it into a fuel. Not very good. So, always eat butter at that meal. You can eat cream [unintelligible]. A lot of people don't digest it. Remember the complexity of digesting cream. Sometimes you'll put the cream with the meat, and if it's not sour cream, already pre-digested, it will coat the meat, and you will not digest much of the meat. It will never [unintelligible] your brain and nervous system. You'll even see that the meat is less digested in your fecal matter. So, it's best to eat butter.

If you're going to have a sauce, do the combinations of sauces, allow for the proper utilization of your meats, so it doesn't cause a problem, and maybe it's a stroganoff, where there's a lot more cream in there, but usually with cheese it's slightly sour, so it will pre-digest a bit. But if you have a problem, if you look at your feces the next day, and you see some meat that's coated, and it looks like it's pearlized, and there's a cream coat in it, [unintelligible] bacteria and the hydrochloric acid, it didn't get to the cream, and you didn't digest it. Be careful of that. So it's always good to eat butter, two tablespoons minimum, with a meat meal. I eat sometimes a whole cup, of butter with mine. And I'm [unintelligible]. But I am fat. I am as big as he is, but I don't look it. You know why? You know why? Because my fat cells are very small. Raw fat cells are very condensed. When you cook a fat, it swells ten to fifty times its normal size. Take the [unintelligible] pop it, that's what happens. It's huge. That's what happens to the fat cells when you cook them. So I'm twenty-seven percent body fat. Do I to look it? You're twenty-six, I'm fatter than you are. See? So look at the difference. There's twenty-six.

A: [unintelligible]. So I'm saying, I'm concentrated. I'm fatter than he is, do I look it? So after you've been on this diet, I haven't even cooked fat since 1974. Took that long. It took me this long to get there, where I wasn't very large. I used to go up to a thirty-eight waist on my big side. Now, the highest I get is thirty-six. But I have three wardrobes. I go from, all the way from a thirty to a thirty-seven, thirty-six waist. And I, you know, I get my thirty-one, thirty-two size, and my thirty-four size, and thirty, you know, thirty-five, and then I get thirty-six, [unintelligible] thirty-eight, you know. So I have my three wardrobes. And I still use them, because I go up and down. A year ago, I had a twenty-nine, thirty inch waist when I was here. It was on the downside. Now I'm on the upside. I'm up to a thirty-six waistline. Thirty-four. Thirty-six waistline.

Q: I've got a thirty-four.

A: Yeah, way down here. [unintelligible]. So... I eat a tremendous amount of food. A tremendous amount of fat. And I have to eat a lot of milk in order to keep my weight up.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I like to put on, like I said, I let everybody get fat. You want to get well, you're [unintelligible] fast, get fat. Sometimes I'll get up so heavy and, you know, I won't look that heavy. But I'm, like I said, I'm fat when I need it. But I don't look it. But I can see that it's starting to make me, you know, my heart is carrying more weight. It's a little bit more of a struggle. And then I'll start getting a cold or a flu or something like that. And it starts coming on. But I let my body do it. In the recipe book, I tell people every six months to go up and down. But that's just because so many people, especially women, are paranoid of being fat and not losing weight. So what [unintelligible]. This girl was a skinny model nine years ago. [unintelligible] Nine years? Skinny little model. And I mean skinny tall model. Like Twiggy. And I dated Twiggy one day and that was it. That girl was crazy. Very sensitive, overreactive. And that's the problem with skinny people. They don't have enough fats to bind with any kind of erratic poisons going on in their body. So she was the same way. Had a lot of health problems. But she got up to 207 pounds when she got up?

Q: 210.

A: 210? She got to be a pretty big girl, you know. 210. [unintelligible] But now she's been on the diet long enough. She's [unintelligible] and strong. She's a tennis player, you know?

Q: She's beautiful.

A: Yeah.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You have to get fat for a certain amount of time. It could [unintelligible] my medical profession where I can look slim with all the fat in my body. So, get fat, stay that way. I like people who get this size. It's safer. When I was in this shape, when I was on a cooked food diet, at this I was 145. So, everything gets very densely concentrated, very densely concentrated. Let me give you an example of how good fats are for you even if it's a bad fat. Every year, I go to Asheville, North Carolina, there's a group called Earth Haven. There's a new community, it's about 6-7 years old now, that actually started building a whole community that was vegetarian. We're talking up to 37-year-vegetarians. I've never seen such a group of unhealthy people in my life. And one of the fellows there that went on the diet, he was ultra skinny, about 5'11", 6 foot, [unintelligible] skinny. Huge black. I mean, he looked like a raccoon because he was so dark. [unintelligible] he was weak all the time. He found out about my diet over the internet, started doing it in the closet. [unintelligible] he's getting healthier and healthier. He's starting to put on weight. And all throughout the year, everybody says, oh my god, [unintelligible]. And then finally at the end of the year, they said, come on, you've got to share it with us. Anybody that gets this healthy in a year, when you could barely crawl a year ago, you've got to tell us. And he said, okay, you cannot kick me off this property, because I helped create it. He said, I'm on a high meat, dairy diet, and 90% of my diet and I don't eat any vegetables. And you don't eat vegetables because they're hard to digest. They over-alkalinise the system and neutralize the acid bacteria. You eat the vegetable juices that are important for your intestines, so it doesn't cause all that alkalinity in your digestive system. So, guess what happened a year after that? The whole place had changed. They had pigs, chickens, goats, cows, animal farming, everything. They invited me to go there. It was the third year there, and everybody started thriving. You have to understand how bad vegetarianism is. 50% of my cancer patients were long-term vegetarians. Take a look at Linda McCartney, Paul McCartney's wife. She threatened to divorce him many times and leave him if he didn't stop eating hamburgers and stuff like that. She said, I will never die of cancer because I'm a vegetarian. She died of a very aggressive, nasty breast cancer. It is a fallacy. It's a huge fallacy. Vegetarians do not have the proper kind of fats to protect them, nor the proteins to build themselves. It's a myth. It's a terrible, terrible myth.

So anyway, I'm in this group of all these hippies who look terrible. They're getting better, slowly. Their bodies are changing. Some of the younger ones, middle, some of the older people, their bodies are healthy and strong. And then this one guy comes in for a private consult, and he looks like he came right out of a motorcycle gang. His skin was probably 12 layers thick, hard, and rough. He's done enough alcohol and drugs to fill a battleship. So I shoot his eyes, and I'm expecting that he weighs about maybe 15, 25 pounds overweight, maximum. So I shoot his eyes, and I expect to see a terrible plethora of problems inside. He was so clean, it looks like he was, instead of being 53, 54 years old, it looks like he was maybe 30 years old when he was shot. And I said, I'm sorry, this doesn't make any sense to me. Either you were caught in a blizzard, you know, in Alaska, and you weathered it for a year, or you abused to alcohol and drugs for 25 years, for about 30 years. If this doesn't make any sense, you don't have that kind of damage, you're not that heavy. He said, four months ago, before he went on the diet, he was 300 pounds. Do you get it? Even the bad fat protects. Even the bad fat protects. So, be fat and happy. Skinny people are not easily happy. Most of them are easy to temper, they're easy to annoyance. They're not as, they're more selfish. Fatter is better. And let me tell you, I stayed this size for probably 20 years. 20 years. In 1977, I got that big and I stayed that big for as long as I could. I, boy, the mushrooms knocked that weight off me for a little while, but I gained it back. And then, probably in 1995, I started losing some of that and still have kept fat. So, it took me all those years to get to the point where the raw fat didn't make me look so large. But take a look at it, I'm 27% body fat. That's the difference. It will take you, if you have a cesarean in your life, it will take you longer to get to that point where the molecules look smaller. You'll have a lot more damage and toxicity in your system, but you just have to be patient. You'll be thin the rest of your life, even when you [unintelligible]. Pretty cool, isn't it? You'll be protected and strong. You can do like I do. I have probably an average of three and a half to four hours of sleep a day, and [unintelligible]. And stay alert. One time I slept one and a half hours a day for twenty-two days, ten minutes at a time. And I was suing the city of Los Angeles and the police department for hassling the runaways on the Venice Beach. They were out there trying to make a living as hair wrappers, you know, hair wraps and artists.

And the police were running them off the Venice Beach. So I hassled them, I got a few attorneys from law school to help, and I go to one of these guys. And I lived out on the beach for about five and a half years because I needed to get thousands of people on the diet to experiment. So I was a psychic nutritionist out there. To draw people in, to get them to do the diet, I would spend an hour with them, give them their diet. And I had thousands of people, probably about 10,000 people over a five and a half year period, to try the diet. So I got a large number because I only worked with hundreds, you know, in my explorations. So I needed to know how it affected a lot of people and a lot of different, you know, backgrounds and styles and life styles. So anyway, I was suing the city of Los Angeles because they were driving these runaways who were abused into prostitution and drug trafficking. Instead of their art that they wanted to make, so I got these attorneys from a couple of law schools to defend these people. And I go right up on an officer ticketing and I said, this officer is breaking the civil rights and [unintelligible]. Call this attorney and sue him. So after five years of that, the police got another cover man to push me into a fight and I wouldn't do it. I kept backing away from him. He kept hitting me, you know, in the face and in the throat. So I picked up a stick and I beat the shit out of him. And they put me in jail for, you know, and I had all these witnesses. So it was all staged and set up. I was the first non-attorney, plain person, who got the City of Los Angeles and Police Department into federal court. I did it all myself. I wrote legal documents this high. And I had, I was up there questioning officers. I had 22 officers and all the courts into that federal court room. It cost them millions of dollars and lots of sweat. And then when the jury went out, they switched the juror with a 10-year employee from the police department. And he shattered the verdict. But I won on a moral level, because they left the teenage runaways alone for an entire six years. And then as soon as the case was lost, they went out there and started hassling them again. And all during the trial, they said, oh, we help these kids. We help these kids. We love these kids. It was just a fricking lie. A lie. So anyway, I had to prepare for the case the next day. And I mean, you're talking about documents. You've got to have every document in the line, everything.

[audio cut]

A: A half a cup of food every hour. Never enough to satiate yourself, never full. So I ate one hour, maybe half a cup of meat the next hour. [unintelligible] And then the next hour, half a cup of milk. But every hour, I had something. And I told them in the courtroom that I had been diagnosed with diabetes, and the only way out was not insulin, but I had to eat every hour. And you're not allowed to eat in in the courtroom, guess who was allowed to eat in the courtroom? If I knew my civil rights, if they had taken my civil rights to eat as I needed to, for health reasons, I couldn't [unintelligible]. And I let the judge know. So I was able to eat all three meals a day. [unintelligible], you know, while you're cross-examining and stuff like that. But I only got to sleep an hour and a half a cup. By eating like that. So there's tremendous things that you can do when you've been on this diet a long time. [unintelligible]. When you're in that [unintelligible], temperature, temperature changes, wind, and sun every day, that's stress. I lived there for three years, that's stress. [unintelligible]. You do not know what stress is until you live outdoors. There are lots of different kinds of stress. Then you will know what stress is. Just a little anxiety is not stress. That's anxiety. Most of it is caused by food. Okay, so you have the meat meal in the morning. The meat meal makes sure that the body makes glycogen, which is brain fuel, nervous system fuel, from pyruvate, a protein sugar. That pyruvate mixes glucagon, and you have pyruvate, carbohydrates, I mean glycogen. And guess what? The advanced glycogen concentration, 7-8%, you can handle 12% a day. So no sugar overload. So your brain and nervous system fluid, and your blood, and your skin, and your intestines. Then, from there, like I said, if you have a mineral deficiency, which we all have, have one and a half to two tablespoons of cheese with some honey. And then, a couple of hours after that, two, three hours after that, you have milk in between, [unintelligible] gain a lot of weight. If you have problems digesting, you want to suck a lot of eggs. [unintelligible]. Okay, eggs. We can talk about the fat in the eggs. Eggs are the very, [unintelligible]. Eggs can digest in 16 to 23 minutes. It's completely important. Milk takes a minimum of 6 hours if you have a good digestive tract. You can have a bad digestive tract and still digest an egg in 45 minutes max. When people come to me with allergies for anything and everything, even water, I put them on an egg diet. 

They an egg every 40 to 45 minutes, every hour, and all of a sudden, all of these problems start going away. I had one woman that ate mainly eggs for a year and a half. Then I was able to start adding other foods. Little by little, but I had to add only two tablespoons or three tablespoons of butter at a time, and that time kept increasing. Six years later, when she [unintelligible] her husband, such an educated, he was a professor at a university, and he came and was coughing and wheezing. So that medical professor had been working on this for a year, and his system didn't work. So he had to work it in, and he was keeping his mouth shut for his wife. He loved her that much, and he kept his mouth shut. [unintelligible]. He wanted to get up and strangle me, and he couldn't do that, and he was listening to me. [unintelligible], because when I was a child, we got abused all the time. Everybody thought I was a wise-ass, so I got beaten up. So I learned very quickly that the first day of the year, school year, I picked the biggest guy in the school, no matter how old he was, and I beat the shit out of him. And I beat him bad, because I did just like animals do. I went for the throat, the eyes, and the ears, and the temple. And you go there, [unintelligible] your opponent, no matter how big they are. So that's what I did every year, so I didn't let anybody beat me up. So I never worried about beating the guy, unless it was a grand martial artist. I'd go sucker punching in the face. [unintelligible] Oh, God, I'm getting thirsty. Anyway, okay. So, hey, so this woman went on eggs. And she started improving. In two months, her whole system started improving. She started putting on weight. She started being able to function. [unintelligible]. Her husband is a full advocate of the diet. And this is a full professor. A very intelligent, evolved, calm, collective, smart man. [unintelligible]. You know, because it worked. He saw it work. Eggs were very important. I'll tell the story in the rest of the book about this woman who had advanced emphysema. She was supposed to die that weekend. Her doctor called me. Thanks for coming. Her doctor called me on a Thursday night and said, I've got an emphysemic patient. She was diagnosed seven years ago. She's been mainly on machines for two years and bedridden. She's going to die this weekend, is there anything I can do.

And I said, well you're calling me a little late. She said, you know, in the medical profession, you have to have, in the medical profession, only if medicine doesn't work for ten years you can do something else. [unintelligible]. So I said, the only thing I can suggest is you get ten to sixteen dozen eggs, put them at her bed table, and tell her to eat one as often as she can. So on Monday morning, I get a call. This was on a Friday night [unintelligible]. It was eleven o'clock for me, so it must have been one or two in the morning for her, because she's calling from Maine. And I get a call on Monday morning from this raspy voiced woman. She said, you know, I got off the machine. I'm out of bed for the first time. [unintelligible]. And what else can I do? And I said, well, who are you? And she said, oh, my doctor called me for me, the eggs. I ate 33 eggs a day over the weekend, 66, Monday morning. And now I'm off the machine and breathing. I'm out of bed. What else can I do? That's what eggs can do. It's protein. It's egg whites. It's immediately ingestible. So there's that fat in the egg yolk, and it doesn't take much time to digest it. Everything can be assimilated. The only bad thing about it is, and I suggest you not abuse it, is when you eat eggs alone, they cause weight loss. They cause weight loss. You suck eggs down [unintelligible]. I want everybody to be fat. [unintelligible]. Even cooked, they cause weight loss. If you use eggs with other foods, they help you gain weight. A little at a time. But if you eat eggs alone raw, they cause tremendous amount of weight loss. I can lose 20, if I eat nothing but eggs, and I can eat 50 a day, I will lose 10 pounds a week. I mean it. It just allows you to burn fat, I [unintelligible]. Quickly. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Cholesterol is a good thing. Cholesterol is a very good thing. It's all been a lie. The cholesterol myth, there's a book that I reference in the recipe book, and it's called the cholesterol myth. And it tells about the scientist who spent his whole life just studying cholesterol. He said without cholesterol, you would have no protection, you would have no lubrication, you would have no energy. There are 66 varieties of cholesterol. A third of them to protect yourself, a third of them to clean, a third of them to energize the body. And all of them are necessary. It was a sales tool, the nutrient commercial hit, that gets you to say, oh, fat's healthy. So they advertise something is healthy or unhealthy to get you to eat a certain substance. So all that cholesterol myth is discarded. The higher the cholesterol level, the better. I have one champion, a Hall of Fame basketball player. I'm not allowed to say his name because he's still in the closet about the meat. He has a 675, when he was playing, 675 cholesterol levels and nobody can outplay this guy. Nobody could outplay him. I've got an Olympic gymnast. She had to keep hers at 375. So forget those cholesterol levels. When I went and had my blood test at Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, my cholesterol was sky high. No hardening of the arteries, no problems. Healthiest [unintelligible], I forgot the doctor's name. He was a very famous, world-famous cardiologist, sports. [unintelligible] a lot of the famous sports people. That's how he heard about me. He was one of the sports people. Paul Cohen, who was... I don't know if you remember Paul Cohen from the fifties. In the early fifties he was a champion tennis player. And he came back and was a coach for 10 years. He's been on the diet 11 years. On the 12th year now. And he went on 100 percent. [unintelligible] And he told this doctor, this cardiologist about my system. And he said that I could push more weights with less stress and less stress on the whole body than people he knows that work out three to five times a week. Work out an hour to two hours a day. And here they just put me on it and I was working out really fine. With that much weight. So you have to understand, those cholesterols are important. They don't mean anything.

Anything the pharmacies or the medical community use as a tool of measurement, it is all a lie. 85% of people who are diagnosed diabetic because they have one or two tests that show [unintelligible] kidney level, and they may perform the glucose tolerance test [unintelligible].  That doesn't mean you're diabetic. It means you just need to be on the diet. 85% of the people who come to me taking insulin should never have been on insulin. 15% should never have continued on insulin. They've been on for a short period, been on a good diet. PSA [unintelligible] your prostate. Bullshit. [unintelligible]. No PSA. And I see people without PSA, a hundred. So it's absolute garbage. The pharmaceutical industry pays scientists to do something. If they don't do something that gets them favorable sales and products, the scientists don't work, the scientists don't get paid. So you can look at the, in the context of interest, when it comes to these scientists, they want to make a name for themselves, so they'll pull out something and say, oh, this is what it is, what it really is. It's a small picture, put it in a context that has nothing to do with reality. And cholesterol is one of them. So to forget cholesterol, as much cholesterol as you can get.

Q: [unintelligible] LDL?

A: [unintelligible] LDL. Just remember that when you're on a good diet, you're going to be throwing off a lot of toxic cholesterol from your body, discarding from your body. The toxic cholesterol in your blood is going to be toxic cholesterol leaving the body, which your body will never use. Just on its way out, through the blood. Not the normal passage, but the lymph system is so jammed with all the garbage we put in it, the blood is acting as a nurser and a detoxifier. It's not its job. That's why there's high cholesterol in the blood. So the LDL, you're going to have a high LDL. You want a high LDL or you're not detoxifying. I would still be as big as this gentleman right here. If I didn't get rid of that old fat. So I got rid of it. So now I've got all this new fat and I'm very small. As small as he is. And I'm fat as you are. Pretty interesting, isn't it? [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] Because I, at Washington Medical School in St. Louis, they put me in water to see my fat level. And my fat level at that time was 26 percent. And they looked at me and said, you don't look like 26 percent body fat. But I was. And on that scale, they took three quarters of a percent off. My scale said I was 27. They said I was 26. [unintelligible] They give you a good range of your fat level. And women should be around 30 percent. Minimum 30 percent. Men, you know, they say the athletes should be 7-13%  percent maximum. That's why they dry out and [unintelligible]. They dry out and thin themselves. You just become brittle inside. McEnroe, the tennis guy. He, he was so skinny, he worked out all the time. [unintelligible] You know, now he's a nice guy, he's smart, he's intelligent. That's the advice I give him. [unintelligible] But that's all changed now. The whole body is different. They're different. [unintelligible]. He's got a lot more, 24% body fat. And he is a happy guy. [unintelligible]. Forget about it. Highest cholesterol you want. [unintelligible] You're pretty good. You have a little bit more weight on your legs. But you're athletic.

Q: I am very athletic.

A: [unintelligible]. You're pretty good. [unintelligible].  Yeah, she can use that and be fine a while. You don't see her going off on you, do you? She goes off on you just a few minutes.

Q: I'm going to be great then.

[laughter]

A: [unintelligible]. Call her down. Fat? No way, no way. [unintelligible] Again, you've got to use a lot more muscle [unintelligible]. Okay, so you have to, then after 2-3 hours after the meat meal, you have a milkshake, [unintelligible], with milk, cream, honey, and the ratios are in the recipe book. Then 2-3 hours after that, another vegetable juice. 2-3 hours after that, you have a fruit meal. Finally, in the afternoon, you don't want it at night, you don't want it in the morning. In the morning, it will cause your nervous system to get sticky, and not work properly. You won't focus as well. [unintelligible] You have it in the afternoon. And you have it with fat always. Coconut cream, if you want to have the best cream. Let's say you have [unintelligible] multiple sclerosis, any kind of scar tissue in your body, and you want to start removing it. You get coconut cream and banana. If you want to get rid of heavy metals, the dark heavy metals, you use berries. Dark berries, like blueberries, blackberries, and boysenberries and coconut cream. If you want to get rid of iron, which is a heavy metal, that is light in color, especially when rusted, iodine, salt, you use raspberries and coconut cream. If you want to get rid of the combination of metals, you use both berries and coconut cream. So, in the book, you go through and see, in this book, it will tell you what you eat for your particular symptoms, what fruits, and this will tell you how to do the diet, and the ratios, and the mixtures, and the recipes. So, that's what foods you use in the afternoon and coconut cream. Anytime you use coconut cream, just remember, you're going to radically [unintelligible] the body. You will always need a protective fat with it. So, a small amount of butter, like a half to a whole tablespoon of butter, and a half to one-and-a-half tablespoons of dairy cream, along with the coconut cream. Never more than three ounces, unless you're as big as Joseph. He can handle four ounces at a time. But most people shouldn't handle over two to three ounces of coconut cream in the afternoon.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: For the day, no. That's just at that time of the day. One meal, three. You can always have a tablespoon of coconut cream in the middle of the day. You know, sometimes you have it before the juice, if you want to get rid of metals quickly, you have a tablespoon of coconut cream with the juice. [unintelligible]. One time you have to sit down, it's just too easy on you. That's first thing in the morning, and sometimes in the evening, between six and eight o'clock. [unintelligible]. Unless you're diabetic, have a severe high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, [unintelligible]. So [unintelligible] you just break it up into three meals instead of two. Normally, those people should have two meals.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I just said, you find that out in the book.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's processed and cooked, very processed. If it's in a pan, it's pulling out the metals. You just better believe it's pulling out the metals with your [unintelligible]. You're forcing yourself to do it. Remember, a coconut cream, large amounts should be no more than two ounces at a time. You have butter or cream with it. Two to three hours after that, another vegetable juice. Now this vegetable juice is tricky, because after that, your next meal meal is very slow digesting. Then you want to cut the ratios down [unintelligible]. [unintelligible]. Now this is a balanced diet. [unintelligible] And I prepare everything between my juice in the morning and my meat meal. I prepare all my food until dinner. All done 45 minutes. All prepared. Even my [unintelligible]. My meal kit. My afternoon fruit meal. Everything is prepared in 45 minutes. Shit, if I was in a restaurant for one meal, I could wait 45 minutes just for one frickin' meal. [unintelligible] And I made my whole meal for the day in 45 minutes. It may take you an hour. Hour and 15 minutes. Because you don't know how to do it and you're not used to it. So it's very simple and very easy. And if you take that fruit meal and you blend it all together. You don't have to sit down and eat it like you do with custard. Or you're blending the berries and the coconut cream. It'll turn into like a parfait because you [unintelligible]. And if you do that, you sit down and eat it like a jello. Jello, you know, stuff. But that's okay. You can sit down three times a day. And then you can eat it too. [unintelligible] Once in the morning, you can eat it. Once in the afternoon. But most people will be drinking it. In the afternoon. So you're not having to sit down and eat it. How many people drink coffee and cheese and soda pop and water? They're always sticking something in their face all day long. [unintelligible] Keep the questions down for the Q&A. And so it's very easy. It's very easy. So then, after that, the third vegetable juice, hour, hour and a half, two hours maximum, you have your second or third meat meal. Same as the first. Anybody who's anywhere from four [unintelligible] having a pound of meat a day. [unintelligible] And no matter what size you are, [unintelligible]. Particularly if you're under four, eleven, you [unintelligible]. It's going to be like eating about a cup, you know, twice a day. So I'll take two and a half cups at a time with me. So two cups a day, basically means about three quarters of a pound. Two and a half cups is about three quarters of a pound. Okay? So, again have butter with it so you don't burn it up. [unintelligible]. And then, right before you go to bed, it's sometimes [unintelligible]. You can leave it. That's fine. You can go to bed with a full stomach. On this diet, whenever you have all the enzymes and vitamins in it, there's no problem with digestion. 

Your liver doesn't have to leach enzymes and vitamins and minerals from every other cell in the body. So it's very little work for it to do. And it doesn't mind working while you're asleep. [unintelligible] There's very little on the raw food for it to do. There's very little for it to do. So people sleep better and are much healthier, and you can gain the weight. If this is your last meal, if you're 7 o'clock in the evening, you're at 6.30, then have a milkshake or a half of one, a cup of milk, half cup of warm milk with some honey. During the night, do not wait until the morning. You need to eat something, you need to eat something. If you normally get up early in the night, you have a half a cup of milk, [unintelligible]. It's in the recipe book, and I call it that. It's mixing butter, eggs, lemon juice, and honey together. It tastes like a lemon meringue, and that's what I suggest to people to eat with their meat meal instead of just having plain butter. [unintelligible] And the reason I like this moisturizing formula is, [unintelligible]. [unintelligible]. I don't know a woman who doesn't want to use a moisturizer. For her skin, not for the [unintelligible]. For most guys, it doesn't work. And men like lubrication. And the reason I like that combination is because, like an orphanage, you get your kids, and the kids closest to the foods get the most, but each kid in the back don't get much. That's the way it is in the human body. The organs and the glands will take all of your fat, because, again, [unintelligible]. So this lubrication formula, this Moisturizing Lubrication Formula [unintelligible] just help slow down, is by the lack of it. So rapidly, the brain and organs can't absorb all of it, but they can only absorb about a third of it. So two-thirds of it is actually consumed by the body. Remember that most of the toxins that leave your body, leave through your skin. [unintelligible]. You don't have damage to the skin yet, because the poisons are leaving it. The more bad things you do, the worse the skin gets. Because it's discharging out the skin. So the skin will usually be the last thing that [unintelligible]. That's the skin. [unintelligible]. But those aren't, those are rare people. Most people will have skin troubles, eruptions, thick skin, charred skin. [unintelligible]. I mean, you can't see my scars here everywhere. [unintelligible]. Even that cancer I talk about in the book, you took a third of my nose, took my sight from your side, and burned a hole in my forehead right here. You don't see my scar anymore. [unintelligible]. And last year I went through that. [unintelligible]. But my driver's license said that I had to wear glasses for driving.

[unintelligible]. So that eye got better. So the scar is just a small hole. [unintelligible]. So the body repairs itself. It's really one of the last things. That moisturizing lubrication formula gets out to your skin and your bones and [unintelligible] texture. And people usually love that thing. [unintelligible]. It's very, very important. [unintelligible] OK. Now I have two more things to cover. Water and salt. Back in the 50s, 40s and 50s, when I was a child, we [unintelligible]. And we liked to drink milk, you know, three glasses, four glasses a day. Never had water, except three sips a day. Then all of a sudden, in the 60s and mid-60s, we started bottling water. And then we were starting to take it. [unintelligible]. Water is very bad for you. Period. It is bad for you. If you look at an archaeological book, the first word under solvents is water. [unintelligible] So the plants can eat. [unintelligible] the toxins in the digestive tract. [unintelligible]. It causes dehydration. The more water you have, the more you want. The drier you get, the more water you take, the drier you get. If you put water on your arm, what would happen? It gets so dry, [unintelligible] off. If you put oil on it [unintelligible]. What's that? What happens? We are fat-deficient, we are not water-deficient. We are de-lipidated, we are not dehydrated. It sells water, it sells more food, because people become more malnourished by drinking water. If you want to know how much water we need to drink, look at these aborigines in the hot desert. Anybody see the rabbit-proof-fence? Rabbit-proof-fence is about these aborigines. [unintelligible]. And the British government in Australia decided that they should never be raised as primitive aborigines, so they took the children and left. [unintelligible]. They wouldn't let these children go back home. Three little girls ran away. The oldest one was like nine years old. Her little sister was like six years old. And I think there was some [unintelligible] there. And they all lived in the same village. So they all ran away together. And if you follow the rabbit-proof-fence, you can see [unintelligible]. [unintelligible] They ended up going almost 2,200 miles on foot, never drinking water. They broke plants off, ripped [unintelligible]. They dig up a root. They wring it. [unintelligible]. They know that if you drink water, you are dead in that desert. [unintelligible]. There's vegetable juice and milk. That's what you need. And if you have dry lips, as I said, most people, [unintelligible].  

So you have the honey and coconut cream you put on your lips. That protects you. [unintelligible] and the fat from the coconut cream are more easily absorbed. And the fat from the honey, they're more easily absorbed than any other vitamin and moisturizer. [unintelligible] I started using the honey and butter mixture, and then the honey and coconut cream mixture, and those are now down to about 10 percent. So I have a few little lines. I'm not as vain. [unintelligible]. So, water is not good. Water is a solvent. You're going to neutralize [unintelligible] nutrients in your body, tendons, cause all kinds of problems. Salt is another problem. Salt clumps. Salt molecules clump. Now, normally, when you have nutrients combining together, you have maybe about 6 or 7 calcium molecules, and all these other minerals you'll have in this balance. You've got phosphorus, you've got vitamins, you've got [unintelligible] you know, soluble fats, water soluble fats, fat soluble fats, oil soluble fats, water soluble fats, vitamins. You have these whole smorgasbords of nutrients. [unintelligible]. It's going along in the blood. And then this huge cell opens up with these two ions inside [unintelligible]. And that's the way it is. [unintelligible]. And it's cooked and isolated. You have different things clumping involved with it. Salt is one of the worst. Because it's four or five ions of sodium that's grouped together. [unintelligible] You have a vast variety of nutrients in a clump this big, such as this is. But with sodium, it goes into the body and locks on. [unintelligible] The molecules, you get five molecules this big. [unintelligible] And they're the smallest ones you can get. You get this huge clump. [unintelligible]. It's also a waste product now. Or else it can cause dead cells to collect in [unintelligible]. This salt is a very bad thing. [unintelligible]. Okay, now it's time to take our final break. We're going to get into, um, well, I was going to tell you, you might sign up for mini readings. Okay, well, let's just do a few and then we'll close up so some people can go home. We'll do a few and then we'll take a break.

Q: Okay.

A: And then we'll do the mini consults first.

Q: One question. You said about sour cream is better for those who have trouble digesting fat. Is that correct?

A: [unintelligible]

Q: Is that what you said about sour cream, that it's better than regular cream?

A: No, no. Dairy, you have, raw dairy never goes bad. [unintelligible] Now, [unintelligible]. It's just a natural bacteria in this milk doing its own digestion. [unintelligible]. We don't have a perfect environment anymore. [unintelligible] But it doesn't help you own bacteria. The bacteria relies on it. [unintelligible]. So, if you want to feed yourself with raw milk, well, [unintelligible]. It wants more fat and protein. That means bitter and tart. [unintelligible]. If you put a little honey in it, honey helps. [unintelligible], dairy really helps you [unintelligible]. [unintelligible]. It swallows it. But it's pre-digested. It adds an insulin-like substance, a variety of insulin-like substances, to the nectar, converting it into carbohydrates, and the enzyme, which is actually mainly protein, is secondary to fat. [unintelligible]. So, then the bee will bring it back to the hive and vomit. [unintelligible].  So, you put a little bit of honey, like two tablespoons of honey, per quart of milk. [unintelligible]. So, I'll take a little out, and I'll just pour it back into the bottle, shake it. [unintelligible].  I don't heat my house, so. [unintelligible] it's going to be 32 degrees outdoors, and it's about 32 in my house. So, I just use more clothes. So, I usually keep my milk in there. [unintelligible]. So, I just put it in a sink of hot water and heat it for about 6 hours. Not hot enough to burn my hands.  It will turn into kefir in 24 hours. Keep it out of the sun, because the sun causes the kefir to become more bitter. [unintelligible]. [unintelligible], but look at how healthy you were. [unintelligible]. In that particular country, [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, absolutely.
