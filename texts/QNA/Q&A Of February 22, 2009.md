A: I might talk about this finger.

[laughter]

A: I went through a detox with this. When I was three years old, my father brought a new push mower. I mean, it was the old push mower, no electric, I mean, no motor. And my two older brothers got to try it out after my father. And then the neighbor boy, I was next in line. It was my lawn mower, right? So the neighbor boy went over and he grabbed it to push it after one of my older brothers. So I put my hands right down in it and cut my finger off. So they grafted skin from here and put it on here. So a year after I started eating raw meat, the end of it, that graft fell off. It inflamed, turned red, got very bloody around there, and it just dropped off. And before that, before it dropped off, it turned as hard as rock. I could put my finger through glass. But after the graft fell off, then it was soft at its normal sensitivity and everything. But when they did that, when I cut it off, my mother wasn't home at the time. My father doesn't know anything about anything except his inventions. So he stuck my finger in a cold pan of water down, so of course it's going to bleed like crazy. So it bled and bled and bled. I lost a lot of blood. But when I got to the hospital finally, because he couldn't stop the bleeding, the young intern, you know, they're going to do something cool. They think their ideas are new and genius. So he took the tetanus shot and he injected me all around the cuticle and with a painkiller to do the grafting here. So about two months ago, well, December 28th, I think it was, December 24th or 28th, the finger started inflaming. And one doctor I know said, oh, you've got an ingrown fingernail. No ingrown fingernail. It was detoxing. You could smell the same odors of the tetanus shot and the anesthetic that was shot in. It was reeking. And it just inflamed. It got very big. It pussed finally out this side after about three weeks. And it warped. And you can see there's a hole in here. The body used so many minerals that it left the nail very small down here in between the cuticle and a little space out. So that'll take about six months to grow out. It was extremely painful. And, you know, I dipped my finger in some warm water, hot water sometimes, just to make it feel better so it wouldn't be so painful. And you can see it wasn't a hangnail, I mean an ingrown nail, because you go like this and you can see the nail. So, of course, the doctor's never going to admit that it was the tetanus shot and the anesthetic. They poo-poo anything like that. Because, of course, if we could prove it, we'd be able to sue them. We'd be able to sue them.

Hello there. We only have seating back there right now. Would somebody move this cooler off to where, off to under there, or back there somewhere? There we go. Terrific. So that was my latest heavy detox. A bit painful, but it's just now subsiding. No more pain at all. Just a little deformed nail, and that'll grow out probably within six months. It takes about six months to grow out a nail. However, that growth is in about three weeks. So I'd probably be able to do it in four months because I'm eating so much bone marrow. Bone marrow has stem cells. My hair is growing an inch and a half a month. As long as I'm eating a lot of bone marrow. I eat a package a day. So, you know, about half a dozen a day.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Pardon? No, I just eat a meat meal and then eat that after or eat a little bit while I'm eating the meat. Yeah, so if I have two meat meals, I'll break it up into two meat meals.

Q: Can't you freeze that? Is that the only thing you can freeze?

A: You'd have to flash freeze it. You can't freeze it.

Q: Erica told me that you could, you know?

A: I don't know who told her that. I didn't tell her that.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: I said that sperm, ovum, and anything with stem cells in it, if you flash freeze, it will hold up.

Q: So freezing it right...

A: Flash freezing means you freeze it within maybe 20 minutes. So you have to have a certain kind of process to do that. Because normally it will take 24, 36 hours to freeze in a freezer. It's a whole different situation. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Probably will do a slight bit of detoxing. But you have to remember, anytime you eat anything high, it is predigested. When you vomit, it stinks, right? It stinks like bile, it stinks like rotten meats, it stinks like all that. Because that's the process, bacteria digesting your food. When your food goes in, where's the first place it goes into the mouth? You've got 2,300 bacteria per 1,000,000 parts of saliva. That's a lot of bacteria. That's more than a dog and a cat has. We have more bacteria in our mouth than any other animal. So what does that tell you? That means that we need acidic foods that the bacteria feeds on, and that's meat and dairy. So when it goes down into the stomach, the hydrochloric acid breaks up food particles to make them into smaller molecules so the bacteria can feed on the food molecules. But almost all digestion is done by the bacteria, so their waste is our food. And if you look at that, we eat the urine and feces and sweat of bacteria. That's our food. When you think about it that way, you won't be so disgusted in the future when you think of bacteria as our main focus and our main digestive process. 

Q: Why is your finger doing this now, you've been doing this for a long time?

A: Well, I've had so many things. Chemotherapy with AZT. AZT is the most toxic chemo ever created, and it was outlawed a year after I had it. But they brought it out for AIDS patients. That's why 99% of them died. They had $200 million of AZT in the vaults. They needed to use it. So they used it on undesirables, mainly homosexuals who had AIDS. And they were given it in the hepatitis B vaccine. So it was just an annihilation. It was a process of bacterial warfare experimentation.

Q: Can I ask about the bone marrow one more time? One more thing about the bone marrow. Should you take it out of the bone immediately when you get it?

A: If you remove it from the bone and put it in a glass, it won't get as ripe. I've had it last two weeks. As long as I get the refrigerated, it's nice and clean and fresh.

Q: Okay, so because it gets hard and you can't get it out of the bone, that's why I'm asking that.

A: Right. I always leave mine out and take it out and put it in jars.

Q: Can you buy that anywhere else besides Rawesome?

A: Well, you can have it sent to you. He gets it from North Star Bison.

Q: There's bone marrow at Whole Foods.

A: That's not organic.

Q: Really?

A: Whole Foods is just a racket, Texas. It's owned by the Bass family, and I was with one of the Bass children back in the late 70s, and they are all just about money. They'll tell any lie they can just to make money. And they're into it for the money. They don't care a lick about... The daughter I went with did. In fact, she did the raw diet with me. But the rest is damned. They think it's all silly and ridiculous. But they'll make money on it. Okay, now I'm going to go around the room and answer questions. Everybody get your question ready.

Q: If somebody's thyroid got [unintelligible] for hypothyroid, can it be reversed?

A: She asked is it possible to reverse a toxic thyroid condition that was caused by chemical reaction. I've seen even the finger. You see, that's a good finger now. I can feel, it's sensitive. I can give the good finger. I can do all kinds of things with that finger now. So anything can be healed. But remember, the endocrine glands are all for emergency purposes. You're not supposed to have thyroxine. You're not supposed to have adrenaline in your blood if you're a healthy person. If you're eating a lot of crap and you're always making your body fatigued and tired and toxic, you're going to have a lot of hormones because you won't have any energy if you don't. So if you have a low thyroid, a low thyroxine, low adrenaline level, low testosterone, low estrogen, that doesn't mean you're deficient. Only if you have symptoms, like if you have adrenal fatigue, you won't be able to get off the couch. You won't be able to get out of bed. That's a sign you've got a problem. Then you can eat adrenal glands. They'll boost that to help you use the adrenaline until you get healthier. 

Q: They actually use the Iodine-131 to cure the thyroid.

A: You mean the radioactive isotope?

Q: Yeah.

A: I have seen anything come back. Even if it's by radiation, I've seen it restored. They gave me ten weeks of radiation therapy in the stomach all the way through to my back. It took a lot of time for my back to heal from that radiation therapy. Then it can still heal, it just takes more time. Radiation is probably one of the worst. And then chemo would be second worst. Do you have a question? Not yet?

Q: Is there any way to keep cheese from molding?

A: He wants to know if there's any way to keep cheese from molding. That's the process of cheese. If you get American cheese, that's not.... The process of making cheese is you take the dairy, you make it into curds and whey, you filter it out, you dry out your curds, and you put it in a cave. That's the way cheeses are made. Instead of putting lactobacillus, bulgaricus, calcoaceticus, acidophilus in the milk, you're introducing a mold to predigest it the same way the bacteria does. So that's the only way that you can use hard cheeses, that you can digest them, is if there's mold in them. Well, there's one way. You can eat a little bit of honey with your hard cheeses, and you'll be able to digest them, or you can pasteurize them. You make it from pasteurized milk. Of course, when that happens, the cheese is going to absorb toxins in the body and then redigest it, reabsorb those chemicals, those toxins, back into the body. When cheese is raw and unsalted, the body does not digest it. It uses it to attract toxins out of the neurological, lymphatic, and the bloodstream, as it passes even through the mouth, pulls it out of those systems all the way through until it leaves the body. If you eat honey directly with the cheese, then you will digest the cheese, and if there are any toxins in it, you'll reabsorb those toxins. So I say eat cheese with honey only twice a day, about 30 minutes after a meat meal. And that's to get your calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, all those good concentrated minerals, supplementation. But otherwise, the cheese won't be as digestible without having fungus or mold in it. If you don't want it to mold, don't refrigerate it. Molds grow in cold environments. So if you leave the cheese out to get warm, the mold won't grow.

Q: How long can you store cheese at room temperature?

A: Until it gets very cold in your house, and then the mold will start growing.

Q: [unintelligible] a year?

A: I don't know about that, I've had it up to six months in my experiment.

Q: [unintelligible] 80 degrees if it gets hot in the summer?

A: Oh, that even restricts it more from getting fungus, getting mold. It's tastier.

Q: Does it ever go bad?

A: Now, just remember, raw dairy never goes bad, it just turns into cheese.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: When you've got hairs, little fuzzy stuff all over the outside, those are mushrooms. Those are the spores. That can cause a heavy detoxification. So you scrape the outer stuff off.

Q: So if you wanted heavy detox you could eat it?

A: Yeah, absolutely. But you may get strong fatigue. You also may get diarrhea or vomiting. So if you're ready for it, do it. 

Q: Or if it doesn't bother you. I know people who have been eating the moldy cheese for ages, simply said. It never bothers me.

A: Well, look at the Germans, you know. I mean, they are very healthy with all that really raunchy, stinky, awful smelling cheese. And that's all from molds.

Q: So there's no harm in it really?

A: No. No, it's just going to be too much of a detox for some people. David, do you have a question?

Q: Yes, I do. I've had this really good egg supplier for like about five, six years. He gives me unwashed eggs that I buy from him by the case. He doesn't feed him any soy or anything, just corn. And he says he gives them worms also. But I had a problem last August. You know, I buy a case and usually I finish the case and a couple go bad.

A: Raw eggs don't go bad, they just go stinky.

Q: Well, it would go to become a rotten egg, the classic rotten egg. And I love classic rotten eggs. But in August, I was quite slow at eating my case of eggs, and something very strange started happening to these eggs. Instead of going bad, because it was in August, it was hot, they were in my kitchen, I don't have air conditioning in my place. But it's not direct sun or anything like that, it's sure it's hot, but instead of becoming a classic rotten egg, it would just break open and become this smelly brown...

A: Hard?

Q: No, no, smelly brown and full of maggots. And now I'm wondering whether I can still... I've still been buying eggs from this guy since August. Is there a problem with his eggs?

A: No. Anytime you crack a shell and you've got it warm enough, there are those little bitty fruit fly worms, fruit flies that will lay their larvae, and they can get into the cracks because they're very tiny, they're not like a regular fly. 

Q: But instead of going bad, all these eggs, dozens of them, start to turn into this stinky brown thing just full of maggots.

A: Good stuff.

Q: I could have eaten that?

A: Yeah, absolutely. A lot of that brown stuff is the maggots pre-digesting all that nutrients. Their waste is usually brown. There are some funguses in China when you have the century egg, it turns black inside and not brown. It's either white, brown, or black, depending upon which egg you're buying. And that's what it's from.

Q: That's a classic bad egg. But that stinky, smelly, completely brown.

A: Those are the maggots pre-digesting.

Q: They pre-digested the whole darn egg.

A: What do your bowel movements smell like?

Q: I don't smell them very often.

A: But I mean, you know, if you shit in the yard, what would it smell like? It smells like shit. It smells pretty foul. Well, that's the food that's most absorbable. Once the E. coli and bacteria have broken everything down, the body holds the fecal matter up in the sigmoid colon to absorb all that foul, stinky stuff, because that's reduced it to the molecules to feed the cells in the body.

Q: Would it have been healthy to eat that brown, smelly maggot-ridden stuff?

A: Yeah, with the maggots, too.

Q: With the maggots?

A: Absolutely.

Q: So I could have just thrown it in a jar and gotten around to eating one of these days?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Really?

A: Yep.

Q: So nothing wrong with my egg supplier then?

A: No.

Q: Okay.

A: That's normal in the summertime if the egg shell got cracked.

Q: How do I know they got cracked? It just sat there?

A: You won't know. You have to have a magnifying glass, a pretty powerful one, and see if the egg's got cracked. See, when it gets very hot, they're fragile, and all they have to do is just bump each other, and they'll put hairline cracks.

Q: Yeah, they seem to just, like, explode on their own.

A: And I do that. I'll do that. I'll take them in the hot summer, and I'll take a spoon and just tap them. And I can hear that crack go through it, and then I know I'm going to have some dark, stinky eggs.

Q: But sometimes I'd like to have a whole plate of these things, and they'd all go bad, the whole thing.

A: Well, that's a week of good, well, pre-digested egg.

Q: But there's a difference between a rotten egg and these smelly brown things. They're the same.

A: No, they're not the same, because you've got the parasites, I mean, the maggots eating one, and you've got fungus eating the other.

Q: Okay.

A: And bacteria and fungus.

Q: So, I know you've always talked about how we should get parasites in our body. Is this a good way to get parasites in our body?

A: That you can't get. That parasite is not an internal parasite.

Q: Okay, so that parasite, it's going to be digested by our bacteria.

A: It's like that tribe that lives on maggots. They hunt, they slice the meat very thinly, they lay it on a grill of twigs, and then the maggots come and lay their eggs, their larva, and it grows. And then they'll eat the maggots on the fifth day before they grow wings. And they get big, juicy maggots, and that's all they eat. And they can run 32, 35 miles an hour. Everything is liquid and finely digested when it's in a maggot. 

Q: So that's good stuff to eat.

A: Absolutely good stuff to eat.

Q: Do you detoxify from eggs like that?

A: Not usually. Some people, if they're getting ready to go into a detoxification, and you've predigested the food that thoroughly, you could create some kind of detoxification. But that doesn't mean that it would normally do that.

Q: But that stuff stunk so bad.

A: The things that will always cause detoxification is fermented fruit. And eating too much fruit, it turns into alcohol in the body. That causes detoxification.

Q: Does that apply to green fruit as well?

A: Even green fruit, if you're eating too much of it, it ferments.

Q: Is that why you get a stomach ache when you're a kid and eat too much fruit?

A: Yep. The body's trying to reject it. Jim, do you have a question?

Q: Yeah. It seems like when I wake up in the morning, I'm the sharpest that I am the whole day. And I kind of gradually deteriorate.

A: You don't.

Q: Yeah. And I get tired by five or so in the afternoon. I take a nap. I'm good for the night. But if somehow I don't get to nap or I don't get enough sleep or whatever, then I'm dangerous.

A: People should always take naps. Every other animal in the world takes naps. In Mexico, they have the siesta every day.

Q: Is there something dietary-wise that would keep you sharp throughout the day?

A: Well, if I want to do that, I suck on an egg, and I don't eat large meals. I'll eat no more than a half a cup of food at a time. And I've done that for 22 days, only sleeping an hour a day, ten minutes at a time. Hour and a half a day, ten minutes at a time. And then when I went back to sleeping, you know, I didn't sleep more than my normal five hours. But you just have to keep the body hungry enough not to get lazy and tired. So you feed it half a cup at a time. Well, you could probably do three quarters of a cup, you're a larger person. But it's better to take a nap. Ninety percent of healing happens in the sleep state. Most people need a nap. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible] during the day?

Q: If what?

Q: Would that not interfere with your night sleep?

A: No, not unless you're sleeping three, four hours. Nap, and then at night you won't sleep as much.

Q: What's a nap time? How much time?

A: 10-60 minutes. If you're really exhausted, you've been through heavy detoxification, a couple of hours might be necessary. And still get your eight hours at night. But again, never sleep, never go five hours without eating. Because the protein level bottoms out. You remember that.

Q: Does that five hours count juice? Do you have juice?

A: Five hours from the juice? This is fine.

Q: So I should eat eggs as a little between meal?

A: Yeah, you could eat an egg every 30 minutes to keep your brain power going, to remain sharp. Do you have a question? I didn't ask you because you were chewing away. Steve, do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, you know, I've got these spots around my eyes, and I thought that was just from being in the sun. But I remember you saying something that they were like liver cells or something like that that might make them grow. I can't remember exactly what you're talking about.

A: He asked about what they call liver spots around his eyes. A lot of us get them after the age of usually 45 and then after the age of 45. Because the body throws off glandular cells that can no longer function as a glandular cell, but still can be used as a skin cell. And they'll usually clump together because they like each other. They're of the similar species of cells. So they clump together, and then you have what they call sun spots or liver spots. So it's really, you know, it's a matter of the cells. The liver cells are pancreatic or spleen. What happens is, or gonads, whatever, those cells are no longer producing hormones. They're not dead, and the body says, let's put you where you can do, you know, some good, but since you're not functioning as a gland, get the hell out. And then so the body can reproduce cells, that will actually produce glandular activity. And the liver has to make a lot of bile to handle fats. It has to make 60 varieties of bile. And most people are lucky if they make 15, 20 varieties. So if your body, as your body gets healthier, or as the body gets sicker, for most people, the liver starts throwing off its cells. The pancreas does too, and the pancreas is very dark cells. And they create those skin spots.

Q: What can do you do to get rid of them?

A: You can put vinegar on them, it will usually bleach them out. Vinegar and then coconut cream.

Q: Okay.

A: It will usually bleach them out. Yeah. It usually won't get rid of them completely because those cells, what you are is bleaching them when you put the vinegar on. But you're not really changing the structure of the cell. That cell is a dark cell. It's like taking a very tan, dark person and keeping them out of the sun and putting vinegar on their skin or some kind of bleaching compound. But as soon as they hit that sun, they'll be dark again.

Q: So is it a problem or it just doesn't matter?

A: It doesn't matter at all. It's just you've got a pattern. You're colorful. You're interesting.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, if you heal the liver, you still may be throwing off live liver cells that don't produce bile. So that could be a 40-year process. Probably after the 40 years it wouldn't happen again, but I don't know. I've got 14 more years to go to finish my 40 years. Do you have a question?

Q: Okay, this is sort of Blaine's question. Her particular diet. You know she doesn't like eating protein. You said she was not absorbing it this last time.

A: Well, I said she wasn't healing.

Q: Healing.

A: Because she wasn't eating the protein. She was cleansing, but not healing.

Q: This one she asked me to ask you, what she does, she puts on ginger juice. I juice the ginger. We make a no-salt mustard. And honey. Now is that changing all that stuff to cleansing instead of healing?

A: No.

Q: So it's okay.

A: Yeah. Well, it depends on how much she uses.

Q: She hates that meat. She puts honey. And I go through four gallons of honey a month.

Q: Wow.

Q: We buy it by the four-gallon case. And I go through one every four to six weeks. And that's mostly her. I mean, she loves that stuff. She can't stand to go without it.

[laughter]

A: Can we clear that off so they can sit? Because there's room over there to sit. Can you put some of the stuff on top of that cooler?

Q: Can you sit on the cooler?

A: Well, it might be cold on the butt. Vinegar, you shouldn't have much vinegar with red meat. You can have vinegar with fish or poultry, as long as it's not too much.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Absolutely. Hyperactive woman will do...

Q: [unintelligible]. I'm bored!

A: Well give her something to do.

Q: Yeah right, I work for a living these days. She's too tired right now.

A: She has to find something to do. Or a hobby. Paint, golf, who knows what. You need a new dog? Yeah, there's a golden retriever that never has had shots, and somebody's moving and they want a home for it.

Q: I don't think she wants a big dog.

A: That's a big dog, yeah. Okay, I've got to move on. Do you have a question? Do you have a question, Mike?

Q: Yeah, I have a [unintelligible] in my back [unintelligible].

A: Papaya helps clean the back, helps clean it. Pineapple helps rebuild vertebrae and cartilage and any bone. So if you want to clean the back, just remember any time you have pain, you have toxins stored somewhere. So you really want to clean a little bit first and then rebuild. So you can do a couple of days of custard and a couple of days with coconut cream and pineapple with a little bit of dairy cream. And just keep doing that every week, you know, four days with that routine for the back.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: As long as you heat your – if you have damaged vertebrae, you want to make sure that your back is relaxed and all the muscles are stretched first, that they're warm and relaxed. That means either getting into a bathtub for 20, 30 minutes before you do stretching or put a hot water bottle back there and let it heat for about 10, 15 minutes. And then you do your stretching. And when I had the back trouble after the radiation therapy, I was in such severe pain that I couldn't move the lower part of my body. I crawled on the floor with my elbows and dragged the lower part of my body. It was that painful. Then when I learned that I could sleep, and I was only able to sleep 10 minutes at a time, I'd wake with excruciating pain after every 10 minutes. I lived like that for a year, suicidal as hell because I couldn't sleep. It was very painful. So I took baths. I learned that if I got into a bath and I couldn't get out of the bath, and I just kind of had to keep warming it, then I realized that I was becoming buoyant in the water. So it took all that pressure off my back. So it alleviated almost 80% of the back pain. And then when I got out, I did yoga stretches. I'd do the spinal twist on both sides and do the plow. Everybody know what the plow is? It's when you lie on your back, you raise your legs and your buttock, and you're back in the air. And then you either put your knees to your ears or your toes out on the floor behind your head. So you're like, this is your head, and this is your shoulders, like this. And you've got your back going up like this, and your arms over, and your feet down here, so it's over your head like that.

Q: How is that on your neck?

A: It stretches it wonderfully, because you have vertebraes here, too. Because a lot of people can be very tense in their neck, and it causes the whole back to tense. And if your back tenses, what happens, the vertebraes shift, and they'll pinch the nerves, and that's what causes all that bone pain. It can also cause the wearing of the cartilage. So you want to keep those stretched and relaxed. Okay? Do you have a question? 

Q: If I get bit by a rattlesnake, what's the best thing?

A: Well...

Q: What was the question?

A: He says if you get bit by a rattlesnake, what's the best course of action? Take a gun?

[laughter]

A: Well, when I was bit by a rattlesnake, I didn't do anything. I just left it alone. But he didn't stay in me. He didn't put much venom in me. But the American Indians, they would pack it with mud. They would cut it open, pack it with mud. What they normally do in our hospitals is if they don't have a venom antigen, they use hydrochloric acid. Now, I got bitten by a scorpion, and I was getting pretty sick from it when I was a fruitarian. So I went to a health food store and got some HCL, some hydrochloric acid. And I mixed it, and it was causing me to swell. It looked like I had elephantiasis. My balls were this big. My penis was this big. Everything hurt. I mean, my legs were out to here, and it was going on and on. It didn't go away. So I went to the health food store and got some hydrochloric acid. Then I went to a hospital, and I stole a hypodermic. I took a mixture of fresh grapes, squeezed the juice out of them, because the grape juice is almost as refined as glucose water. So it's almost exactly as it occurs in the blood if you don't get any particles in it. So I had filtered it and sifted it through many, many layers of cloth, so I'd have all the particles out of it. I mixed a tiny bit of the hydrochloric acid with it and then injected it into my thigh, and it was gone in about 12 hours. And I had been suffering a lot, about a week from it. So I thought maybe it was filaria, which are the parasites from mosquitoes, but they are so finite and small they can't cause that kind of swelling, even though they blame elephantiasis on mosquito filaria. Again, I think that's another myth of the medical profession, where people usually get elephantiasis in Africa in those tropical climates. They've got the yellow fever vaccine, some kind of vaccine, and they're reacting to that, or the malaria drug. Of course, the medical environment is always going to blame something in nature, so they don't get the blame for it. And so you'll be afraid of nature, and you'll keep making the same mistakes and get worse and worse, and have to go for their help all the time. It's a sad reality, if that's the way it works.

Q: What would be the ratio of hydrochloric acid to grape juice?

A: Well, I just did it as a matter of instinct. I probably used the hydrochloric acid tablets that I got were 50 milligrams, and I probably used about a fiftieth of one to two tablespoons of the grape juice. But it's better if you just take the hydrochloric acid. I didn't realize it, but the body, I learned from the Indians, that the poisons dump into the stomach no matter what kind of venom it is. So the venom goes to the stomach, especially if you have dairy. Dairy will draw to the stomach. The Indians taught me that. So if you just drink milk, cheese, it will draw to the stomach, absorb it. Hydrochloric acid will dump from your stomach. But remember, I had no hydrochloric acid in my stomach because of the surgery. So I didn't have that option. So I took the tablet. And I injected it. I didn't have to do that. I could have just taken it. Because the poisons still dump into my stomach. I just don't have the hydrochloric acid there. I have a small intestine for that. Another thing you can do is, I've had other people who were bitten by black widows and scorpions right here in Malibu Mountains. And I suggest that they chew some corn, put it on the wound, and also eat corn and drink some beet juice. Both of them have hydrochloric acid precursors. Those are the two foods that help you generate a lot of hydrochloric acid.

Q: If you had just two foods during pregnancy, what would they be? And are there any foods that are normally on the diet that become counter-indicative?

A: She asked, what are two good foods during pregnancy, and are there any foods on the diet that are counter-indicative for pregnancy? Now, the medical profession will tell you, don't eat any raw meat. That's so your baby can be stupid. All the children that were born on this diet with the mothers eating raw meat are very advanced children. One of them, when he turned five, he entered the fourth grade. I've got a 19-year-old that graduated from Yale two years ago. All these children are very, very bright unless the mother smokes. If the mother smokes during pregnancy, even if she's smoking a few years before, the child is not as smart. Because those tars get in there and start blocking neurological transmission. So no, there's no... Usually for women who are pregnant, it depends upon the toxicity in the mother. If she has a lot of toxicity in the body, you want to eat a lot of cheese often so you don't go into morning sickness. Morning sickness is the body detoxing very toxic substances that dump into the stomach. Vomit, vomit, vomit, because the body does not, or the baby, the placenta does not want those poisons going into the baby. So the mother has to vomit and vomit and vomit. So if she's eating cheese regularly, like a little piece every hour, it will help keep the baby strong. Now the American Indians that would eat cooked foods, some cooked foods, the gestating mother would always take a little bit of clay every day, moist clay right from the bed, right from the river, so it was already full of bacteria, not dry clay. And take a teaspoon to a tablespoon, depending upon the size of the woman. So those are two that will help protect the baby. As far as feeding the baby and making it strong, eggs and meat, of course. And it depends on what type of baby you want. If you're a high-athletic person, you'll probably want a high-athletic baby, or else you'd get frustrated with a baby like me who just laid around because I had no activity rings. And my parents were very active people, so I was always a big frustration for them because they had to drag me, motivate me, not in a nice way, to be fast and hurry up and hurry. If you want a child that's more active, eat more red meat. Not a lot, but let's say 50% maximum if you want an athletic child. If you want a brainy child, stay away from red meat. It depends on your energy level. You can see those kids that drive parents mad because they've got too much energy. They can be very taxing and wearing and driving you crazy and end up punishing the child a lot. So I would say never over 50-50. Half red meat, half chicken or poultry and seafood. And let's say minimum of red meat, two meat meals a week. Two red meat meals a week, beef, lamb, buffalo, venison, whatever. About two of those a week minimum. And that way the placenta will be strong. Because the placenta acts as the baby's liver until it's born. Okay, do you have a question?

Q: Sometimes there are different conditions that require conflicting things. For instance, in my case, I need to build potassium, build the bones from the osteoporosis and everything. But I keep detoxing, especially recently, with a lot of, you know, it's actually cold and all that stuff. So I'm eating a lot of the apple cider vinegar. And that's contraindicated for the osteoporosis. So how do you kind of balance that situation and all that? I mean, we've sort of talked about this before, but I just want to make sure that I'm...

A: You just have to do it cleverly. You have to make sure that you're not having more than... If you get any kind of gum sensitivity, you're having too much vinegar going the wrong way. Then that should be your... That is a good key to watch. If your gums get sensitive, your gums are bleeding, it means you're having too much vinegar, and you're eating something that will cause a breakdown in the calcium in the body. If you are going through a detox, though, from the brain, and you're throwing out heavy metals, that's still... You don't want a lot of vinegar in a period like that.

Q: Oh, but when you're looking at all that stuff about the sinuses and the... with all the vinegar juice in the morning, the vinegar and lemon and...

A: Yeah, but I'm talking about if you're bleeding heavily.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: Out the gums.

Q: Okay, but if I'm not bleeding in the gums, then I would do that vinegar and lemon.

A: Yes, that's fine.

Q: Does that mean canker sores, too?

Q: And you can do it for as many days as you want. One time it's only, like, three or four days, and I end up, like, going a week, if it doesn't matter.

A: Usually two weeks is the maximum you can do that. And then you're going to start decalcifying, demineralizing the body.

Q: And then I can go back to the little bit of ACV in the juice. And I've started the clay again, you know, in the morning. [unintelligible]

A: You're doing fine. It sounds like you're doing fine.

Q: Okay. I just, I'm so nervous about that. I'm getting my bone density test, by the way, in a couple of weeks. I'm curious.

A: How long has it been since you've done the program?

Q: Program? Two and a half years, I think.

A: Then you should have some results.

Q: [unintelligible], and they only did it for two years. So I'm about to do another one.

A: How are you doing your bone density test? Are you getting an X-ray?

Q: It's, I don't think it is. I think it's got other things.

Q: Ultrasound.

A: Usually, ultrasound doesn't give you a good bone registration. UCLA does it in water. It's a very accurate one in water. It's ultrasound in water. That's very accurate.

Q: Typical bone density.

A: It's either X-ray or, you know.

Q: But they say bone density is not an X-ray, because they can't use X-ray to get bone density.

A: Oh, yes, they can. They do it all the time. That's mainly what they do.

Q: Well, then it's not a bone density test.

A: Dennis, you had an X-ray for your bone density too, didn't you?

Q: Yes, I did.

A: Absolutely. At Washington Medical Center, Medical University in St. Louis. I refuse to do it that way. I won't get an X-ray. Oh, you have a question? Let me go around first. Let me go around. Jill, do you have a question?

Q: Talk to us about skin wrinkles.

A: Well, I talked about that also in my newsletter. Bone marrow helps get rid of wrinkles very well. Sperm and ovum. Those are your best bets for it. Primal facial body care cream is also helpful. But what has worked the most for most people that I've seen, the quickest, is bone marrow. The oily bone marrow.

Q: Apply it on the face, you mean?

A: Yeah. Especially rub it in gently to the wrinkled areas. Anybody know Erica at the Rawesome?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay. Erica was one of those people who had never gained in that weight that I wanted. To get rid of her dry skin. She was excessively dry. Lots of wrinkles, lots of dry skin. She did enough to her whole body, lubricated, but never her face. Remember that the most toxins you have, metallic toxins, are in the brain. So when they leave out the mouth, the gums, the tongue, and the salivary glands, it pulls all the fat out of the face. That's why all tribes, all people, wrinkle in the face first. It's all the contaminants in the brain that dump out the mouth. So eating enough, usually to keep the skin from wrinkling and re-lipidizing the skin in the face, usually takes a tremendous amount of weight, 25 pounds overweight to do that. So I started experimenting with bone marrow, so she agreed to do it. And within two and a half months of putting the bone marrow on her face a couple of times a week, 80% of the wrinkles went away, 80% of the dryness. And she had been, I would say, anywhere from, let's say, 70% on the diet for about six years. As soon as she started doing that bone marrow on her face, big difference, huge difference. She brags about doing it.

Q: So it's good?

A: Yeah, very good. Best she ever had. Because you'd always see that dry, wrinkled, you know, crinkled face. And the rest of the body was pretty good. Now, that's taken care of.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, she does it probably three days a week. You can do it every day. You know, if you have the bone marrow.

Q: How fast does that absorb [unintelligible]?

A: It depends upon the skin. If I put it on, if I put it on thickly, it may take hours. Five, six hours to absorb. If I put it on thinly, it will be absorbed in about 20, 30 minutes. Especially if I rub it in gently. Okay, John, you had a question.

Q: Yeah. Sometimes I'll get achiness in my teeth. One thing I noticed is if I drink coconut water, it goes away. So I had a couple of questions. Is there something else that will also help with that? I'm assuming minerals. I'm getting more minerals. And then the other thing, can you talk about coconut water at all?

A: Well, coconut water is water. Of course, there are more minerals in it than your normal well water. And of course, many more minerals than rain water. Rain water is mainly distilled water with tons of bacteria in it. When it rains, it dissolves rock, and then the minerals are freed up from that, and it feeds plants. That's how plants eat. So all water, even coconut water, is a solvent. But you've been around a lot of chemicals in your experimentation. You need some solvent to free up some of those minerals, so they're not all using up all of your food minerals. So you can do it that way. You could also start eating little amounts of cheese all day long.

Q: With honey?

A: No.

Q: For the minerals?

A: No, no, no. So you're using the cheese without honey to absorb the toxins, so you're reserving the minerals in your food to feed yourself. So that's how that works. Anybody who's been subjected to a lot of chemicals and a lot of toxins needs a little water. I drink at most, this week I had less than three ounces of water all week. In the summertime I'll have up to a half a cup a week or a half a cup a day. I'll need more solvents at that time. I need more of that to dissolve these compounds. You've been exposed to a lot. The further I get away from my chemotherapy, the more that leaves my body, the less water I need. So look at it that way. So water is helpful for you. And, of course, the cleaner water, other than rainwater, is coconut water. However, in Asia, men will drink up to two cups of it a day only. Women will only drink a half to a whole cup because it causes bloating. It causes bloating. That means you're not absorbing that water into the cell. You need a whole balance of nutrients to carry the H2O into the cell for the cell to be able to hydrate itself and be able to use that water properly. Otherwise, it's going to dehydrate the cell. The more water you drink, the drier you're going to get. That's why people who drink are drinking... The more they drink, the more they drink. It's endless. It's a rat trap. The water companies love it. Good money for them. Ebrahim, do you have a question? Chris, do you have a question?

Q: I do, actually. My father had a three-hour surgery yesterday in Boston. That was his choice. I want to get him some kind of dietary advice, some kind of plan to follow. [unintelligible]

A: Well, will he do it?

Q: I think so. I think this might have been a [unintelligible] for him.

A: Well, probably the best thing for him to have would be liver. Liver shakes. So half liver, half milk, tiny bit of honey. And what I do is when I'm making those shakes, I take the liver, I'll cut it into little cubes, put it into the food processor and make a pate of it. Then I'll put half milk into that, put it in the blender and blend that. That way I don't get too many of those sinuous fibers around the blade. That's to help him heal and get through everything. And a lot of eggs, at least nine eggs a day. To recover from all the anesthetic and other chemicals he's taking. He shouldn't be taking an antibiotic. It will destroy his digestion. So if he wants an antibiotic substitute, three tablespoons of lime juice, two tablespoons of lemon juice, and a teaspoon... Three tablespoons of lime juice, one tablespoon of lemon juice, one tablespoon of honey. Mix that together and add it to about two and a half ounces of sparkling mineral water. And you pour that mixture into the water, not vice versa. It's going to foam up a little bit. And you can have that once a day, you know, for maybe ten, twelve days. 

Q: And what about cheese?

A: Cheese will help absorb poisons, absolutely. But it should be pretty simple, because he's not going to digest well, because he's had a lot of antibiotics, probably intravenously, too. So, the liver shakes, milk shakes, eggs, cheese...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Pardon? Yeah, but he had a surgery. Not a good idea. That'll cause detoxification deeper than what his body's already dealing with. Yeah, that's for later. Maybe after about six weeks, four or six weeks. Do you have a question?

Q: My question was about mattresses. Which ones do you sleep on? And what are the effects?

A: We’re talking about matricides, people who kill their mothers. He’s talking about mattresses, to sleep on. Just wanted to see if everybody’s awake.

Q: Do you have a regular, like, polyurethane mattress? Is there any [unintelligible]

A: Absolutely. Any mattress that is made of polyurethane, any kind of plastic, outgases from your body heat. The PCBs, the phenol chlorides, actually outgas. 

Q: Does it matter how old it is?

A: As long as you're not affected by molds. If you are, just make sure that you have, like, a down or down and feather bed. You know, a thin coating on top of that that will absorb the moisture so it doesn't get in and doesn't cause molds in the mattress. 

Q: What kind of mattress are you recommending?

A: I have mine made by a futon company. So what I do is, they never, you know, in California, you have to have a fire retardant unless you have a doctor's note. So I got a doctor's note. So I took it to the futon company and also took them organic cotton fabric, upholstery fabric. It takes three and a half yards to do an eight inch thick, 10% wool, 90% organic cotton futon. And they mix it together and with that 10% wool mixed in there, it will stay softer. And mine, I have two of them. One's about 15 years old and one's 10 years old and they still have all of their bounce.

Q: You have a spring underneath?

A: I don't have a spring because that's metal. When I have metal and I use a spring, box spring, I hear radio sounds in my sleep. I'm very sensitive to that and usually it's a talk show that I hear. 

Q: Once you're on it?

A: Yes. So what I have is my box spring. It's not a box spring. It is a true rubber latex mattress that's made not too hard and not too soft. Those are the most expensive things to have made. It probably cost me about $1,200 to have the box spring made. You can get a futon if you provide them with a cover and ask them to make it. I had it made for $450 plus I paid for the material. That was another $100 to get organic, upholstery, very fine flannel, cotton, organic material. So it cost me about $500 and something. That was so many years ago it probably cost you $1,000 to do it now. But a lot of these places that are selling things that aren't even as good as that are selling them for $2,200, $2,300 for organic cotton wool interiors of these mattresses. So it's a lot. It's better to go to a futon company and say, listen, like mine were made in San Francisco and shipped down here. But I found a company, a futon company on [unintelligible] Boulevard that made them. It's called the Futon Company. So it's molds... That is the problem. If you want to get rid of the mold, if you get mold in there, you have to take it out and let it beat it in the sun. Let the sun break it down, and then vacuum it. Vacuum it four or five times. And then make sure, again, you have a feather blanket on top of that to absorb a lot of moisture. And, of course, your sheets will be over that. You need something so your mattress doesn't get wet.

Q: Would it be okay to [unintelligible] mattress if you do that?

A: Not really. You're still going to outgas because there's going to be a temperature level on you that's probably about 100 degrees when you're sleeping, 99 to 100 degrees. It's going to cause outgassing. If you do a lot of layers, let's say you put maybe a few inches or a few inch, three inch cotton futon on top of that with a cotton cover, then like a three inch futon cover or some kind of yoga mat that's all cotton and that thick. If it were that thick and you put that on top of your plastic mattress, that would probably be okay.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Those all have half polyester and at least half polyester. Most of them, all cheap ones were all polyester. And a lot of them will use polyester fill, not all cotton fill. Then you want organic too, you know, for the best quality. Do you have a question Lewis?

Q: You answered it, I believe, I've got [unintelligible] cotton futon on top of my mattress, so that's already covered up.

A: Well, if you have springs in there, metal springs.

Q: A wooden bench, wooden slats are okay.

A: Wooden slats are fine, just a little harder. Okay.

Q: Because of the cancer, I noticed that my gums, as soon as I had cancer, that my gums were in pretty puffy and bad shape. I've been using, of course, the same toothpaste that you recommend, which is the clay, the coconut cream and the...

Q: Vinegar.

Q: Vinegar. Right. So I've been using that and flossing and water picking. Not too often, though, because it's a lot of wear and tear. Maybe even once or twice a week, something like that. But I noticed that over the last few years, you know, I've been recovering, obviously, but it looks like some of my teeth on the inside are maybe a little brown, indicating maybe possible wear of the enamel, exposing dentine. Is that possible? Is it correct? What should I do about it?

A: Well, anybody with cancer has a tremendous amount of metals in their body, in their brain, usually, and it's dumping out the teeth, and it will turn the teeth. Even though you're not losing the dentine, it will still turn them colored.

Q: So you mean I could still have the enamel in my mouth?

A: Still have the enamel, the dentine, and still cause them to be brown or gray. A lot of people who take cocaine or crack cocaine or set up crystal meth, there's so many metals in those compounds that it turns the teeth gray. It's like 50% of the people who take those drugs have gray or brown teeth, or gray enamel.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: All the other drugs, vaccines, everything else.

Q: So in other words, my teeth could still be in good shape?

A: Absolutely, because your teeth look pretty good to me. Just remember that the most acids you put out are in the lower mandible and the back of the front teeth.

Q: Yeah, that's exactly where those things are.

A: Yeah, most of the acids and most of the toxins dump there.

Q: So you mean when the cancer cures, then what should happen is that...

A: Well, it's not cancer cure, that's getting rid of heavy metals. Your whole life, could take 40 years before your teeth get further. You may get rid of cancer in two to four years.

Q: Yeah, okay, gotcha. So it doesn't mean I'm losing enamel, in other words?

A: No. You could be from the toxins, but it wouldn't be from the vinegar.

Q: Okay.

A: You'd have to brush your teeth with a lot of vinegar every day to cause that problem.

Q: I have two points. One point is that I've been waking up at 2 in the morning since November and staying wide awake until about 6, 6.30 in the morning, and then I get sleepy, and then I want to go to sleep, and then I have to wake up again. So I'm wide awake for hours. I'm detoxing, right?

A: She's not sleeping through the night, not sleeping a lot, and what happens is the nervous system always begins detoxification as soon as the sun goes down. By midnight, it's full on, and it'll go to 5 o'clock in the morning. So there's a lot of people who can't sleep between the hours of like 2 o'clock, 1.30, 2 o'clock in the morning to 5 o'clock. If you try to sleep and there's no way your body's going to let you because it needs to stay up and awake during that kind of a detoxification, you're just going to be frustrated and angry. So do something. Get up and read. Do something. Be productive in that time. And then go back to sleep at like 5.15, 5.30 in the morning for an hour, an hour and a half before you have to go to work. And go to sleep about 8 o'clock. You know, maybe get up at midnight, you know, or 1 o'clock in the morning or 2 o'clock. Then do your productive time again. Take a nap in the morning.

Q: I also found out recently that I have had a vintage stove that my landlord moved into my place. I found out recently it's been leaking gas. I have had gas leaks. I've been breathing in gas for 12 years.

A: Do you cook? Do you use it?

Q: No, but I have it.

A: Yeah, but see, I turn the...

Q: It's off, but you know.

A: If you've got a gas stove and you're not cooking, you cut that thing off right at the side outside the house or the apartment. There's no gas in my house. That stuff leaks too easily. You know, even a little bit.

Q: Is there anything that you can do to detox it [unintelligible]?

A: Well, vinegar helps break down those gases. Clay helps break down those gases in your body.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I put in warm water. Well, there is gas on my water heater, but that's in a pump room outside of my house. As long as you have that water heater room ventilated, if there's even a slight leak, it's not going to get into the house. Alright. You said that I answered your question.

Q: On another...

A: Don't tell me that, just give me your question.

Q: Yes. I think you deliberately...

A: You said [unintelligible] and said you answered my question. Okay, go ahead.

Q: Yes, where I'm at in my mental state and all, what are the proportions of meat, red versus white, do you recommend that I should have in my daily routine?

A: Well, you've got a lot of activity rings in your eyes, so I'd say very little red meat.

Q: Okay.

A: Very little red meat. Maybe two meat meals a week. In fact, for you, I don't even suggest you have a whole red meat meal, but you have half poultry or seafood with half red meat. You could do that as many as four meat meals a week. So, but they're only half red meat.

Q: Right. I got it. Okay.

A: Okay.

Q: Four meals a week. Okay.

A: The rest, poultry and seafood.

Q: Okay. Thank you.

A: Okay. I'm sorry, I don't know your name?

Q: Meredith.

A: Meredith. Hi, Meredith. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes. First one is regarding hyperactivity and unrest in children [unintelligible]. So what about [unintelligible].

A: You don't feed them any red meat. Red meat is the big problem. Beef, lamb, venison, buffalo. Pardon? 

Q: What about adults who are that way?

A: Same thing.

Q: No red meat?

A: No, just leave them off of red meat until they become calm. And then once they become calm, maybe only two red meat meals a week. I have people that never touch red meat. They're athletes. Very hyperactive people. So that's the best thing. And you know, some good milkshakes. Calm them down. Not smoothies, milkshakes.

Q: And then what about the detoxing of heavy metals? [unintelligible] What else would help detox from heavy metals?

A: Cilantro juice.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, but you could be a crazy person. You have to be... Some people who do heavy cilantro become really uncontrollably crazy.

Q: So what amounts?

A: So I usually tell people to do no more than 5%. If they're as thin as you, never more than 5%. Maybe only 2.5%.

Q: Of that juice?

A: Of the whole juice. Yeah, of whatever juice they're drinking.

Q: So then it would be celery, parsley, and...

A: Carrot. If they're having dizzy spells, they should have carrot. Because they're using up all their sugars, and they're getting dizzy and not having it. So it would be like a 30% or 25% carrot, 25% celery, 10% parsley, 5% cilantro, and about 25-35% cucumber puree. And berries help get rid of heavy metals in the body. So for a fruit meal or a smoothie, you put dark or light berries in there. Depending upon the metal you're trying to get rid of.

Q: Following one of the...

A: Eating schedules?

Q: In your book, you want us to be eating three times a day, eating juices, and not having any fruits. Especially if there's a hyperglycemia problem.

A: Well, if you're eating the fruit with the fat, the way it's suggested in there, they could have one piece of fruit every day. And that's fine. But again, not a really ripe, fermented fruit. It has to be on the green side.

Q: But if it's berries?

A: Berries, it has very little sugar. Cherries have very little sugar.

Q: So I'm saying to use that fruit for the brain detox. Anything else for extreme dizziness?

A: Well, if you're getting extreme dizziness, you're too thin. You don't have enough fat on the body. You have no reserves. So your body's using...

Q: I didn't have it. [unintelligible]

A: Well, if you didn't have it for a long time, it gets worse every year. Because you have no reserves, so your body has to use the sugar that's available in the blood because there's no storage. If you're getting dizzy when you're just already standing and not just on the stand, then you've got an imbalance in the ear fluid.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Nerve damage won't cause that kind of imbalance. You have to have too much fluid in one ear and not enough in the other.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you get a feeling of which side there's too much water is in there, and then you put a hot water bottle on this side and just perspire it out that side on that night. And it will perspire that...

Q: That'll do it in one night?

A: For that day. And then if you're drinking water, it's going to fill up again. You have to really drink small amounts of water or else it could fill again. Usually if one ear is filling more than the other, you've got a lot of heavy metals in that ear. It's swelling and the other one doesn't. So that may be a daily thing. Every night you may have to put a hot water bottle in your ear, depending upon how much water you drink.

Q: I told her to not drink goat's milk because she's underweight.

A: Absolutely, absolutely. Anybody who's thin should eat cows and drink cow's milk. Because goat's milk has an adrenal precursor to it.

Q: You said that I don't need to go see him, that you know everything.

A: I've heard from other people he said that too. He's wrong.

[laughter]

Q: And he was only going to charge me $50.

Q: Oh, such a steal.

A: I've heard it from other people. I've heard it from other people. But everybody knows he's full of shit.

Q: Can you put goat's milk in the bathtub the same as cow's milk?

A: Absolutely. She asked if you could put any kind of milk in the bath. Yes, you can. Raw.

Q: Yeah, right. But I mean, goat's milk in the bath.

A: Do you have a question?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you have an allergy to milk, you're going to have cramps in your intestines and stomach.

Q: She might have it cold.

A: Pardon?

Q: Cold.

A: Cold? You're not drinking it cold, are you?

Q: No. [unintelligible]

A: That's not enough for you. You need more bacteria. You need it out for eight hours, ten hours. Or you're going to have to immerse it in some hot water, you know, to get it warm, so it sits out for two hours, growing bacteria fast.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, because you'll have the bacteria proliferating in it. So break it down into finer molecules, so that when the toxin comes through your skin, they will be smaller molecules. Those are very large molecules that are coming through.

Q: So before I went on the diet and drank pasteurized milk [unintelligible].

A: But that was because you were getting rid of the toxic... You were also getting detoxing the milk. But on this diet, you don't detox the milk. You detox the old milk products still in your body. That's why some people will have allergies, think that they have allergies to raw milk, because it's detoxing the old stored casein that is cauterized, that's still in their skin. The old pasteurized is still in your body.

Q: And is yogurt, is that okay cold?

A: Yogurt is okay cold, but for anybody who breaks out, I don't suggest anything cold. You might do the sport drink cold, but that's it. Even the vegetable juice, I'm not sure I would do cold.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Sport drink, I've got a hydration formula in the book, that's two cups tomato puree and one cup cucumber. Well, the sport drink is a little different, it's more cucumber. It's two cups cucumber, one cup, and that's not in the book, and one cup tomato. Some of my tennis players just use a little three cups cucumber puree, and then it's one tablespoon of vinegar, one tablespoon of lemon juice, one to four tablespoons of honey, two to four tablespoons of coconut cream, and two to four tablespoons of dairy cream, and then two and a half ounces of sparkling mineral water, and blend that all together. And then those who are actually performing, five hours of sports at a tournament, I have them put an egg in every cup of that. Whip an egg, and then they sip that. But they add the egg into it right before they're going to drink it.

Q: Is that cucumber puree in blender or a juicer?

A: A blender, yeah. It's a puree, so you don't want to separate it from the fluid.

Q: Can I just leave it out before I drink, through the day, without refrigerating it?

A: You can leave that out all day, not a problem.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it has adrenal precursors, so it causes people to be more hyperactive. So if they're thin, it's going to have a tendency to make them more irritable, more hyperactive. Have you ever seen a calm goat? No such thing. They eat nails, they'll eat anything but millet. I was experimenting with goats and diets, and you know how millet is advertised as the most protein-rich grain, and has all this other stuff in it, has lots of biotin and niacin and all this stuff in it. I fed it to, when I fed it to herds of goats, the goats would eat it for three days maximum. If there was millet, I don't care if there was two tablespoons per two, two and a half cups during milking time of their grain, if I just had two tablespoons of millet in there, they wouldn't eat any of it. They wouldn't even eat. And if a goat doesn't eat, there's really a problem.

Q: [unintelligible].

A: But like I said, thyroid is for emergency purposes. It shouldn't bother a person on a daily basis. If you fell from a tree and you bruised your chest and lungs, the thyroids would come into activity. That's why you have two thyroids and four parathyroids. Because if your lung and heart get bruised, you've got to have emergency hormones in there to keep those pumping. Otherwise, you're going to be food, dinner, or lunch or breakfast, you know, back in the old days. So that's what that was for. So just because it reduces, like pine nuts, reduce thyroxine production, we don't need it anyway if you're eating a good raw diet. You don't need those hormones. Only if you're a sick person do you need extra energy from hormones, because you're not producing enough of the correct kind of fats, and you're not utilizing those fats properly as fuel and energy. So eating the millet, those goats just did not want to frickin' eat that food if there was millet in it. Then I'd have to go in and take out all the frickin' millet. You know, we use a lot of organic. Organic feed's expensive, very expensive. And, you know, the goats just wouldn't eat it with the millet in it. Millet, don't eat it cooked or in any other way. Okay, uh, do you have a question? I forgot your name... Mark.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's fine.

Q: It's just faster for me.

A: Yeah, well, it just would be more nutritious. Yeah, and you'd gain more weight if you'd have the egg in it.

Q: Okay. [unintelligible] more honey? But I'm getting pretty hyperactive. I feel almost like I'm high.

A: Yeah, then you should be having it with butter. Well, you might have maybe one, two tablespoons a day by itself. But most of it should be with other foods. But not with a lot of meat. Not much with meat. No more than a tablespoon of honey with a meat meal.

Q: Why?

A: Because it's highly alkalizing and will neutralize your hydrochloric acid. It also is antibacterial. And bacteria is the main digester of meat. So you're neutralizing some of that bacteria. No more than a tablespoon with a meat meal. Pardon?

Q: Any kind of meat.

A: Absolutely, any kind of meat. All meats require hydrochloric acid and bacteria to digest them.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The chemistry with red meat, it will turn it into a fuel rather than building bonds. With red meat, it will turn it into a pyruvate, a sugar protein to burn as fuel. And you want to eat most of your meat to gain strength and muscle mass. New cells to heal.

Q: It's super-digesting the meat.

A: No, it's a whole different chemistry. It converts it into a different thing. Not that it digests any faster. It turns it into a whole new chemistry.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah. Turns it into a citric acid cycle.

Q: If the honey is mixed with butter or eggs, is that okay with the meat?

A: Just no more than a tablespoon of honey.

Q: Even then?

A: Even then.

Q: With how much meat?

A: Let's say a cup of meat. Did you have a question?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Lime and lemon? Lemon adds fermentation bacteria. That's why it's a good marinator. It increases fermentation and bacteria. Lime juice does just the opposite. It's antibacterial. Like when I had my motorcycle accident. If I had put lemon on that, I would have festered and had white blood cells, been pussy all over. But because I used the lime, it surrounded all that asphalt. And even though my skin healed, it came out through. I got one white blood cell that I used. I got one spot of pus from all of that damage and all of that asphalt. It just came out for the next eight months through the skin. Two pieces of asphalt built in the skin. And I can just peel it off like a wart. And only lime will do that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Raw?

Q: Yeah [unintelligible].

A: That means he's digesting everything. If we were healthy, we'd have all white turds. If you look at all of your wild dogs and cats, every feces they dump is completely white and turns into a white powder. Sometimes it's furry if they've eaten something furry. But yeah. It means that that baby is digesting perfectly. If it's all white. John, do you have a question? Oh, this is our host. Thank him for hosting us.

[applause]

Q: About refrigeration. How do you know what to refrigerate and what not to refrigerate? For example, sometimes I run out of eggs that I purchased at Rawesome, and I have to go to Whole Foods, but their eggs are refrigerated. Does that mean that I have to put them in the refrigerator or can I leave them out?

A: No, you better leave them out. It takes about 48 hours for them to get the bacterial level back, but it will never be as if they were never refrigerated. See, if you never refrigerate an egg, it can still hatch. Once the egg is refrigerated, it will never, ever, ever hatch. It destroys the reproductive ability of an egg. But still, you want bacteria to break down those eggs, those particles, so you can assimilate it better.

Q: For example, the diet you put me on, with all those drinks that I made [unintelligible], does all that stuff belong in the refrigerator? Do you have to leave it out for a couple of hours before?

A: Well, I leave my milk out. You know, I leave my milk out at least 12 hours before I'm going to drink it. And everybody should leave it out 4 or 5 hours before, 3 hours. 2 hours is absolutely minimum. If you have skin conditions, it should be 4 or 5 hours minimum.

Q: What's the problem with drinking cold milk?

A: When you drink cold milk, the stomach contracts. You don't secrete the hydrochloric acid, so the molecules of protein aren't fractionated, so the bacteria can get in there easily. And then what happens is some casein or lactate will be absorbed in the lower part of the duodenum, get right into the blood, and cause some problems.

Q: What about the other drinks like, for example, the green drink?

A: That can be drunk cold. Some people don't. He gets headaches if he drinks it cold.

Q: I see. It's an individual choice.

A: Yeah, individual thing. But when I drink mine, I put it in my mouth cold, but don't swallow it until it's warm.

Q: And the milkshakes?

A: Milkshakes should always be room temperature. Or unless you hold it in your mouth until you swallow it. But even if you do that, you're not going to digest it as well. If you want optimal digestion, you want to leave the food out at room temperature for at least 5-8 hours prior. I make all of my food in the morning for the whole day. Nothing stays refrigerated except my vegetable juice. So it is out for the entire day. By the time I get to my evening meat meal, it's been out 12-14 hours.

Q: That's for everything?

A: Everything.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You can, but it's going to start fermenting. It's better to put that in a bowl of hot water if you want to warm it. Okay.

Q: It's better to leave it out?

A: We lost that young lady over there.

Q: You got this one.

A: Alright, I'm going to go around again.

Q: You got this one to go.

A: Yes, go ahead.

Q: … trichinosis...

A: Do what about the trichinosis? You want to get the trichinosis?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay.

Q: So.. do you eat it fresh when it's just been harvested, or do you eat it over a few days?

A: It's always better to eat as much as possible as soon as possible. Because the oxygen starts killing them. And what I do is I order a pound section of the small intestine from a pig from Amos Miller. Miller Organic Farms. And I get it... He always sends two pounds. I don't know whether he doesn't like the measure or what, but he always sends two pounds. Way too much, so I'll share it with other people. But usually a half a cup is all it takes. If people have been on a long fruit diet for a long time, it will take more. Because all those alcohols will kill, kill, kill for sometimes a week or two. So it's better not to put it in too cold in a chilly area, but not a refrigerator, because it will make them dormant, the tric worms.

Q: So you need more than half a cup if you're eating a lot of fruit.

A: No, you need a half a cup at a time. I'd say maybe every three days for a couple of weeks. You can even go into three weeks if you had that. So, just to make sure.

Q: What's the benefit of this?

A: Well, when Joel Weinstock, Dr. Joel Weinstock, a gastroenterologist, noticed the pigs at the university, University of Iowa, he noticed they were very sickly. They were in a very clean environment. Everything was pristine. And he was raised on a farm. He knew how the pigs lived, and they were always healthy. So he compared the digestive tracts between the pigs that were sick at the university and the pigs that were in captivity at the university that were in a sterile environment. And he found that the pigs in a sterile environment at the university had no tric worm, whip worm. It was the tric worm. So he filtered some out from the healthy pigs at the farm, gave it to the pigs at the university, and they were well in a week. So he decided that he would try it with humans. So he went for a license to do it from the FDA on humans. And they said he could do it on six people, but they had to have suffered with IBS, inflammatory bowel syndrome, for at least ten years, and up to 32 years with no relief from the medical profession from the allopathic system. So he got six people under those circumstances, and they all suffered terrible pain and diarrhea, vomit, just from drinking water. He picked his worst cases. He gave them all the tricworm. In five days, five of them were completely asymptomatic. These were people who had suffered every day. No matter what they ate or drank, they had severe problems, gastritis. So just from having that parasite. Remember, the parasite, the tricworm, and any normal intestinal worm is there to digest your food fast. A parasite can eat 100 times its weight in 24 hours. Bacteria can only eat 50 times their weight. So your parasites are your best digester. They're also your best janitors, and that's what you do. So they can work twice as fast, you get healthy twice as fast if you have a good tricworm. And you infuse that by eating pigs' intestines. The two animals on the planet that almost all of them have tricworms unless you're in a sterile environment like we have with awful food. The humans and pigs have all the tricworm. Okay? Yes, John?

Q: Have you ever thrown any food away?

A: No, I never throw any food away. I'll give it to the coyotes. I'll share it with the coyotes. I have people who give me high meat. Lots of people will give me because they don't want to eat anymore. They've had enough and they'd rather start with a fresher batch because it's way too stinky and liquid. But that's when it's the best. Because it's already been reduced to a liquid. The bacteria has broken it down. So all those nutrients, even though as foul as foul can be, and no fouler than what's in the intestines, if it were concentrated, and you eat that and it goes right into the body and fulfills the body. That's why a depressed person in ten minutes can get happy. That quickly. Because it's all pre-digested. But I get so much of it that I share it with a coyote. Or the ravens.

Q: What if I don't have any coyotes or ravens in my house?

A: Just put it out on the sidewalk and a dog will come by. Put it out at night. Some dog will come by and get it. Or cat. And I guarantee you they will love you. When I lived in Venice and Beverly Hills, I used to put it out just at the edge of the sidewalk.

Q: Will my cats eat high meat?

A: Cats indoors will not eat high meat. Only outdoor cats.

Q: She is an outdoor cat.

A: Then she might. Most cats like things fresh. Dogs love things rotten. But if a cat is sick, not really well, it will eat the high meat. Okay, we're going to go around quickly. Now I'm going to answer quicker the question. Question. Okay.

Q: Just go ahead, I'll give you [unintelligible].

Q: Can you go over the seafood? This diet, money is always a consideration. Is one cut good enough? You know like, is a bigger fish better than a smaller fish?

A: It doesn't matter. It does not matter what kind of fish you eat, as long as it's an ocean wild caught. Scallops and clams, as long as they're not coming from the Gulf of Mexico, are fine. Even though they're farmed, because all they do is put a fence in the ocean, and it's still fed by the ocean and nothing else. Oysters, clams, and scallops. Shrimp? They can farm.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: All of the ships that go through the Panama Canal, and they wait there for weeks to get through, and the U.S. Navy dumps their nuclear waste, and the Navy, I've had them, when I lived on Jekyll Island, Georgia, that naval base in Jacksonville, Florida, we used to brag, I would hear them bragging, the sailors bragging about how they're dumping their nuclear waste from the submarine right there offshore, 50 miles, 20 miles offshore. All the way in the Gulf and all the way down from, you know, Jacksonville, all the way down to the Bahamas, or down to Cuba.

Q: It's never frozen?

A: Well, some fish, your northern fish can be frozen. But not your tropical fish. Cod, if the salmon is northern salmon, caught in the winter, it's up there in the cold too. Anything that's cold up there.

Q: What about Scottish salmon?

A: Scottish salmon is mostly farmed. Not a good idea. Question.

Q: My grandson is three. He's not really fully in the primal diet. I read in your book that children under 15 should not really drink vegetable juice. So, for a three-year-old, what would be the ideal diet?

A: That all depends upon the child. And if they're not on cooked food, who knows what kind of toxins they've had, and what kind of vaccines. But normally, children, very basically, raw milk. Raw milk and eggs and honey. That's all they need until they're about seven years old. The child she's talking about is three. So, a little bit of meat once in a while is fine.

Q: When he went to the doctor he said that he had anemia, a little bit of anemia. So they were worried about giving him more meat. He was drinking raw milk and not much than that.

A: Whenever the doctors come up with anemia, they're looking at hemoglobin. Again, figures that they don't know their ass from a hole in the ground. There's a figure to get you to take some kind of ferrous sulfate, some kind of iron supplement. It's always about taking something to remedy the problem. If the child doesn't act like anemic, if the child isn't going around like this, the child's not anemic. If that child's got energy, it's not anemic. You just tell the doctor to go stick his head up his butt. Just leave him alone. I just hate that. Because the pharmaceutical industry tells these doctors that we have to fit in these measurements. And it isn't true. I've got a fellow who was diagnosed as leukemic because his white blood cell count is off the chart and his red blood cell count is as low as a child's. He runs marathon races every year. He runs seven miles a day. Does he have anemia? He doesn't eat any red meat. He only eats fish and poultry. Does he have anemia? No. That is his system. His system is perfect at that stage. In fact, if he eats red meat, he gets hyperactive and crazy. But yeah, he's got anemia? No way. Do you have a question?

Q: I've got some high meat that I started. It's as old as a year. If I start opening it up again, will it continue the process? Or is that pretty much shot? 

A: When I did Ripley's Believe It Or Not, I was eating up to a year and three months old meat. It was all liquid and black and green.

Q: So you can continue any time?

A: Like I said, it never really goes bad. As long as it's raw, it will never be bad. It will just be completely predigested and black liquid. It's really raunchy smelling.

Q: Even if it's not in the refrigerator during that time?

A: Even if it's not in the refrigerator. If molds grow on it, you may have trouble with it. There's molds as well as the bacteria. If you start having mold layers on it, you may cause some detoxification. That's happened to me a few times.

Q: Get back to me.

A: Okay. Yes.

Q: What I've been doing lately is I've been buying past expiration milk from organic pastures. 

A: What I'm going to ask everybody to do is not tee it up.

Q: Get right to the question because we only have 20 minutes. Okay. Anyway, what I do is I just put it in bottles. Right now, I've got like 12 or 15 gallons of organic pastures milk in jars outside. What it does is it either turns into yogurt or cottage cheese. What I'm trying to do this time when I bought my 35 half gallons was to... I used to keep them in the refrigerator and then put them outside.

A: You're going to have to get your question.

Q: Okay, but now I'm letting them sit out for weeks and it's yogurt to cottage cheese. Is that okay?

A: That's fine. And if it's in cottage cheese, you just blend it very briefly. Three, four seconds and you're going to have milk.

Q: But I don't. I don't. I just eat the cottage cheese and I save the whey.

A: That's fine. You can do that.

Q: But it can sit out for like a month at a time, this milk.

A: Doesn't matter.

Q: That's turned to yogurt and cottage cheese.

A: I'm going to say it for the hundredth time. If it's a raw food, it never goes bad. Dairy never goes bad. It just turns into cheese and whey. Period. That's it. Those are good too. Okay? Question?

Q: Come back.

A: Okay. Jim?

Q: What's the best middle of the night meal?

A: Best middle of the night meal is something with protein in it. No vegetable juice, that isn't going to satisfy your protein needs. So egg, meat, or a milkshake. Or just milk.

Q: Egg and meat?

A: Doesn't need, no. Just one or the other. I wouldn't mix meat and egg if I go to sleep with it.

Q: Cheese.

A: Pardon?

Q: Cheese.

A: Cheese with honey might be okay because you'll digest some of the protein. But probably I wouldn't do that. I would eat some cheese and an egg, cheese and a milkshake, or cheese and meat.

Q: Raw butter.

A: Pardon?

Q: Raw butter.

A: Raw butter has no protein in it.

Q: Oh, yeah.

Q: [unintelligible] You don't really talk about that anymore.

A: Well, like I say in the book, starch is a nut formula. If the nut formula doesn't work, then you go to some kind of cooked starch. You eat as much raw butter as you do with cooked starch. For some kind of fat, butter is always best. And with the experiments that I've been doing in the last three years with different kinds of starches, your rice is the best. The Asians have it right. Rice is always digested best, causes less toxicity.

Q: White? Does it matter? White?

A: Doesn't matter.

Q: What is narcolepsy?

A: Narcolepsy is, what did you say?

Q: What do you think it is? Well, I mean, where do you think it's coming from?

A: Narcolepsy, usually it's coming from some kind of aluminum stored in the brain and somewhere in the sleep center. Aluminum destroys the zeta potential. The zeta potential is ability for nutrients to remain suspended in fluid. You see little fishies going around in the aquarium in the water. That's the zeta potential. You put liquid mercury in that, the fish will hit the bottom and not be able to swim. Same thing happens in the brain. So, if it gets to the sleep center, all the firing is not going to get where it's going and you're just going to fall asleep. Everything shuts down. I mean if the aluminum gets active. Sometimes mercury can cause it. And to get rid of aluminum, you need some raspberries and coconut cream with a tiny bit of dairy cream.

Q: Tiny bit of what?

A: Dairy cream. So you're having half a cup of berries, raspberries with two and a half, three tablespoons of coconut cream, one tablespoon of dairy cream.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I think you'll change it as long as you're going to leave your milk out longer or if you put it in warm water and then leave it out for two months. You might put, you know, like a couple of drops of honey in per cup of milk, just to help, you know, it gets digested a little bit better. And all that might lower the detoxing through your skin. And if you're detoxing heavily through the skin, it may be very difficult for a while to gain weight, unless you're having one or two whole moisturizing formulas, and at least half of a moisturizing formula with each meal.

Q: I just had my eyes examined. No change in two years, but they said a lot of floaters.

A: A lot of what?

Q: Floaters.

A: Yeah. Well, the eyes and the neck and the ears have the least circulation, blood circulation in there. You've got this little pathway going into this big eyeball. Same with the ears and the same with the neck. Big brain, lots of blood going up in there, and this little passage. So anywhere it's restricted, you know, especially if your body's overweight, you're using your nutrients for a lot of other things, your eyes are going to take the hit for that.

Q: Cool. [unintelligible]

A: Sleep on a slant? Sleep on a slant would definitely help. Yeah. Absolutely. Sleeping on a slant. Yeah.

Q: Does it help snoring?

A: I don't know that.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: He asked if sleeping on a slant stops snoring. Do you have another question, John?

Q: Yeah, quick question. Other than, in the sense of relaxing those muscles and the nervous system, is there anything else besides cream, milk, [unintelligible] avocado and frozen raspberries to help that?

A: Well, hot baths, any kind of warmth will relax the nervous system. Any kind of warmth. Hot water bottles in your bed, or wearing a robe, just keeping warm all the time will relax the body, the nervous system. I'm getting to those people who didn't get two questions answered. Everybody in the back got two questions answered. There's a few people here that did not.

Q: Okay, I sometimes get sores in my mouth [unintelligible].

A: Now, you're getting very acidic blood. You're getting about under 5.5 acidic blood. I remain 5.5 blood, urine, saliva. That's normal, that's 5.5 to 5.8. You're getting too acidic at that time. You need to drink more sport drink, or drink a little bit more vegetable juice, or put a little bit more parsley in your vegetable juice. Either one of those will help. Also, years ago when I wrote that book, I wasn't using cucumber puree. I was using cucumber juice. But after all the years, I noticed that in some of us, we were losing a lot of collagen, and we don't eat much fruit. And fruit's a good collagen source. So since we cut out all that fruit, and we detox mostly through the skin, we weren't replacing collagen. So that's when I started using cucumber as the bland fruit pulp precursor, and it's helped tremendously. So whenever you're looking in my book and it says to have something like cucumber, always put cucumber in your juice, but puree it. Always peel it, but always puree it. Don't juice it. John?

Q: I've had eight ounces of juice at a time. I've tried 12. It seems like I'm a little bloated. That's a little too much. Go back to eight. Do you have anything to say about that?

A: You have to play it on that. I do the same thing. Sometimes I can have 16 ounces at a time, but if I do that, I can only drink juice once a day. You just have to play with it for you. You're an individual.

Q: You have to go slow with that. You have to take it real slow, right? Slow, with the amount of juice.

A: Oh, yeah. It may take me half an hour to drink that much juice.

Q: Why not juice the cucumber? Why not?
 
A: You want the pulp to replace the collagen under your skin. If you don't, you're not going to have the elasticity. See, since I started losing collagen under here, so my skin started detaching from my, you know, the connective tissue was deteriorating. Now it's nice and tight, like when I was 20 years old, my teens. See how tight that is? And that's just from a year of drinking the juice with the cucumber puree rather than the juice. Okay?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Because you need so many nutrients so often that if you drink a juice, you can get undernourished, you can have more pain, you'll have more diarrhea, you'll have more vomit, it can induce all kinds of things. Also it's better not to have juice when you're going through a heavy detoxification. Some people might get away with a half a cup or a whole cup, but still, if it causes more diarrhea and vomit right away, you may not want it.

Q: So what do you recommend to alleviate the snoring?

A: He wants to know how you eliminate snoring. You go to Vietnam, they'll take a scraper and scrape your sinus with that. Really, that's what they do. Snoring comes from, you've got a very saggy sinus. When you're lying back, that sinus sags back into your throat passage, and it reduces the amount of airflow. So you suck in a lot more air to get past those sinuses. Unless you're breathing through your mouth, usually you don't snore so much. But if you're breathing through your nose, you have to go past all of that sagging sinus. So you can sit up, or you do things to tighten your sinuses.

Q: It's not bad to breathe through your mouth?

A: Well, you're not filtering as well, but still, you won't snore as much. But what you can do is, you can snort a little bit of water, good mineral water, with a tiny bit of vinegar. Let's say you're snorting, let's say, 3 ounces or 2 ounces of water, with a quarter of a teaspoon of vinegar only. You snort that, and it will start breaking down a lot of the dead tissue in the sinuses, and cause them to shrink over a long period of time. It may take a year or two, but that will do it. If you start getting sore throats, you're detoxing too many dead cells at once, and you're not creating enough mucus, so stop it until that subsides, and then start snorting it again. And you only... once on each side is all it takes, and it should come right out of the mouth.

Q: Oh, just one snort?

A: One snort on each nostril.

Q: Is that for the sinusitis too?

A: It depends on the sinusitis. If you're not creating mucus, it's not going to help.

Q: Okay.

A: In fact, vinegar would make it worse, because it's a scar [unintelligible]. Yeah.

Q: A good friend of mine is dealing with a really heavy duty case of psoriasis. It's growing on his back, in his abdomen, in his arms, and it seems to be multiplying.

A: Two to three lubrication formulas a day. Okay, yes?

Q: I don't know, lately, airplanes, long flights, I started getting agitated, it's like irrational fear.

A: It's not irrational. It is not irrational. You've got jet fuel. You've got kerosene in the compartment. You wear a mask, a cotton mask. You need a cotton mask. They have a lot of them in China. That's where I got mine, but you can go online. There's a site called I Want to Breathe, I think it is. Something like that. Something about breathing. Put a mask, breathing, and you'll come up with a website where they make all cotton, organic cotton masks. And that's the thing to use and wear. That's what I wear. It makes all the difference. Usually, people who get fatigued from jet lag, it is the airplane exhaust in the plane. I used to get terrible neck aches until I realized that. And then I started wearing the mask, and now no problem.

Q: That's the best for people with sensitivity as well?

A: Absolutely. If I go on a golf course, I wear a mask. People freak out because I wear a mask. And that's one of the most polluted environments there is.

Q: From the carts?

A: No, well from the carts, but they put so many chemicals on the fairways and the greens. It's atrocious. Okay, one last one.

Q: What do you recommend for cold feet, chronic cold feet? It's always cold, everything else is normal.

A: Well, that usually means there's poor circulation in the feet, or you've got a lot of metals that have drifted down and clumped in the feet. And you know, if you touch steel when it's cold, steel will be as cold as ice. So that's usually what's happening. If both your hands and feet are cold at the same time, you've got a mineral deficiency, and you eat cheese and honey together for several days all day long, a little bit at a time all day long, and that'll usually get the warmth of the feet and the hands going.

Q: So more minerals?

A: Yeah, minerals, yeah. Digested minerals.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, no, no. It's always one-third honey to the cheese. So it's one tablespoon of honey, honey, one tablespoon of cheese to one teaspoon of honey. Sometimes I tell you people you need to use less honey. But that's the highest ratio, three to one. Okay, everybody's had two questions, right? Oh, there's some dairy, and what else do you have?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay, so there's some food here. Somebody wants some food here. It's available. Now we're going to... Wait a minute, everyone. Hold on. We're going to dance if you want to dance for about an hour. So, I mean, we can add those people who want instructions. We'll get instructions. To the people who already know how, you just want to dance, they can take another part of the floor. You just dance.

Q: All right, thank you.

A: Okay?

[applause]

Q: Thank you very much.

A: Oh, Jill and John made some recipes on the CD, the video. [unintelligible]. So just come and see Jill if you'd like one of those video recipes.
