Q: This is my wife, Joy, and our daughter, Rosemarie. We've been on this diet pretty hardcore for three years in the sense that we don't ever cheat or go off the diet. If we do, we immediately see a negative thing happen to us. For me personally, my body shuts down. If I go back and eat any cooked food at all, I'll kind of collapse where I have to go to bed for about 24 hours. My body works it out, and then I'll get explosive diarrhea, and it'll pass it on through. It just doesn't assimilate any of the stuff in the cooked food. We did the diet based off of her books without speaking with Aajonus and doing a personal consultation for about a year. We saw a lot of great things happen health-wise, but it wasn't until we met with her personally and studied the iris on the computer screen where we were able to really realize what we had to do. I was weighing about 150 at the time, and I think Joy was – you put on, what, 40 pounds?

Q: Forty-five.

Q: Forty-five pounds, and I put on about 50 or 60 pounds. Aajonus explained to us that in order to have the proper buffer against the toxins, we need to have the extra body fat on us. We were really underweight. After doing that, our balance increased, and Joy needed to start taking [unintelligible] just to release the energy and find the strength in her body. I've had bizarre things happen to me where eyesight has improved. I've grown an inch on top of gaining the 50 pounds. I actually spent about a month with pain going on in my lower leg area where I had growing pain. It felt like I was 14 years old again, and I was growing, so I grew an extra inch. I'm 33 now. This is my bone that said, hey, now we have nutrients to finish developing. We can put on that last weight and that last height and finish out a proper proportion of what it's supposed to be. I had off-and-on ear blockage throughout my life. Most recent years, I had a lot of ear blockage where it felt like there was closure in my ears and it was muffled. I was working with Aajonus, and he was explaining to me that it's the mercury from my vaccine that were coming out lymphatically, and I needed to loosen up the lymphatic system. The books explain, too, the pineapple bath and loosening up the lymphatic system. It got to the point where I'd be driving down the street, and black, gummy bear-sized balls would fall out of my ears. They were just balls of mercury and wax pushing itself out through my ear canals. I've had antibiotics coming out of my fingertips a lot, and I'm to the point now where, because I've got the fat on me, my body says, we want to get rid of all the mercury, we want to get rid of all these things at the first chance we get. The Novocaine from my years of [unintelligible], the Novocaine drug deposits are still stored in my mouth. If I eat an avocado or a tomato, I will taste Novocaine in my mouth as it's leaching out through my canker sores that I'll get immediately. I'll get these ridges on the sides of my tongue that are so painful that I can't eat. So the Novocaine wants to come out, the mercury wants to come out, but it's so painful in a sense, and it takes time out of your life where you're going, okay, I don't want to have to deal with this, I don't want to have to deal with the swollen lymph nodes, I don't have time to take a pineapple bath every single day in my life. So it's a matter of now, I've got the buffer on, I've got the weight on, and it feels good and it feels balanced, and I've got great energy all day long. But I have to be careful in picking chews when I want to take a detoxification. So in the meantime, I've had to stick to the plan, specifically hour by hour. My meat is bland, I can't put sauce on it, because if I do, things will start exploding on me, which is great that they do that and that they're coming out, but it's been a long road, and it's going to be a lot longer.

Apparently, I have blue eyes, but if you look closely, they look like they're hazel. I remember as a teenager growing up, my eyes would turn from brown to hazel and brown to hazel, and I would ask, why does this happen? And of course, the answer is, well, it's just the time of the year. This is the way people are, that's what they do. I would say doctors or parents or teachers or whatever, but I know now that the amount of toxins in my body were worse. You know, I would be eating more Twinkies or getting more vaccines during a certain time of the year that would make them darker and lighter. So the idea is, after so many years, my eyes would become as blue as my daughter's. That's awesome. There's online chat groups, what are they called, Yahoo support groups, that I know Aajonus isn't specifically a part of, but a lot of times if you were out of attention and we couldn't get a hold of you and I had something going on in my body and I said to myself, I need to know what's going on, I can get on there, onto the Yahoo chat group, the final diet chat group, and type in the search and say, why is it that I threw up from having salmon? And I would find out why. And I felt good because it was the most bizarre thing, to eat a big plate of salmon and then you're sitting in front of the computer and you say to yourself, my mouth just filled with bile, I'm getting ready to throw up an hour after I ate salmon. But I'm not sick, I don't feel ill at all, so I'm going to throw up. You know what, I'm going to throw up. And you go in and you throw up, and there goes the salmon, filled with all kinds of toxins that your stomach said, okay, we've got this wonderful salmon here, we're going to put toxins into it, and it's going to go one of two directions. The easier, quicker direction is, let's just get it up this way. And you get done throwing up, you go back to the computer, and you're going, I feel fine, but yet I just threw up. Why is that? I mean, it's kind of freaky, kind of a weird thing. Well, is it bad salmon? The answer is no, it's perfectly fine. It's just my body says it's great salmon. We want to use this to move some stuff.

Q: What is it called?

Q: I don't know, Joy, it's the Primal Diet at Yahoo! Groups. Just go to Yahoo! Groups, and there's one called Primal Diet. And I wouldn't say that everything in there is true. You know, take it with a grain of salt. It is just the internet. But it's a good database for meeting other like-minded people that have read the same information, that have gone some other different direction sometimes. And it's one other outlet that I found to be beneficial in time of crisis if you can't get Aajonus on the phone.

Q: Thank you.

Q: I'll back up the antibiotic stuff coming off the fingers. I had for a month just a nasty, ugly, crusty thing coming off my skin. I've got this thing that's just happening. You can see it's kind of left a white mark. Now the color will come back. But I asked him. He said, oh, yeah, because it was puffy and black. It was like [unintelligible] with black mixed in on both of these. And these guys were like, they were just nasty. It was stuff I really, you know, you don't normally see. You just get that vibe that, wow, this is deep, or this is old, or this is, you know, that kind of stuff. So anyway, I just wanted to say I had the similar experiences. I didn't grow an inch, unfortunately. I put on, you know, weight, and he did like, just not an inch.

Q: The detoxing happens more slowly or quickly with older people?

A: It's never determined. But people detox all the time. People get sick. People have colds. People have flu. They have vomiting, diarrhea. They have aches and pains. Everybody has them. This diet doesn't make any difference to that, except in the shortens your periods. It is less uncomfortable over the long run. People on this diet are only in detoxification 12% of the time, 8 to 12%. So it averages around about 9, 10%. On the average diet, people are detoxing 22%. So I'd say this is the better plan. What he said, he'd go right back to work. He'd vomit and go right back to work. What other person could do that? They'd be strapped all night with vomiting and diarrhea. But everybody's detoxing, and it's usually not just the cooked foods that they're detoxifying. It's the other preservatives and chemicals that's in their food that's the biggest problem. If people ate cooked foods, they would get very few diseases. Only 10% of the diseases that are out there today. And it wouldn't be so bad. But now we're in such a polluted society, we have to have a diet that takes care of a lot more. And that is all the poisoning that is happening to us. It's creating 90% of those new diseases. Compounds everything. So, with that, you know, Jeff looked like he was an Auschwitz victim. People know him when he was like that? I mean, he's a skinny guy. And all kinds of different diets. Went to the doctors. Doctors said he was in perfect health. All the tests. So that tells you what they know about their tests. That they aren't, they don't tell anything. That's just a pharmaceutical angle to trap you into taking medication. It's got nothing to do with anything. Cholesterol is a good guy. They say it's a bad guy. So they want you taking cholesterol-lowering medication. And that's what it's all about. So, this diet doesn't cause more problems. It gets rid of a lot of your problems. People who get pneumonia on this diet go to work. The people who are around them are listening to them cough. They're the problem. They're afraid that you're going to get the same disease or whatever it is. They can work. The only detoxification that has nothing to do with the diet that usually ejects people into a bed is meningitis, spinal or cerebral meningitis. That's a tough one to do on any diet. It usually makes people bedridden for a period of time, up to 10 days. On this diet, whereas meningitis, the medical community works with you on it, it could be 6 weeks to 3 months. Usually on this diet, it's 8 to 10 days.

Q: How do you know you have that?

A: Pardon?

Q: How do you know you have that?

A: Absolutely the symptoms. You can get diagnosed and then they'll freak you out. They'll tell you you're going to die. I've had a lot of clients who went through that. One was a famous composer, musical composer for motion pictures, and editor and director. She came down with a really bad case. She was too skinny at the time. I worked with her for a year and a half. Hollywood women, even if they're not in front of the camera, they think they have to be skinny to be attractive, and yet never had a relationship. Theu last two weeks or a month or something like that, they still think that getting up into late 40s and you're 50 years old and you say, I haven't really had a meaningful relationship, you have to wonder, well, is your skinniness not working for you? Is there some other thing? And then you try it. She got very sick because she had no fats to buffer her poisons, not to help carry them out of the body. So she was terribly affected. In a matter of six weeks, I put her on a diet of eating all day long. We have a big group in Los Angeles where we have volunteers that will prepare the food, that make the food, and others that will deliver and feed the person, stay with the person if there's an emergency. So they did that for her, and she gained 60 pounds in that six weeks. I mean, she was like a huge Jewish pear. I mean, it was just mostly fat because I didn't give her a lot of meat. I wanted to fatten her up. So I fattened her, and her ex-husband, that marriage lasted six weeks, I think. They had a child from it, but a terrible relationship. And, you know, he's a famous casting director, and he called a famous doctor for those Hollywood people, and she went to her home, which is a rare thing for them to do. Went to her home and diagnosed her with at least an advanced severe pneumonia and possibly meningitis, and said that she didn't get into the hospital, she'd be dead within 24 hours or less. And I said, that's what she's told. She doesn't know. She never sticks by anybody, you know, so I wouldn't believe her. So I've been through meningitis, you know, four times. You know, I know what it's about. I know what it's through. I ask her how many times she's had meningitis. So she didn't do what she said, so she gained all that fat and weight. And she got through it and was stronger and healthier. She got all this fat. She had gained eight dress sizes, you know, in that six weeks' time. Eight dress sizes. And I said, is that all? She was not happy. And what happened, you know, she lost probably about 30 pounds of it in the next two months. And she met this ex-chippendale model, 15 years younger than she is, and they're still together five years later. You know, having a good time with her twice a day. You know, in here she was fat and very unattractive. But she became a very nice person because without that fat on the body, there's no buffer.

The poisons go into the system, into the cells, and damage the nerve cells mainly. And that causes people to be irritable. How many skinny women do you know that aren't irritable? How many skinny men do you know that aren't irritable? They're on edge quickly. They like to be alone more often than not. The people who are overweight are much more relaxed because the poisons aren't going into the body, irritating the system all the time. I remember when I was getting well, I was doing motion picture things because I was too sick to work. So my publicity agent was the head of MGM's publicity department, and he asked me to take Twiggy to the opening of Butterflies are Free. And this was in 1972 or, yeah, 72, I think, or 73. And, you know, when the limos and everything. And here's, you know, everybody knows who Twiggy is?

Q: Sure.

A: Yeah. I mean, oh, I mean, talk about skinny. The limo drivers looked in the mirror at her and said, you got a pretty face, honey, but you ain't no Marilyn Monroe. She laughed. You know, that was good. To give you an idea of what happened, we went into the theater, watched the movie. The Apco Cinema was a new theater, three screens, one of the first multi-complex. And three was a lot in those days. And it was a new complex that opened. We went in. So I didn't want to deal with the paparazzi going out like we did coming in. So I said, let's go out the back way. And Justin, her manager, went out and told the limo driver to meet us on the side. So she and I and Dory Freeman, the publicity manager, we went out the back way. And there was a lot of construction materials in the back. And the door was closing. And I said, you know, I hope that these side doors are open because we just locked our way out, Twiggy freaked. I mean, she just started screaming as if some horrible, frightening creature had just threatened to devour her with gnarly teeth and plastic or steel or whatever. And she just couldn't stop screaming. She just went hysterical over this idea that maybe we may be locked in for two minutes. But Justin knew where we were. The limo driver knew where we were. So we weren't going to be in there locked in there more than two minutes, and she just panicked. It was a good three or four minutes before we got her to stop and had to shake her and almost slap her to get her to stop screaming. That is what happens when you don't have buffers in the body. Everything is exaggerated. And that happens a lot in people who are thin because they don't have any fat to protect them. When I was a fruitarian and I was skinny, I was crazy. I was a fanatic about it. I would get distressed and upset very easily. And if you meet a lot of the raw fooders who are fruitarian vegetarians, they foam at the mouth very easily. They get really upset. They get crazy. I you remember the first time I, when the book came out. I was invited to a health convention and show in San Diego. And I was sitting there at a table and all these people knew that I had been a fruitarian vegetarian for all those years. And they came up to me to read me the Riot Act about eating all this raw meat and raw dairy. That they were certain that it was bad for me. And so I let them do all their, you know, talking for about 20 minutes. And I picked up a mirror and I said, you say that meat eaters and milk eaters are violent and aggressive. And I said, why don't you take a look in this mirror? Because I knew what would happen, which used to be me when I did it. When I would stand there and talk long enough, with that kind of intensity behind it, I'd start getting, you know, foaming around the mouth. Literally foaming around the mouth. So I just held a mirror up for the two of them to see.

There were five of them. The two of them were doing this. Literally they had foam all around their mouth. And I said, if you're on a vegetarian diet, you're eating all adult food, fruit, dairy and mainly, and what do you think about that? Does that look like a calm person? I'm sitting here and I'm eating, you know, one to three pounds a day. And I, you know, drink two quarts of milk a day, raw milk a day. And I eat lots of this butter and probably up to 50 eggs sometimes a day. I'm very calm. I said, are you sure what you know is true? I would say right now your experience says that it isn't. So I would take that as a good indication that you're wrong. And maybe I'm right. And they walked away. They left. They left. They walked away without saying another word. I never heard from them again. And I went down and been down there at least four more times. Never heard from them again. And these people were very skinny. So you have to take a good look at that. Try to track. Fat is the most important nutrient in our toxic society because if we look into the body, and we've had many scientists have proven it, where do they find most of the toxins? Wherever there's lots of fat. Bone marrow, glands in the brain. And if you happen to be a fat individual, it's all here. Not in your glands and not in your brain as much. It's not a problem when you've got fat. You have protection. So everything you ever hear from the medical profession is upside down. Because their intent is that you be sick. That you need them. You've also heard the phrase fat and happy. That was a predominant thing for years. All of your, you know, your ruling classes, it was an honor to be fat. You didn't have to work hard. You could eat all the, you know, plunder you wanted. All the heavy meats and fats and creams and butters. And get fat. It was a sign of royalty. Of class.

[audio cut]

A: When you get those little pieces of bacon, lard, and then you boil it in oil. The little things swell up to this big. Little crispy, I forget what you call them.
 
Q: Pork rinds.

A: Pardon?

Q: Pork rinds.

A: Pork rinds, yeah. They boil in the oil and they swell up and they're nice and crispy. And, you know, that's more than 2,000 times their normal size if you're cooking them in oil. But then the average is 10 to 50 times their normal size. So I had 24% body fat and I'm this size. If I had all the other old fat, I was big. I was fat. And I didn't care. I felt good. It was very good. I mean, I used to, you know, get up to 38, 39, sometimes 40 inches. Quite large. Now my waist goes from 28 to 33. And in fact, you know, the least I ever did is 18%. And then I'm at 29 inch waist. 18% is still a lot of fat. According to the athletic industry, it says that 7 to 10% or 7% is maximum that you're an athlete. Yeah, if you want to burn out at 32, 35 years old and be so dry you can't be an athlete anymore, that's what happens. And also, if people get an injury, they put ice packs on it, what happens? It blocks circulation. Ice blocks circulation. It stops circulation. It stops the blood flow. It causes dehydration in the area. Because the body gets rid of the fluids because it's trying to warm the area. So what happens? You scar in that area. You don't heal properly. You don't clean out the damaged and bruised tissue. And you don't heal properly. So you have an injury. So then the athletes don't move usually beyond 36, 38 years old. It's the end of their career. Because their coach wants them to get out there and play the rest of the game.

Q: What are you supposed to do?

A: Hot water bottles. Pack it with hot water. And that means keep it loose. Don't put pressure on it. Don't bind it. You want it to stay relaxed so the nutrients can get in there. And you have to eat good nutrients to do it properly. Get in there and remove the dead substances, damaged substances. And heal that area as quickly as possible. So heat allows for the expansion of tendons and everything. Because when you get bruised, you have a tendency to lock up. Because you've got pain there. And then if you put the hot water bottle, it allows the tendons, connective tissue to relax. And then your proper circulation and flow moves in and out. It's all just heat. Any kind of injury, never, ever... And even if you're seriously bleeding, never use cold substances to stop it. And then you worry about, you know, a lot of people worry about urine, you know. Oh, it's dirty urine. It's something with PUA, you know. Something toxic. But urine is nothing other than the blood without many red blood cells. Because the kidney's job is to filter out red blood cells. And it puts ammonia. It manufactures ammonia in that process. And so you've got a little bit, you've got the blood with a little bit of ammonia in it, not many red blood cells. So that's all the urine is. All your astronauts drink their urine. That's what they drink up there in the spaceship. They don't take on water. They drink their own urine. It goes through, there's a filter, and right back up to them. They drink their own urine. I read it was part of the space program general library. That's what they drank. Many, many cultures do it. The Ayurvedics do it. Many... The practice got big in India because of all the vegetarians. They were lacking a lot of proteins. So they drink their urine to recycle the proteins. So drinking urine is a very popular, important part of health in India. One time I was talking about urine in 1982. I was giving a small workshop like this in Jekyll Island, Georgia. And this man was about, he was probably 83 years old, stood up and he said, I know what you're talking about. He said, I'm a retired police officer from the Miami Police Department. And he said, when we found somebody either shot or in an accident that was bleeding to death, we urinated into a cup and poured on the wound and it stopped the bleeding within moments. Two minutes at max. And they just poured on slowly and it stopped the bleeding. He said in 1928 they outlawed it. We watched thousands of people die because we couldn't piss on them. And he literally, even though he said it jokingly. You have to understand the value of the whole body. You should not be afraid of it. Every part of you is important. The only things that are a problem are the poisons from industry that are being pumped into you. Antiseptics, antibiotics, medication.

It is all there, not as an aid to your health, but as an aid to them to keep gaining money from you. And that's what it's about. So all these things. When you leave here, you should never be afraid of the human body or anything in nature unless it's a very hungry tiger or lion or a whole swarm of crocodiles, you know, that are very hungry and you're the only food around. Let me tell you, I've swam with alligators every day for a year and a half, and never once did they come to eat me. And I've swam with them in the lake on Jekyll Island rivers every day for a year and a half. We're not on their diet. Lion or tiger, oh my, yes. Some bears, yes. But, you know, you've got to be in their neighborhood to do it. All these bacterias, that's like saying, I'm going to take all of you and we're going to fight the United States government. With arms, with weapons and everything, we're going to overtake them. All right. A few little bacteria, a few little parasites are going to take over the body. Who are you talking to? A lot of people that are buy the Hollywood [unintelligible], that a few people can take over this whole United States Army, there's at least how many people? Eleven million? Eleven million people work for the U.S. Army? [unintelligible] And how long would it take you to propagate to make a bigger army? And aren't they all so ingrained in it? It's impossible. So all this stuff about bacteria taking over your body is an absurdity. You have white and red blood cells that are always working to protect itself and heal itself, unless you're poisoned. So let's take a look at the systems of the human body. We have blood, we have the lymphatic system, and we have the neurological system. Those are the primary parts of the body. What does the blood do? Red blood cells transport oxygen. They also collect carbon dioxide and take it out of the body. So they do two things. That is their primary and singular goal, is to supply oxygen and remove carbon dioxide and other gases that might exist from chemical interchanges in the body. We find that it does a lot of it. Sometimes we find it feeding, delivering nutrients in certain areas. We find it transporting toxins out of areas. It's not its job. That's the job of the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is responsible for feeding every cell in the body and for collecting the waste products and toxins, neutralizing them, dissolving them, neutralizing them again, and then sending them out of some area of the body. You can build it into hair and nails, heavy metals, or more compound solid toxins. Or send it out the ears or the tear ducts, the gums, the tongue, the salivary glands, the skin. Most of it goes out the skin through perspiration. You've got the urinary tract. You've got the bowels. They're all discharged from any area that it can. And that's good, because we're all very toxic. Has to send it out all ways.

So these systems are doing things that they shouldn't. And if we eat certain foods that cause congestion in those systems, they don't work. So the blood has to do something it shouldn't do. Or the lymph system has to do something it shouldn't do for the bloodstream or the neurological system. The neurological system transports what? Information. Electricity and light. Keeps the whole body in communication. So things stay a solid unit. And what does the light and electricity usually use as its component for conductivity? Metallic minerals. Any of the metallic minerals that conduct electricity and light will reflect electricity and light. And reflect light. So what happens if you take a food that has these trace minerals in it that are very good in trace amounts for the nervous system and brain to work, and you break the bonds, and all of a sudden these metals become free radicals? Where are most of them going to go? To the brain and nervous system. Why do you think we have such a big brain? And they keep growing every year. Because we're full of toxins. No other animal has a toxic brain like a human. When you break the toxic brain down, dissolve it, and analyze it, the concentration of poisons in the human brain are 1,200,000 times that of any other animal. 1,200 times the concentration of free radical metals in the brain and nervous system. And it's only been analysed in the brain. But I'm assuming it's in the brain and the nervous system too. So think about that. So maybe we don't have a big brain because we're smarter. We have a bigger brain because we're polluters. And we need somewhere to store it. And the brain is, what, 60% fat? Where are those poisons going to go? Into the brain. We're obviously not much smarter. No other animal has a disease like we have unless we poison them. They get injured, they get eaten. That's the process. But not poisoning, not suffering disease. That doesn't exist unless their food supply is poisoned or interfered in. And they're starving. So, then let's take a look at the digestive tract. In the digestive tract, it starts in the mouth. Mainly. I mean, you can put nutrients on your skin, especially on your neck, and you'll absorb those nutrients. You'll actually digest in the skin and absorb nutrients. That was discovered and proven in the late 50s and also in the 60s when it was repeatedly done with sick people who had no way of eating. And certain people were putting the nutrients on their head, putting it on different parts of the body, but they found that the neck was the most absorbent of any part of their body. So, what goes mainly into the mouth? Now take a look at the teeth structure. A lot of vegetarians say, we're built like the herbivores, animals who eat vegetation. Oh yeah?

Every horse and cow, sheep, goat that I've ever seen, they're all molars. They have nothing but molars in their mouth. They have no cutting teeth, and yet most of our teeth are cutting teeth. They're not as sharp as the canines and felines, and we do have four of those in our mouths, but most of our teeth are cutting teeth. We just have our hands to help us, so we don't need as sharp as teeth. You know, they rip mainly with their teeth, and they swallow it whole. So we go down their digestive tract, and our digestive tract, and we find that they have 15 times the hydrochloric acid we have in our stomachs. But we still secrete hydrochloric acid throughout the entire small intestinal tract. So we secrete just as much hydrochloric acid as they do, but we don't do the concentration in the stomach that they do, we break our food up into smaller bites than they do. They will swallow clumps this big if it's raw. Cooked, it gets too dry and gets stuck. With raw, they can chew big blobs like this, swallow it. They need a lot more hydrochloric acid to break it down because of those clumps. We don't eat like that, so we don't need that much hydrochloric acid. But still, we're built very much like the canines in carnivores, all the carnivores. Then we look at the rest of the stomach. We have one stomach. Herbivores have two to four stomachs. Then we go further down into the intestines. They have two and a half times longer intestinal tract than we do. They have 30 times the length of the torso, we have 12. Felines and canines have only about three to four times the length of their torso. It goes to them very quickly, very rapidly, but they have to because the concentration of hydrochloric acid infiltrates the system. And they can digest it that quick. They do it in 10 hours. Meat takes 24 hours to digest. 16 hours to digest meat. 24 hours to eat things that have cellulose in them. As long as it's not vegetation. So herbivores have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose and fat molecules to get the fat and protein from those cellulose molecules. 60,000 times more. So what happens with vegetation, whole vegetation in our system? That means leaves, stalks and roots. It constantly causes secretion of alkaline fluids in our intestines, neutralizes acidic bacteria and the acids that normally help us digest animal matter. Dairy, egg, meat. Also causes constipation in walled cougars. So what happens if you eat vegetation on a raw diet? Constipation. It interferes with digestion. Now it's fine if you're eating cooked meat. Eating a raw salad is good. Because the meat, once it's cooked, does not move through and digest properly. It has a tendency to putrefy. So eating a salad delivers some enzymes and vitamins and minerals to help partially digest the meat and keep it moving. So it doesn't putrefy and cause an ulcer in our intestinal tract. But when you're on a raw diet and you're eating vegetation, it slows everything down and causes constipation.

Even vegetable juice that has too much fiber in it can cause constipation in a person like me who's been a raw fooder for a long time. Raw meat and dairy and egg eater for a very long time. I did some vegetable juice last week. It was a juicer that wasn't my juicer. And it wasn't strained. And I had constipation for two days. So you have to consider everything about your system and how it works so you understand it. You won't be confused about what's happening in your body. That's the whole purpose here. So that you can be in control of what's happening in your body and you know what you're doing to it and you know what you can do for it. Now herbivores, when they have a patty, you look at that patty, if you analyze it, 50-75% of that matter is undigested, even in their systems. 50-75%. If it's dry hay that they're eating or dry grasses, 50% is digested. If they're eating fresh grasses, 75% is digested. But it's already predigested for certain humans if they don't have an access to protein. So you can eat herbivore manure that's dried very nicely, like a lot of tribes do. In Thailand, in the poor areas, the tribe's people will go out and find beetles. That will as well be one of their main diets if they can't afford meat. They don't have chickens and they don't have anything else. And they're rice farmers. They'll find the buffalo patties, after they're five days old, and they mark them for little, you know, bamboo sticks around there telling the time limit for them. And then they mark that in their brains and they go back. On the fifth day, they harvest the cow patties. What are they harvesting? They're beetles, like the Japanese beetles, that don't live on the food except for five days out of their lives, which is probably a third of their lives. And they go in there and they lay their eggs and they hatch in there, and the young ones feed on the shit. And they thrive incredibly. On the fifth day, they take flight. So the Thai tribespeople will go in on the fifth day and collect them before we take off and put them in containers. And that's what they will... They'll stir-fry them, water-fry them, not oil-fry them. They'll stir-fry them or eat them raw. Can you imagine going around eating Japanese beetles all day long as your snack? Thriving. These people are incredibly healthy. Wonderfully healthy. Better than those that are eating 90% rice and 10% meat that's cooked in oil. These people are thriving. And working in the rice paddies is a lot of strenuous work. Nothing but blazing sun all day long. And then you're half-steeped in water, so one part of you is all waterlogged and the rest of you is out there in the scalding heat. Let me tell you, the elements. That's stressful. Talk about, oh gosh, we live in such a stressful, emotionally stressful society.

If you haven't lived outdoors, you had no idea what stress is. Elements from day to night, wind. All of that's on you every day. Here, you're air conditioned and heating. You get in a car and go from here to there. You're not going through puddles of mud and rain and wind. You have no idea what stress is until you've lived outdoors. And I did for three and a half years. I mean, there were times when the storm was so cold that I couldn't sleep in a sleeping bag. I would put all the clothes from my saddlebags on. So I had, you know, like three inches of layers of clothes or even up to six inches of layers of clothes. Then a poncho, a rain poncho over that. And then I'd tie myself into a boat, bow in the tree, and sleep. What was I doing asleep? So you learn how to deal with all these things, these stress factors that are really stressful. You don't know if you're going to freeze to death all night because you're, you know, freezing. And it's freezing, and it's raining, and the wind is blowing hard. And just think, I didn't have all these clothes on. I mean, these guys go out and do it in just one layer. Animals do it easily. And we are so sensitive. We're so ill, we're so sensitive. We should be able to withstand, like the Eskimos who put one layer of fur on and that's all it takes. But when we go out there, we have layers and layers and layers, and then the fur over that. And then we're still cold. Why? Why, why? Because we're unhealthy. So, in digestion, digesting, if you look at the digestive tract, we are very much like all the carnivores. We have a system that is designed and built, all most of the acids in our system are designed and built for animal matter, animal tissue, liquids. Sure, we can survive on those other things, but what's the result? What happens if we eat fruit? What does fruit do in the human body? It has a tendency to ferment 90% of the time. It ferments. What happens when it ferments? We have alcohol in our system, excessive alcohol. What does alcohol do in the human body? It makes solid soaps. It starts dissolving bone minerals. It starts detaching minerals. It starts breaking down fats. It starts tearing the body apart. It may be good if you're very toxic and you need some waste products removed. Well, what happens if you eat it excessively? You become crazy. Emotionally unstable. Mentally imbalanced. Take a look at your monkeys. Those that live on fruit. Anybody ever seen a calm monkey that wasn't masturbating all day long? I haven't. And I've been into the jungles everywhere. And every monkey's crazy that lives on fruit. Those that live on bugs, you know, insects, and meat. Very calm. Very calm monkeys. Very calm apes. Apes only eat bananas when they're completely so green there's alamine when you put them in your mouth. They need to peel. They eat everything about that about the banana. Everything they eat on that banana.

No peeling. And it's as hard as hard can be. And you wonder, I try to eat them, but I can't. It's impossible. But that's the way they eat them. And everybody know who Jane Goodall is? The ape woman. Her father, John Goodall, was a friend of mine. When I was so sick and still couldn't get in front of the camera I was editing films. So he was in the editing room next to me and he did the film, the Academy Award winner documentary that was 1971 called The Beginning. He went all over the world and filmed all these animals giving birth. He lived with a gorilla for 30 days and filmed her giving birth. It was incredible. She's like this down and she goes walks over to the corner in this cage one movement the fetus is out in her hand, the baby's in her hand one contraction. So there's two contractions, one there, one here. Two contractions it's in her hand, she licks it clean bites the umbilical cord licks the baby in her hand no scream, no agony no pain, nothing. And he was showing me that when he was following gorillas around when he was studying them tribal gorillas they always ate these green bananas. Couldn't understand why they would eat these green bananas. They're almost impossible to eat. Well they are impossible of course, humans do. So the crew got a huge bushel, a bunch of bananas, cut it down put it in the back of one of their jeeps and let it ripen. So when they were yellow put it out there for the gorillas cause they were following the gorilla keeping the distance cause they were silverbacks, big gorillas. And the gorillas all went around these line of bananas and they're all so curious. I must have seen them before but probably just never approached them. It just didn't occur to them to do it. Here was this whole bunch sitting right in the midst of them so they start playing with them and bite them and they squish out all over. It was about 40 minutes they were in the field and started eating them. 20 minutes later they went into a sugar freak. They started you know, they all wanted to own all of the bananas so they were fighting over them. It was obsessive. Just like you do on the cameras. And they started fighting each other. One of the young ones was killed and the other one got a leg and an arm broken, one of the adolescents. And some of them are actually too big and there's no way that they could get it away from them. And they slept, the bigger ones slept on the pile of bananas so nobody could take them from them. That went on for almost 12 days. 12 days before they left the bananas. And they were afraid. The killer monkeys, they go on a fermented fruit binge 24 hours before they go on their killing spree. And they usually eat fermented figs and overripe bananas. And then they'll go kill for 24 hours. Anything in their sight. Even monkeys, go on killing sprees. The old Nordics, what did they used to do?

They would ferment their bread, get a mold on it, and what would they create? Lysergic acid. LSD. And they would drink a lot of alcohol and eat this fermented spoiled bread with all this LSD. And then they would go on a campaign of killing for about 10 days. Food can create a whole state of mind. So you have to know what food can do to you. So fruit is illegal in the Maasai tribe. No one in the tribe can eat fruit. Unripe or ripe. It is against their law. Because it changes them. They are the skinniest, tallest, most intelligent tribe in the world considered, by the archaeologists when they used to be able to mix with the tribes. 30 years ago, 35 years ago, when Shirley MacLaine and all those people went over there giving them candy and cakes and all that garbage. After about 12 years of that, they realized that that food was damaging their tribe. So they went to the government and said, we don't want the white man within 20 miles of our tribe. Into our villages. We will hike 20 miles out every day to sell them our wares, our trays, and do dances and rituals for them. But you don't let them near our children and our tribe, and they can't bring anything. And we won't take anything with us. So you can't get near those tribes, any of the Maasai people now. You just can't get near them because they protect themselves against it. And they have outlawed fruit. They always outlawed fruit. They outlawed anything from the white man. Because they know. And they are the smartest tribe in the world. But they're more affected because they're so skinny. They have no fat on themselves. They live a pure life. So they can't tolerate that kind of thing. They're more affected. Now the Fulani tribe lives 95%, 90% on dairy. So they've got a lot more weight. They're fat. They're robust people. In fact, you cannot become a chief or a shaman of that tribe unless you've improved to them. You can be one of the fattest of the entire tribe. And they do that for the one year period where the men, none of the women will do it because it causes them hardship in birth. Childbirth. But the women, I mean the men, will eat nothing but milk, gallons and gallons every day and see who can become the fattest out of those who want to be chief or shaman. And the fattest one wins. Why? Because it makes them calm, deliberate, and decisive. And they've got protection. They know that they don't have to worry about that individual in any kind of a dangerous circumstance. He's got the fat to protect himself. So, digestion is important for anything. How foods are eaten and consumed, consumed with form, how old they are, all of that will make a difference, unless it's dairy. Raw dairy never putrefies, it just becomes cheese.

If you let butter mold, it becomes blue cheese. You can make a great loaf or a dressing from it. Not harmful. If you let milk settle, it'll just become cheese, it gets harder and harder and harder, but never putrefies. Pasteurized dairy putrefies. When it spoils, the molds create a toxin, a veritoxin, that produces very ill-effects of a similar type to botulism. And botulism never exists in raw foods. It only exists in canned, controlled, contaminated food. And it mixes with the heavy metals and creates this black mold. You can see a similar relation to that with raw food. If you have meat sitting in a can letting it spoil, letting it break itself down, if that, if the enamel on the top or the plastic sealing up there lets the, exposes the metal, it will start turning black and that drips down into the meat. You've got metal poisoning, which is just like hot [unintelligible]. The gases, the chemicals that are discharged are poisonous to us. But again, it's in relation to a cauterized mineral that's metal. So it's forged, very high temperature degraded, cauterized elements. It's not natural rock or anything. We know that all of the tribes who used pottery and even fired that in low cones didn't have any problems. When they got up to 12, 15 cone to make, you know, to make porcelain and china, and then you [unintelligible] it to protect it, you've got poisons that can release into the food and poison you. Plastic gets warm, freezes, it gasses, it's PCBs into your food. You can be poisoned from so many things. And fat will protect you. So how do we digest fat in our bodies? Bile is the main thing that disassembles the fat molecule. I like this man, he's eating that good food.

Q: You're making me hungry.

A: He's never eaten raw food like that because he's had trouble now. It's raw meat. Liver makes bile. The liver manufactures, synthesizes bile. Bile is a caustic substance, not dangerous or toxic, unless you're a cooked food eater and lots of poison is mixed in the bile. It disassembles the fat molecules so they can be made into 60 varieties of cholesterol. Cholesterol. I said a bad word. Cholesterol. You have 60 varieties of important cholesterol. [unintelligible], the pharmaceutical houses wanted you to take medicine for high cholesterol. Everybody would have high cholesterol. 100 years ago, 99% of all the people who could afford to eat had high cholesterol. Everyone has high cholesterol. Hey, we can make a fortune, can't we? Because we make dietary supplements that we make, or we can get them to take lowering cholesterol drugs. Hey, dietary programs, exercise programs, exercise machines. What a whopping industry. All we have to do is declare cholesterol bad. If you want to really know the facts about cholesterol, get the book The Cholesterol Myth. This scientist, this biochemist, this individual is a genius on fats. That's why he calls it The Cholesterol Myth. You cannot do without cholesterol. Anyway, any form, any shape, it is dangerous. It causes disease. You have a third of those, so a third of those cholesterols, 20, 20 of those cholesterols are for, a third of them, are for protecting the body. A third is to give you the greatest amount of energy that you can have. And a third is to clean the body. All very important functions. How does it protect the body? It absorbs toxins. It makes a seal over your skin, like oil. Poisonous can't get in there. An insect gets on you, let's say a fly gets on you and there's saliva, which is meant to decompose the little things that they eat, all the little insects and things that they eat, bacteria, they'll put a serum on it, predigest them, so their stomach is on their surface. It's on the surface of whatever they're eating. That's their stomach. Then they absorb it after it's digested outside of their body. So the stomach's outside of themselves. So, if it gets on your body, and you've got good fat, a ceiling of fat, doesn't affect you. Doesn't affect you at all. There's lots of insects that do that. So, you're protected. Let's say a mosquito comes along and says, oh, I'm going to suck your blood. Now, it's not normal for mosquitoes to eat human blood. It's too acidic. They don't like it. It's not sweet. However, with our dietary habits, what happens? High carbohydrates, they love our sweet blood. We're just like the herbivores now. They say, look, aren't the mosquitoes one of those devils in nature that has no value? Who do you think pollinates those tiny little flowers? Mosquito does. The males, if you know, they're pollinating those tiny little flowers that bees can never pollinate. So, they have a purpose.

They don't eat or drink the blood for themselves. It's only the female. It's ten times larger than the male. So, what does she use the blood for? It feeds her larva. The larva feeds on it. But they need that hard, high carbohydrate blood that comes from herbivores. Like the deer, the goat, the sheep. That's what they used to feed on. Now, with the humans that start eating all this, oh, they will eat all those monkeys. It's a pressure to blood. They feed on those monkeys a lot. But they feed on us because we have high sugar content, just like the monkeys. And like the other herbivores. So, it feeds on them, and that doesn't mean that the mosquito itself feeds on them. It's for the larva. If you have an acid system, acid blood, maybe 5.5, let's try it around here, acid blood, guess what won't eat you? Mosquitoes and other insects won't touch you. Now, I go to Thailand and I was in Bali, in the jungles, Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos. And I've been in those jungles a lot. And everybody around me is getting eaten like crazy and I don't get a bite. Until I have one slice of watermelon. One slice of watermelon, that's all it will take. I can eat, you know, two days of eating mango, you know, unripe mango, and, you know, by the third day I'll get a few bites. But all I do is eat one little thin slice of watermelon like this and I'll be eaten that night by five or seven mosquitoes. Full. If you have a question, it's better to write it down or you will get sidetracked like we did earlier. So don't get sidetracked. So if you have a question, write it down. If I've not answered it by the end of the session, I'll be surprised. But you can ask it then for the question and answer period. So, fats protect the body. It also creates a fluid that if an insect bites you or eats you, they will not like it. So they smell it and they won't eat you or bite you. I mean, when I live outdoors, and I live outdoors still a lot when I go to those jungles, I don't have any problems. I mean, big old, you know, spiders crawl all over me, bats flying all over, vampire bats, I mean, nobody touches me. I'm on a diet that supports it, you know, unless I eat that piece of watermelon. And then I'm mosquito bait, or mosquito fodder. It just works just like that with watermelons. You have to be careful of what you eat, or if you're in a nice, you know, controlled environment, you don't have to worry about those insects that come around. You poison them, right? God, if they can kill insects, can you imagine what they're doing to the cells in your body? Well, they don't harm you, no. They won't kill you in an instant, but give them a few days, a few weeks, and they'll work on you slowly but surely. They will kill you slowly but surely. So... 

[audio cut]

A: The neurological system and the lymph. And they're all very simple systems until we get into cooked and processed foods. The blood has two jobs. To deliver oxygen to each cell and to remove carbon dioxide from the body, mainly expelled out the lungs. And the oxygen absorbed through the lungs to the skin is also a major part of absorbing oxygen through the skin and letting some of the carbon dioxide go out the skin, but the major part is the lungs. That is their sole job of the blood. But when we get into toxicity in the system, in a lymph system which job is to feed every cell in the body and to remove all the poisons, the lymph glands are so overloaded with disposal, waste disposal, that they can't do their job of feeding the body cells very well, so the blood takes a lot of that job. But still, the lymphatic system is responsible for feeding every cell in the body, including the blood and bone cells, as long as they're in the bone marrow. Once they get into the bloodstream, the blood gets its nutrients as it passes through the intestinal tract and the lacteal system. The lacteal system is the fine network, web network that comes off of the intestinal tract that feeds into the lymphatic system. It's called the lacteal system because when the food is absorbed from the intestinal tract into that, it's very milky. By the time the lacteal passes through the lacteal system to the lymph system, it's more translucent and less milky looking. But that's how the body works. Very simply like that. Now the neurological system, its fluid system is basically metal, metallically oriented. Most of the metallic minerals that are in the body will be concentrated in the brain and nervous system because it reflects light and conducts electricity. That's how that nervous system works. Main properties. So when you cook a food, you release all of the metals in that and they become free radicals. So they store mainly in the brain and nervous system. Now we say that the human brain has evolved and become very large. Why? Because they started cooking. And the brain, the more toxins the brain collects, the larger it has to be. 60% fat. Somebody calls you a fat head, it's very true. Don't be offended. Say thank you. And you want it. The more toxins you have, the more fat you want. Because the fat will bind with those poisons and prevent them from causing cellular damage. They do very little damage inside of a fat cell or a white blood cell. So in the white blood cells, their job is also to protect the blood stream. Anything that gets in it, there are phagocytes. They're fatty cells. The white cells are mainly fatty cells. And they bind with any kind of poison that gets into the blood stream.

Of course, the more toxicity we're subjected to environmentally and dietarily, the worse it's going to be and the more complicated it is for the blood stream and the rest of the body. Now, all of these levels, let's say you have a red blood cell level like this and a white blood cell level like this, it depends on what your work is, what you're subjected to. I have one client that was diagnosed as severe leukemic and was supposed to die 15 years ago. He's been on the diet 12 years. He doesn't even eat red meat. He eats fish and he eats chicken. He eats any kind of poultry. He's a marathon runner. His red blood cell count is extremely low. His white blood cell count is sky high. Asymptomatic because that's the perfect balance for his body. So all those ratios there to pharmaceuticals way of getting you to take medication for the rest of your life. Low blood pressure is a good one. They want you to have low blood pressure. People who have high blood pressure are getting high blood pressure for a reason. They're eating toxic substances which harden their arteries, harden their hearts, harden their capillaries. So of course the body has to have high blood pressure to make sure that these are open and the blood flows. So if they don't have high blood pressure, they're likely to have heart attacks. But you're given the opposite story. They're told if you have high blood pressure you're going to have heart attacks. Well a whole test came in, a whole group of tests came in from the UK in November which released I think it was something like 12,000 11 to 12,000 people were involved in the examination. And the people who had 160 to 170 staltic rate had no heart attacks. And those who were 110 to 120 with a low blood pressure medication had all the heart attacks. So it proved. And do you know how much media time they got? One day. One day media time. And it was wiped out. Because it doesn't make money. All of this time everybody has believed the medical the pharmaceutical community high blood pressure is bad, will cause heart attacks will cause aneurysms, will cause strokes and all of that. And out of those tests that came out, the high blood pressure was the life saver. You have to take a look at these things. Anytime you're giving a measurement anybody, don't believe it. You go by your symptoms. If you have symptoms, you have a problem. I've got 85% of diabetics come to me, are not even diabetic. They were diagnosed diabetic. Taking insulin. Their sugar level needed to be high. I had some diabetics, so called diabetics 300 sugar level, 320 sugar level, asymptomatic.

No ill symptoms of diabetes. It's the pharmaceuticals way of getting you to take medication for the rest of your life. $1200 a month from each person who is considered diabetic and there are 30 to 50 million of them in the United States, hey that's a good piece of money, every year. And they can count on it. And these people do not have your best interest in mind. They have money in mind. Just like the tobacco industry. They create addiction. And the doctors are paid off. $30,000, $50,000 a year in kickbacks for giving. And this was just released again about three weeks ago. In a publication from a medical journal, I forgot which one it was, but if you run a recent search on it, on Google, you'll probably come up with it. And there was a report written. And a doctor who investigated, he said he did it. And he knew that other doctors did it. And it was something like 86% of the doctors get kickbacks. 86% accept kickbacks. Tremendous amount. So forget the numbers. What are your symptoms? Always approach it from that point of view and then you won't have to be confused. You won't be stirred into a direction or guided into a direction or forced into a direction that has nothing to do with your health and your body. Okay, let's take the digestive tract. Now the digestive tract is a simple process. We put food into the mouth. The teeth structure tell you maybe what you're supposed to eat and get a good idea. A lot of vegetarians will say, oh we have the dental structure of an herbivore. Herbivores all have molars. All molars. No other teeth than molars. Do we have all molars? No. How many percent of our teeth are molars? Out of 32, how many do we have? About 1 fourth of them are molars. And those are crushing teeth. All the others are cutting and tearing teeth. So when you cut something and you need to chew it a few times to be able to swallow it, you need some molars to do that. Now the canines and felines have 15 times the hydrochloric acid in their stomach than we do, so they don't need to crush it. But they still rip it and chew it enough to be able to swallow it. We have just as much hydrochloric acid production as the canines and felines do, but we produce it all through the small intestines, not just in the stomach. And an herbivore, I mean a carnivore, like the dogs and the cats, felines and canines, they have a digestive tract about 3 times the length of their torso. We have one 12 times. The herbivores have one 30 times the length of their torso, two and a half times longer than ours. Herbivores have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fat and the protein from it. They take 24 hours to pass it through the 2-4 stomachs, and then multiple compartments within each stomach.

We have one stomach, two compartments. Stomach, duodenum. So they can process vegetation, and then when you look at their feces, it's full of straw, a lot of things that were never digested. So they digest about anywhere from 66 to 75% of what they eat. We do similar, but we have the ability to digest everything if we eat the proper thing. If we eat vegetation, you're only going to digest, at the most, 10% of it. 10%. And that's mainly the juices from it, the vitamins, the enzymes, and the minerals. Some of the minerals in that cellulose that is ripped apart and juiced and separated from the pulp, from that cellulose. So if you pass all through the digestive tract, you'll see that our digestive tract is very acidic. Mostly acid bacteria, and mostly acid enzymes, and juices all throughout both the stomach, I mean all three of the stomach, the intestinal tracts, both intestinal tracts, small and large. Bacteria is very important. We have somewhere around 10,000 varieties of bacteria in our small intestine and large intestine. The main one in the large intestine, the bowel, is E. coli. E. coli is responsible for the final stage of protein digestion. It breaks those molecules of protein and fats down into the smallest finite substances to feed the brain and the nervous system. And you notice people with colon problems have more of a problem with positivity and happiness. They are more irritable. All those people who do enemas, you notice those people who do enemas and colonics become more sensitive every year. They become hypochondriacs, but they're not really hypochondriacs because the body's getting worse and worse and worse because the nervous system is not being fed properly. So E. coli is very important. And now we have all this publicity and these food companies getting their doctors say E. coli is a bad guy. E. coli is a bad guy. Of course the 157 H7, 0157 H7, is the real bad guy. The problem is when I was looking to experiment with the 0157 H7 in a laboratory, I couldn't find it anywhere. Not even in these feed stalls. I could not find that E. coli anywhere. The only way I got it was like a friend who has a lab who's part of a university at Davis and he gave me a sample of it. It does not exist in nature. When I put an enzyme on it, it did not fractionate in the normal way that an E. coli fractionate. It split in two. It's a sliced man made bacteria. That E. coli is not natural. Something very sinister is going on there. And if you look at the process, what's the latest process? Blaming spinach. Put Popeye in a cat coffin. Spinach used to be the one where you took for power and you cleaned the blood and you cleaned the liver and the spleen and the pancreas. Great substance, spinach.

Well then you say it's contaminated with E. coli. Most people who don't or aren't finite intelligently are not going to look at H 157 I mean 157H7 and compare it to the other E. coli. They're hearing E. coli. All E. coli is bad. So if you have fecal matter, you're always going to have E. coli. If your main fertilizer on the planet is fecal matter, you're going to have E. coli on everything. And if they condemn E. coli, then what happens? Those fertilizers are banned. All natural fertilizers. Who makes money then? Dow, Monsanto, Gulf and Western, who own the agricultural businesses of artificial chemical fertilizers. And that is all the intention. You can better believe in the next five years, they're going to ban fecal matter as, I don't care where the manure comes from, they're going to ban it as a fertilizer. Because they'll say it's bad for your health, and we're going to prevent disease in the human race so we're going to sacrifice a little bit. And I can tell right away where it's going. They're cloning animals the same way. So all the animals, they did mad cow, mad sheep disease, stuff like that. Is that true? I can't find any cases in a natural setting where anything has E. coli. The deer that had the poisoning had been bombed by the military, both in this country and Canada, had a program where they were bombing the forest to see reactions on deer and other animals. And that was released two years ago by a man who blew the whistle on them. And there's a book out on it. I can't remember the name of it. But they started experimenting chemically on bombing people in this country as early as 1957. And they did an aerial test of DDT or one of those chemicals on one million people in Louisiana. And then they kept records of how many people went into the hospital with respiratory and other infections. That was just released about a year and a half ago. That testing. Our government and the Canadian government have been doing this since the 50s. In conjunction. So you have to understand a lot of this stuff is propagated to channel everything into you eating processed foods that are safe, using chemicals that are safe. And let me tell you the chemicals are causing the problems. The chemicals are causing the cancers. And I tell everybody if you got a cancer, analyze the tissue and see what is in that tissue. It's usually a heavy metal or a contaminant. Like Jeff's father had kidney cancer. So I said take a little bit of that specimen and have it analyzed. And he found high doses of cadmium. High level of cadmium in it. So he looked up cadmium in cancer and found out cadmium is a great producer of kidney cancer. There are other elements. I had quite a few patients and I checked their vomit when they vomited.

It cost me $2,300 or more a test. The last test that I did was an eight phase test on a tumor that a patient had that was this big. And I waited until it got that big until it started to obstruct his vision before I found a doctor who would remove it the way I wanted it removed. And it was very tricky because surgeons don't want to listen to anybody about how to do their job and they're very programmed about what to do. So they biopsied the tumor first, found out that it had melanoma cells but a very slight concentration. I mean it was, you couldn't even call it melanoma because the concentration was so small. So I got into conversation with him. He was the head of Kaiser this particular hospital of Kaiser. He was the head of surgery, a fairly young Italian doctor, probably 42 years old. And he wanted to remove all the lymph glands in the neck and have the antibiotics and all this. So the patient, who's like 63, had been with me probably five years, four or five years on the diet, and just following this thing and, you know, I could always look at him about every three to six months to make sure that the tumor wasn't attaching to the jugular and wasn't attaching to the nerves in the face. It stayed loose. And then at the end, when it got so big and started balling, it started to attach right here. So then I said, it's time to remove it. So the surgeon, you know, I said, think about it, doctor. I said, think about it. The lymph gland is responsible for cleaning toxicity out of the system and making the body better. You're going to, if you've got cancer anywhere in the body, you're going to find cancer cells in the lymphatic system. That doesn't mean you've got cancer of the lymphatic system. So why remove those glands? Just because another, you've got one lymph gland that is carcinogenic, that is cancerous. So, he said, okay, I get your point. Okay, I'll just remove the one. And I said, just let this be a test case for you. This is what the patient wants. As his guide, this is what I want. He agreed. So he removed it. I just saw the patient two days ago. And in great shape. Vision back. You know, he's a little sensitive to light. But he's got all this, put on a lot of weight again. You know, he's happy. He's vibrant. He's got all this energy. And when his eyes get back to the point where they're not going to be bothered by the light, he's going to be a powerhouse. All the lymph glands are still there except that one. That one little one that got this big. So I sent it to the laboratory. And this was a guy who'd been in the hippie era doing vitamins and mineral supplements. And that's what I found in this tumor.

The first one that I found in the tumor. He took vitamins and enzymes and mineral supplements for 45 years. And that's what this thing was a concentration of. I never, I didn't know that, you know, vitamins and minerals and enzyme supplements could cause a cancer. And I can't say that it was a malignant cancer because it had none of the activity that a malignant cancer did. Even though it had some little small amounts of cancer cells in it. So the body had made this hardened, I mean it was huge, it looked like football. Well, it looked like the shape of a heart. It looked like a heart. All kinds of layers, it was like it had a life of its own. I've got all the photographs and everything from it because I had to dissect the parts and analyze different parts. So I paid $8,000 for the tests on this one tumor. But I was able to find out what the constituents of that was to find. And I couldn't find any unusual unnatural chemical that I usually find. I'll find thallium or mercury or some lead or cadmium. That's usually what I find in tumors. This is the first one where I didn't find any levels that were significant in that tumor. One woman who had breast cancer and she came to me with a breast cancer and just beginning in the first stages and she's on the diet about three years. She had been ultra skinny. Then she put on 25 pounds. I wanted her to put on 35 pounds as I told her. If the tumor starts dissolving she needed enough fat and minerals and everything else in the body to bind with that acrid substance so she didn't start losing tissue and then that burning other tissue and then it just, that acrid substance just keeps dissolving all surrounding tissue and that's usually why people die. Not just because of the cancer, it's because the fluids that are in the cancer cell, which is like a virus, dissolves dead cells. Like I said in my book, in my research of cancers, cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve dead cells and remove them from the body. So the body collects them in tumors, whether benign or cancerous. If it's cancerous that cell is a specialty cell. It has a fluid in it like a virus, which is a soap, a solvent that will dissolve all the surrounding tissue that are hardened and dead tissue. You're only going to find one cancer cell surrounded by up to 500 dead cells. And the blood stream going through it. Now in a benign cell, you don't find veins going through the tumor. It's a solid tumor in a mask and your body has to dissolve it from the outside in. But when you have a cancerous cell, you've got blood circulation going through it and it's feeding these cancer cells. All the surrounding tissue around every cell is dead cells. Mummified dead cells the body hasn't been able to dissolve and get rid of.

So what happens when the body is isolated into this tumor however big it is, then it decides to dissolve the tumor. Each cancer cell when it dies releases that serum. Then it can dissolve anywhere from 100 to 200 surrounding dead tissue. And then you have a dissolved tumor. That's why you can have an overnight reversal of the tumor because it can just dissolve like that. Now that your body has the nutrients to be able to bind with that acrid waste. If it doesn't, it's going to keep dissolving anything it comes in contact with. So this patient started coming through the tissue and she went through a period and a lot of cancer patients do that, goes through a period of intense vomiting. And the poisons are dumping into the stomach and they're vomiting the poison that caused the cancer because this is dissolving. So, like I said, she only gained 25 and I wanted her to gain 35 because I've been around this a long time. And she's only 5'5". And she went from like 1, 20, 6 pounds, you know, and only 25 pounds heavier. I wanted her to go up at least 10 more. So she went through two and a half months of this vomiting episode and I just took one 4-ounce vomit and I sent it to the laboratory. The lab, head of the laboratory called me and said, somebody's poisoning your patient. And I said, what do you mean? He said, well, she has 3,000 times the lethal dose of thallium. Thallium is not readily available. Somebody's poisoning her. I said, she was a jewelry maker. She never wore a mask and she never wore gloves. Right over that Bunsen burner with that thallium going up into it. She had all these metals and she went through stages of vomiting each different metal. Mercury was separated. Thallium was separated. Lead was separated. All the metals were separated in her bouts of vomiting. So she vomited thallium for about a week. Lead for about two weeks. So all these compounds were being discharged and she had so much of it because she was right over the Bunsen burner breathing the smoke. The vaporized metal. And never wearing gloves too. She was at the end. All the cancer was gone but she starved to death. She needed that extra ten pounds to make it that one more week where she could have recovered. I've been around it a long time and I know. And she was just too vain to put that extra ten pounds on. You can't do that. If you have cancer, you want to get as fat as you can be. As fat as you can be for all the protection in the world and eat a lot of cheese to absorb that stuff. The body will use calcium, magnesium, potassium, phosphorus in great amounts to bind with poisons.

To take it, because all your free radicals are acidic. They're acrid. So your body uses the alkalizing minerals to neutralize that.
Otherwise it will go in and melt your body apart. Damage it. It will actually melt your body. Dissolve it. Burn it. Even sulfur. It will burn your system. And they get sulfur drugs to dry the system out. What a hell of a way to dry it out. With burning the system. Not a good way. And sulfur stores in the body. Terrible. So your body uses minerals to bind with things. To have a great example of that, if you want to do some tests to find out the truth of dental decay and arrest and receding gums, all that plaque is predominantly calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium. In midst of that, you're going to find mercury, you're going to find aluminum, and you're going to find high concentrations of metals. When the brain detoxifies, remember the high metal content in the brain and nervous system, dumps out the gums, the salivary glands, and tongue. You get a white tongue, that's a lot of calcium, potassium, phosphorus and magnesium bound to poisons coming from the brain. So if you've got a coated tongue, be thankful. You've got enough minerals to bind with it. If you've got a blue tongue, you're in trouble. Eat more cheese, drink more dairy. Because those poisons are not bound with enough minerals to isolate it. So, when you have plaque on your teeth, that's the body dumping the heavy metal out the gums, and your body taking minerals and binding with it so it doesn't damage the dentine. However, what happens with thallium, mercury and lead? It will take hundreds of thousands of molecules of calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium to handle a few hundred of those toxic metals. So if it stays on there, the metals start breaking down the alkalinity and get through and start eating away at the dentine. Then you have bacteria results that's eating the dead, destroyed dental dentine cells 
And then if it goes into the tubules, it will affect those. But your bacteria is not the cause of decay. It's the heavy metals being set free from the brain and nervous system, mainly the brain, out the gums. So, yes, you need to brush your teeth and you need to get that plaque off before the heavy metals do damage in your dentine. How you remove it is something else. Fluoride is highly toxic. All the fluoride experiments, especially those done in Boston in the 50s, people had less dental cavities in the groups that had fluoride, you know why? Their teeth fell out. They had fewer teeth, so they had fewer cavities. Actually caused something like 22% of tooth loss.

That much tooth loss. Fluoride can't be good for you, if it does that. However, fluoride is one of the major byproducts of the military-industrial complex. They have to get rid of it. So it goes in every water system. Because the military is that powerful. So they disperse it among everybody for national security. And that's why fluoride is everywhere. Because when they make tanks, when they make guns, all this metal, fluoride is the main byproduct. And it's a toxic substance. It's a terrible substance. So anyway, you have all that heavy metal coming out, going around your teeth. Just think if you're on a low-calcium diet. You're a vegetarian. And why do vegetarian teeth turn grey? Quickly. Turn brown and grey. Because the poison is going down and they don't have enough calcium and magnesium and potassium phosphorous to bind with those metals. So they're getting into the nerves. They're getting into the dentine. They're eating into it and they become a part of it. People who take cocaine have the same problem. Cocaine is very concentrated in those heavy metals. And tetracycline is the same thing. That's why teeth turn grey. It forces the heavy metals into the nervous system. So you have to be very careful about that and deteriorate the system. It turns white spots on the teeth as they grey. All of that is toxins coming from the brain and nervous system. All a matter of your intake. Whether it's environmentally breathing it through your skin or eating. The body rejects poisons everywhere. I say that we're all one big asshole. Now if you look at nature the asshole shouldn't even be called something bad. The anus. Because in an animal that is in nature even their urine is not toxic. Their urine can be consumed, their fecal matter can be consumed by all kinds of different creatures. You see the animals going around and licking each other all the time. Getting that E. coli. Why isn't it damaging them? Why don't they have disease? Because it's not contaminated. It is a natural good product. Let's say an animal a baby, a pup or a kitten or any other animal you know that's a pup of a squirrel or whatever is having problems with its nervous system. The mother will actually feed it mix in some fecal matter the baby's own fecal matter and some of the mothers or some of the fathers or one of the other offspring mix it with a little saliva and give it to the pup and then milk following it. Medicine. Animals do this every day. And we say oh that's disgusting. We're told that it's disgusting. And it's not disgusting. It's healthful. All creatures do it and they don't have disease unless man has given them a science diet or something like that. I used to do tests on animals on the science diet because I noticed that my patients who had animals were on the science diet, had severe kidney stones that would grow within six to eight months repeatedly. 

I had an English mastiff that was 260 pounds. And he had to have kidney stones removed every six months. He was on the science diet. And I finally, after I kept showing him that this was the repeating of it, and I got the man who owned the dogs to change the diet to just raw meat, raw milk and honey and butter and some raw eggs. All his animals. He had a whole menagerie of animals, all different kinds. And one of them was a pug that was 14 years old, completely blind with cataracts, had MS, he couldn't even move on his own. He had to move, you know, press on the back and on the stomach up and urinate and defecate. Could not walk. His master, he called it, he was their master, used to have to take care of that side and manipulate the dog. So I put all the dogs on diet, you know, he said, well, just put that dog on the diet. I said, no, no, no, no, no. All of your dogs are going to get upset if all of them are getting healthier eating the one diet, you know, the one's eating, the other's aren't. So do it to all of them. So the pug got involved in the same one along with the English Mastiff. In six months, that pug was half of its cataracts were gone. 90% of the MS, it was jumping up and down off the couch, going out the doggy door, on his own, moving on his own, everything was fine for that dog except a little bit of the hearing was still gone and half of his vision. But he could see enough to make it through without ever hitting the side of the doggy door. You know, so that was the dramatic process on animals. And they're licking each other all the time and it's not a bad thing. So you have to get away from this germ phobia. The medical profession had adopted the germ theory starting way back in the 1700s, 1600s. And Pasteur made it more believable because he found that... Pasteur wasn't a doctor, he was a would-be chemist. He was just a regular 80-year-old worker that had an interest in crystals. He liked to watch crystals grow and examine the growth of crystals. So he really didn't know anything. But a friend of his had a vineyard and a fungus had gotten into the vineyard and, of course, destroyed the crop for that year. And his friend was not a wealthy man. He was middle class, okay. And if he lost his crop, he would lose some of his land. So Pasteur found that if he heated the wine, pasteurized the wine, he could still stop the mold from turning it completely. So, of course, that wine went to the peasants, sold to the peasants, because it was not considered a good wine because it didn't go to its full fermentation process. The fermentation process was even curtailed because it had been pasteurized and the molds were part of it, so it was sold right away. So it wasn't put in a cellar to age.

It was just sold immediately to the peasants for very little money. So, that is the way the whole food industry grew. And then people started taking notes of Pasteurs way of handling that, so they realized that, you know, if you want to have a food that preserves, you need to get rid of all the mold factors in it, all the spores that are a natural part of almost every fruit and every leaf out there, and even in human we have spores, like the gangrene, which is a natural spore in the human cell. So you need to destroy all these. So they found all these ways by the early early 2000s how to destroy all of these things. But in destroying them and preserving shelf life, it destroys everything good. So then poisons react, you know, they have to fortify everything. So you know, Dell Davis and some of those more aware nutritionists in the 60s and early 50s bragged, were saying that we don't feel as good on these foods. These are not a good thing. There's something wrong with processing food. And you know, they weren't into the chemistry of the byproducts that would form, that would cause toxicity, like I have listed. And I only have 32 of them listed in the last 50 pages of my recipe book. But that's only 32 identified. It doesn't count all the other ones that may be there that I didn't identify. But 32 toxins just from cooking, that doesn't count processing, adding chemical preservatives, colorings and everything that are chemical. All these things have a reaction. And Dell Davis, Bragg and a lot of those people, and Walker, were aware of the diminishment of their health when they consumed those foods. But who rules? Big dollars rule. So they run the government. So all of the rules and regulations that are coming out of the FDA and USDA are based on friendliness to the food industry and the drug industry. So what happened when Bragg and all those people said, oh, this is a bad food. It lacks this vitamin, that vitamin. And it destroys everything else, a lot of things in them. So what did the food industry do? They went and got a synthetically made vitamin and we'll put it in there and it says fortify with this vitamin. How do you know that that vitamin is good? Take vitamin D, for instance. You can see that the results of the FDA tests that they guided that were released last year that showed vitamin D as a dangerous substance that caused death. Death. You know why? They would take a very poor grade oil, vegetable oil, or mineral oil and they irradiate it. Irradiate it. With an isotope or light. And they call it vitamin D. It does not have the same molecular structure as a natural vitamin D as it appears when the sun changes a vitamin D structure into a fat cell on the skin.

Entirely different molecular structure. Doesn't even look 40% like the natural vitamin D. But they call it vitamin D and they fortified it. So they sell you on buying this product because it's fortified with a vitamin. FDA, USDA, and everybody else lets them get away with it. This is like calling thimerosal-free, mercury, thimerosal-free, which is mercury-free, vaccines when they've just reduced it. And it's not mercury-free at all. There's mercury in there, a lot of it. Enough to poison any person that it enters. And damaging the whole structure in this system or this system. So, all of that fortification is all sales pitch. Where does most of your vitamin E come from? 99.9% of the vitamin E comes from Fuji and Kodak. A scientist that was given the task of reducing the toxic value of this developing fluid in result of it, because they used to have to put it in big cauldrons, you know, stainless steel drums and bury it in walls so it would never get moisture. 12 inch concrete thick walls. Takes a lot of money to build those and the land. It's expensive. Hundreds of million dollars a year for the isolation of that. You saw what happened when they did with Japan. They were just dumping it into the ocean. And when I was there in the 60's, my father showed me, he put an undeveloped film in there and it came out developed. Right in the water on the shore. They couldn't eat the fish there or anything. So of course, you know, by the late 60's they had to contain it because it was killing people. And there were no reports on it. Japan's government kept it all hush-hush and secret. Conspiracy began with Kodak and Fuji. Fuji over there, Kodak had labs over there too. Its main labs because it didn't want to dump its pollution there. So one of their scientists realized that it looked like tocopherol. It had 76% of the molecular structure of tocopherol, which is alpha-D tocopherol is vitamin E. So he said, look, this is tocopherol. We'll call it vitamin E. We'll call it alpha-tocopherol, not D-alpha-tocopherol, to show that it's a slight difference. We'll sell it as vitamin E. 99.9% of the vitamin E out there comes from that source. Even your natural stuff that the health food stores sell, 5-10% of it is natural from soy or corn. Only 5-10% of the rest is that contaminated chemical. Now, nobody tells these companies that it is a poison from Koji or Fudak. Koji... Fuji or Kodak. Put them together. They belong together. The only reason I found out is because my nutritionist, the person who educated me who was my tutor, he told me about it. He learned it when he was studying for his doctorate.

He was going to be an M.D. and realized that it was all so bad in his third year of internship that the people were getting sicker and sicker instead of better. His mother was an old Italian who used food as medicine. He saw the difference between his mother's remedies and what they were doing at the hospital. So he quit. He quit. I mean, he was almost finished. He quit and became a nutritionist. He was one of the top in L.A. Anyway, he showed me, he showed me the research and everything that showed me what the measure of tocopherol was and how they were selling this chemical as a food, as a food to help you get better. And, you know, I worked at a health food store in 1977 and 78, and Diane Cannon and all those people were coming in buying bottles of, you know, vitamin E for their skin. And I kept telling them this was a chemical. Oh, no, no, the government wouldn't do that, you know. The government wasn't allowed to do that. And they said, well, show us the research. I didn't have it. My nutritionist, you know, dead a long time and, you know, well only a few years, and I don't have that research. I didn't get it before he died. I was out bicycling all over the world, all over the country, all over the continent, and North American continent. So, he said, you know, they didn't believe me. What happened to Diane Cannon? Her skin got paper thin, like toilet paper thin, and you could go like this and her skin would just rip open. That is a solvent. That chemical vitamin E is a solvent. It would just cause her skin to get paper thin. She would take a bottle, a quart bottle of those capsules a week. And she also started deteriorating her brain and nervous system. Anybody see her story on TV? She went bananas, and psychologically she was institutionalized, got on the drugs. She couldn't figure out what was happening, and I kept telling her, vitamin E, stop it. Stop the vitamin E. She didn't listen to me. So it took her eight years to get to the point where she realized that she had to change her habit. And she went through a lot of suffering to get there. Lost her career and everything. Everything was gone. Her friends, everybody left her. So, these things that they're selling you, if they're processed, you can better believe it's just to sell. People are trying to make money. Have a product. Some of them, a few of them, have good intentions. And they say, well, we're going to make something that's healthy. And they'll start going to different chemical companies and say, I need this and this and this. But those people don't know the origin of those chemicals. The chemical companies are making money. Oh, this is good for that. This is healthy for that. And these people don't have a clue.

And they're putting mineral and vitamin supplements together. And they're nothing other than toxic chemicals that these chemical companies are selling. They've got nothing to do with health. So it's all marketing. If you see any product that's sold to say, oh, this is fortified with this, this is high in this vitamin, you know it's a bad product. It is worse than a product that isn't being sold with some concentration of chemical in it. And they're all chemicals. They have to be processed. If you're extracting a vitamin from a food, you have to extract it with heat or some kind of chemical. And most of the extracting chemical is made from kerosene. Sound good? Who wants a jar of kerosene? Who wants a cup of kerosene for today? Almost everything is processed that is extracted uses a kerosene by-product. A kerosene derivative. Used to use gasoline. But there was too much gas, there was too much vapor that was too volatile. Too many fires in the production. So they started using kerosene. I think that that was just as volatile, but for some reason the gases aren't as great as they are with gasoline. And it burns slower or something, so there's a reason you should care. The kerosene will fractionate anything. And it etches in to wherever it is. I've seen the molecular structure. You take these supplements, and you look at a natural one, entirely different. Take vitamin C for example. Vitamin C looks like little spongy balls, little hairy spongy balls. Multicolored, pastel looking, multi little balls. It looks like children you could play with. Very soft. You look at the ascorbic acid. Looks like somebody's broken a mirror. And the molecular structure, let's say that the vitamin C is about this size, you know, on a microscopic level. In comparison to the ascorbic acid, pieces of glass this big. Sharp, angled. And when they go into the blood stream, slices and cuts everything that meets the cells. Blood cells. Sure it gets rid of fat. Sure it gets rid of symptoms. Like Linus Pauling found. The body's so toxic, it's dealing with that vitamin C every moment. And if you're taking it several times a day, your body's going to stop all detoxing of everything else that's poisonous in your body, which are your symptoms. So certainly, it makes you look well. But look at Linus Pauling. Died a very skinny, irritable man. Everybody I knew took high levels of vitamin C, got very skinny and very irritable. And I worked two years watching people take powdered vitamin C in 77 and 78.

Dianne Cannon did too. But she wasn't eating enough of that fat for her body to take that what's it called? Fatty substance that... Lipids and the acetates and acetones which that vitamin E was a product of. It was a fat base. So when these go into the body, of course, your body is going to use those to bind with toxins. So she was eating enough of those vitamin E oils, acetates, to be able to bind with some of that vitamin C. But it did thin her skin, but it didn't make her skinny until it took her a lot longer than most people who took that powdered vitamin C. Taking a gram of it at a time several times a day. All of those things are very toxic. You have to be very careful. Don't believe anybody that tells you they have a natural supplement. There is no such thing. The closest supplement I use is cheese. That's a supplement. It's a dried food. There are no active enzymes in it. Your pancreas is going to have to do a lot of work to digest that. But I don't use cheese that way. I make sure that if you have cheese, that it's as a detoxifier. It's a sponge to grab toxins, to attract them into the digestive tract. Whether it's the throat, the mouth, the esophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the small intestines, or the large intestines. Those minerals in the cheese actually magnetically pull poisons out of the three systems as they weave their way through the digestive tract. Your neurological system, your lymphatic system, your bloodstream. As they weave their way through the digestive tract, the cheese can actually, with the minerals, clay can do this too, but not as well. And the cheese just pulls it out of those systems, holds onto it, and you don't digest the cheese. It'll just pass through the body, and you're taking poisons out of the body. The only time you can digest cheese is when you put honey in your mouth with the cheese. You know, honey with anything else, like in a milkshake, it will not affect the digestibility of the cheese. Honey and the cheese have to be together in the mouth. Then you will be able to utilize all of those minerals that are in the cheese for cellular absorption. So if you want a mineral supplement, honey and cheese is the way to do it. The proper way to do it. So you do that twice a day to build the system. Now let's take a look at the glandular system. Okay, we take a look at the pituitary and the pineal gland. We don't know really what the pineal does. Some people believe it's the seat of consciousness. It's the thing that allows us to have an other reality, an imagination. It's the key to the fluids. Build hormones for the imagination. And it could be very true. It's hard to prove.

Pituitary has to do with growth and functionality. And to help cells reproduce. So that if it goes malfunction, you lose as a child, you lose growth hormones at a very young age. It stunts the growth. If they produce in an excessive amount, you can have growth hormones all the way up into your 30s and 40s. It's rare, but it does happen. If you're eating raw foods, it functions until you're dead. If I want to, and if I eat properly, I can put 50 pounds on in 3 months and put tremendous muscles. I'll give you an example. A fellow came to me at 56 years old, chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia. Doctors have been working on him for 11 years without help. He just kept staying thin, thin all of his life. He always wanted to have muscles, look good, have big shoulders, all of this. He was always skinny, even up in the shoulders. He was on the diet 2 years, from 56 to 58. His age, 56 to 58. He got to look different. I mean, he started developing, his shoulders grew. It was in his 50s, his shoulders started growing, shoulder bones. So he grew. He says, you think, and he came to me at that point for a follow-up, he says, you think I can bodybuild at my age? I said, sure, just eat a pound of meat twice a day and a whole lubrication formula, a whole one, after each meal, after each meat meal. So he did, did the normal diet, milkshakes, lots of eggs and milk and cheese and honey and cheese together sometimes. And in 2 and a half months, he put 4 inches on his arms and 6 and a half inches on his chest. So at Gold's Gym, they were accusing him of using steroids. He says, no, no, I'm just using raw eggs, milk, raw meat and honey. They didn't believe him. Didn't believe him. But it works that way. It can work that quickly. And the pituitary, if it's not functioning, I found 2 people that their pituitaries were not functioning. And they only gained 13, one gained 13 pounds only and the other gained 28 pounds. And these were 2 men. And they were ultra skinny. One was 5'9 and 110 pounds. He gained 28 pounds and stopped there. Because his pituitary wasn't functioning. And I, you know, getting a pituitary out of an animal's brain is not easy. And eating a lot of brain, he just wouldn't do it. And that's the thing that I suggested that he do to try it. But he wouldn't do it. He ate a couple of brains, you know, calves' brains. But, you know, getting them is very expensive and stuff like that. So getting a brain is like $75.

Q: You gotta want it.

A: Pardon?

Q: You have to want it.

A: Yeah. Oh, brain is so sweet and delicious. They're incredible. Incredible. That's why they did monkey brains in Japan and some in China. You know, they're incredible and sweet. You know, testes are the same way. You know, so, anyway, getting the brain is $75. You know, sometimes you get it and it's all mush by the time you get it. So, depending on who's handling it, sometimes they'll freeze it and it doesn't have the same effect. At least with the gland. So, with the testes, it's okay. The ovary's okay. Those cells seem to be able to withstand freezing. You know, that's why they can use ovum and sperm you know, freeze frozen and still get them to procreate and develop. Because they can handle, like all seeds, can handle freezing. And then you plant them and they grow. You know, heat, they don't, certain levels of heat, they don't withstand. You know, and they don't grow well. Those sprout and grow to a certain point to die. But freezing, even at very extremely low temperatures, you can still get them to grow. So, freezing does a lot of damage with certain glands and so if you eat that gland, it doesn't help as much as it could if they weren't frozen. So, building the body, that gland, the pituitary gland has to do with growth and development. That's a pretty simple process and we keep that going and creating raw meat for most people. Like I said, only two out of probably 11,000 people that I've seen in the past 30 years and only two could not gain weight, the kind of weight that they wanted to gain. Then, we go down, we have the thyroid. The thyroid has to do with activity of the heart and the liver and to keep everything working in the lungs, keep everything working while you're asleep, while you're functioning. It has to do with that. You have the parathyroids, two on both sides of the thyroid in case the thyroid is down for cleansing. These are backups. And the little bit in those little parathyroid glands are concentrated in thyroxins and producing thyroxins as the whole thyroid gland. So they're like, you know, they're hyped up sports glands. Then you go down to the thymus. The thymus protects the lower glands and also helps protect the lungs. All very simple. Then we have the heart. We know that's mainly a muscle. It has a whole big repository of fat on the top to protect it. It needs fat at any time. It can take some of those molecules very rapidly. And if you've ever looked at a heart, there's a huge pocket of fat on top of it. And if you look at a child, I've seen two children without a fat deposit on there. These children were very weak and their hearts never developed fully. They had small hearts, deformed small hearts. And they didn't develop well. Their respiratory systems were not good because their blood wasn't flowing well and they didn't have a lot of pressure in the heart, and they only lived to 13.

I know there's a lot more, but I was only able to get access to two individuals that were like that. So, fat is a very important part of the heart to protect it. And that's quite a pool of heart fat on top. We're not talking about a little amount. It equals about 10% of the heart. That's a lot of fat. Some hearts even have more. Some hearts have up to 20-23% fat protecting them. And that will give you an idea of where I'm going to go with fat. Then, we have the lungs. Of course, they absorb oxygen. They get rid of toxins in the system. You breathe, whether you're awake or asleep, just like the heart beats. The thymus, I mean the thyroid, and the parathyroids mainly keep that function going with those hormones. The adrenal glands that sit on top of the kidneys give the body its power, its physical energy to be mobile and strong. And one little pin drop of that can allow a woman to lift a 3,000 pound car off of a car that's going to roll over their baby. That's been proved. And you have to be careful. I mean, you may have maybe 50 molecules of adrenaline in 3 cc's that you're pumping into a heart during a heart attack. 50 molecules of adrenaline to get that heart going again. That's how concentrated that stuff is. The rest is all chemical based, and it's all nonsense. The pharmaceuticals can make it available for 10 cents. But one of those injections is about 400 to 500 dollars. It's absolutely insane. Anyway, adrenaline is for physiological muscular energy and force. They make those steroids chemically produced on a molecular structure similar to adrenaline. That's where they get that. And adrenaline feeds the muscles up. Again, it's a chemical. The steroids are chemically developed. So they will damage the system because they have something like 3200 types of chemical reactions in the stages of developing those particular substances. Those particular synthetic hormones. Then we have the kidneys. The kidneys, their only job is, if you're healthy, to filter out water. So that you can regulate body temperature. It won't filter out the water, if you're hot, they'll leave the water in to thin the blood. If you're hot, I mean if you're cold, the kidneys will work immediately to draw the water, excess water, H2O, out of the bloodstream, so your blood will get thick and stay warm. When you're cold, you start peeing frequently. Urinating frequently. Because you're cold. Kidney needs to get rid of the water. Also another gland, another organ of the body that functions that way is the spleen. Now the spleen does not develop or produce anything. It holds extra red blood cells. 

A pint to two pints, depending upon the size of the person or the animal. That was for, let's say, we were swinging around in the trees or throwing around a rock or something and somebody got hit and they lost a cup of blood. They would be anemic for about 30 days to 45 days till the body was able to replace the red blood cells efficiently and mature the red blood cells mature enough to give the body a lot of strength. Because an immature red blood cell does not transport much oxygen. Hardly any. If it's in the red blood cell, if it's in the blood stream, it is a leech. It eats what's in the blood stream but does not provide the transport of oxygen or the transport of carbon dioxide. So it's just not mature, it's not working. The cell, red and white blood cells are usually released from the bone marrow where they breed only when they're mature. Then they go in and do their functions. So a lot of people who have immature red blood cells, they have a bleed. But the spleen holds that excess red blood cell. And mature red blood cells. So if you have a bleed, it shoots it right back into the blood stream and you're okay. If you stop the bleed, you're okay. So it can also do the same to help the kidney warm and cool the body. Say the blood is very thin and you're cold. The kidney's working on removing the water, the H2O excess, and the spleen is dumping more red blood cells in to thicken it even faster so you can be cold and you can be warm instantly. Take a look at the eskimos. You can see from sonograms when they're with their fur coat on, and they wear their fur inside, the fur's on the inside, leather's on the outside. It's like a jungle in there. I mean, it's so hot you perspire. And you can be at 30 degrees below and a chill factor of another 40 below, and you can feel like you're in Thailand, or in Indonesia, where it's just like a steam bath inside. And that's the way they wear them. But you can see it. If they don't have their clothes on, and they go outside in the freezing cold, their spleen will get small, smaller. And then it'll get larger when they get warm. And you can see their blood getting thinner and thicker. So, that's how I discovered that the spleen will also help the kidneys thicken and thin the blood. That way, for some of these to thin it, you know, the spleen will draw some of the red blood cells out of the bloodstream. So, all these things are functions that make us healthy and able to endure many things in our environment. And when we cook foods and process foods and chemicals, we destroy all of that. We interfere. We complicate the body. Like I said, the lymphatic system is a network that's just as complex as the blood and the neurological system. And it's got little nodes. Thousands of them.

Hundreds of thousands of them spread throughout the body. The glands are less frequent. There may be about a thousand glands, lymphatic glands, in the body. And the largest part in the neck, the glands, I mean under the arms here, in the arms here, and in women, all over the breast. And then down the groin area, all in the inside of the legs, all up into here. And you can feel sometimes you have swollen glands down there. They're absorbing the toxins to neutralize those poisons and then to send them out the skin or some other way of the body. And the body will discharge poisons, as I said before, out of everywhere. Through the mucus, they will put them in the mucus so that you drain the mucus. Through the skin, out the hair, build them into the hair, the nails, like heavy metals. That's why you have a high ratio of heavy metals in hair, when you go have it analyzed. The body will throw it out the tear ducts, the ear wax, the salivary glands, the gums, the tongue, everywhere it can, everywhere there is leakage, the body will discard poisons because it's the only thing it can do. And we're just inundating the body with poison. When you're eating raw foods and you're getting in touch with everything that's natural and no chemical pollution, nothing is toxic, even your waste products are not toxic. Some creature eats them after you expel them and it's their life. And they thrive on it. That's why manure is good fertilizer. But take human manure and what happens? The crops don't grow so well. And they have deformities in the crops. If you want to see that in heavy form, look at Canada. Canada forced fertilizers with human waste. Many, many of the farmers, and it's forced. They have to do it. So the cities come by with these big tanks of human waste and spread them on your land. Whether you want it or not. Just this year, there's some people that have become aware of the problem and some of the parliament and they're starting to change the law. What are they going to do with that waste after that? The population, because of the expansion, is going to have to become a lot more aware of the results of everything. And there's a great conflict there. Chemical industries don't want that. The big agribusinesses don't want that. They want everything poisoned so that you'll eat what you consider safe food that has a long shelf life. Nothing to do with your health care. It's the money they're concerned with and their product. The women live about 20% longer than men. The only thing that I found that could scientifically validate that is that women produce 20% more mucus that flows out their vaginal cavity. 

It means they get rid of 20% more toxins than men do in their menstruation and even when they're not menstruating they can have a yeast infection. It's getting rid of tons of poison. I remember one woman that had yeast, I mean she had huge cottage cheeses this big coming out. So I wanted to know what it was. So I analyzed a half a cup and sent it to a lab report. I said I wanted them to run three tests on it. So they take a third of it at a time, I give my half a cup of it that she collected for a little over a week. Guess what was in it? Penicillin fungus. Penicillin fungus. And I found, so that led me to other explorations of penicillin. If penicillin is not natural to the human body it belongs in the bird community. Birds naturally have penicillin molds that help them get well. In the human body it doesn't react well especially when it's processed and sterilized and mutated and put in the human body, but it still thrives. Mold will survive almost anything. Fires, anything. But it changes its structure. So I found that in the cases of, I found a way to identify it in the irises in a penicillin mold. And I found that 90% of the IBS, inflammatory bowel syndrome, and digestive disorders, including Crohn's disease, was caused by penicillin given at a young age. And they're pumping children with penicillin a few days old. I remember a famous senator brought his granddaughter to me who had Crohn's. And she was 13, 13 and a half at the time. Her knees were this big. Because what happens in Crohn's, if it's chronic or, you know, severe, it causes lesions in the intestines and food path, undigested food, passes into the gut, and from some reason goes to the joints. Knees usually first, then the hips, and then the shoulders and elbow. In that order, most often. Not all the time, but 80% of the time, that's the order. And this little girl had gone to her knees and her hips, and they were very large, and it was starting to go to her elbows, so they were starting to get large. So, the daughter of that senator had been on the diet for about three years, and the senator didn't like it. But when he saw his granddaughter getting worse and worse and worse, and this was a granddaughter from another daughter, and not the daughter who was on the diet, so he brought her to me. He brought her to me, the grandfather. Put her on the diet, six months later, her knees were almost normal, she was functioning well, did the diet for a year and a half, asymptomatic for a year and a half. And then, she wanted to be like all the other kids, so she thought she was well, so she started eating badly, and in two years she was back in the same state. You know, it takes longer to get tissue well if it's been damaged, but she had penicillin at one day old.

She was born with pneumonia, and they gave her penicillin at one day old. It took them a day to get the test back that showed she had pneumonia. Penicillin at one day old. So, I found that penicillin is not the greatest thing since... discovery of penicillin. Another bullshit story, myth propagated by people who sell penicillin. Pharmaceutical houses. That stuff is dangerous and destructive. Causes all kinds of mutations in the body. And every time I find some bad area of the body where somebody is suffering, penicillin is in the area first. Not every time. Not 80% of the time. 85% of the time. Penicillin is there first. Tetracycline also shows up pretty radically, but that's usually not given to children. And then you see all the adolescents who've been given penicillin, they have discolored teeth from it. Of course, that's never told anybody that 40% of the people who take tetracycline are going to have discolored teeth. Nobody ever tells you that. And that's what happens. So, you've got to watch what happens in the body. You've got to be aware of what's going on and you can protect yourself and then feed yourself properly. So, we have the pancreas. Now, we're told that the job of the pancreas is to handle blood sugar. Oh, is blood sugar that big of a thing? If we're a body who's mainly a carnivore, who doesn't eat carbohydrates, we're not supposed to eat vegetation? Why would that be a big thing? Why would sugar be a big thing for the pancreas? It's not. It's one minor function to make insulin. The pancreas makes thousands of different substances like insulin. It's responsible for taking the enzymes in food that are digested and realigning them in different molecular structures for the human digestive tract and for the human body. If enzymes and vitamins are missing because of the ingredients in cooked foods, the pancreas is responsible for making a variety of hormones that go and leach from every cell in the body nutrients. Whether it's vitamins, minerals, enzymes, protein, fats, or carbohydrates, it's like sending a group of thugs like the mafia going to every cell and saying, I need a few pennies of your nutrients to every cell. So what you're doing is spending the savings account of every cell. So that's why aging, deterioration are synonymous. And the medical profession and the food industry says, oh, no, no, no, no, your body, you know, the enzymes are absent in your food from cooking. Your body produces them, does not produce them. Money does not grow on trees, just like enzymes don't grow in the body.

It leaches them from your body. We get those enzymes every time we eat, if we haven't destroyed the food. Even dehydration destroys the enzymes. A lot of people think dehydrated food is raw food. It is not. Enzymes are not bioactive. They become hardened and they're not stable. You can give that kind of food to an herbivore, like a cow or a sheep or a goat, they have a long digestive track. They can reproduce the minerals, that's why you can feed them dry food. They love dry food, that's part of their diet, but not the human. It doesn't do well, the dry food. Cheese is a supplement that I told you how to use it and that's one supplement I'm using. And that is a supplement, it's not a whole active food. Even cheese is not. Butter is not either. Butter is a concentrated substance. It's isolated. Cream is very isolated from a lot of milk, so it is, again, it is a processed food that needs to be utilized and thought about in a way that balances within your particular system. I'm going to explain that a little bit more after I get through with all the little things I want to talk about in the human body. So that pancreas has a lot of jobs to do if you're a cooked food eater. If you don't eat cooked foods, pancreas' job is very simple, just realign. Takes them, realigns them and sends them back, nutrients back to the body and addresses it for the human body. A lot of different structures, different structures of fat, it will be the final production of certain cholesterols. It's involved in everything. Pancreas is a very important gland in the body and it just doesn't handle insulin. So if we are not high sugar eaters, then we can get rid of the pancreas, right? Well if you don't eat, let's logically follow the medical profession's thoughts about it. It handles blood sugars only, okay? Well if you stop eating blood sugars and you're taking a synthetic glycogen to feed the brain and nervous system, then you can have your pancreas removed and live. Pancreas removes your day pretty quickly, within about ten days, a week at the most. Or if you're IV people, they can stay alive longer without a pancreas, but you have to be piped into tubes and other machines to stay alive with a pancreas that's non-functioning or removed. So pancreas has many jobs to do, but it's very simple if you're eating raw food. Pancreas is not yet overloaded, but right now, the worst gland in everybody I see is the pancreas. It's the most hardened and overworked damaged organ gland that I see in my life. So we have the gallbladder. Well, let's take the liver first. Liver, mainly muscle, I mean, it's mainly protein, has fats in it. It manufactures bile, hundreds of varieties of bile, and you look at it under a microscope and you say, my gosh, this is all bile?

It looks like, you know, a whole planet of its own, because your body makes 60 varieties, and those are the large categories of cholesterol, and a third of them protect the body, a third of them dissolve toxins in the body, your body makes soaps with, solvents to dissolve toxicity, and a third makes fats to give you energy, and the greatest amount of energy comes from fat. We'll talk about that more in a few minutes. So the liver produces bile to digest fats. So then we have a spleen, I mean, a gallbladder right next to it. In fact, there's a gut between the liver and the gallbladder, sends the bile to the gallbladder. The gallbladder doesn't produce anything, it's like the spleen, the spleen holds blood, the gallbladder holds bile. Well, why do we need a whole sack of bile? Because when we were cave people and we'd kill an animal like the gorilla, they'll eat 14 to 28 pounds of meat a day. How much bile do you need to digest that much fat? Tremendous amount. We eat all day long a little bit so the liver can keep up with it and we don't need a spleen, I mean a gallbladder. But if you're a pig like me, sometimes you just sit there and have a quart of ice cream at a time and you better have a gallbladder. Or you'll drink, you know, I drink maybe a pint, you know, if I'm very thirsty sometimes and it's a hot day and I'm very dry, I know it's not water I need so I'll drink a pint of cream and have a little honey afterwards to make sure I've got enough enzymes to handle it, it relieves the pancreas. Honey is mainly enzymes so it makes the job of the pancreas very, very easy and helps the liver also, provides enzymes for the liver to manufacture bile. So honey is a very beneficial thing. So the gallbladder holds excess bile for heavy fat utilization and digestion once you eat a lot, if you're eating a lot at one time. There are all these reasons for everything in the human body. Just because the medical profession doesn't understand what it is and say, oh, we could remove this, it takes functionality away from you, normal animal functionality and then you'll be able to, you won't have the ability to do many of the things you wanted to do as you did when you were young. If you do this diet, you get young. You heard Jeff, both Jeffs, talk about, he was getting old, sore for three days after using his Bowflex.

Now he uses his Bowflex and he's not sore at all. Even a day, even an hour, he's not sore and he's getting his athletic ability that he thought would never return. Every day is going to get weaker and less able to enjoy his life physically, sports wise. Now he's swimming and all these things and he stopped doing because his body was weakening. If your body eats raw meat like this and gets into the raw diet, the raw milk and the raw cream and butter and the honey and the raw eggs, the whole body changes. It starts coming alive again. It's pretty amazing. I mean here I was sick all my life and then when I started eating raw meat and working on those farms, eat all that stuff, pumped up. You know what I did? I hadn't been able to exercise my whole life. I couldn't play sports. So when I went back to L.A. I started running. I couldn't run 10 feet without losing my wind. The next day I was able to get a half a block. Within a month I was running a mile. Within three months I was running five miles. Within six months I was running 13 miles a day. I was doing 250 push-ups with my legs this high up and my arms on the ground and I'd go down and my nose would barely touch or I'd let my cheek touch. So I would do the entire expansion, not just where these guys go like this. I mean I went all the way down and up. And then I'd do 50 handstand push-ups against the wall, I never could keep the balance. I hope I get back that I'd go up against the wall and do handstand push-ups, 50 of those a day. And then I'd do my running. I mean I worked at it because it wasn't something that I really wanted to do from a physiological viewpoint because my body doesn't produce a lot of adrenaline for physical activity. All of my other glands produce very well. My sexual glands used to overproduce and I'd masturbate five times a day. But the adrenaline never pumped in me. So when I did this I had to force myself to exercise. I did that for two years, it was phenomenal. I could run in the rain, I was barefoot, I'm running on rocks, you know, and I had all this muscle, all this physiological, so I thought, I can do it, now who cares? If it isn't my biological desire, then why do I care about doing this? It doesn't excite me, I'm more of a mental person and a sensual person, an artist, so I'm not physically inclined. So another thing I thought, well, how can I distinguish that in the irises because I use the irises as my analytical tool on the human body?

So I found that the body produces these circles in the line, circles in the eyes. Now most neurologists call them nerve rings, I used to call them order circles, but they were order circles only because they showed how much physiological energy you produced, whether it was testosterone or adrenaline and the other physically motivating hormones. And the more you have in the eye, the more physical energy you need to express, you need to utilize those hormones. If you don't reutilize it in physiological expression, emotionally you get to burn them. So I tell everybody who has a lot of those, how much activity they need to do, how many hours a day, and the more they have, each one means another hour a day of activity. All of my athletes have 7 to 13, 7 to 13, that's why they're athletes, that's why they're ditch diggers, that's why they're carpenters, they have to be physically active all day. So if they pick the right career, perfect, they're not in anxiety. But those who don't are when they get injured and they can't exercise and their body keeps producing them because they're on a bad diet, if you're on a good diet, a lot of those people will stop manufacturing those hormones for as long as they're recuperating. So the body works with you. But when you're on a bad diet, the body is confused, has problems and all kinds of symptoms because of it. So I have no activity range. So I'm like Cary Grant, this is my exercise, my keyboard and my computer. I carry my groceries once a week, I sit here and talk a lot, so that's my physiological energy, that's as much as energy as I have. I only sleep about four to five hours a day and I have enough energy to do what I need to do, and work all the time, but it's not physiological energy. One week a month, one week a year, I will trim the trees around my house, and we're talking about big oaks, so I'm going up there 60 feet climbing, you know, roping myself. I used to use hand saws, that was just too much. Now I have the old chainsaw, because there are too many trees, and I'm in a fire, you know, Malibu mountains, the fire area, so I have to trim all these trees every few years, so I have to take a few of them a year and do those. But I'll be trimming about somewhere around 10 tons of logging I do for one week, so that's enough for me for the year, but it does make me feel good for that time, but then it's still a lot of work, but no soreness.

I can do all that work and I'll be dragging these things, carrying them, you know, somewhere, some of them are 400 pounds, and I'll be carrying these things, and carry them all the way from the backyard to the driveway where they'll be picked up, you know, hauled away. And I watch the guys who come out, the Mexicans who come out and are hired to haul it, and they'll lift it together, and I'm lifting it singly, these big sections, you know, and they're out together lifting them up. So again, I'm 60 years old and I can still lift. I remember one time I went to a friend's, a friend who's an artist who does sculpture and she bronzes them. So she had a bronze turtle. And I'm standing there looking at the bronze and I'm just curious, you know, what's the weight of this thing? How heavy is it? Because it was a pretty big turtle. It was about this big. And, you know, I'm wondering, did she hollow it? How did she make this turtle, because, you know, it was only about this big. Is it hollow inside? You know, I had all these questions, and she was so busy because it was an opening. So I went over, you know, hoping not to be seen to lift it. So I went, I said, okay, maybe 120 pounds, put it down. Somebody said, you know, she told me, she ran over to me, and she says, you know how much that thing weighs? I said, no, she says 141.2 pounds, 241.2 pounds. And I was picking it up like it was maybe 100-some pounds, you know, I had no idea. And that's when I was doing all the push-ups and everything during that time. So that's when I lifted that thing. So I had no idea that I had that kind of strength. So this diet works tremendously for, you know, producing health and vitality for enjoying physicality or producing health from disease, no matter what you want, it can't produce it. Okay, so does anybody have any glands and organs that are significant? I don't think so. Yes?

Q: I was wondering about tonsils.

A: Oh, tonsils are very important. They filter out all the toxins that go to all the fluids. They are the stop to go into the brain. They regulate everything that goes into the brain directly. So if you lose those, your brain is very open to a lot of toxicity. And then you wonder why we have learning disorders in children. Very prominent. Somebody has their tape stopped. I thought I heard a click. It's over there. Should we take a break? Does anybody need to take a break? I go, I'll ramble and ramble for four hours. Everybody's okay? You want to take a break? There's one that wants to take a break. Three shaking their head no. Okay, I'll go through another 20 minutes. So we pretty much covered what muscles do, what nerves do. Connective tissue keeps things together no matter where it is. It binds the skin to the muscles, the muscles to the bone, and just makes everything work. The tendons and the muscles grow together and the tendons hold or grow into the bone to keep everything elastic and solidly there unless you have a rip like I did and your tendons just get ripped apart and let me tell you, I had more pain from those tendons being ripped than the bones being broken. I had the most pain right here and right here from where it was ripped. The tendons attach to the muscles, attach to the bones at the ends, at the joint areas. Sometimes they'll be injured, pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They grew back together in a week. I watched them, they were bubbled up here and here and in one week I saw them grow back. The pain didn't stop where they had been ripped but I just watched them grow back. I knew that from years ago when I, you know, to make money because I was so sick, you know, I was an actor a lot so I was on General Hospital. I went to Stanford for the British American Drama Academy where Richard Dreyfuss, Marcia Mason, Anne Jackson and Ted Knight were our professors. So you know there were thousands and thousands of people who applied and there were like 42 who were accepted and I was one so I was very delighted. So the day before I have to go to Stanford, the step that I had outside the house, a different house in Venice, or in West Los Angeles, tipped. So I ripped the tendon right off the ankle so it was bubbled up like an egg at the bottom. You think I was not going to take my classes? I paid all this money to have all these great teachers and everything just to mix with them and to be able to, you know, do scenes and all of that, explore and dance and everything else. So I went up there limping. I went on crutches, and they said, oh, you're not going to take classes. I said, tomorrow I'm in the classes, tomorrow I'm in the classes, the dance classes. So I just put an ace bandage around it, and I did the classes. And within three days it had grown back, still sore, but I just worked through the pain and did my dance classes, movement classes, everything. I learned a long time ago that the tendons will grow fast on this diet, very quickly replace themselves. The pain's not going to go right away, but the pain was gone in two weeks. Here it hasn't gone away yet completely. A little bit of pain and soreness right here where it tore from there, and a little bit in this area where it tore from here. It's less from here now than it was when it hurt the worst and it still hurts a little bit. Your body can replace anything, it can do anything, it's amazing what the body can do. I found out from the way I broke this leg, I was a little nervous, but just watch and see what happens. My body took care of it, I was walking on it in five and a half weeks, gingerly. I was walking on it, and then I threw the crutches away in six and a half weeks, I haven't used the crutches in six and a half weeks, here it is nine weeks as of yesterday, last night. I'd say it's doing pretty well, it's doing very well.

The lymph system is involved in all of that. It goes through the connective tissue area, because it feeds the skin, it feeds the cartilage. The cartilage is at the joints. It's not as hard as the other bone, so if you take harder blows, there's a little bit of weight to it, also the cells can regenerate in that area faster than the hard bone. The hard bone can take seven to seven and a half years to replace every cell in it. The cartilage can take four years. The tendons can take about three years. The muscles can take about two years to replace every cell. Lymphatic about two and a half to four years, depending upon your health. So different parts of the body take longer. The blood, some say you can redo it in ten days, that's absolute malarkey, because I'm looking at the blood, examining it under a microscope, I found very, very mature older cells there up to 50 days, 55 days even. So I figured it takes anywhere from 45 to 60 days to replace every cell in the blood. And that's, I don't know if that's including the spleen or not. I don't know if the spleen is dumping some of those cells and taking new cells to replace them or not. I haven't examined that part of it and I don't know how I would, you know, to be able to do that without damaging somebody's body pretty badly and their health. So that I can't answer. But the different parts of the body take longer to reproduce fully. So if you look at how long it takes cells to regenerate and you look at the work of Price and Pottenger who did experiments with laboratory animals, feed them cooked raw and processed cooked foods to see the health that they had, the ones that ate raw. The... Pottenger used 900 cats, used 900 cats in his experiments over a 10 year period. Howell, who came later, didn't want to use cats because they lived so long. He used rats who only lived three years in his experiments. He found that all of those that ate raw food had absolutely no diseases in both tests. No rats had diseases, no cats had diseases at all, any diseases. Those who ate cooked foods had disease, all the diseases of man. Those who ate processed cooked foods had all the severe and chronic diseases that man has. So, that was, and then they even got into the most processed foods, he tested some animals and he found that powdered milk, powdered dry milk, dry powdered milk they call it, and cereals were the worst. And guess every time you give a donation to help those children in third world countries, guess what they're sent? Cereals and powdered milk, the worst thing you can feed them.

Guess what causes tapeworms? High carbohydrate, dry, dehydrated foods, and that's solely what they're eating causes tapeworms. Only people who have tapeworms, who live with the tapeworm. Tapeworm may come and go to help get rid of your high sugar content that's stored in your intestinal tract, and it does, but people who it thrives and lives with every day eat a diet like that, dried milk, cereals, processed cereals. So these people who own these charities go to Purina, General Foods, make deals for cheap food and send it over and think they're doing good. They don't have a freaking clue, because the USDA and the FDA are telling them that's a balanced diet. These are good foods, and they're not. In fact, the results from tests from Sweden that came out on chrolamides about four years ago, four professors, nine to twelve full professors, all chemists and scientists, were examining cancer, and they found that almost every tumor they examined had a most concentrated element of acrylamides. So they checked foods for acrylamides, it's a byproduct of high carbohydrate food, and all foods have acrylamides once they're cooked. And if they're processed and cooked in certain ways, the acrylamide level skyrockets. You can start off with like fifty-six acrylamides and go up to fifteen hundred acrylamides depending on the way it's cooked and processed. Cereals are the worst, potato chips, potato chips are the worst, any kind of chip is the worst, whether it's soy or whatever, high in carbohydrate, boiled in oil, french fries, and then donuts, and cereals. They wanted to outlaw it. They did all this research for something like eight years, and then they came out, see their work was known by everybody in the university there. Their work was known all throughout the university. They were giving out their results frequently. Everybody knew, the president of the university, everybody knew. So they thought it was okay, so they called a conference, a press conference without going to the board. And they gave out all the information that they wanted the government to have all cereals, you know, potato chips, any kind of chips, stuff like this, because they were so carcinogenic. And the press released it. The food industry had their scientists right there to counter it within days. So the fireworks flew between them for about two weeks. That was it. They never heard anything else again of it. All those full professors are now working in high schools, teaching in high schools, demoted and fired because they did the right thing. So what happened? A lot of people in America got wind of it and knew. So what is happening now? New York City has outlawed certain foods because of high acrylamides. So they say, OK, the acrylamides are foods that are boiled in oil, certain kinds of oil.

So now they're using other kinds of oil. You're going to have the same acrylamides. It doesn't matter. In the human body, most of the oils that they use cause is hardening of the arteries and heart and everything in the system. And I've got something to go into that. The tribes who eat nothing but animal products, cooked, like in New Guinea, Guinea, Borneo, even cannibals there in New Guinea, they eat only animal matter cooked, all kinds of lard. They eat all of the fat of the animals, pigs, everything, all the fat, all cooked. They have no heart disease and no arteriosclerosis. They have no hardening anywhere. So all that myth about animal fat causing hardening of the disease and heart disease, hardening of the arteries and heart disease, is all a myth propagated by the new industry, Margarine and Crisco back in the early 60s. They started giving animal fat a bad name and nobody checked the science first. Those people knew, those people knew what they had created, they knew it was causing disease because there were certain tests they had to do, but they hid the information. I ran into one guy in Oklahoma while I was bicycling all over the country in the mid-70s, and he had worked for... better not say. One of the big companies, the biggest company. They had their own grain mills all throughout the Midwest, and they had major cereal companies. In offshoots they owned other cereal companies. They said that they did the same test that Pottenger and Howell did, they did them way back in the late 20s and 30s. They found, see they were going to prove that their product was healthier because it destroyed bacteria, but the animals got sick and diseases on the cooked food and the food that they served with all the bacteria in it, to the animals which was the raw, got no diseases. He said we were ordered to burn all of it, all 12 years of that research. We had to destroy and incinerate every animal, and he said we had all had to sign a contract that none of that information could be divulged, or else they could sue us for an unreasonable amount of money, and we'd be living in the gutter, so these people never talk. It's like the whistleblower for the tobacco industry, against the tobacco industry, you know. Thank God he had a good set of attorneys to stop them from suing him, you know, and there were enough people who sent him massive donations to take care of, you know, his legal bill, you know. They did a movie with Russell Crowe and Al Pacino that told his story, the doctor who let the cat out of the bag, about the tobacco industry. Well, nobody's done it with the food industry yet, except for the guy who came out about aspartame, blew the whistle on aspartame, that poison they use to make sugar substitute. What is that sugar substitute that's so famous?

Q: NutraSweet.

A: NutraSweet. NutraSweet. Did a commercial for NutraSweet, paid me a lot of money and I blew the whistle. And I didn't feel any remorse without it for blowing the commercial. They had me as a, I was 47 years old, and they hired me as a, because I looked in my late, early 30s, the character was supposed to be 30, 31. He and his wife were going to have their 10th year re-wedding, having another wedding to celebrate their wedding so it's their 10th anniversary and they're going to get remarried. So they do these different things and then he's in a tux and we're at a dinner and they go out to jump in the swimming pool at this hotel around their second honeymoon and they're jumping the pool and do all this stuff together. So they told me that I had to put her on my back, piggyback, but don't tell the girl and jump in the water, the swimming pool, we're using the Olympic swimming pool in Los Angeles, at the Olympic Center. So there's a big pool, it's about this low between the water level and the edge and they want me to have this girl, her chin is right here and her teeth are right here. She hits my chin, we hit the water, breaks her teeth, breaks my head, breaks her chin. I said, no, no, no, no, this is for stunt people, I'm not doing that. Held them up for two days, those shoots cost anywhere about $200,000 a day for your crew and all of the camera equipment and everything. So I cost them a bloody fortune for that. And plus they had to pay me a fortune to do the commercial. So I made somewhere around $23,000 for one day's work because I didn't show up for those other two days because I wasn't going to do the stunt. So they bargained with me and bargained with me and I said, okay, I'll do the stunt so I came in an hour and they didn't want me to tell her. I said, you give her chewing gum, make sure she's got something in her teeth so it doesn't break her. They said you want her to chew gum, the character is chewing gum, and then right before we went in I said, you know we're jumping in, they told me not to tell you so I want you to be prepared, watch your chin, back it up from my head. So it didn't look good on camera because she had her head back and I frowned because I didn't want the commercial to make it because I knew what aspartame was. This was in the early 90s, about 93. So I cost them so much money on that commercial, they only ran it for 6 weeks. I made another fortune on it but I spoiled, it cost them too much to run the commercial because they had to pay everybody a percentage of it.

And I purposely did it and still have no regrets about doing it because aspartame is a poison, a dangerous poison. If you want to find out how dangerous, just get on the internet and start, put in aspartame and then start searching it. It's pretty bad, it causes diabetes, it causes seizures, it causes all kinds of problems in people. And all of the examination, all of the material that Monsanto did on it, proved it was a bad substance and the FDA approved it anyway. Even after the FDA had looked at the information they approved it anyway, because they're worried about raw milk. They want to take raw milk and they took, the FDA and the USDA three years ago took away all raw juices. You can't have a pre-made raw juice in your health food store. Only from a juice bar can you get fresh juice. Everything has to be pasteurized and they threw aspartame out on the market. And they've got other sweeteners which are just as bad as the substitutes and they're all poisoned. So, time to take a break. So let's make this one, try to make it only maybe 12 minutes, so we can enjoy.

[break]

A: I'm going to get into food pretty soon, but I wanted to talk about bacteria, parasites, molds and viruses first. Now, these are our janitors. Of course, bacteria is involved in digesting your food and, you know, this E. coli, we know that they digest food, you have 2,300 varieties of E. coli, I mean, salmonella in the human body, several hundred varieties just for your nose. And then for your, we have more bacteria, humans have more bacteria in the mouth, twice as much as any dog or cat. So if you get bitten by a human, you have a rabies shot. And that's a bunch of malarkey too, this rabies stuff, a bunch of malarkey. The bacteria, the parasites, the fungus are all living creatures. The parasites can eat a hundred times their weight, they can eat a hundred times their weight of your damaged cells in 24 hours. They discard 1 to 2% as a waste product, as a verotoxin they're called, and it's not toxin at all. They want you to think, and they started this a long time ago when they started making things, they started naming these things, verotoxin, the excrement of bacteria and parasites are called verotoxin. Why would they call them verotoxins way back in, you know, 50, 60 years ago when they weren't really toxic? What were they preparing to do back then? This has all been planned a long time, how they were going to shape the human mind to get it to do what it wanted to do with processed foods and the medical profession, and the government's been part of it. I should say that the people who had this plan infiltrated the government areas to be able to control this. Like I say, 11 of the last heads of the FDA belong to as executives in the pharmaceutical industry. You know there's something wrong there, terribly wrong. So they've infiltrated the FDA, the pharmaceutical industry, and now the food industry. And the food industry has infiltrated the USDA for years and years and years too, probably 50, 60 years. So we have to be careful. Anyway, parasites eat and discard very little. So it's like if you eat 100 pounds of food in 24 hours and you had a one to two pound bowel movement the next day, that's very efficient. It uses all that matter, it has little waste. Bacteria eats about 50 times its weight in 24 hours and has about 5% waste. That's not quite what we have, you know, let's say we eat 7 pounds of food in a day, 8 pounds of food in a day, and we have anywhere from a pound to a pound and a half bowel movement. That's less. It's like a man, so maybe other people are smaller movements. But in a 24 hour period you could have 3 or 4 bowel movements, 5 bowel movements. So we are not very efficient because we have all this toxicity in our systems. We lose a lot of nutrients just in discarding the waste because we have to use good nutrients to bind with the bad and discard it.

Now the other animals out there, you know like the coyotes, they'll eat a whole rabbit and maybe they'll have 2 bowel movements. Very small, very little, much more efficient. Well these bacteria and the parasites are very efficient too. So I would rather them go into my body, eat up these damaged and dead and decaying cells, have a little bit of waste for my body to have to deal with, the lymphatic system to have to deal with that. Very little waste. Molds are the same way, but molds have more excrement, they have maybe 10-20% excrement of what they dissolve. And molds have a mycelium as its base, a milky substance which goes through and dissolves something. In the woods you see rotting trees, you see this milk stuff dripping around. That is the mycelium, that is the substance that goes in and dissolves each of them. It's a fluid organism that goes in and eats certain kinds of growth, especially roots in the ground, and then mushrooms pop up as a spore. So we have molds which are called yeasts and different kinds of fungus in the body. Those are all fungus, those are all molds. Yeast is a fungus, yeast is a mold, depending upon what's eating in your body. If you're a high carbohydrate eater, your body's going to have a lot of yeast that feeds on sugar products. Some of them will have a lot more yeast infections because they're eating a lot of yeast, they're eating a lot of yeast nutrients and food for yeast. There are different other molds. If you have gangrene, you're usually a pretty heavy meat eater that's probably diabetic. The processed insulin, even if it's so-called natural from the porcine, the pig, it is the way it is processed and it becomes a chemical. When it converts a sugar into a glycogen, a storable sugar, it is not a good workable complete body as if your own system had used its own insulin to convert it. So that's why a lot of your diabetics, after they've been taking insulin for 27 to 30 years, start having amputations because the sugars are very accurate when they're made with a poor insulin or a chemical insulin. It goes in there and stores the sugars. Very acid, very accurate. Even the insulin's accurate. Accurate means acidic. And it starts eating away the connective tissue and the surrounding tissues and you have gangrene. Start cutting off the limbs, you know, a toe at a time, and then the foot, and then the lower leg, and then the upper leg, you know, and fingers, and you know, ears, and everything. Again the pharmaceutical industry knows that this is happening because it's happened to the laboratory animals. But they don't care about you. They'd rather see you get gangrene, freak out, and lose a limb, and they keep making money.

They keep making their $1,200 a month from the insulin. So you have to take care of yourself thoroughly. Anyway, molds in the body, again, are eating things that have been destroyed by chemicals in your body, whether it's a food additive, or a preservative, or a food coloring, which is a food additive, any of those things are poisonous. Yellow food coloring is full of cadmium, a cancer-causing, heavy-concentrated mineral when it's not in proper balance biologically with other minerals, where it's a smorgasbord, a soup, and yet they put it in food coloring to make your food look good, to make margarine look yellow like butter. If you look at margarine when it was first produced, without any kind of coloring, it looked like Crisco, white wax, white wax. That's basically what it is, it's a petroleum product. Then they took vegetable oils, and then they started hydrogenating them, and when you hydrogenate a vegetable oil, guess what it turns into? Plastic. In fact, that's how plastic's made. You hydrogenate a vegetable oil, or you can even do it with some fats, some animal fats, but it doesn't work well. What they do is vegetable oils, some mineral oils, they can do it with, and then they subject it to tremendous amounts of heat, and there you have plastic. What happened with plastic in the 60s? Why didn't they come out with it fast? Because they discovered it, some guy went to sleep when they were hydrogenating the vegetable oil, and it turned into a hard plastic, it was fired, but created this incredible substance. They found that plastics, within nine months to a year, are molded. They couldn't kill the mold in plastic, so they couldn't use it in cars, they couldn't use it in clothing, they couldn't use it in anything. All these scientists got together and made poisons. Who could create the best poison to kill the molds in vegetable oils that were turned into plastic, dioxins were formed, PCBs were formed purposely. The most poisonous substance on the planet, the most carcinogenic substance on the planet, so you can have plastic. The amount of damage it has done to this planet is extraordinary. So hydrogenated vegetable oil is not good, vegetable oils in themselves are not good or not in the food section yet, so we'll talk about that. Back to the parasites, bacteria, and fungus, they clean up decaying, dead, damaged tissue in your body so your body can regenerate and become anew and not get old and deteriorated and weaker and more feeble. So these are our janitors, and you don't blame the janitors for all the dirt that they're cleaning, do you?

Same thing in the body, when the medical profession says, oh, you've got all this salmonella in your gut, yeah, well, the body has 2,300 varieties of salmonella, but what does it do? Well, it's all there in your stomach, and it's all around this food and your stomach and intestine. But did that create the problem? No, it's some kind of chemical that went into the body that damaged the tissue, or that's in the food and the salmonellas there trying to protect you, trying to help you, or trying to clean the system. So they are not the bad guys. The medical and pharmaceutical community is not going to blame, and the agribusiness industry and the food industry are not going to blame themselves, anything that they do for the problem. They are going to blame the janitors all the time, but the janitors don't make the mess. Janitors don't do the damage, they just come and clean it. So never worry about a parasite, a bacteria, or a fungal infection. They are your friends. If you've got an infection, you've got a lot of damaged tissue there, and you need to allow it to have its course, it's like you do a cold or a flu, you let it run its course, unless the doctor says, oh, you could die from this, or you could get some kind of problem with this. So take this antibiotic, but that's the pharmaceutical industry brainwashing the doctors. Remember all the education comes from the pharmaceutical industry in all your medical schools and all your universities. Most of the doctors go in there with good intention, but they're brainwashed by the pharmaceutical industry with a lot of hogwash, with a lot of myth and fabrication and, what do they call it, hoodwinking. So a lot of these doctors don't discover. They believe this stuff until the day they die. And there's others that don't. There's others that find it, hey, not working, I'm sorry, don't buy this, and they go off their own way. I have, to last count, 66 MDs who now practice nutrition and do this diet who don't do the medical procedures anymore, completely abandoned. They've given up all their money that they used to get, I mean, tremendous amount of money that they used to make as MDs, and they're not making that now, but they're happy and satisfied in their conscience, and they're making enough money to make ends meet very well and they're happy, because people still respect their minds. They were doctors and respect that they have been thoughtful enough to care about the human body a little bit more than those who just shut their eyes, wear blinders and stay focused with the pharmaceutical and the medical perspective.

So you will not get them to identify the poisons that cause the damage in the human body, they're just going to blame the janitors forever. You got an infection, oh, thank you. How can I help that waste product and those bacteria, parasites, fungus, whatever they're doing to do their job? What can I do? And I tell that in both books, how to handle different infections and what to eat to help them remove the waste. So nothing to worry about. So if something is so poisoned in your body that what they eat because of the contamination in the food or the medication that you've received like chemotherapy and radiation can poison your body so badly that if a parasite eats one of those cells or bacteria or fungus eats a cell, they will die, whole colonies will die, they'll stop reproducing and you no longer have their assistance. That is what's happening to the civilized world. Most of you are so toxic that you cannot breed bacteria, parasites, or fungus very easily anymore. Getting less and less antibiotics, tremendous drugs tremendously in the system and all the chemicals that are in the food including MSG. If you feed MSG to a parasite, colony of parasite, they'll be dead in 20 minutes, 20 minutes from MSG, not a good thing. So you lose all those good helpers that make you get well quickly and what can the body do after that? Virus. Viruses are not alive, they have no nucleus, they have no respiratory system, they cannot breed, they don't multiply. You put them in a petri dish, in a fertilized petri dish where cells can reproduce, there will be no more virus, not one more than you inject into the petri dish, into the fertile petri dish. Once you add cells to that sterile environment, that so-called fertile sterile, fertile sterile isn't that kind of contradictory in itself, fertile sterile petri dish, you put cells in there, put virus with it, all of a sudden more virus appears. Because cells manufacture virus. So if they've got a virus that will start dissolving the fluid that it's in, the fertilized sterile environment of the petri dish, the cell is going to create virus to help repair itself, to clean itself. So virus are produced in the cells and they are a solvent, it's a body soap. They do not multiply, the idea that they're contagious is absolutely absurd, HIV is no more contagious than laundry soap. You could say, oh, look, I found a stack of laundry soap here and it's in all the neighbor's houses so laundry soap is contagious. That is the mentality of the medical profession. The pharmaceutical people at the top know that, but they want everybody to believe this fantasy, this myth, this superstitious bull crap. So again, it's not the doctor's fault mostly, it's the pharmaceutical industry that's the problem and the food industry. So virus, what happens when you use a solvent to clean something? 

You have to mix it with water and all of your contaminated fluid, let's say you're dissolving some cells that have been poisoned with cadmium or a combination of lead and cadmium because you're a metal worker. Let's say you're a lathe worker and you're using oil in high temperatures or you're even smelting steel and you've got this smoke coming up and you're in a smoke factory, I mean a smelting factory. You're getting all of this damage in you and all of a sudden you can't get infections. You can't get bacterial infections, parasitical infections or fungal infections. You can only get virus. When you start mopping up this stuff, when you start this, you start dissolving those cells which were destroyed by that combination of poison, you've set all of this fluid and all of this contaminated waste with no reduction, remember the parasites and the bacteria and the fungus reduce the waste product to a very tiny amount. Body can handle that easily. When the body uses virus, massive swelling, massive contamination. That's why when you have a bacterial meningitis which is an infection in the coating of the nerves of the brain, a bacterial virus is not feared like a viral virus is because in viral virus, in a viral meningitis which is a viral infection, the swelling is immense and you have this heavy pressure on the, you've got 11 layers of tissue which is called the meninges, actually the outer layer of that, those 11 layers is the meninges. So you have meningitis, it's an infection in there and it causes massive swelling if it's a viral. And then there's seizures, there's coma, there's all kinds of reactions, but it very rarely happens in a bacterial situation. It's usually a bacterial which is in the company of a viral. It's not a pure bacterial. So you don't have to worry about bacterial infections. Stay away from the antibiotics. If the infection gets more than you can handle for the pain or the discomfort, then lime juice is your antibacterial. It'll reduce the colonies. It'll destroy even the good bacteria if you have too much of it, but it is an antifungal. I found out in 1996, I'd gone to Tahiti and I hated Tahiti because the natives were trying to be white, and they hated white people. So I went to the island of Mo'orea, which is between Tahiti and Bora Bora, and the natives are natives there. So I'd gone out snorkeling, you know, I went early in the day so I could spend many hours. I figured six, seven hours snorkeling would be plenty of time for the tide to come in. I was out there 11 hours and didn't know it. I thought I was out there six hours. I noticed I was in danger. I had a 20-foot reef to get through and this much water to get through it, and the waves were coming in. So it would even get lower at points.

So I spent 20 minutes or 15 minutes counting the waves, measuring, you know, how many before the big break came in to get the lowest. So I timed it so I could get through that 20 feet quickly. I got right to the end and I got caught in the coral and just ripped my thigh open here. So 1996, I'd been eating raw meat 20 years, I figured I was Superman by that time. I hadn't had an accident except for the twisted ankle in 1993. So you know, I repaired quickly so I thought this isn't going to matter, although I'd heard lots of stories about, you know, the elements in coral will cause massive infection, cause gangrene, 48, 72 hours and you lose your leg. So I heard stories like that, I figured anything was myth. No matter what, it was myth after that. All this crap about, you know, how the body's going to die and all this stuff from something natural. So I, you know, I ignored it. I rented a bicycle on the island and was driving around, stopped at this restaurant which is basically a native's house with a picnic table in the yard and they cook in their house or prepare food in their house and bring it out to the picnic table, you're out in the yard. That's the restaurant, unless you're in a hotel. So I went there to have some ceviche because I knew in Tahiti there's Polynesian areas like that, lots of raw fish, all the time raw fish and they liked ceviche a lot. But they could serve me, they said, what would you like? We have good bird today, you know, would you like it? And, you know, I ate chicken but never marinated before so they marinated this chicken and put it in, I mean, yeah, chicken or whatever kind of bird it was and they marinated it for me and served it and I've got the recipe in here. The first time I had prepared chicken like that, I mean, I'd eaten chicken, it was one of the first things that I ate when I went to that farm in 1976, but to find it prepared and people eating it besides me because everybody's afraid to eat chicken, you know, and here was an island where everybody ate bird's raw, so I was quite thrilled. Anyway, this old, probably 15 and a half, 16 year old native girl comes out to take my order and you know, my shorts went up to here and you could see it and I didn't notice so I just ignored it. I had no, very little discomfort, just a little bit of, I could feel just a little irritation and she looked down at my leg and she said, did you get that in a coral? I looked down and I saw this pus coming out of this, scraping this wound and I said yes and she said, you wait right there. Like I had done, she was my mother telling me I did a very bad thing, I felt this little girl telling me, you know, I told her what I wanted, I said wait a minute, wait a minute, take my order.

She took my order and she told me about the bird and everything and then she came out immediately with a half of a lime and she said now you squeeze that on there and you rub that in for about a minute, lecturing me, bad boy. So I did that, 20 minutes completely sealed, stopped the infection just like that but not only that, the lime juice went in there and picked out all the particles and brought them right to the surface by the next morning. Same thing happened here with all the gravel and everything, every bit of it came out except that was actually buried in the skin but that that was in the tissue that was all dissolved, you know, fibers of muscle that were hanging and stuff like that, it just brought it all to the cup, to the top, within three days it had all been removed in little scabs, little crusty things, never scabbed over, I didn't allow it to scab. I allowed this stuff to scab where it just took the skin off.

Q: Did it hurt when you put the lime on there?

A: Yeah, it stung like hell, just like aah, just to release some of that pain. Yeah, it stung, but it worked very well. Lime juice is an antibacterial, if I put lemon on there it would have made it worse and started dissolving my skin and making it worse, so a lot of people make that mistake. Oh, lemon, and a lot of the Asian countries call lime lemon, so they call it lemon and it's lime, for us it's a big difference. In fact, you can hardly find lemon over there anywhere, unless it's imported, so you don't have lemon trees over there, or very few of them, unless somebody's imported them, so lime is what they have. So they marinate in lime, and that's not great because you're destroying the bacteria in the food, so you don't quite digest your meat as well. So if you need, let's say you have a parasite that's making you feel too fatigued and you have to work because you're going to starve to death if you don't work, then you have about three ounces of lime juice, two tablespoons of lemon juice, about three ounces of honey, and about four to five tablespoons of coconut cream. You blend all together and put it in about anywhere from a half a cup to a whole cup of sparkling mineral water, the natural ones, like Gerolsteiner, Ramlosa, San Pellegrino, San Faustino, Perrier. Those are where they take the gas, the carbon, from the well, the upper part of the well and the water and shoot them into the bottle at the same time. It's not like Coca-Cola or soda water where they make a chemically produced gaff and shoot it in with it like all of those sodas are made with unnatural gaff.

Q: How much lime juice did you put in it?

A: Two tablespoons only.

Q: Is that on the recipe book?

A: No.

Q: Do you have to be sick to drink this?

A: No, but I would say unless you're having symptoms, I wouldn't do it.

Q: Why not?

A: Because you'll start destroying all the bacteria in your body. It's like an antibiotic. It isn't selective when you have it frequently. Say you wanted it once a week, I'd say that's okay. Once a month, okay, but every day, no way. Every other day, too much. Every third day, still too much. Once a week's okay, but like I say, if you're in one of those situations where you've got a deadline or something, and you need to work, and there's no way out of it, and you don't have any energy to work, and that infection's really cleaning you out fast and hard, then if you take that once a day, every day, for about three days, you're going to be functional. Almost within six or seven hours, you'll be functional, because it will reduce those colonies. The best way, in fact, it'll stop you from producing even virus, even though viruses are manufactured in the cell. The cells obviously get the message. Stop manufacturing this soap, and stop cleaning me out. I need to function. Three ounces of lime juice, two tablespoons of lemon juice, four to five tablespoons of coconut cream, three ounces of honey, blend that all together, and add half to whole cup of sparkling, natural sparkling water. And you drink that about three ounces at a time, three to four ounces at a time, four to five times a day. No more than three days. If you kick the detoxification in a day, don't take it those other days. Stop it right there. You don't need it. The way the body naturally reduces bacterial virus, any kind of an infection, is fever. Bacteria cannot reproduce over 100 degrees in the body, in the human body. Parasites cannot reproduce over 100.2. Your body will not, molds can't even breathe above 99.7. The body will stop producing virus at about 100 degrees. So fevers are very important into a long detoxification. Also, it's very necessary to help increase reproduction of cells. When the temperature gets up to 102, cellular division is fast, as long as you have the nutrients. So a fever is very important to the healing process. What does the pharmaceutical industry do? You have a fever, you take antibiotics and you knock that, or you take analgesics, or you take sulfur, you take some way to stop that fever. And that's your healing crisis. And you're just knocking it out. It means you're going to get old and feeble and you're not going to repair what you've just finished cleaning. So that means you stay weakened in that area. So you're going to have problems in that area and the medical profession will promise to help you over and over and over the rest of your life. And they get that rich.

Like I say, if you're going to restrict anything, don't restrict an infection unless you absolutely can't function. And you have to. And don't stop a fever, which is your healing crisis. And also when you're very tired, usually following a long detoxification, you have a period of lethargy where you want to sleep a lot. That is the body. 90% of the cellular division, the reproduction of cells, happens in the sleep state or in an alpha state. Some people can reach that alpha state who know meditation very well and do it well. They can reproduce cells even not being in the sleep state, when they're not in the sleep state. But most people have to be in the sleep state. So when you have a period of sleepiness and lethargy, take advantage like I do. I'll eat sometimes three pounds of meat a day. I infuse myself mainly with proteins so that I will divide cells and have enough to make them strong quickly. So if I have a mass division of cells, I'm going to need a lot of protein fast. You know babies eat all the time. Children eat all the time to feed themselves until they get to maturity. So new cells are the same way. So I make sure that when I go into a sleepy state, I eat very little. I don't eat much milk, just enough to keep me hydrated, and I eat lots of meat and some eggs just so I take advantage of that reproduction of cell cycle.

Q: And this is before you go to sleep?

A: Oh, this is all during the day. All during the day. But when you're that sleepy, you may nap many times a day and sleep many hours in a day. So you just eat all the time because you're awake. Try to eat some meat and egg and a little bit of dairy, you know. 

Q: What happens if you don't have time to take naps like that? Can you take a 10 hour or a 12 hour sleep?

A: Yeah, but you want to break it up. You want to wake at least every 5 hours to eat. The body eats itself after 5 hours. The bloodstream becomes protein deficient in 5 hours. Even if you're 700 pounds, it's the protein that becomes deficient in. So after 5 hours, the red blood cells begin eating other red blood cells for the protein. That makes you temporarily slightly anemic. Every morning you wake, how many people go for caffeine in the morning? Whether it's soda pop or coffee or whatever it is, how many people in the United States go for? Europe, everywhere. I'd say 95% of the population goes for some chocolate, soda pop or coffee for caffeine to jack them up. 80% of that problem is that the red blood cells are eating other red blood cells and it causes an anemia. Every day, a slight anemia. Not a good thing. So you need to wake and eat sometimes during the night so you don't go five hours without eating. Some people wake up after five hours and eat and can't go back to sleep, they have too much energy. So I tell those people set the alarm for three hours and then sleep five hours and you've got your eight hours. If you're going to sleep ten hours, five hours and then go back to sleep for five hours. Or get up every four hours. Some way to do it so you're not going five hours without eating. Makes a big difference. Let me give you an example. I've given two workshops at this one particular town in California. And the third year, and I stay at these people's houses, and the third year the man who lives in the house came to me and said, you know, this diet is incredible. I met him. He was 46 years old. Like an old man. He had been a vegetarian for 24 years. So, and usually I would say 90% of my vegetarian patients who were long-term vegetarians, they all had back spinal problems because they had osteoporosis in their spine. Osteoporosis. Other places too, that almost always occurred in their spine. I had one athletic woman, 36 years old, 30% of her spine was gone. And she was an athlete. She thought she was very strong. Then she started having scoliosis and started to collapse over. It just happened, her sister was on this diet for a year before that. So, in this year she just collapsed all at one time. Her body just started eating her calcium, her bones up, to get minerals and protein. So, she went on the diet a year, spine completely replaced. Now, I get emails from her from England, she's British, and everything's fine, great. She's trying to get everybody on the diet. She's on the diet five years now. Her whole life is incredible.

She's much more athletic and can do so much more than she used to. She was a champion athlete. Just like that guy, going from 25 hours to 20 hours. People dream of that. He's just thinking, get it down an hour, I'll stay at 24 hours, and I'll probably stay there the rest of my life, and maybe it'll get worse again. That's the way these athletes think. I had two marathon runners, one from New York City, one from Las Vegas. Went on the diet, and they dream of taking two, three minutes out of their marathon a year. Let's reduce it to maybe six minutes, ten minutes may be pushing it. Both of them, one of them, two and a half months on the diet, took 20 minutes off of his time. That quickly in that two and a half months, the other in three months took 40 minutes off of his time. I also had a champion athlete who was a martial artist. Came to me at 51 years old, and he came in about 35th, anywhere from 35th to 40th in his age category. Everybody in his 55 to 40 to 55, 15 year period. He's in that category. He's at the end of that category. These other guys which are 40 years old, they're so much healthier. They're the ones who are coming in way before him. He's coming in 35th to 40th place. He went on the diet, and he had done all these graphs, recorded everything. What he does to, and what he did back then, he still does, he jump ropes to practice and get his stamina, endurance for his martial arts. He'll take an hour to do these. An hour he'll jump rope, jump rope three days a week. He lets two days, one time, three days go between them. First day of the week, like on a Monday, he'll jump rope, no it's like a Tuesday, he'll jump rope 2,300 in an hour, or he'll do it in less than an hour. He tries to steady and make himself slow, so he can focus on what he wants, what he does. He'll jump rope about 2,300 jumps in an hour. No big deal, that's common, that's OK. Then on Thursday, he'll do 7,000. 7,000 jumps an hour. That's moving. Sunday he does 12,500. That's lightning fast. He's a blur. Really, he's a blur. You can't see him moving. You can't see the legs. He's moving. That was very difficult. He always let days in between, because he'd be so exhausted. He had lots of sore symptoms doing that, but it really powered him up for his competition. When he got on the diet, he noticed that in his graphs, his heart rate was in between 171 and 184, or something like that. It would take him sometimes half an hour, 35, 45 minutes for his heart to normalize from that kind of intense workout. Then it was back down to its normal 70 beats a minute. 62 beats a minute.

I think his runs around 70 beats a minute normally. When he went on the diet, you could see every month, the time allotted for him was like two, three minutes to get to, two to three minutes after the exercise, it was normal. Just like that. He got fifth in the competition the next time. Fifth in competition. He was wiping out all these young guys. He was up there at 52 now. Not at 40. He was going up instead of down. That's the kind of thing that can happen on this diet. You don't have to be sick, like I said. If you can do it just to improve your life, to be able to function better and have a great life. 

Q: What do you think about fasting?

A: Ask, save your questions for the end. Otherwise we'll get off on all kinds of tangents, which I do anyway. I tell the stories, you'll remember it better. I've always found if I just give the information without the stories, it does not connect here as well as here. When it connects here and here, people remember a lot more. Then they can remember it in a way that it makes a difference in their life. Oh, that's what happened, this, maybe this, and this, and it becomes a part of their whole being. I like people who think of the whole being. If you think like the medical profession, you're all confused because it's all from the head, it's not from reality. Anyway, we were talking about the virus and how it contaminates everything. You've got a lot of waste products to remove, so you've got to have a lot of minerals when you've got a viral infection. That means you have to eat cheese, cheese, and more cheese, and some cheese with honey directly in your mouth together, because you want to absorb some of that minerals, extra minerals, because you're detoxifying, and you've got all that toxic fluid, and you better have a lot of minerals there to bind with it, or else it's going to make you sick and poison the rest of your body. If your body doesn't have nutrients all over and you're not overweight, you're going to have problems. So there's no skinny person here, which I'm happy to see. There's some slender people, but there's no skinny people here. You're about the skinniest there. Still go up. I like people this size and this size. You're still on the thin side. Fats protect. That's what we're going into now. We're going to talk about foods and how important they are. Fats, like I said, your body makes many different cholesterols with fats to do different things in the body. If you want to know how important fat is, compare your weightlifters to your bodybuilders. Bodybuilders are all muscle, clean and lean. Take Arnold Schwarzenegger, for example. When he was in competition, he was down to 7-8% body fat. Trying to get down to 2-3% body fat. He would go, in between his competition, lifting, he would go from anywhere from 500-600 pounds, working out with that, and then at competition time when the fat was low, all the way down to 200-300 pounds. Lose all that strength. Look at your weightlifters. Fat. Every one of them fat. Fat gives you 2.5 times more energy than your carbohydrate or protein. 2.5 times more energy. It's pretty efficient. Take a look at your wrestlers. Ever see a skinny, slim, trim wrestler? They have to take blows. Now, most of it's staged because I used to be a fighter, and when I was a fighter, I went for the lethal places. I wanted to knock somebody out until they didn't move.

I wanted to hit them one, two times. That's all I wanted to have to hit them. It was an elbow in the throat, elbow in the temple. Somewhere where it incapacitated them for 10, 15 minutes, and I could sit there and beat them to death if I wanted to. But usually knocking them down and out like that was all I had to do. These wrestlers could be doing that to each other every time, but it's an exhibit. It's a show, but it is a dangerous show, and it is a damaging show. They throw each other all over the place. They pound their backs. They land on legs with their backs stretched. If they don't have a tremendous amount of fat in their systems and good strength along with it, they get hurt. I mean, they're aerially jumping up and all this tremendous weight comes down on you. You better be in good shape. The best people in the best shape I know are these wrestlers. Nobody in better shape than these wrestlers. Even the people who are acrobats for Cirque du Soleil, which I love, those people get injured all the time. They're too freaking thin. Their contract says you have to stay thin, which is absolute garbage. I've talked with them. I've interviewed with them. They used to perform out of Santa Monica, and I used to live at Venice Beach, and I got to interview them and talk with them a lot about their diet. Let me tell you, it's in their contract that they have to stay under a certain body fat level, not healthy, so they get injured. They burn out quickly. Very few of them are over 32. Same with athletes, other athletes in sports. They're taught to be thin. They're taught to be ripped, unless you're a football player. What happens? They burn out young. 38 years old, their career is over. That's the average, 38 years old. Well, if they did this diet, there would be no age limit. Every one of them would be going up into their 50s probably, and just tired of exercise, tired of the sport maybe, and leave it for that reason. And that's what can happen. Fat is so important in this diet. The poisons, keeps them from damaging cells, even your teeth. But mostly there, it's the minerals that your body has to rely upon. But in the body, fat. Let me give you an example. I go to North Carolina, Asheville, North Carolina, usually once a year. Community there called Earth Haven. All vegetarians went back about 6 years ago, 7 years ago. They were all vegetarians. This whole community, all vegetarians. Long term vegetarians, some of them 35 years. The unhealthiest community I've ever seen in my life. Vegetarians. Deteriorated spines, weakness, fatigue, all this black around their eyes, lethargy, fibromyalgia, chronic fatigue, all kinds of problems. There was this one fellow there who was only, I think, 36 years old and he could barely work. He literally looked like a raccoon. He had black, deep charcoal gray circles around here.

His skin was gray. He had gotten it from metal poisoning, from farming, all this pesticides and everything. He was not doing well as a vegetarian as none of them were doing except for some of the young ones. They hadn't done it long enough to deteriorate their body. He started on the diet in the closet. He went online and started seeing who was good at getting rid of chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia. He kept coming up with people who talked about the primal diet and Aajonus Vonderplanitz. He went there, got the book, and started doing it in the closet. He would take the meat, put it, disguise it inside the head of lettuce or something. Put it inside of a salad, all the salad over the bowl with the meat down at the bottom. He said, I have to have my own refrigerator. He didn't share his refrigerator. So he's doing it in the closet like that. The change in him in a year was astounding. Everybody says, what are you doing? We want to do that. What do you do? He says, you don't want to do it. Yes, we do. After a year, it got to the point where they were getting angry with him because it was such a big change. He put on weight. His skin was now more red looking. Half of the circles were gone. His eyes were open. He was working. He was happy. Finally, they said, they cornered him and said, you have to share this with us. It's not moral. It's not loving to do that. He says, you're not going to like what you hear, but you cannot kick me off the property. They thought maybe he's doing drugs or something. He says, I'm not going to tell you. They finally agreed. He told them. Within six months, they were growing pigs. They had goats they were milking. They had cows. Two-thirds of that whole community changed. The other third held fast on to their vegetarianism. Within a year, all of the vegetarians were gone. Some of them left. The community but 90% of them went primal. To whatever extent, they went to raw dairy and meats. Some of them didn't do much of the meat. They ate a lot of eggs and dairy and a little bit of meat or fish. Others went whole hog with the red meat. But they all got so much better. The third year there, I'm doing private consults and this guy comes in and looks like he came right out of a motorcycle gang. Thick damaged skin, air blown from maybe motorcycle riding and heavy sun exposure and lots of swelling and nose problems that come from alcoholism and drug use.

I can see all through the scars around his forehead and around his chin and neck. He was probably maybe 20 pounds overweight for his size to the average. To me, that was okay. He could have gained a little bit more. But still, he was comparatively overweight for the average fashion thinking person or the health minded person in our society. I shot his eyes and all of his glands and organs were really clean but his skin was shot. I said, it doesn't make a lot of sense. I can see by your skin that you've abused alcohol and drugs for 25 years at least. He said 30 years. I said, it doesn't make sense. Your insides are so clean and you're only a few pounds overweight. He says, four months before I went on your diet, I was 300 pounds. It made sense to me right there. Even bad fat protects you from the toxins that are in the body. This man was doing cocaine, speed, meth in chemical form, all that stuff. All those years and because he had all that fat, it protected everything but his skin, the place where the fats had to discharge and get out of the system. But it even protected his colon. There's a lot of times I'll find damage in the colon even if somebody is overweight. But he was 300 pounds. That was plenty of fat to protect him all over. 300 pounds and the guy was only 5'9". 300 pounds. That's big. But he was healthy. Here 52, 53 years old and his insides were healthy. His skin wasn't but he was inside. So the amount of change that came over him in that first four to five months on the diet was tremendous because he had protected all those cells inside his body. So never be afraid of fat. You're saying, well, Aajonus, you're awfully thin. Yeah, because I just lost 20 pounds from this accident. Well, let me tell you, did you see me two weeks ago? I was even thinner. I was 5 pounds less than this or 7 pounds less. But in last checking, which was two days ago, I was 20% body fat. 20% body fat. He's probably 18% body fat, if that. He's probably only about 13% body fat. You're probably 28% body fat. I'm 20% body fat. Where is it? You have to understand that when you cook fat, the molecules swell 10 to 50 times their normal size. Like you take a kernel of corn and you pop it and you've got a big thing like that. Cotton candy blows out. Fats do the same thing when they're cooked, depending on how you cook them. You see, let's take fat from a pig and you boil the pork rinds. You have a very thin little sip like a bacon. You put it in there and you've got this big fat pork rind. It's this big.

That's what happens in the human body. Those fat molecules are huge. I have a lot of fat that is concentrated. I like to stay 22% to 23% body fat. So I'm going to have that in about probably two weeks, two and a half more weeks. I will have three days off finally to start putting the weight on where I can pig out to do that. For right now, I went from Thailand. I had to go spend two days in getting the house in order. Then I go to Hawaii, next workshop there. Then two days back again. I had to do so much work here to catch up. I wasn't able to eat all the time. Then I had to come here. But I have, no, you've got me booked up again. So I only have two days. So I'll catch up soon. I'm just working. I'm just going up slower than I normally do. So I am not thin. All the people who are on this diet a long time that don't cheat very much, they're slender and fat. You know, one woman who's 14 years on it, she used to have breast cancer. She's, she just turned, you know, she'll turn 50 in September, October, September, October, she turns 50. She has about 24% body fat. It doesn't look any heavier than I do. And she can't get any bigger. You know, she used to go up 32, 34% body weight and was heavier. But after seven years on the diet, it stopped. It stopped. I used to go up to 30, 31% body fat after the, you know, when I was able to do it. When I was doing all that running and everything, I mean, I was puffy. I was blown up. And I would go, I would force myself to get up 31, 32% body fat, you know, so I could take care of all that chemotherapy and all the other chemicals that I had injected in my body from all those years. And now I can't get up to that size anymore. The biggest size I can get up to is, I can't get that size anymore, but I used to try. Um, about as big as you are is the biggest I can get now in the waist. But I have three wardrobes and I encourage everybody to get three wardrobes. I go from a 30 inch waist to a 37, a 36 and a half. So I have three wardrobes that I can fit into, you know, to, to work within that. Cause sometimes like this accident, I mean, it took 20 pounds off me. I went from there, I was a 36, and by the time I left, seven weeks later, I was a 30 waist. So, don't be afraid of that. It'll be your best friend next to, well, best friend period. Next will be parasites, the next will be bacteria, the next will be fungus. All the things you thought were the worst things for you in the world are your best friends. Your antibacterial soaps, your antibacterial sprays, those are your deadly things. Those are chemicals which will damage you.

But all of these, all of this, you know, free trade and free market thing says, we can tell you anything. This is a good chemical for you. It's antibacterial. It's good for your children. Spray it all around your house and it's a freaking chemical poison. Damage their lungs. But it's antibacterial. It's just absurd. It is frightening when you think about it. So don't be afraid of all those natural things. Don't be afraid of poop. Every creature in the world eats it but the humans. And there are some tribes that eat it. There are some tribes that are vegetarian and they will not eat an animal but they'll eat the waste of an animal. They'll drink urine and they'll eat feces. Because when a vegetarian animal poops, it's digested 75% of it. And a lot of it is matter that just got to the point where it's about to be absorbed and didn't. So they can eat it. And then we digest about 20% at best of vegetation. So it's so predigested that by the time it passes through our body in 24 hours, we've digested a lot of that product. So the first time I saw it was about 1971 or 72. It was on National Geographic. And they showed this... She was in Georgia, Russia, this black, beautiful black hair, blue-eyed woman, very small, diminutive. And you see her chewing something, swallowing like this, smile on her face, and pulls back and you see this buffalo tail in the back, swishing. You see she's in a rice paddy or some kind of an area where there, I think it was, I just assumed it was rice because water was sectioned off in squares. But they grow other things. They grow [unintelligible] in Hawaii. So they may be growing flowers in those that they're growing. But that's what I just assumed it was when I saw it. And as you pull back, she's eating something and you can't see it, but it's brown, dark brown in places. And you don't know what she's eating. You pull back and she's a very small little lady in this big cow paddy that was probably near her size, not really, like a huge bowl in front of her. And she's eating this cow shit and thriving on it. And her family couldn't afford chickens or fish or anything like that, so that's what she ate. And the insects, they eat live insects. Sometimes they'll fry them up big in Asia. There's a certain beetle which lays its eggs in the buffalo manure and in five days thousands, I mean thousands of these beetles will come out.

So they sit there and pick them and put them in their little jars. And they'll take them home and stir fry them in water and eat them or eat them raw, like that, while they're picking them. So lots of cultures who eat that way. And gosh, if it were that bad, the way the pharmaceutical and media are telling you that it's bad for you, we'd all be dead. They'd all be dead. It's an absurdity. It is absolute craziness. So, fat, fat, fat, fat, fat. Get fat and be happy. Eat shit and live. It's going to be the name of one of my comedy books, Eat Shit and Live. It's going to tell the absurdities in a comedic way. Then we have protein and my experiments with protein in the human body and all the vegetarians I knew and still know. They eat grains, they eat beans, they eat nuts, all this stuff combining different things to get the proper protein balance. And it's all chemistry nonsense because it doesn't work on 99% of them. I've only known eight vegetarians that did well on a vegetarian diet. Seven of them were women and one was a woman who I just told you about who her spine had started deteriorating at 36 years old. One of the oldest ones that I have that I knew used to heckle me at conventions where I'd speak and he said, you don't need meat and all that. Look at me, I haven't eaten meat in 52 years and I'm a raw food hygienist and I only eat raw fruits and raw vegetables. He's a hyperactive, hyperactive muscular man. You usually don't see vegetarians muscular but he was really muscular. But he ate so much fruit, he was so wired and so hyperactive he couldn't sleep. He'd get up and exercise every hour to exercise and pump himself up and then all of a sudden after, let's see, 52 years of doing that and at 74 years old his spine went one year. Painfully. Guess what diet he did? He went right to this diet and it made him well. But did he tell people? He would tell them just the opposite. He would tell them just the opposite. People's minds work in strange ways. And still to this day, this is four years later, he still eats the meat, strengthens his back, but he's just convinced that he had some kind of a spinal injury when he was a child and it's all from that and he wouldn't have to eat the meat if he didn't have that injury. People warp it now. At least Dalai Lama, when he heard about this diet, he started having severe problems. Dalai Lama says, yeah, I eat meat medicinally. He was against meat all those years, all of his life.

And then all of a sudden when it started deteriorating and a friend of his, a close friend of his, who had been on my diet for four years and he saw what it did to him and then my friend said to him, Fred Segal said, you know, you got to eat the meat and eat it raw. So Fred didn't tell me whether Dalai Lama was eating it raw or cooked. So I can't say which, how he ate it, but I know he's eating the meat. And he's telling people he's eating it because it's medicinal. It helps him and it's not bad to eat medicinal. But medicinal, for most people, functionality is eat it every day several times a day. If you're diabetic, you'll eat it three times a day. Anyway, protein, we do not digest and assimilate and utilize protein to increase cellular reproduction with grains, beans, and nuts, no matter whether they're germinated, cooked, raw, powdered, or whatever it is. It does not matter. We cannot increase reproduction of cells with that protein, nor can we build stable muscle. People, when they develop muscle on this diet, does not go away when they stop exercising for months. It stays. I don't exercise at all, carry my suitcase, that's it, and my groceries once a week. When I travel here, I'm not carrying groceries. They carry my groceries because everybody feeds me wherever I go. So maybe I'll take a bottle of milk or something like that. So when I'm traveling, I'm carrying my suitcase to the airport, to the car, from the car to the airport to the plane, and then to wherever I'm staying, and that's it. That's all the exercise I get, and yet I stay very muscular because I'm eating raw meat. If I didn't eat the raw meat, it wouldn't last like that. Nobody's muscle would maintain and sustain itself. You see those bodybuilders that pump up with protein powders and stuff like that, six months after they stop working out, it just melts, their skin sags, it just sags. Did you see that picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger in a bathing suit, where they caught him in a bathing suit two years ago? In between pictures, his skin was just sagging, all of his muscles were just sagging. They put a picture of the woman who was 28 years old, you know, Mr. Universe, one of the seven times, and this one when he's, he's my age, I'm a few months older than he is. He's got all this sagging flesh, and I don't have any, anywhere. Well, a little bit right here when I did, see that's, and that's since I lost that weight so quickly, you know, leg injury. So that's all that I had sagging, he had it sagging everywhere on his body. So that raw protein in the meat is important for that. Now I've seen the hunter tribes who live on cooked meat, and they stay very muscular until they get old. And when they hit their 50s and 60s, even that muscle and their skin starts sagging, even though they haven't changed their diet, it's the same thing throughout their life.

On this diet, everybody's perked. I remember when I got a 68-year-old man on the diet who was in the second stage of Alzheimer's. And his wife brought him and put him on the primal diet, and the Alzheimer's stopped at stage two and stayed at stage two. Improved a little bit, he remembered his wife's name, he remembered how to dress himself and stuff like that. So she never had to institutionalize him, she never had to worry about him getting lost, going away. His body, he did the diet 100%, never questioned it. He was just at that mentality, he just ate whatever she put down. In six years his body looked like a teenager's, like that. His wife was so happy, and he died after seven years, mid-70s, his last seven years were great on the diet and he didn't die of a heart attack or anything, he just died in his sleep. Just a nice comfortable death, and that's the way all of us should be happy to go, or more like Peter Sellers doing an orgasm, either way. This diet will keep you toned for life as long as you continue on. Then we have, you know, going to carbohydrates and carbohydrates are things like fruits and vegetables are considered carbohydrates, grains, nuts, all of those are considered carbohydrates because they're high in sugar, high in sugar products and byproducts. Now, in the human body, Columbia University at New York University found that in the human body when you use glycogen that's been made from a high carbohydrate concentration, you create a lot of advanced glycation end products, and they're called AGEs, advanced glycation end products. They store at a rate of 70 to 90% of every time you eat them, store in the body for a lifetime. They collect. It means your body is full of sugar. No wonder we deteriorate the muscle as we go, because it just starts, you know, it becomes a very acidic sugar reaction, the more water you drink the more your body dissolves itself, especially if you've got an acid sugar base in your body, in your tissue. They found that the 70% were healthy people, the 90% were people who had kidney condition or diabetics. The 70 to 90% of every time you eat a high-carbohydrate food that makes glycogen, that the body makes glycogen from it, which runs the brain and nervous system, 70 to 90% of that waste product stores in your body for your lifetime. [unintelligible] raw fooders who may be able to clean it out, especially on the final line, but so they only know they're in store.

And acrylamides are very linked with those too, which are carcinogenic. That's from a high-carbohydrate food that's cooked, especially in fats and oil. So anything cooked like that is a problem. But even the raw, if you're eating raw fruit, any kind of high-concentrated fruit, like your tomatoes are fruit, your cucumbers are fruit, zucchini, any of those squashes, those kind of squashes, summer squashes, are not high in fruit. I mean sugars. Your winter squashes are high in carbohydrates, like a carrot, high in carbohydrates. And almost all roots are high in carbohydrates, very high. Your potato, your carrot, almost all of them are very high. Your jicama. So all of those in high-end juice concentration will create a lot of this plant-based fluctuation in products. It causes the brain fluid, the nervous system fluid, the bloodstream, and the lymphatic fluid to all get sticky with that AGE. So what happens if you've got a sticky fluid in the brain, and your body goes to fire it, it's a synapse, and what happens? It goes in the wrong direction, hits a wall and bounces and sticks, never makes it to its end. What was that word I was trying to think of? What was that thought? What was my train of thought? All those things happen because of that stickiness. Fatigue can happen because it happens in the blood. The blood cells get very sticky. The whole fluid that they're traveling in is sticky. So it's like you trying to go through a quicksand. It's murky. It's thick. It isn't like water where you can travel through easier, but that's even a solution that is difficult because we're just passing through air. But when the cells get in the murky substance, it's almost like a high advanced glycation end product. It's almost like an acrylamide. It's like going through quicksand. If you've got a base, you're going to move, but you're going to move so fricking slowly to get through it, your legs will push through slowly, but you'll get through it as long as you can pull it, otherwise you're going to go down and that's it. So those advanced glycation end products are a problem, carbohydrates like seeds and nuts and all of that, high carbohydrate, so something you don't want much of. According to one scientist that I read, I forgot his name, in the late, mid-60s, he came out with that material and I didn't read it until the early 70s, he showed that he could make the human animal function biologically as an athlete, any other way, mentally and everything, if the diet was 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate, and he said in the citric acid cycle, you have the carbohydrate or vitamin C or something like that help digest and utilize with pyruvate, which is a protein sugar, and that combination made a certain amount of enzymes to utilize the fat as energy.

It's not really burning, that is a misnomer, that gives you a bad concept, it makes you think of the body like a car or like a machine, it is not like that, there's no fire inside the body. There's like, you eat, you don't spit out fire, you have a waste product, the fat becomes a fluid energy that lets a certain amount of electricity in your body in concentrated amounts, like a car that runs on battery, and pistons that burn fuel. So we're more like that, we're more a biological fluid system of utilizing fat as energy. So that combination, so that means calorically, 80% fat, 15% protein, so when you're looking at the difference between the volume of meat and the volume of fat, you're looking at an equal balance of them, because this is 2.5 times more energy than your protein, and then you've got some fat in your protein, but you want to add fat to any protein that you eat, so you don't burn your protein as fuel, so you don't utilize your protein as energy. So you want to keep the sugar level, the sugar intake, the fruit take, at a very low level, so it's only, most people need some alcohol to clean out their body and to make solvents like virus. So you can keep your diet to 10% or minus 5% strictly or less, because there's carbohydrate in meat, there's carbohydrate in every vegetable juice, so I get my 5% daily from that. I have a fruit maybe two or three times a week, when I used to have it maybe twice a day, or a lot at one time with a lot of fat once a day, but I eat very little now. The last category of food is not really a category, it belongs in the carbohydrate category, and that's starch. Now there are certain kinds of chemical byproducts from the brain, and they're called psychotropic trauma and stress hormone byproducts. Elnora Van Winkle, a doctor that was the woman responsible for cataloging, investigating, cataloging, researching, experimenting with all of the brain and nervous system. Every cell, every chemical that was in the brain and nervous system, she worked for Millhauser Laboratories at New York University, 47 to 52 years she did that. That's all she did. She knew the brain and nervous system inside and out. She wrote a paper called The Biology of Emotions, and you can find it on the internet. She's written one paper that is entirely, you won't understand it unless you have a chemical background, and then a layperson's. She saw that certain chemicals that were produced, hormones that were produced during trauma and stress, during trauma and stress, had byproducts like any other thing utilized in the body.

There was a byproduct, and that byproduct stored in the body like any other byproduct if you're not on a very healthy diet. She found that when her friends, her girlfriends, who were married and had children, husbands and stuff like that, had families, got into trauma states and anxiety states when there was no physical instance that created the behavior, she found that these byproducts were high in the blood. The body was detoxing them from storage wherever they were in the body, cleaning them out, but they created the same kind of emotional response as when the trauma or stress originally occurred. They would find, let's say, she had one instance where she said, okay, to her friend, okay, you're angry with your husband, you're giving him all the shit and he didn't do anything. If you just sit down and relax, wake up from a dream, wake up from a nap, tell me what you experienced. Tell me what goes on and we might find a clue to the memories of when you produced that particular stress that caused that byproduct to store. She took a nap right then and there and then woke up a few hours later and she remembered this event with her father. Her father had betrayed her by doing something for her sister that was really meant for her, promised for her. This whole event created this anxiety that lasted for almost two years in this woman. This woman resented her father for two years as a child from that one event. It took her eight weeks to detoxify all that before she could look at her husband without jumping on his butt. He was a male and her father was a male, so you just have to get rid of it. Elnora believed that primal therapy was good. Primal therapy is from the 60s and 70s where you vent your anger, you take a pillow, you beat it to death, you build a little dog house outside the house and you get in and you scream, you pad the walls and you scream and scream as loudly as you can and you release all of it. The problem with that, and I had arguments with Elnora back and forth about this, is you keep the anger and hostility moving in anger and hostility when you do that. If you take that energy and you sing or you dance, you exhibit in a way that makes you happy, when any of that comes up on you again, you're thinking is not going to be to beat somebody up, to beat a pillow up, or to be angry. It's going to automatically go to a way of creating a situation where you can transform it from anger and anxiety into singing and happiness, painting, whatever it is you do that makes you happy, that's where you burn the energy.

I had somebody approach me the other day saying, I do that primal therapy thing and it really works but I find myself in anger, and I said, but I told you, don't go along with primal therapy. Even though it's a primal diet, it's not the primal therapy of beating and being angry. You've got to release it in something creatively happy, something that creates happiness for you. You'll just get buried in that anger and that anxiety, and you're going to stay there. When you read her paper, discard that. Discard the primal therapy. Van Winkle, two words, W-I-N-K-L-E, Elnora. Anyway, she talks about those chemicals and how they come out of the body and you can be upset for no reason, but then chew somebody out and get on them. You need starches to bind with that kind of a compound. That's what I discovered. That's why I wrote the book the first time, eight years ago. I had cooked starch in there that you eat with lots of raw fat, equal amount of raw fat. If you have a baked potato, a half a baked potato, you have a whole stick of butter in it. If you don't go in and bind with the toxicity, the fat will bind with that and not allow it to store in the body and cause a problem. People went off, I know I can eat Italian bread, French bread, I can eat a baked potato, and they just went off on it, so I saw all these people taking that to the extreme and I saw this advanced glycation end product and the acrylamides collecting in the intestines, even though they were doing the diet better, you know, pretty much all the way everywhere else but that cooked starch they were having. So I said, well I've got to find a way to get rid of the cooked starch. So I started experimenting with things and another friend helped me come up with it. And what we did was took nuts, ground them until they were a flour, added honey, egg, and a fat, especially butter. And that neutralized the phytic acid, it helped release the starch from the nuts, and there's a lot of starch in nuts, even more than beans, that are released. Of course the nut you can have but there's a starch released without cooking it and the bean you can't release unless you're a vegetarian animal. So it only works with nuts. Now if you take a raw bean and powder it and eat it, you can count on it to almost die. It'll cause intestinal cramps you won't believe. Diarrhea for three days. I know I experimented with beans in several ways and almost died twice from it. I mean the cramps were just like my uncle described that I'd had with the rabbit. That happened with the beans. I was for sure I was going to die on the third day. It was that bad. Diarrhea, I mean it was every twenty minutes. Twenty-four hours a day for three days. Headaches, stomach cramps.

I was on the floor screaming out loud. I mean it was worse than I went through the pain on the knee and the stomach. It was excruciating. But thank God it was over in three days. But it probably took me about three months to recuperate from just one time of experimenting with the beans. The second time was just as bad. So I will test things. I don't take anybody's word for anything. And I've sacrificed my life a few times. But that way I know. I don't leave anything to conjecture and hypothesis and theory. If I haven't tested it, I don't say it's valid. If I insist a thought, I'll tell you it's probably a good guess or it's a theory of mine, and we'll see. Try it. So I tried it. So this cooked starches. So the nut formula. And that's called the net formula. It's in the recipe book, references in this book to the recipe book for the net formula. Very simple. Once a week is usually fine just to keep that kind of stuff out of the system. If you're going through trauma and anxiety and it doesn't have to do with your exercising when you should be exercising and you're not, then have the nut formula more frequently. Half of one a day or one every two days or one every three days. Find out what works for you. If, like I say in this book, if the net formula doesn't work for you, then have a cook starch once in a while with a lot of all fat. But I found that the cook starch is only needed by skinny, highly active athletes and people like that. Highly energetic, overactive people, hyperactive people. So I've met anybody who's slim but not skinny and who's got a nice weight, the nut formula always works for them. Okay, so those are the food categories we need to talk about. Now let's talk about qualities of fat, qualities of meat and stuff like that. Now in fact, the foods that, the fats that digest in the human system best are animal fats. The fats that are in meat are the easiest to digest, most easily digested. The fats that are marbled through meat that are part of meat, like when you get fish, usually you don't have pockets of fat, the fat is just all through the meat, all through the meat. It's just a part of the meat, they aren't separated. It's a tail sometimes there is. In chicken and birds, it's dispersed throughout the meat even though they have pockets of fat, and it's very concentrated. That's why if you're boiling chicken, the amount of fat that comes off of it is tremendous. You don't have any fat pockets on a leg of chicken, yet the amount of oil if you catch it that drips off of the fat is like five or six tablespoons. That's a lot of fat through those muscles and in that skin. If you remove the skin, you're going to have about a tablespoon and a half, almost two tablespoons and a half less fat, so the skin is very fatty, but we don't digest skin well. Plus, when you get a bird, they dip the bird in boiling water for one to two seconds, that makes it easy to remove the feathers, so the skin is boiled. Not even the fat underneath it is damaged, but that skin is damaged, so I don't suggest you eat it.

I don't suggest you feed it to your animals, bury it or throw it away and go to the dump or something like that, and the rats that are already unhealthy will eat it and that will make them a little healthier. And that fat will be healthier than the garbage they eat in the dumps. The best fats are the fats that are in the meat itself, whether it's poultry, seafood, fish, beef or any of the red meats. Next would be butter. Butter is the easiest, most easily digestible besides the meat fat. Why? To deliver that, I thought that lady, that was hers, anyway her, you just tell, is she here? Did she have to go eat? Pardon? Oh. Thank you. The reason that the butter is the easiest is because it takes very little, various forms of bile to break it down so the whole body can utilize it. Now, it digests very quickly and it's like an orphanage, the cells in the body are like an orphanage. The strongest, healthiest kids that get to the plates, get to the table where all the food is spread out, get the most food first. So your glands and your organs are going to take the butter first and foremost and there's not going to be much left, if there's any left, for the bones, skin, connective tissue, arteries, tendons, cartilage. So the muscles are going to take it, the glands, the organs are going to take it all. So that's the problem that I found, people would be eating tremendous amounts of fat, cream, butter and their skin would still be dry. So I needed to find a way to get fat in the body that would pass through so quickly that we get to the extremities without all the cells gobbling it up who are closer. So I came up with the moisturizing lubrication formula, and I do call it both. Talking to a man, I say lubrication because men like lubrication. Women like moisturizing, it appeals to them. So I use both because I want it to be a very appealing formula because it's a very important formula. It is the most important formula on the diet because it gets fats to everywhere in the body quickly, the only way to get it there. If you're young, your body's going to get it there anyway. If you're not, most of the time. If it's not, it may not get there easily because all these raw fats are going to be consumed by the glands and organs and muscles before it ever gets to the bones, connective tissue and skin. What it is is egg, butter, lemon juice, and a tiny bit of honey, and just a little bit of lemon juice. Now, it tastes like lemon meringue, so if you like lemon meringue pie, you're going to love lemon meringue drink, which is the moisturizing lubrication formula. If it coats your fecal matter, and your fecal matter comes out looking a little pearly coated, then you have to eat it 10 to 15 minutes after your meat meal and not with the meat meal.

If you eat it with the meat meal and your fecal matter doesn't come out undigested, I mean, in your fecal matter if your meat doesn't pass through looking pearly and undigested, then you can have the moisturizing lubrication formula with your meat meal, with the meat, otherwise wait 10 to 15 minutes after and have it. The cream is the hardest to digest, the dairy cream. The liver has to make a myriad of enzymes to make two-thirds of that cream into butter. The other third it makes into enzymes, I mean, fats, cholesterols that feed and protect the nervous system. That's when the body mainly gets the fat for the brain and nervous system, it's from raw cream. It doesn't have to rely upon E. coli to do that, although E. coli will break down fats further to help the brain and nervous system. But the cream usually has that amount of fat, it's part of the mother, the mammary glands making the cream to sedate and protect the nervous system as the fetus and the child develops. Other fats, pressed oils, they don't have any of the water-soluble fats, they're only oil-soluble. That means the body's going to make a tremendous amount of solvents from them. So they are 90% cleansing, they don't stabilize the skin, they don't do any of that, unless you cook it. And when you cook it, you have the swollen molecules, you have a more acidic nature to them, so then you become Italian, with a hot temper and passion, because it does irritate the nervous system. Olive oil, any of the pressed oils, olive oil, flax oil, any of them react the same way in the body. Coconut oil is probably the least problematic, it does not become acidic, so the body can use it in many more ways than it can't with the acidic, you know, safflower oil, flax oil, olive oil, those are very acrid oils, coconut is not oil, but still it contains none of the water-soluble vitamins, nor of any of the water-soluble nutrients, so it is all your fats that are pressed oils are inferior, you have this old scar tissue, you can do other things with it, you can help get rid of, you know, you can put it with your sauces to give it a certain flavor, but I suggest you only use a tablespoon of it to make a sauce using olive oil. If you are going to use it in like four ounces of a sauce, don't have it for three or four more days. You can have maybe one pressed oil a day, one pressed oil, tablespoon of pressed oil a day, and that will be medicinally okay. Anything beyond that is pushing it. Unless you are very overweight and want to help dissolve some of the old fats in your body, and there's nobody here that I would recommend to lose fat except for there, and then you could use a little extra olive oil or flax oil to help break down some of your fat.

Because those raw fats, especially pressed oils, will go down and help break up and dissolve old toxic fats that are swollen in the body. Coconut cream is an incredible source of a nutrient. Like I say, when I use that to prevent drying out of my body, and also I have the water-soluble vitamins and everything in it, and combined with the honey, it worked wonders. I've seen people use, and I've used just the honey. It does not work like it does when used... I mean, it would have taken me probably twice the time to seal this and this in the spot on my ankle. It would have probably taken me a month to seal it. But with that coconut cream, I was able to do it half the time. Half the time. Two weeks and it was all sealed. We're talking deep.

Q: What is coconut cream?

A: You take the meat of the mature coconut, you've got to beat this stick and you have to pry it off the shell, and you juice that. You run it through a juicer, you separate the cream from the pulp. It is very tasty, but you do not want to sit there and gulp a lot, even though it's incredibly delicious. Because if you do, it's very heavy. And you could start vomiting, you could have all kinds of problems happen. Never eat more than four ounces at a time. For most people, I suggest only three ounces. If you're a small, diminutive person, there's nobody like that here, two and a half ounces, five tablespoons a day, and that's it. But it will clean stuff out of your body quicker than anything else, and it helps protect, it helps heal, it helps all kinds of things. It isn't stabilizing like milk, it's more cleansing, but it works very well in the system. It helps get rid of toxic metals out of the system. If I take a top like this, all of these things have a sealer on them, so there's a lacquer sealer over all this metal, so it'll last a little bit longer. But if I were to remove, after long use of that sealer, and I take coconut cream and I put it on this metal, in an hour it'll turn gray, start ripping up the metals, dissolving them instantly. If I put butter on here, it could take a day, a week to start dissolving the metal, and I'll never see it turn gray, unless I let it sit for three weeks, a month. If I put olive oil or flax oil on here, it could take three days, it could take a week. Coconut oil on there, even longer. But the coconut cream, could do it within an hour, start ripping it up. So that coconut cream, I recommend everybody eat coconut cream in the afternoon with a fruit meal. Remember, mainly fruit is going to be used to help you utilize fat as fuel, as energy, and to clean the body, because the body will make a certain amount of alcohol. It will reduce the amount of alcohol that's produced from fruit, you eat it less ripe. The more ripe, the more alcohol your body is going to produce, the more cleansing you're going to have. That's fine if you're early on the diet and if you're overweight, because it will help make more alcohol and you can clean better. But I mean overweight. I don't mean, you know, trim. You're fine. You could eat more ripe fruit rather than unripe fruit for a while. But then if you lose about, let's say, 7, 8, 10 pounds, stop that. Eat more unripe fruit. I like you just the way you are. It's more protective and you'll be a lot healthier. Six or seven years down the line, you're never going to be that big anymore. Only a few people who are very sick. I took one woman. I had a model that was six foot and almost like Twiggy. She's from Canada, very sickly. Put her on the diet. She got to 260 pounds.

So that went her career that way. But she still had a great personality. So she worked as a public relations individual for an advertising. And, you know, tremendously strong and healthy and happy. Loved the diet 100%. Now she's been on the diet about nine years, something like that. And this last year and a half, she started losing that weight. You know, she's always had big chichangas, you know, so they're huge still. They're even bigger, you know, since she was skinny. They weren't, they were big, but not obtrusive. But her breasts are dolly parts and she could have, you know, a contest, you know. But she lives with it, you know, the big breasts. But she's powerful. Now, 32 years old and, you know, so she was very young when she came to me. 32 years old and she's now entering competition in tennis. I'm talking about a six foot girl who is on the big side, muscular side. But, you know, she's not skinny like she was and she's not thin. She has hips now, she looks like a very curved, voluptuous woman, like, you know, a larger scale Marilyn Monroe. And powerful, man, can she hit that tennis ball. She's incredible. And this isn't somebody you see as, you know, a tennis player. And she's incredible. It took her about nine years, eight and a half years to get to that point, to lose it. But she was a very sick person, a very skinny person, who had been poisoned because she was a model. And all those poisons were going into her live cells, damaging her live cells, and made her chronically fatigued with fibromyalgia by the time she was 23 years old. So those people will take longer to lose that weight. But most women, six, seven years. And the women with cancer, 12, 14 years. It will happen and you will always be slim and you'll never be huge. You'll never be big and fat. You may be fat, but nobody will see it because your fat molecules will be small. Like I'm considered fat, 20% body fat for a man. I'm considered fat. But do I look it? No, because it's a small molecule. But I still like to be up to 22, then I'm big and fat. But then I don't look it, I just got a bigger waist. Bigger girth all over. So those pressed oils are not great fats. They're to be used medicinally for cleansing. And they can clean scar tissue, like I say, and I have other references for what they do in We Want to Live. So that pretty well covers the categories of fats. Cheese is basically a fat unless you eat it with honey, high in concentration minerals. But you're not going to digest much of that fat unless you eat it with honey, just like you're not going to absorb the minerals and much of the cheese, it's going to pass through you. 

But you will digest some of that fat, about 20% of the fat in cheese, if the cheese has been made from full-fat milk. Of course, if the cheese is just made from skim milk, there's no fat in it anyway. So you're just going to absorb the protein and the minerals if you eat it with cheese. So you just have to eat extra butter, some other kind of fat to make up for that balance. And I always tell people, if you're eating cheese from a skim milk source, then make sure you eat lots of butter with it so you don't get constipated. There's another thing. I was constipated as a child. I moved once every three to four or five days. So you can imagine the collection of poop I had. It was like granite, literally like granite. It was just like rock. You know, it came out, it had sharp edges on it. And it ripped my rectum. By the time I was 21, my rectum was almost an inch thick all the way around. Inch thick rectum. And it should be about what, 16th? 16th? Sometimes a little bit larger than a 16th of an inch thick. Mine was almost an inch thick from all the scarring. Because it would all come out and it would be huge. And it would rip my rectum. It would slice the entire rectal area, the whole canal as it came out. Just scrape it and scratch it. So I would lose anywhere from two to three tablespoons of blood every time I went. This isn't much when you're going once every three to five days. But it was traumatic. Going to the toilet for me was traumatic. It's painful. My parents didn't like me to scream. So I wasn't allowed to scream. So I had to do everything I could. Bite on leather, on a piece of, on a stick, a branch or something like that to withstand it. Then when I went on a raw food diet, I had, it was easy for me to move every day, several times a day. But that first part was just like granite. It was that way up until two years ago. Two years ago, you know, I'd been trying to spike myself with parasites all those years because I could get well, healthier, faster. You know, because of my animal laboratory experience, the animals who had parasites, when they were brought, I put an ad in the paper, a laboratory and I got together, I went to a laboratory and paid them. We put an ad in the paper for animals that had parasites, had to be from 12 to 14 years old. And this was Los Angeles, so there's a lot of animals out there that have problems. So, we got about 15, well, we got about 20 some animals, but some of them were dying right away and they wouldn't be good for the experiment. We needed something that was a little bit more alive.

And all the animals had varied kinds of parasites. And we took half of the group, fed them the raw stuff, and then the other half we fed cooked stuff. Those that got cooked stuff that had the parasites still had a lot of problems. We had three all together. The next time we ran three. And we had a group that were given dewormers, pharmaceutical grade and then homeopathic grade, and the other group not, just the raw meats. So, in the first group, the ones that had the cooked foods didn't improve. Lots of parasites, lots of problems, a lot of waste, a lot of fatigue, bleeding. We gave the raw meats to the other group. They were dogs and cats only we used. Their parasites were gone in three to six months, and they were like puppies and kittens again. Entirely different. Just like that pug, you know, revived so quickly, that much in six months. See a human recover that much in six months, everybody would be astounded. So, we kept the animals until they died, and some of them lived as long as 18 years old, and we dissected them at their death. We also dissected all the other ones that died, that died with their parasites and bleeding and disease. And their guts and everything inside were dark, black, just like the Pottenger cat's photographs, you know, those who lived and died on the processed cooked foods. They had black, you know, dehydrated, very ill-looking tissue. Connective tissue was like mucus and it wouldn't even hold. You know, it was very, very awful. And that's the way it was with these animals that had parasites to the end, that ate the cooked meat. The ones that we dissected upon death that had the parasites and ate the raw meat, every gland, particularly like one had heart worms, one dog had heart worms, about four of them had liver worms, one had brain worms. All of the areas where they had the parasites, those glands or organs were beautiful. Beautiful, red, rich. All of their glands had reconstituted because the parasites got rid of the waste product quickly and they were able to regenerate those glands or organs rapidly because they had the raw meat. The animals that we tested that had bacterial infections, their increase in health and vitality was half the rate of those that had parasites. That's why I think parasites are your best friend. So I was trying to induce parasites, to do something about this bowel situation of mine. I tried trichinosis, didn't work with me. 

Joel Weinstock, a gastroenterologist at the University of Iowa, he had grown up on a farm, been a farmer as a child, became a doctor, chose the gastro field as his specialty, went to this University of Iowa, found that the animals that they had, especially the pigs that they had in the university, everything was clean and immaculate. They were on concrete with fresh straw on it, and the straw would be changed every day. So fecal matter didn't settle, urine didn't settle, they had proper drainage, so it stayed very clean. Those pigs were very lethargic, sick, vomited a lot when they ate their food, had diarrhea frequently. So he tested their intestinal tracts and compared it with those animals that were on the farms that were wallowing around in the mud and the swamp and everything else and were vitally healthy. The only thing he could see differently was that they didn't have the whipworms. The animals in captivity in the university had no trichinosis. So he took the trichinosis and spiked it into the pigs at the university. They got well in a week, well in a week. So he did this many times, found that it worked wonderfully and he knew that most humans had trichinosis throughout the world, tribes people, trichinosis. The human has had trichinosis heavily up until the last hundred years. We're always told that what's the worst thing you have to be afraid of? Trichinosis. Cook your pork until it's really done. Trichinosis, trichinosis. Get trichinosis from pigs. I've never been able to produce it. But Joel Weinstock did. What he did was he filtered out the eggs from a pig's intestines. He put it in Gatorade, which is a very alkalinizing substance, and then fed it to six patients. Now he had to get a license to do this from the FDA. The FDA says, okay, you can do that with six patients. But they all have to have tried medical therapy for ten years. And that is a law. An MD, a licensed MD, any kind of practitioner that's a medical doctor of any kind, has to give medical treatment for ten years before they can use any alternative, or else they're breaking the law and can have their license taken away and even jailed. So that's the first time I heard about the law, that law. And it's true. Ten years. So he gave it to these six patients, and the patients suffered anywhere from ten to thirty-two years with IBS. And their rate of IBS was like if they drank water, they had intestinal cramps. Anything else, they vomited, they had diarrhea. He spiked them with the trichinosis eggs. They cultivated in their intestines. In six days, six to seven days, they were asymptomatic. That quickly. They had no symptoms, they had no diarrhea, no cramping, no vomiting. Lasted for five months. Then they were back at the school, give us some more trichinosis. Exactly the opposite of everything we're told.

You can go online now, and if you can find the website where they do it, eight doctors followed up on his work for like six years and did experiments and found that it worked in all these humans. So now you can buy trichinosis in a vial through the internet. So you put Joel Weinstock, Whipworm, trichinosis, and you'll come up with the tests that follow that, and then you can get them in a vial. But again, that's a wash, it is a treated chemical, even though it's eggs, there's still a solution that's artificial. So what I tell my patients is to go to one of my Amish farmers on the product list and order a pig's small intestine, a section of it, and eat about a quarter of a cup of it, and you'll no longer be constipated, you'll no longer have a bowel problem for a certain amount of time. For some people, one time and it cures them for life. Others, they have to take it every six months to a year for a few years, and then they're cured for life. Well, I wanted to spike myself because I wanted to get rid of this sugar, this diabetic-like stuff that had been stored in my body forever. Because like I said, I ate cereals, donuts, I was a heavy carb eater. I liked my cooked steaks well done, but I ate mostly carbs all day long. Donuts, powdered donuts, God, I loved it. So I knew I was full of this sugar, and I knew that was mainly the problem, why I was still having that first part of my bowel movement like granite. So I wanted to get that sugar out of the intestinal walls. So I took milk, and I put about four tablespoons of maca powder in it, which is a root high in carb, and I fermented it together. And that maca is like cereal. It tastes like cereal, the crumbs of Cheerios or something like that. And I put some honey in it, so I let that all ferment together. Something I don't suggest anybody do until I put out the detoxification book that takes you step by step to do it. So this is something you don't do at home yet, because it is not enjoyable. It can be dangerous for somebody. It's dangerous for me. So I fermented it, and I fermented it for about ten days. Usually I don't let things ferment that long unless it's meat. So I popped the cork on it. I had it in one of the bottles like this, up to about here. And I went like that and it was so high in alcohol it burned my nose and actually turned my eyes red for two days. I drank three cups of it at once. Dumb, dumb, dumb, stupid. Yes, I was. I had welts, I had hives that were as big as my hand. I had to go to Hanoi the next day. I'm on a plane and I'm itching, itching. I go to the toilet and I take out my little jar of, I've got an ice pack there with a jar of tomatoes and cucumbers and I'm rubbing it every hour. It's 12 hours to Hanoi and I have to stop in Taiwan for two hours for a transfer.

So every hour I'm in the bathroom rubbing these big, huge welts. They were from on my butt all the way up to here and on the front from here down to here. So I'm dealing with that. I said all I wanted was a freaking parasite, you know, tapeworm or something like that to clear my intestine. So, and I studied, I knew that, you know, the only children and the people in Africa who had all those tapeworms in third world countries were the ones that said they had cereal and powdered milk, that highly fermentable stuff in their intestines because it's so processed. So those are the ones that had tapeworms. So I thought, you know, I can't get a whipworm or a pinworm and I ate a whole undulating piece of salmon that just undulated with pinworms. And I ate all of that, thousands of them and probably 5, 10 million eggs and didn't get one whip, I mean one pinworm. Had my feces and urine checked and blood checked for 10 weeks and not a one stuck in my gut. That was in about 1980, 81 when I did that. So this was three years ago that I did this. Yeah, three years ago. No, two years ago. Two years ago July. I guess it was just two years ago. Two years ago July. And I'll have to look in my notes and see what exactly, but three years ago. And then I get to Hanoi, so I'm stuck in a hotel for three days dealing with these hives because I won't scratch them. I want to see what happens to them. I don't want to change the structure of my body. When I got to Hanoi, I wanted to take skin scrapings. The laboratory is there. I can get something done there for $150, $200. It takes me $3,000, $6,000 here. So I was going to take full advantage of that there. So on the third day, they started scabbing over. I was living in a bathtub. Every hour I was either putting cold tomato on, and then the next hour cold cucumber, and the next hour I'd be in a cold bathtub with tomato and vinegar in there. So I'd just rotate that for those three days of dealing so I didn't have to scratch at all. But it all came to a heavy scab on the top anyway. So I took the scrapings at the end when it was coming off so I didn't tear the skin. And I put coconut cream on it. You can get coconut cream everywhere in Asia. Put that on there and then help it fall off. Of course, in the laboratory I had to tell them to remove certain steroids, which are from fats. And that was the word I was looking for before. There are lots of steroids. Everybody makes steroids is the idea of making a hormone. They're usually intercellular hormones that are made with a lot of fats. So when they make a steroid, they do it with a vegetable fat and not an animal fat the way our body does. But the coconut cream, I had to tell them to not even, you know, to dismiss the high rate of steroids. I wanted to know what chemical compound was in there. Guess what we got? Chemotherapy. AZT.

AZT and lots of acrylamides and advanced glycation products together. Now AZT is what they gave me as chemotherapy in 1968. It was outlawed a year later. It said it was too toxic for man. And that's the chemotherapy they gave me. What happens in 1985 or 84? They had vaults of it. Hundreds of millions of dollars of AZT that they had planned on feeding people with cancer. And then it was outlawed. FDA shut it down and said, too toxic. Too toxic was too obvious. It crippled me from the pectorals down. You know, it was too obvious how toxic it was. They brought it out of the vaults for AIDS. It said it would work for AIDS without any testing. Just to get rid of it out of the vaults. Do you know what's coming out of the swine flu vaccine pretty soon? I mean, for the Avian flu vaccine pretty soon? The swine flu. Remember the swine flu? 1976? What happened? Oh, swine flu is going to take over the world. Again, they're blaming some natural creature. How is the fricking swine flu going to get into a human body if the cells of the swine eat it? If the cells of the swine manufacture the virus? It's not contagious. You cannot get in other animals or insects virus. Impossible. It's not contagious. It does not reproduce. So the whole swine flu, President Ford went on, got his injection. Who was vice president? Rockefeller. What does Rockefeller own? Five pharmaceutical houses. Did Rockefeller come on and get a shot with President Ford? Hell no. He knew. He knows that it's unnecessary and stupid and dangerous. So two individuals filed suit against Ford, against Rockefeller, and the FDA and the federal government for the swine flu and said this is a dangerous substance. There's no evidence that swine flu can even be in humans. And it was Ida Honorof, a consumer advocate, and an MD named McBean. They were both from San Diego. And McBean, Ida Honorof had a show, so she was syndicated in like 160 some radio spots, consumer advocates. So this got the press, I mean, alerted in the suit. So the press started and they said, you want to see what happens? Go to the vaccine polls, they call them, I don't know. You go there and you get your free injections. So the government paid $7 billion for the swine flu vaccine to give it to all the population, because they are kind-hearted, give it to everybody. And whose pocket did that go into? Our Vice President, Rockefeller. His pharmaceutical house has made it. So 2,300 people died the first week who got the swine flu. That got closed down immediately because the press was there watching and reported it. The swine flu went into the vaults. Guess what's coming out is the Avian flu vaccine. Swine flu is going to come right out of the vaults. They're showing you all this research that you're doing on Avian flu.

They got the laboratories pumping, trying to produce it. And you can better believe what's going to come out of the vaults is a relabeled swine flu as Avian flu. You have to understand that a virus is a solvent that a cell makes. Cells only will detox for 24 to 72 hours. That's all it takes them to use it. And then three days later, you'll see no signs of that virus again. A virus will always change. Then it's no longer the same virus. You've got 300,000 viruses just in the human body because you have a virus that will work on a specific tissue intracellularly. It's like let's say you needed a variety of viruses just to clean your connective tissue if it was damaged by a chemical or even a mushroom. Mushrooms damage connective tissue pretty easily and readily. So let's say somebody ate a poison mushroom and they weren't damaged just by factory chemicals, industrial chemicals. The body would make a virus because bacteria and parasites can't eat this poison. It would kill them. I mean bacteria and parasites nor fungus. So they wouldn't survive in a situation like that. So the body would make a virus for that situation. So we would make a variety for the connective tissue that connect with the nails underneath where the nails grow. It's a different tissue than the connective tissue here. So as you go along in the joints the same way. So in the arm alone you can have 2,000 varieties of viruses that'll be local just for the cells surrounding that area for that tissue. So they're saying oh viruses change shape every you know three days and they're called retroviruses and what else do they call them? I forget what else. It means they're always changing over. Sure they're changing over because different cells make them and also they're not cleaning out the same tissue all the time. So a virus is absolutely gone in three days, 72 hours. You will never see that same virus again. So let's say they get a virus from a bird and they cause it and they infect all of these cells in a petri dish and they cause those cells to manufacture that specific or a variety of avian viruses produced by those eggs that they make it in. So it produces and produces and produces from those eggs because those egg cells are alive and they're producing the virus. The virus aren't multiplying on their own. Those cells are making because of the toxic environment of the petri dish. The solution it's living in is not natural. So the cell is getting toxic and it cleans itself out a little at a time. So these are avian cells because they're from an egg. Almost all the vaccines you get are that that occur in birds because 99% of all diseases are grown or vaccines are grown in eggs.

And they throw in there formaldehyde and mercury and aluminum and detergent and say that's healthy for you. Prevents you from getting disease. Hell, lick somebody's butt, get E. coli, you know. That's natural immunity. Every animal does it. You know if you think of immunity but if you look at it the way the animals look at it, oh there's brain food. E. coli in the predigested matter, there's brain and nervous system food. And that's the way the animals probably look at it. It has nothing to do with immunity. That is a manufactured idea of the medical community. Immunity. You don't have to be immune for things that aren't toxic. And the only thing toxic in our environment is industrial pollution. So we need to be immune to our factories and everything else in our environment. You know, that's produced from industry. So anyway, on the third day, you know I had the skin tested and I said all the compounds were in it. Lots of carbohydrates, lots of advanced glycation end products, lots of acrylamides were all in that tissue. Very concentrated. All of a sudden a few days later I saw a noodle swimming in the water after I had a bowel movement. It was a tapeworm. A section of a tapeworm. I got excited. Oh my gosh, I got a tapeworm finally. So I was able to start going around, went to the laboratories in Hanoi, went to the hospital, took a look at the people there, the health, you know. They're always fascinated with an American coming around and curious, you know. Even though I told them I was a nutritionist and a medical researcher, not a doctor at the time. I just got my doctorate a year ago, two years ago in August. I was an honorary doctor even though they tested the hell out of me.  It wasn't purely an honorary doctor when they test you. I mean, the tests went on for months, tested me on everything. I guess they didn't think I wrote my own books. They let me use those as my dissertation. So that was very fortunate. So anyway, I went over there. They let me be in there with patients, examining them and everything. It was frightening. You've got teenage girls that are 16, 17, 18, 20 years old that actually have plastic stomachs. They have stretch marks from having babies. Plastic. From all this. So you have to understand that the worst foods the industry is taking from him that the USDA doesn't allow and aren't approved. They're selling them to these other countries. So anything high, let's say they've over-hydrogenated some kind of food, it'll go to Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Thailand and Indonesia everywhere and Malaysia everywhere. And I've seen it. I've been probably 40 hospitals or more. More than 40 hospitals there. And all these young girls who have these stretch marks. It's actually plastic. You can see plastic. It's shiny. Sort of like plastic.

And they're giving them steroids and stuff like that during birth. And they're calling it medication. You're just dumping anything on them. They're purposely destroying these civilizations. Purposely destroying these civilizations. And you see their mothers standing there have had six kids. This child has had one child. And they don't have any stretch marks. Because they eat the old way. Lots of fresh foods. Even though they may cook them or steam them. They're eating raw meats. It's a culture there. The new kids don't. Because they're subjected to TV which tells them that, oh, that stuff's dirty. You'll get bacteria. You'll get disease from it. So they're doing everything, the packaged food. The kids. Anybody above 30 is not doing that. Anybody below 30 is doing McDonald's and all the packaged garbage food that comes out of a store. And it's sad and it's sickening. Can you imagine going off into a jungle where people still in their native attire wearing their skirts. Even men wearing their Asian skirts. And they're living in grass huts. And they're kicking around bamboo woven balls. Chickens running around and the children running around naked, no clothes. Primitive. We're talking about nothing is developed anywhere around. But they'll have a little store there with soda pop galore and lots of medication. A pharmacy combined with a little deli store that sells nothing but pop and candy and medication. Every one of those huts has electricity. Everyone has a TV. Where did they get the electricity? They make 50 cents a day per family household. It would cost at least 50 cents a day to run the electricity to run their TV. No refrigerators except in the store. They've got a TV. Who paid for it? General Electric. Throws it out there. General Electric is now in their banks in Asia in their banking system. General Electric, who made all your war toys, was responsible for a lot of the experiments on humans. General Electric was big in that industry, the Nazi-like industry. General Electric giving them TVs. Why? Because do you know that in 30 minutes of a TV show in Thailand or Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam, you have 8 to 10 commercials per half hour. Most of it is drugs. And they don't have the, you know, don't take this because you are, as they say, the side effects may be diarrhea, vomit, headaches. You know, it's like, why would you want me to take this? I've got a little bit of cramping, female intestinal cramping, and you want me to take something, it might be diarrhea, vomiting, headaches, and I've just got a little pain here, a little cramp.

There's no thinking like that. So they don't tell them any side effects over there. This is good for this, this is good for this. Take this, you got a headache? Take this. You got menstrual cramps? Take this, with no side effects like you make yourself sick, and this. That's only because we have people who are not doctors, not pharmaceutical people, who are saying, hey, there's side effects, you've got to do something about this. And that's people like you and me, saying, hey, you've got to do something about this. But they don't have that oversight of intelligence in those kind of third world countries. So they're indoctrinating these people into not listening to their parents, eating garbage food, and thinking that everything their parents do is primitive and dirty. So there's no respect for any of the kids that leave their families and go to the major cities in any of those countries. They think their families are primitive and dirty and crass, uneducated and poor. When they're in their jungle, healthy, strong, happy, what's rich? These kids are getting sick, stretch marks that are plastic, abdomens because they're eating processed vegetable oils. Vegetable oils are very bad in the human body. That's what causes hardening of the arteries, hardening of the heart. Vegetable oils in a vegetarian animal, which is an herbivore, has a body temperature of 102 to 105 degrees. They keep vegetable oil fluid in their systems. Ours is 98.6 and lower, only we go to a fever very occasionally, and that's not enough time to melt that vegetable oil. What vegetable oil does in the human body, even if it's raw, if it's built as a part of the cell, it crystallizes. It dehydrates and becomes crystal. It hardens the artery. Finite crystals take a high-powered microscope, an electronic high-powered microscope, to see those crystals, but they become a part of the cell, a part of the cell in the artery or the heart, and you have hardening. Vegetable oils are responsible, not animal fats. If you eat only animal fats, even cooked, have no heart disease, no congestion, no arterial hardening. None of that problems. No congestive heart failure. The fats don't even congest in their bodies. Why? Because we have the proper temperature for animal fats. That's why I don't want you to have olive oil, flax oil, or any of those oils, because they're on the order of vegetable oils. Very often [unintelligible]. Not enough for the body to start using it to build cells and make it a compartment of cells just to use as a solvent to dissolve certain kinds of tissue so that you can be healthier. Okay. So we covered food pretty well. Now, if you want to know specifics about fruits that help condition, you know, that help certain conditions, all of that's in here in the last two-thirds of the book, We Want to Live. Thousands of raw food remedies for hundreds of diseases. 

And I suggest that everybody go through it with a highlighter. Any symptom you've ever had in your life, unless you're on raw food, and I know none of you are on raw food with raw meats your whole life, they're going to revisit you in your life. So if you have it highlighted, you'll know where to go. And if you download the PDF version, you know, you can search it in an instant anywhere. So it takes you five minutes to locate every spot in the book that mentions that kind of problem. If you have it here, you're going to have to say, where did I see that? And, you know, you have to look a little hard. But there's a PDF version at wewant2live.com. And the two is not T-O. It's a numeral two. Wewant2live.com.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: First time I've heard that. Sometimes they'll be correcting something or putting something new on the website. And they were going to put something new on there. They told me, it's not my website. I don't have time to do a website. But I contracted with this couple who have done the diet and reversed their problems and everything. And they pay for and run the website. And they contracted to put all of my information, all of my information out there. So I do a newsletter that comes out every two, two and a half months. And all the other material that is not published, you can read of mine that I have written and I've given them to publish articles and interviews and stuff like that. So it's all available there. But you can download the PDF version of each book and you can search it like that. Put a word in there and you'll know right away, you know, it comes up with the spots and pages and you just click on those spots and there you are. So it makes it quick. Now if you print that, it's not a printable version. If you print it, you're going to have this little logo. Where'd it go? Oh, it's on this one. This logo is going to pop up and obliterate. That's to keep people from copying and reproducing it. Printing it a lot to read it. And you have to have a keyword to open the file. You have to have a password to open your file. So you can't just give it to people unless you give them the password with it. So that's why it was set up that way for security reasons. So it's good to have both versions if you want to be faster, you're helping people, you want to help people with this, you can come up with the answers quicker. I don't have to do it because I remember all of it. I don't have to do that. But everybody else, I would recommend that they do that because it will save you from calling me. I only charge $120 an hour over the phone and I can give you the answers fast. But a lot of people can't afford that. It's only $20 for 10 minutes. A lot of people would rather afford it than go through the book, even get on the computer to look. But there's other people that would rather spend their money in a different way and I'm all for that. I'd rather you enjoy your money rather than give it to me. I'm doing fine. I'm not rich and I don't charge you a lot. Nutritionists in Beverly Hill and Westwood and those areas, $2,000 just to get in the door the first time. I charge $300. And I give them personal attention. You go into their offices, you give them papers and you never see the nutritionist until your second visit. Second visit is $500 to $1,000. And then they're giving you pills that cost thousands of dollars. Vitamins and enzyme supplements. I'm not a greedy person. I can live very easily.

I can live in a grass hut and be very happy as long as I have the good food. Because I know that happiness comes from health and not having a lot of money because I know people who are filthy rich. I mean filthy rich like Fred Segal. Four years ago, five years now, he's been on the diet. He was only 67 years old and he was like this. I mean skin and bones because he was a vegetarian. His wife, he married a vegetarian woman. So she was 30 years younger than he was. So he was just so feeble like this. And then a year after he's on the diet, standing up straight, put on about 20 pounds, 25 pounds, so much better, did so well that his vegetarian wife said that if he ever went off the diet she would leave him because he became very nice. He was a tyrant like a lot of skinny people are. You've got this acid going in the nervous system to get the fat out of the myelin because they can't find it anywhere else and it causes irritability. And you know that skinny women and skinny men are much more volatile. They can make a mountain out of a molehill in a split second. I dated Twiggy one day and I didn't even call her after that. 1972 or 1973 and I had to be in an industry where I could make money and I was too sick to do anything else. I just didn't look sick after I got a predominantly raw diet, but I was so sick I was vomiting, still had diarrhea all the time and I moved slowly. My publicity agent was the head of MGM Publicity and he wanted me to take her to Butterflies are Free, the opening of the movie Butterflies are Free, at the new Westwood Cinemas. Branded cinemas, the first multiplex, there was only three. That was a multiplex in those days, 1972-73. So they hadn't finished construction in the halls in the back and because of the chemotherapy and the radiation I was very light sensitive. So we're going in and all the flashes and all of that almost gave me, in fact it gave me a headache. So I didn't want to walk out to the front of the paparazzi, I wanted to go through the alley so we sent somebody out to tell the limo to meet us at the alleyway on the side. So we went out through the back and there's building materials all in alleys. In the movie theaters you have alleys in the theater to take you passageways to the exits. So I was a little ahead of her looking around and I went in to look a little bit more to make sure that we could pass through and out. So she came in and Justin, her manager, and Dory Freeman, and we went into the hallway and I was going to tell them not to close the door just in case that would lock. We'd not be able to get in, maybe there was a problem. There was too much building materials we couldn't get through safely. So Twiggy panicked.

She thinks we're locked in this hallway. She screamed and she screamed at the top of her lungs. We're locked in here, we're going to die in here. And I mean she's just going on and on and on. So Justin and I took her and practically slapped her. We shook her, did slap her, to bring her out of it. And it took a good shaking of two minutes to get her out of it. And then she wasn't calm the rest of the night. That's how volatile 90, 95% of your thin people are. They're very volatile. And I found that with any people that I've been with. Most of them are volatile. Once in a while you'll find some that aren't. But most of the time thin people are volatile. They don't have any fat to protect themselves from all the pollution and poisons in everything. So get fat. Keep fat and happy. Absolutely. We've got to get through the portion where I want to tell you how to eat to keep the brain and nervous system and body at peak production. If you're interested in that. So you wake up in the morning, the blood is very acidic. Especially if you haven't woken during the night and eaten something. Protein, egg, milk, milkshake, meat, something during the night. But regardless if you've eaten something, that blood stream is going to be acidic because the nervous system starts cleaning as soon as the sun goes down. It's heavy into cleansing from midnight to 5 o'clock in the morning and then stops. And where did I say most of the free radicals, heavy metals, and most acidic substances live? In the brain and nervous system. So that blood is quite toxic when you awaken in the morning. You need to alkalinize it with a green vegetable juice. That doesn't mean carrot juice, it means a green vegetable juice. Juices that have a lot of chlorophyll and very little carbohydrates. The best one is celery juice. Celery does not have enough carbohydrate to digest the cellulose or anything in the celery. So it can help clean out your blood of sugars and help clean the blood and balance the mineral system in the blood. And the mineral concentration in celery juice is almost identical to blood serum. Not blood cells, but blood serum. So watermelon also has, but it's too high in sugar. So celery should be 70-80% of the vegetable juice. Then you need something high in chlorophyll, even though it has a little bit more carbohydrate in it, like parsley, cilantro, spinach. Those are high chlorophyll, or comfrey is the highest in chlorophyll, but it's hard to find comfrey. But parsley is your best and most even. Cilantro will cause you to start pulling heavy metals out of the body and detoxification, so you have to be careful with cilantro, and it tells you about that in the recipe book.

So you put maybe 10-15% of that in your juice, and maybe 5% carrot or 5% zucchini. So you just balance the juice that way you have, and in the recipe book I give suggestions for the quantities for your size. So that's in there, so you can find that in there. Then, if you have a lot of nausea that you experience throughout the day when you're on this diet, because let me tell you, when you go on a raw diet, sometimes that liver, your pancreas will start dumping poisons, and you might get nauseous. And you think, oh, this food isn't good for me. I have no taste, it's making me nauseous. And even the body will react as if the food's doing it. It's your body doing it with the food, not the food doing it directly, because your body's poisoned, not the food that's poisoned. Your body's the poisoned thing. So it dumps those poisons into the stomach, heavy chemical poisons. You get bitten by a rattlesnake. Guess where you'll find the highest concentration of that snake serum? In your stomach, because hydrochloric acid neutralizes it. That's how people survive. The body dumps it into the stomach. Chemotherapy, guess where you'll find most of it? In the stomach lining and dumping into the stomach. Any kind of chemical. When you get a vaccine, I find that most of the formaldehyde, mercury, and aluminum go to the stomach lining. And I've seen people that haven't had a vaccine in 20, 30 years still have some of that mercury in their stomach lining, still quite a bit of the aluminum, and scabs of the formaldehyde still stuck in their stomach. And the only way that I've been able to come up with a formula to get rid of the formaldehyde is about half a cup of mangoes. It's not in the books. Most people need to have this once a week, not every day, because formaldehyde is very dangerous. That's why the body doesn't release it from the stomach lining very frequently. So half a cup of mango, quarter cup of kiwi, three ounces of honey, two to three ounces of coconut cream and about a teaspoon of lime juice. Blend that together and mix it with a half a cup of sparkling mineral water. Very tasty, very nice, very good, just like some kind of fruit soda. But you only have that once a week at best, maybe once every two weeks. Formaldehyde is very dangerous stuff. It should never be injected in anybody. Benjamin Franklin stopped the milk industry. The large dairies, they were putting formaldehyde in milk as a preservative in his day. He stopped them because it's a poison. The food industry doesn't give a shit about your health, I tell you.

They're out to sell a product and they don't care what they put in it. If it smells good and tastes good to you, you'll eat it, no matter if it poisons you to death. Just be careful. So, you can have a little coconut cream before you juice, or cheese. Cheese, coconut cream together.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, this is for nausea. It'll absorb the toxicity. Ten minutes before you eat anything. When I've clocked the body from putting a tube down some people's throats, and they actually let me do that. I measured the solution in their stomachs every time they ate, and all day long. Every few minutes we were taking out a solution. What we found was that as soon as food goes into the stomach, the stomach starts dumping poisons that are in the stomach lining, or they're stored somewhere else around the stomach. And it will dump it. If you stop eating, ten minutes goes by, the body stops dumping it. Because it'll mix in the food, and the body's hoping that the food will absorb it, and maybe not be absorbed into the body, and just pass out of the system. So you have these people that eat all day long, and eat all day long, and not digesting anything, or digesting certain parts of it, and never being satisfied, so they over-eat, and over-eat, and over-eat. That's because you've got denatured foods that have no nutrients in it, so everybody's starving. And the food industry loves that because you keep eating. They love that, people. Because they just keep eating, and eating, and eating, and eating. Well, the body can do the same thing if it's binding with the poisons and passing it through. It compounds it. You're not getting any nutrients from it. So I found that if you eat the cheese, wait ten minutes, the body stops dumping the poisons, the cheese absorbs all of that in that ten minutes. Then you start eating your meal. You have twenty-five minutes to get your meal in before the body will start dumping poisons again. So that's the cycle.

Q: Did you say cheese and coconut cream?

A: Coconut cream helps you clean a little bit quicker and helps make sure that you neutralize a little bit better. But you don't have to have it then. The cheese is the most important. You just absorb it.

Q: How much?

A: About a sugar cube-sized amount, which is a half a teaspoon, just a small amount of cheese, about the size of a marble, a small marble. If it's before a meat meal, I suggest two sugar cube-sized amounts. Because I found that when somebody's eating meat, some of that stuff lightly still dumps from the stomach, some of the poisons. So you should have two before that, two before the meat meal, and eat a little bit of cheese with the meat meal. And the meat meal is next. You have the juice, you have the cheese, ten minutes later you have the juice, then 45 minutes, 50 minutes later, cheese again, 10 minutes later your meat meal. 

Q: Can you say that once more?

A: Cheese, 10 minutes juice, 40 to 50 minutes later, cheese again, 10 minutes later meat. Now all that pattern is in the recipe book, page 40 to 41, without the cheese. It doesn't have the cheese in there. So you just add the cheese 10 minutes before everything. Now I'm going to explain to you in detail why I devised that pattern. I've given that information in the book, but just so slightly most people don't comprehend it. I'm telling you in more detail why you should eat certain foods at certain times. Now this meat meal will be your most important meal of the day. It doesn't contain carbohydrate. You don't want high carbohydrate, it's low carbohydrate. You don't want to make the brain and nervous system sticky. You want to stay focused. When you're up for 6 to 7 hours of the day, if you're on this kind of a diet, the body will make all of its glycogen for the day. Storable glycogen. So all of the fuel for the brain and nervous system is made in the first 6 to 7 hours of your day. So whatever you eat in that 6 to 7 hours is what the body will make or with what the body will make glycogen. So if it's high carbohydrate, you're going to have sticky nervous system, sticky blood, sticky lymph. And it interferes with functionality, clarity, physical expression, movement, everything. It will interfere with everything. So like I was telling some people, a 14 1⁄2-year-old girl who was a B student, mid B, not B minus, B plus, mid B. She wanted to be a dancer, a ballet dancer. She was just an average dancer. Nobody would ever excel. Her mother forced her onto the diet because she and the girl's father got divorced. The mother wasn't well. She went on the diet. It was not going to fix the separate diet for the daughter. Daughter had to go on it. Daughter was furious. Mad, angry with me because I created the diet. It was just a mess. In that year that she was on it, she went from a B student to an A plus student. I think for a top two of the class, at least top five. I think she was second in the class. And she went to one of the top dancers. And she got a scholarship for Juilliard in the first of her senior year in high school. From that one year on the diet, one year, the functionality of the body and the mind, it makes it work very well. And her mother forced her to do this pattern, prepared the foods for her, and did it. Mother got through the divorce with flying colors. She didn't have all the anger and anxiety that most women and men go through daily for a year, two years, or three years. And the mother was able to get through it and get on with her life.

And so it was great. So the girl came on her own the next year. She was one of the first ones to show. She was on one of the first appointments. So it shows you what can happen. The first meat meal is very important for anything you eat within that first six, seven hours. If you're on a bad diet, eating sugar, that's sure that's going to get into your bloodstream. It's going to get everywhere. It's going to be part of, you know, your blood sugar, your nervous, brain and nervous system fuel. But when you're on this kind of a diet, these are the patterns. Even if you're mixing, let's say you're mixing 25% of the other foods, if you eat this way the first part of the morning, it will be that way the rest of the day, unless you down a lot of sugar, candy or something like that, you know, then you might have a problem. And you probably will, at least, with the mind staying focused. So eat that meat meal. And it tells you the quantities in the recipe book, you know, for your size and shape and all of that. And this book tells you, you know, how you tell whether you should eat red meat or white meat. And basically it's this way. If you're a hyperactive person, you want less red meat meat because it will make you more hyperactive. If you're a low energy person, you want more red meat. So you can work it out pretty well that way. If you come to me, I'll look in the irises. I'll tell you, you know, what I think that you should follow, you know, what ratio. Even if you come for even a palm reading, a mini reading, I tell. But then you go, you know, always eat fat. Always eat the fat with your meat. And I suggest to everybody, always eat a tablespoon and a half of butter with each meat meal. You can put any other fat you want with it. But a tablespoon and a half of butter is very important. Now there's not, you haven't put fat into your body except for the little fat that's in the meat. So you have gone all night, except for maybe you're waking in the night so you have a little something, to have fat in it. So the body is protein and fat deficient. You need energy and charge. So the body's going to look for fat first. It's going to find it in the meat. It's going to start utilizing the meat as fuel. What a waste. You just need some fat. So you butter the meat. Make a sauce with butter, with eggs, and any other thing you want with fat in it. And you have it with the meat. So I've got 82 sauces in the recipe book. 82 sauces for meat. That means any kind of flesh food. When I talk about meat, I'm not talking about beef. I'm talking about any flesh food. That is meat. So 82 sauces that can be made in three to five different ways each. That's 400 sauces. Everybody can find many, many sauces to please them. You saw, you tasted a couple today. You know, there was only three mixtures in there. You had the horseradish mustard sauce, and then the other mixture of the pre-prepared sushis. You know, one was chicken sushi, I mean, ceviche, and the other was fish ceviche.

You know, so you got a good taste. Those tasted very good, didn't they? Great, okay. If you get in this recipe book and you make a batch of it and put it in the refrigerator, you know, every day of each meal you can have different sauces. I mean, I've got Roquefort sauces, any kind of sauce you can imagine. It's much tastier. I made a bet with a famous chef in a famous restaurant in Santa Monica that I could make a sauce that would be better than any one that he made, that I could take his sauce and make it better. And he would get more compliments on his food than he ever had. So I took his recipes, made the sauces for him that evening, and he got more compliments than he'd ever gotten. And people were raving, they called him to the table. And this is because I used raw ingredients. Nothing was cooked or fried or stirred in the sauce. And that's all I told him to change. And I won the bet. I got to eat there, and he had to make the food I wanted to eat for lunch. So that was really nice. I got served, pre-prepared, my dishes. And he did it great. So he did so well that he moved to Paris because he opened a restaurant that asked him to do [unintelligible]. My patients have led me to that, owned the restaurant and hired him. So my patient was very upset with me to do that. But anyway, it all worked out. Anyway, sauces, you can make the meat taste wonderful. One about, you know, I always say moisturizing and lubrication formula is good. So that can be your sauce for your meat. But if you're having a sauce, you know, no more than maybe three ounces of it, four ounces of it, and then have your moisturizing or lubrication formula 10 to 15 minutes after you finish your meat meals, and you have a certain portion of that moisturizing formula, unless you want to be a bodybuilder or a weightlifter, then you have a whole one. You can put it into halves and add half with each meat meal. If you're diabetic or have a sugar problem, blood sugar problem, you have three meat meals a day. If you're eating a pound of meat a day, you have half pounds if you're having two meat meals. If you're having three meat meals a day, you take that same pound and break it into three portions. So it's a third of a pound three times a day instead of two times a day. So that's all you adjust. If you wanted to, you could break the moisturizing formula so you get moisturizing all over the body many hours of the day by having a third with your first meat meal, a third with your second meat meal, or if you're diabetic and having three meat meals a day or hypoglycemic or kidney problems, instead of having three meat meals a day, you have the first and the third and then during the night when you get up and have some food.

Then you have the other third during the night with, let's say, some milk or an egg or whatever you're going to have during the night with it. So then 30 to 35 minutes after your meat meal, if you want to stabilize your bones and your minerals in your body, if you have a mineral imbalance or problem, and people look at their nails and see whether they have a problem or if they have an emotional problem, you always need more minerals. If you're going through an injury, a scrape of some kind, you're always going to need extra minerals. So you have one and a half to two tablespoons of cheese with two and a half to three teaspoons of honey. So the ratio is one to three almost. Cheese to honey. 

Q: More honey?

A: More cheese.

Q: More cheese.

A: Tablespoons of cheese, teaspoons of honey. And get processes in your mouth together as well. Two to three hours later, you have a milkshake. This helps calm and relax the body. No fruit, so there's no smoothie here unless you've got a situation where I suggest that you put some fruit in it. Or you sense psychically or intuitively or instinctively that you need a little bit of fruit in there. But I'll never tell anybody to put, let's say, five berries in it or an inch and a half of banana or something like that to do a certain thing. So in that milkshake, there are milkshake recipes in the recipe book. And that's just egg, milk, cream, and honey. Sometimes butter. I suggest that somebody have butter or a tablespoon of coconut cream in it, depending upon their condition. Then two to three hours later, another vegetable juice. You're getting acidic again. Your blood is getting acidic. It's always cleaning itself because you've been on a toxic diet your whole life. It's going to be cleaning that. So you need to alkanilize it. So another vegetable juice. And also, you know, ten minutes before the milkshake, you're going to have the cheese if you have nausea. Or if I say you've got lots of poisons in your stomach and they're dumping into your food, and then you're reprocessing that chemical or damaging your intestines as your body is digesting that food. So you eat cheese in that circumstance. I would say that 95% of everybody I see has those poisons in the stomach, and everybody should be eating cheese before everything for a couple of years while on their own diet. So it would probably be a good idea. Then, so you have the cheese before the juice, then one to two hours. After that, your fruit meal, your one fruit meal a day, always with fat. If you want the best fat, the most healing fat, the most stabilizing fat, that's more of a balance, it's coconut cream. Because coconut cream is so cleansing of various tissues and heavy metals, I always suggest that you eat some animal fat with it, like maybe a half a tablespoon of butter and a whole tablespoon of dairy cream. Maybe having two to four ounces of coconut cream with that meal. Then a little honey if you like. So you can choose the fruits from the symptoms that you have, the fruits that I suggest from We Want to Live. And there are a lot of different ones for different things. I just came up with that formula for the formaldehyde a few months ago, and it's working wonderfully. I know the chemical structure of the kiwi and the mango, and I realized that there was a similarity to formaldehyde in the structure.

So combining them, it was too toxic without putting the cream with it, and it was causing a lot of nausea and vomiting and diarrhea as the formaldehyde was coming out. So you have to put the coconut cream with it, and put a little dairy cream and butter with it, and then the honey, and then there was no vomiting. It captured and arrested and held it. Even the water was important. The mineral water was important for controlling the formaldehyde and neutralizing it. It actually was bleaching it. For some reason, the carbon dioxide was bleaching it and helped neutralize it. Jeff? So... You pick the fruit that will help relieve the symptoms that you have or you know what's in the body that you want to get rid of. Then the next meal, and you can alternate. I have some people alternate three different fruits a week, giving them different fruits throughout the week. Two days, not in a row, one fruit and then another. Alternate like that. If you have a clogged lymphatic system, remember I said the lymphatic system normally feeds every cell in the body. If it can't, the bloodstream is doing what it shouldn't and the lymphatic system is not releasing its poisons. It's probably hardened with vegetable oils. Sometimes you have to get into a hot bath, 102 to 105 degrees, and it tells you how to do that in this book. It tells you to eat pineapple with coconut cream, a little butter, a little dairy cream, and a little honey if you want. It tells you to drink that right when you get in the bathtub or as soon as, right before you get in or as soon as you get in the tub, so that the hour to hour and a half that you're sitting in to have that heat to melt that stuff, because it takes that long. It's almost 50 minutes to get deep enough to where it's affecting, to get your body heated enough, deeply enough, until the lymphatic system starts melting the outer layers of that congested, hardened lymphatic fat that is in there that's no longer fluid. So it starts melting after about 50 minutes, so you're in there an hour and 50 minutes, at least an hour, and then an hour and a half, and you may have to work up to it. By the time you get out, you get out slowly. They take you 10 minutes to dry off, because you're going to be faint. It's hot. You might want to have some warm food, warm milk or something, just to give you some more energy. And then you put on hot clothes like it's snowing outside. I don't care if it's 1,000 degrees. You go outside and you take a 45-minute walk if you can. That will help move that pineapple mixture through the pineapple-coconut cream mixture into the dissolved lymphatic fluid. You're keeping it from hardening again when your body gets down to 98.

So every day that you do that, and you only want to do it two days a week, no closer than three days apart, because if you release that much toxic fluid, it has to get out through your mucous membranes throughout the skin or the vaginal cavity. And, you know, the mucous membranes up here could cause vomiting, diarrhea, could make you very uncomfortable. So you want to give yourself three days to make sure that all that melted stuff is out and handled so it may cause more nausea, eat the cheese. So then that you would always do in the afternoon. It's always best to do it between 1.30 and 4 o'clock, or 4.30. So you don't, if you do it in the morning, it can interrupt your whole thought process during the day. If you do it at night, it can keep you awake all night and screw up your sleep. So it's always best to do it in the afternoon. If you can only, if you can't take one day off in the midweek, you know, in the afternoon off, it takes a three-hour cycle to do that. You know, if you get home, prepare everything, get in, make the bath to get in there, you wouldn't put it in the bath water too if you're running municipal water. You don't want to get into municipal water because you have a massive amount of chemicals in it. In L.A. there are 193 chemicals. They worry about the bacteria. Who gives a shit about the bacteria? 193 chemicals. That's because the city of Los Angeles, the municipal city of Los Angeles, not which part of Los Angeles County, but the city of Los Angeles, the water is used twice. By heavy industry in the valley, which is heavy industrial area, and it's used in Saugus, then in the valley, and then it comes to L.A. 193 chemicals by the time it gets to the city of L.A. And they don't worry about that. They worry about bacteria that comes from all the fecal matter and urine that happen to be flushed into the water. Not the chemicals. They don't care about removing the chemicals from industry. So what I do, before I had a well, and I'm living in the mountains of Malibu, when I was living in Los Angeles, I'd put at least one cup of raw milk in the water, three tablespoons of vinegar, two tablespoons of coconut cream, and two tablespoons of sea salt, just to neutralize all the poisons in the water so that you can have a comfortable bath. And let me tell you, even showering in that water, it will affect you. So I don't recommend that people shower unless they have a three-tiered filter system in their garage. If you're in an apartment, don't take a shower, take a bath. 

Q: Can you repeat that formula for the bath?

A: Yes. One cup of milk, two tablespoons of coconut cream, three tablespoons of vinegar, two tablespoons of sea salt, four ingredients. I couldn't get all those other things, and I couldn't afford to use the milk in Thailand because I get so little of it. I used just coconut cream because that was $2 a liter. I would use three, four cups a day, and I would just be so moist, you know, slimy with that coconut cream. And then the two girls, the two women who were helping me, they would get into the tub after I got into it to get all the coconut cream. And then they would get out and towel off, and then they would do it once a day after I put it fresh in my bath. And when I got out, they would both get in. You know, they'd take turns, they didn't get in together, but they'd get in one at a time. Coconut cream is amazing stuff. So after you have your fruit meal, you wait two to three hours, have another vegetable juice, unless you're diabetic and have a sugar problem. If you have a vegetable juice at that time, make it a small amount unless you're very thirsty. If you find that you go five, four, three, four hours and not hungry, and you try to eat something and you're not digesting, you cut that juice down or eliminate it completely for a week and then try it again. 

Q: How much juice?

A: The third juice, which is somewhere between five and seven o'clock, depending upon your day, how tight you are on the schedule. And then maybe an hour and a half, two hours maximum after that, remember you're doing cheese before the fruit meal, cheese before the juice, cheese before the meat meal again, so ten minutes prior. And then have your second and last meat meal. If you're diabetic or have a sugar problem, you stick that second meat meal before the fruit meal. You can even skip the second vegetable juice. Unless you get very acidic with that second meat meal while you're eating it, you still have the vegetable juice. Then you can skip the third vegetable juice, and you should skip the third vegetable juice. Just have a small amount of the second. Then the meat meal, the second meat meal, the same way as the first. You have the cheese before, the cheese with, the lubrication formula after, or with the meat meal. You're grabbing the sauce with the meat meal. Thirty to thirty-five minutes after the meat meal, you have the cheese again. So you're just repeating the same thing you did earlier. Then two to three hours later, if that didn't take you to bedtime, and then two, an hour and a half, two hours later, three, whatever it is, you can have another milkshake or a glass of, one glass of milk with some honey in it. You go to sleep and then have some by your bedside, something by your bedside. Wake, drink it, eat it, go to sleep, go back to sleep. The way you warm milk is just take one of those canning jars like this, put your milk in it, you know, or another size of canning jar, let's say you want a lot of milk or you have a milkshake. Put it in there, immerse it in a bowl of hot water that's not hot enough to burn the hand and let it get warm in there for 10-15 minutes. Then you'll be having something that will make you very relaxed like a baby. You're going to sleep very, very well. Of course, when you awaken, you're not going to have anything warm, but that's okay, you're already mainly in a sleep state. So you're going to have to get up to the toilet, you have to set the alarm, you drink it, go right back to sleep. If you're up, you can drink it before you go to the toilet or after you go to the toilet, it's up to you. Probably drinking it before you go to the toilet is better because then it will reach your stomach. If you drink it and lie right back down, sometimes you may, you know, stick up there a little bit and be a little uncomfortable. It will keep you from going into a sound sleep for a few minutes before it finally works its way down. If you're like me with no vagus nerves, there's no reaction to movement down there. So when I drink during the night, I have to sit up for about three minutes, then I go on down, so it can get down to the stomach. That's it, folks. We're way beyond time, but that's okay. You learned a lot. Were there any questions that I didn't answer? Usually I've answered everything by now. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]. If you don't mind, probably lack of knowledge, but I understand, like, the cells and the membrane around them and the extension of this stuff, the extension of fatty acids, Omega-3s.

A: Just remember, the people who are saying that are selling Omega-3. If you're eating raw foods, you don't need many Omega-3s. Only when you've got a lot of poisons in the body do you need an extravagant amount of Omega-3. So, again, you're looking at it from the wrong viewpoint. You don't have to worry about Omega-3s. Look at all those tribes, unless they're eating a lot of fish, they don't get a lot of Omega-3. And they're fine and healthy and not diseased.

Q: The follow-up question was, should I eat, my meat meal, for example, more fish than meat?

A: Yes. It depends on if you're having a heavy metal problem or some kind of disease. You might, you know, have more. It all depends. You know, I would focus more on thinking that way. But I'd really forget any kind of measurement that you're given. I don't know where the lights are. Here. This one. It didn't go on. You've got the magic [unintelligible]. The switch works for him. So, yeah, don't worry about those measurements. If you continue eating a lot of cooked foods, it may be a way to get rid of some of those chemicals. But if you're eating coconut cream, you don't have to worry about the omega-3. Coconut cream is a miracle stuff.

Q: Do I have to make it?

A: You have to make it. Well, I bought three sets of machineries for making it. The juicer I bought in Thailand is about this long, stainless steel, about this high, and it produces five gallons an hour. And there's a set in Los Angeles, Aspen, Colorado, and Chicago. He has it sent from Los Angeles right now, but I suggest you get it from... I've got two other places. I like the way they make it a little bit better, which are the Aspen branch of this... The people on this diet, they formed a co-op. The people in Aspen and the people in Chicago, so there'd be a better source of it. Aspen and Chicago, yeah. Chicago, probably closer, and they are a little bit more particular. They've been doing a little bit more experimenting on preserving it with just a tiny amount of lime. Oh, the amount of lime juice that I suggested to preserve it got mistyped. So it should only be a quarter of a teaspoon per seven ounces of coconut cream. Not three tablespoons. A third of a teaspoon. So, big typo there. But what I did before I got these machines and it was being produced for me, I put a three-by-five card at a high school gymnasium and said, need somebody who likes to break things, $8 an hour. I got 50 calls. I hired an African-American end on the football team. Good with his hands. He'd break the coconuts and do all that. Because what you have to do is you have to take a coconut, you have to punch a hole or drill a hole in there, drain the water out, break the shell off of it, pry the meat out of the shell with an oyster knife. It tells you how to do it in both books. And then you have to take the meat and it's best, like I say in this book, to grind it in a food processor and then put it into a jar. This was left out. That sentence got left out. I don't know how. Got edited out. But you put it into like a gallon jar. You may do 10 to 15 coconuts at once. That's what I had in mind. So we had 2 gallons of grated coconut. So put a little bit of coconut water in there to make sure that everything was moist and we immersed it in a sink of hot water. Let it sit there for about 20 minutes so it got warm. And the house has to be about 80 degrees for those hours that you're juicing. Otherwise, if it's even 75 degrees, the pulp will not let go of the coconut cream. It will hold it. So you're only going to get a few ounces per coconut, one ounce per coconut. But if it's warm, both the meat's warm and the room is warm, and the juicer's getting warm as it's working, and you put the pulp through several times, you're going to get anywhere from one to one-and-a-half cups per coconut. And that's pretty good. So I had a guy come in and do it once every five to six weeks.

He made $65 once every five to six weeks, had a great weekend with his girlfriend, and he only had a job that he had to come to once every five to six weeks for that extra money. It worked very well for him and for me. But now I get it for free, because I sold the machines at cost to this guy in Los Angeles who runs our co-op, and I get two pints a week free for the rest of my life. As long as I'm not in town very much to get it, but when I'm there I get it free. It's not really free, but I have it easily. So that's the way to get it if you don't have the time or the energy, because it is an exhausting experience prying that meat out, cutting up, putting it in, and grating it. It's a time-consuming process. It's better to pay somebody eight, nine bucks an hour to do it. There are lots of kids that would like that. One job that pops up every five to six weeks, they make sixty, sixty-five bucks, seventy bucks that time. They have a good time with that money. 

Q: [unintelligible] 

A: No, because really, they're not in the business of shipping it. However, if I ask them to, if I said that I told you to call, they will ship. The Los Angeles are not very reliable except to Jeff, because he orders enough of it. What I suggest, if somebody wants to get in the business here, all three machines, the machine that has a machine to remove the shell, three to fifteen seconds. Can you imagine removing a shell of a coconut in three to fifteen seconds? You have a whole coconut with water in it. Go over and put a slice through it, you put the water in a bucket, you can sell it, also tell if the coconut is good before you go juicing it. Because you can taste it, you can smell the coconut. And then you've got a machine which grates it. You can grate a whole half of a coconut in two seconds. So it grates it, puts it in a big tub, a ten gallon tub, and then you put it into the juicer. And this big stainless steel juicer, $10,000, delivered to Long Beach in California for $10,000. I went to Hobart to see how much they would make the machinery for me. Just for the juicer, he wanted $55,000. I mean, it's so cheap. So if somebody wanted to have a business, and it's growing here in St. Louis. I mean, these people, I got the machinery and they're already almost in the black in a year. They're selling a pint for $10 to $14. Of course, they had to set it up in their garage or basement. It had to be a warm place, so there was some arrangement to do it. They had to pay for the shipping from there to here, which may have been about $600, $700 from Long Beach to here. So if somebody wanted to get into a little side business where they're producing it once a week and making some good money, you could do that if you wanted. 

Q: How do you get the machines?

A: Just speak to me, I import them. At first I was giving them to at my cost, but now I charge $1,000 a time. I get through with, let's say there's a problem. The second time they sent them, the crate broke and they damaged some of it, so it cost me almost $3,000 to get that straightened out. So now I charge $1,000, so I'm only charging $1,000 for my labor to get it coordinated in here. $10,000 is incredible for that machinery. Here alone, the metal would cost you $10,000. Stainless steel.

Q: What do you wash your body with when you take a bath?

A: Coconut cream. Fermented coconut cream. Stuff that nobody wants to eat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You know, I can't answer personal questions. This will just have to be general questions. Otherwise, we'll go to tomorrow with this. Anybody have any general questions about diet? Nope?

Q: One more question, if you don't mind. Okay, I'm trying to summarize the advantages. You talk about some tribes that eat cooked food. They're doing good. Or not too bad, anyway.

A: Not too bad. The diseases that they have are gout, arthritis, rheumatism, and fungus, when they eat cooked meats. So, if you want those, you don't want to have, let's say, pancreatitis, you don't have diabetes, you don't have cancer, any of that, and you don't mind having gout, and arthritis and rheumatism, go ahead. That's all I've got to say.

Q: So the protein changes when you cook it, right?

A: Absolutely.

Q: The molecules will get bigger.

A: Yeah, and they also turn into a very acrid substance that's difficult to utilize as food. It's like people keep on a lot of fat and have a hard time getting rid of it. In some bodies, they can't remove it. It just stays, and they don't have to eat much, and it just kept getting bigger and bigger. You just have to look at the chemical changes per body. When you cook meat, you form heterocyclic amines. You've got a variety of those, and those cause a lot of problems in the joints. That's why it causes gout, arthritis, and rheumatism. It causes problems in the joints, heterocyclic amines. In the fats, it causes lipid peroxides, and that irritates the venous system, the arteries, the capillaries. It causes varicose veins, spider veins, thrombosis. All these different diseases are all from processing and cooking food. Animals that eat totally raw, their particular systems of raw, have no diseases, not even dental caries. The first case of dental caries among the Eskimos was 1986, and that was in a fellow who lived with the British and the Germans in the colonies there in Anchorage. They'd been eating their cakes and their sugars, and they loved the sugars, they'd pile it on. It took them 50 years to get a decayed tooth. The first case of cancer was in 1936 among the Eskimos, and it was those Eskimos that had been living in the colonies, the British and German, the American colonies, for 100 years. It took them 100 years to develop cancer. 

Q: I read some place that they have osteoporosis because so much meat they eat.

A: It's absolutely a lie. You can look at all the work by Vilhjalmur Stefansson, who's an anthropologist who worked for the federal government all through the early, like 1906 through 1928, and even up until 1936 I think, he wrote about and studied the Eskimos, found out they had no disease, no cancer. He wrote a book, Cancer, Disease of Civilization? Because they couldn't find any cancer among the Eskimos. There was no arteriosclerosis. There was no anything. There was no disease. So that's an absolute lie. But the tribes who do eat cooked meat do have a little bit of a problem with bone deterioration. But that goes along with the starts of the joints. Arthritis, rheumatism, gout, things like that. And then it goes further as the older you get, it'll get into deteriorate your bones. But not raw. It never happens. They even eat bones. They sit around eating bones. Bird bones or small bones, seal bones. They'll sit and chew on them. Can you imagine being able to chew bones? Can you imagine being able to eat hard bones? Biting down on a bone without breaking your teeth? Unheard of here. It's like their babies on, you know, bare naked on ice. That's incredible health. Phenomenal health. But they wanted to confuse people. Oh, the Eskimos don't live long. That was a tale. And even Vladimir Stephenson in his book proves it. And he went all over Alaska asking, you know, the authorities in the area what is the rate of this and that. They live just as long as we do. And they, you know, up to 105, 110 years old. But healthier. They don't have hospital beds. No such thing. Hospital beds. That's pretty incredible, isn't it? No doctors. They don't need doctors. They get it cut, they slap meat on it, wrap it, that's it. It heals. Takes care of it. Pretty incredible. So you've been given the knowledge to take care of yourself and to make sure that you don't deteriorate and get diseased. Isn't that a wonderful gift? And I'm glad to give it to you. So enjoy, get healthier every day of your life because I get healthier every day. Even during this I thought, oh shit, I'm going to lose something out of this one probably. Because I saw that x-ray. I even got a little concerned. But here I am, 90 weeks later, I can walk on in no pain and I can, you know, when I touch this area I feel a little pain where the tendon was ripped. You know, it's better than any swelling and it's making, it's own cast and this is disappearing. You know, I know I'm going to be fine. In another probably two months I'm going to be running again. Can you imagine that at 60 years old? Just looking like this at 60 years old with no exercise. I mean, that's pretty stuff. Look at my brothers. It's hereditary. My father, my mother is, you know.

Q: They're not picking on you probably.

A: Oh, not anymore. They keep their, they've not heard a thing from them in 10 years about it. Not a thing from them in 10 years. Before that, it used to be every time I saw them. You're still eating that? You know you're going to get really sick. I know my own family, not sick. Not deteriorating, not aging the way they are. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: My mother does some of the raw cheese, some of the raw butter. She does some raw eggs with some orange juice once in a while. My father's 93, my mother's 90. They don't really do it much anymore. In their 60s, my mother started having a lot of problems. A lot of problems. I convinced her to do 50%. She was doing olive oil, creams, milk. She wouldn't do the meats at all, not even raw fish. She's a nurse. She didn't want to get a brain parasite. It was my experience I couldn't even convince her otherwise. Totally brainwashed. She did it for about 10 years. 50% for about 10-12 years. Then she said, I'm healthy enough. I don't need this stuff anymore. Went back to crappy diet. She almost died last year. She was just wasting away until she died. I got her [unintelligible] just like with my son. I started feeding her custard because she wouldn't eat. I gave her custard with the papaya in it. She was eating. She ate four meals that day. The next day she wouldn't eat the custard. The butter was too heavy for her. I just gave her a half a cup of papaya. She ate four meals that day. Cooked. I don't care. It allowed her to eat. She just wouldn't eat. I spent a week there getting her eating. I go away and nobody feeds her the papaya. I said, you have to feed her the papaya. So I'd get on the phone and just [unintelligible]. I said, you see, feed her the papaya. She eats all day long. You don't feed her the papaya, she'll eat one. She was just skin hanging on bone. We all thought, I mean, all the relatives flew in from everywhere to say goodbye. Then she started eating that papaya to change. What one food could do.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No salt.

Q: What happens if it gets salty?

A: A lot of that salt will be released and cause clumping. I should have said that. I need to talk about salt and water. When you eat salt, it causes the molecular structure of sodium to bind together. Lots of molecules of sodium to bind together. Sodium molecule is one of the largest minerals we have. Large, big. And it carries a lot of things with it. It usually carries H2O. But when salt is in something and sodium is in something, in food, it's in a proper combination. All of your food is a smorgasbord of nutrients. So when your body opens to eat, it's got one or two ions inside of it. It'll attract these ions that are passing with the smorgasbord of nutrients. You have protein, fats, carbohydrates, little carbohydrates. You have vitamins, enzymes, and minerals. All these micronutrients attached to these minerals. And the body opens and attracts it in and eats a whole smorgasbord. So it's eating like a hundred course meal from one eating. When you have an isolated substance like salt, it causes clumping of the sodium molecules. You're eating cooked foods already, everything's fractioned. Everything's binding improperly, coupling improperly. There's not a balanced smorgasbord. And when the salt clumps like that, it gets so electromagnetically strong that when a cell opens to eat and there's this clumping nearby, that will be drawn to the cell instead of that other one that the cell wanted. And it's magnetic. It's so large that it can't get in the cell, and it pulls the guts, which are the two ions, one to two ions, out of the cell. The cell can never again eat. It shrivels like a grape to a raisin. It dies. So one grain of salt will kill about one million red blood cells. So salt's not good.

Q: Not any kind of salt.

A: Not any kind of salt. People say, oh, this came from the great dead sea. Yeah, dead all right. You know? Yeah, it takes a complex organism to live in salt water. You can't put a fish, a freshwater fish, in salt water and expect it to live. It won't. We are not a salt water creature. Salt water is contaminating for us. If we eat salt water, what happens? The sea men, who would take just even a tablespoon of ocean water, just to keep from dehydrating, would turn insane in 8 to 12 days. Just that little bit would make them insane and irrational. So, salt is not a good thing. Water isn't either. Water is a solvent. If you look in an archeological book, the first thing listed under solvent, the earths solvents, is water. What happens, it rains, it dissolves the earth, it dissolves rock, plants eat. They make leaves, make branches, roots, animals come along, eat that, and then we eat the animals that eat that. That's the food chain, and that's the proper process, that's the proper schematic. If you drink water, unless you are one of those three animals that drink water, and that's all birds, elephants, and camels, they all need water, because they're the only animals that need water. If you have milking cows, they do need some water, because they're going through so much fluid, and you're pumping it out of them, and forcing them, so they do need some water, but not salt. I've got a farmer that just said, okay, I'll try to give my cows no salt, they produce a better milk, a much richer, better milk, they took the salt block away, cut down on the water, the milk is richer, it's healthier, it's stronger, I even got more energy from it. Because that's what I said, they gave me the milk, this was in Iowa last week, in Omaha, and I drank that milk, and I said, wow, I didn't even get a taste for meat today, and I just drank your milk all day, what are you doing differently? He said, we took the salt block away, and we reduced the amount of water that they consume. Proof, right there, salt and water is not good for animals, most animals. The elephant can hold 50 gallons, 55 gallons of water, and it won't drink water for a month. A camel will go the same, 24 days, it'll drink 20 gallons of water, and it goes without water for up to 28 days, but usually 24 days, it's filling up again. But it's made that way, it isolates the water and barely drips it like an IV into the system. We just guzzle the water, and that causes it to leach and damage our digestive tract, thin the mucus, cause all kinds of problems, dilute the digestive juice, all kinds of problems. So water is not good. Most people need some water because they have so many poisons in the body, they need that solvent to help them dissolve some things. But mostly, in the summer, no more than a cup and a half.

If you haven't been on the diet long, if you've been on the diet 4 or 5 years, you should only be having half a cup. In the winter, no water. I've had 2 ounces of water in a month. Not a problem. Even Vilhjalmur Stefansson, when he said, you know, all the research about, you know, we need salt, we need all this and all that, and he showed that we could live on meat alone and we didn't need any salt. And everybody was vitally healthy because he lived with Eskimos who lived that way. Salt was a poison in the Eskimos. Can you imagine? It holds water. Can you imagine being an Eskimo and thinning your blood and getting cold? Water is a poison. Water leeches and water freezes at very low temperatures. Okay, that's it folks.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Heated up to 137 degrees. It shouldn't be heated up to 103. The only raw cheese that is really raw is organic pastures cheese. They have a salt in them, so that's the only one you get. Unless you order it from, he can order it for you. He's the order boy in this town. And he gets big blocks of cheese from my Amish farmers that supply most of the product for my patients all over. They send it even to Aruba and some of them on the other island. And you can order it directly too if you want. It's up to you. There's an order form for the product list in the back. And if you go to Miller Organic Farms, he's made a deal with around 13 other Amish farmers and they each make several different cheeses. So you have like 14 flavors of cheeses. You've got dill, you've got caraway, garlic, jalapeno pepper. Too hot for me, so I have to mix it with other things like a [unintelligible]. But other people isn't too hot for them. And there's all kinds of other cheeses. Baby Swiss. It's quite a few cheeses. So that's a variety. So all of you can pool together and mix and match if you want to.

Q: You said Miller Organics?

A: Miller Organics, yeah, on the product list. You're welcome. Okay, who wants a mini-reading? So we have two. Okay, you and your baby. So your baby's been waiting two hours. Sorry, but sometimes I feel that a certain group needs more information. And we did get a late start.
