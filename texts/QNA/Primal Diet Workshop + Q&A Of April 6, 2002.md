Q: He flew up here from Southern California this morning, and he's here to talk to us today about his experience, what he wants to share, and then we'll adjourn and come back to the workshop for the afternoon. So please help me welcome Aajonus Vonderplanitz.

A: Thank you. Hello everyone. Who has read the book? Okay, so we have, who has not read the book? Three people, all right. Are you local?

Q: Yeah.

A: So you saw the flyer, is that how you came to it? Oh, a friend, lassoed you and brought you here, you're in for some trouble, buddy. To introduce, some of you know, since you've read the book, my experience, I was a very sickly child. Probably the greatest assault other than the abuse was when I was about six months old I got my first tetanus shot, and by the time I was a year and a half I got my third tetanus shot, and that put me into autism. So I could not comprehend language at all. I was a parrot, I would listen to sounds as closely as possible and mimic them to be able to communicate with people, but I had no comprehension of what a word meant. When I was twenty-two years old I still could not read the word the, and by the time I was fifteen and a half I developed diabetes. When I was ten I had what was diagnosed as an appendicitis, when it was actually peritonitis, perforated intestine. They went and took out my appendix anyway, just in case it caused me trouble in the future. That's the way they think, oh it doesn't belong in the body, it shouldn't be there. And, hi, come on in and take a seat. I was, I would keep colds anywhere from three to five months at a time. I could fill five handkerchiefs a day, which would probably be a good hand towel. Now when I get a flu or a cold, I can fill a whole bath towel, and you'll understand why that's a good thing later on if you stay for the workshop. By the time I reached 19, I had developed an ulcer. The doctors gave me lots of Maalox to drink, so that turned the ulcer tumorous. So they went in and did a vagotomy pyloroplasty, which means they severed all the vagus nerves to my stomach, so I would never again secrete hydrochloric acid, so of course I would never have an ulcer again, right? So after the, and the pyloroplasty means that they took the pylorus and it stretched out three times its size, so food would hold up there instead of the stomach. The incision turned tumorous, so they told me, terrorized me into believing that I had to have the radiation therapy. So I had it, and it cauterized my spine so that I was then crippled. This was my degree of movement of my spine, like I had had a rod put in my spine. And then that turned the blood, they gave me blood and bone cancer, it damaged my bones so badly, the bone marrow, that it gave me blood and bone cancer. So then they gave me chemotherapy. Now imagine, 19 years old, I went in to the doctor because I had gone on a drunken spell. Went down to Tijuana and drank in every bar all the way up and down the coast. And I smoked three packs of Lucky Strikes a day, you know, non-filters. And I was consuming probably a fifth of hard liquor a day. By the time I got home that day, that evening, I was vomiting blood. An ulcer of the stomach. By the time they finished with me, a year and eight months later, I was crippled from the waist down, or actually from the chest down. So I had to crawl around like a worm to go anywhere after the chemotherapy. So that's when I decided that the doctors did not have a clue about what health was. And all they knew was disease, and that the body is a place where you do combat. 

And that made me take a look at an entirely different perspective on health, opened me up to other things, and basically the opening came when a volunteer at a hospice came to my home, and he said that a woman had cured herself of uterine cancer by drinking a gallon of carrot juice a day. Now to me that was absurd. I have three uncles who are doctors, my father is an inventor and scientist, my mother is an RN, and I have eight aunts and uncles who are RNs. So it was pretty absurd. Food had nothing to do with health. You could take a pound of pills and all of your problems were supposed to be relieved, and you could eat tons of food, and it doesn't have anything to do with your health. Pretty absurd, but we were taught to believe that, and I believed that. So when he offered me this carrot juice, I didn't think anything of it, but finally he coaxed me into trying it, and I had decided just to go home and die. I wouldn't even go to the hospice. I just wanted to die in my own home, left alone, didn't want anybody pushing anything on me at all, or making me feel guilty for not taking any more chemo. So the volunteers would come to my home, they would shop, and they'd clean the house and prepare food for me, for a few days at a time. So I drank the carrot juice, and it was delicious, the first thing that tasted good to me since all of the therapy started. So I began drinking it, and all of a sudden, I could read, just like that. It just turned my mind in a different way. I could comprehend language, I was able to look at a book, I was 22 years old, and looking at a book and reading, I mean my vocabulary was shit, but you know, I could read, I could comprehend a little bit. So I was pretty excited. So I borrowed $110 from a friend, and he took me shopping, and bought books on nutrition. And in 1969, that was a lot of books. You know, you'd get a book for like $7 in those days, a good, thick, concentrated book, the smaller ones you'd get for $3. So all I did for weeks and weeks was just read. And then I stopped drinking the carrot juice, thinking, oh, this is just a fluke, my brain just took a shift. So I stopped drinking carrot juice, and within about 10 days, I couldn't comprehend anymore. And to go 22 years never having been able to do it and always being embarrassed, standing up in the class and asking, you know, demanding that I read in front of the class, and I couldn't even get a consonant out from what I saw because my brain just didn't function in that way. So then to have had almost two weeks of being able to read and then losing it again, I was really devastated. So I began drinking carrot juice again, and it returned, and I got carried away and forgot to drink the carrot juice, drank the soda pop, you know, Dr. Pepper, Dr. Pepper was my drink, that's what I liked, Dr. Pepper, and ice cream. Yes, together, floats, I loved them. So then I went back to the carrot juice again, it went away again, the ability, and the third time was all it took. I said, yeah, it's not a coincidence, three times, definitely, it's the carrot juice. So that made me think raw, because that's the only thing different about it, that it was raw. So I began experimenting with raw foods from then on.

By February of 72, I had gone completely raw, it was vegetarian, fruitarian, and it still helped and it was very good for about six and a half years, and then the multiple myeloma, which is cancer of the blood and bones, surged again. And at that time, I had been living outdoors for about two and a half years off of a bicycle, because I had left society, decided that I needed to find out just what did work, because I needed to reverse all the damage done by the medical profession. So I didn't think that I would get it in the society, because everybody was so indoctrinated on attacking the body, whether it was homeopathy, allopathy, naturalists, herbalists, they were always putting something in the body to attack, to shock the system in some way. There was not this nurturing process. And it took me a long while to understand that, because whenever you cook something, you make it a drug of it. You destroy all the vitamin enzymes, and therefore any agent in it is going to be a shock to the system. And all of your herbs contain, as almost all foods do, trace amounts of lead, arsenic, mercury, trace amounts. However, as soon as you cook them, guess what happens? They are ionically unreleased. There are no electrolytes present. So they're all free radicals. Every time you cook anything, you turn any metal in that food into a free radical poison. So you have to take a look at what the result of herbalists, naturalists, do when they use herbs. They poison the body in very slight amounts. What does that do? It stops detoxification. All disease is detoxification. It's the extreme point of the body saying, wait a minute, I have so many poisons here, I have to get rid of them. It takes good fats and good nutrients to do that. So then the expression of that is loss of mucus, tear, draining of ears, diarrhea, vomiting, body odor, any of that is an expression of those poisons to get rid of them. When you eat those herbs, those homeopathy salts, any of that, it poisons the system. So guess what, all of your nutrients stop working on that poisoned area and they work on the poison in the blood. So it seems to work, sure it stops the symptoms, but there is no healing, there is no progress toward actual reversal of the condition. It just puts the symptoms into remission, so that the body can deal with the poisons in the blood from the herbs. And of course if you take herbs and you juice them, it works entirely differently. You're giving agents to the body so that it can properly detoxify and properly heal. So my journey encompassed all of looking at these perspectives, how did they really work, because most people are just, they go to a school, or they pick up a book, and this is what has been taught, and that's what they follow, and this is what they believe. And they don't really look at what's happening. So I had to step back and take a look. Wasn't easy to do, because the conditioning is so strong. When I went and lived outdoors, you know, watched alligators, I watched coyotes, I watched chipmunks, I watched these different animals and their behavior, and different human native groups in Mexico, and Alaska, and Canada, that were much more primitive, and lived much more primitively.

But it seemed that everywhere there was a primitive tribe, except in Alaska, they were put on reservations in areas where they really had lost their entire cultural comprehension. Even the Mayans, when I lived down in Yucatan with them, for months at a time, they were so culturally adulterated that they were bringing in the Spanish culture and the Spanish thinking, which is worldwide the allopathic system. We must attack, attack, attack, attack. Attack the body, you have a war in the body, what happens? It's like a war in anywhere, you're going to devastate everything around. It's like when I was doing laboratory tests to see what the AZT, there's one for you, AZT, that's what they gave me chemo with, in the 60s, late 60s, they realized it did not help, so they put it in the vaults, somebody, they got enough suits, I was one of the people who filed suit against them, because there was no results anywhere that proved that it was helpful, it was only destructive, one cancer cell was destroyed, there were one billion healthy cells destroyed, doesn't make any sense, does it? It's like killing everybody on the planet because you don't like six people, and it's pretty barbaric. So, AZT, guess what? AIDS came around, oh we can pull this out of the vault and use it, so that's what they started doing. That is the mentality out there, and the doctors can't help it, they go to school, they are trained to think this way, and guess who runs the academia? Funding, guess who funds academia? Pharmaceutical houses, that's it. Pharmaceutical houses tell the doctors what drugs will do. They write all of the stuff, the FDA, the USDA, all they do is read those reports from the pharmaceutical houses. The pharmaceutical houses run the medical profession entirely, completely. So when I was living outdoors, I had to take a look at it. I mean, here were coyotes that were living in a dastardly environment of a desert and thriving. How the hell can you do that, you know? So I just watched them eat these animals. I mean, just no matter what it was, they were eating everything. And they were thriving, they were happy. These coyotes would come down every night from the canyon and be laughing. And they sound like a bunch of crazy people in a loony bin. And they're wonderful. And they would come down and wake me up every night and play this little psychic game with me. And they'd usually come down about midnight on their way out to do some hunting. And they'd spend about 20 minutes with me playing this game and then they'd go off again. Now at that time I had decided that two and a half years outdoors, I was pretty ill again. The multiple myeloma resurged. I was down to about 118 pounds. Getting very thin, very weak. So I decided that I was just going to die. I was just going to let myself, I was going to fast to death. And it was an old Indian burial ground out near the Salton Sea. So these coyotes kept coming down every night waking me, playing this game. And then one night, one of them came over and I was sleeping. It was very warm and hot. And it was 1976.

And I was basically naked. Not basically, I was naked. Except for the hair on my body. And all of a sudden I was awakened by this cold thing coming up my knee. And I woke and there was this coyote running his nose up my knee. And then he backed away as soon as I looked at him. And I didn't know if he was getting ready to eat me or what. That would have been okay because it would have been a quick death. And he looked at me right in the eyes and went three times. I'm not stupid. I knew what that meant. That meant follow him. So I followed them and they were very patient waiting for me because I was pretty weak, pretty thin. And then there were eleven of them. Ten of them went off. One stayed pretty much with me. And then all of a sudden I heard their crazy laughter and I could hear them all this area going out like this. And then the one next to me started screaming also and zigzagging in toward where the sound was coming in. I could finally see it was a good full moon. And the coyotes were coming in and moving in, closing in on this half circle and the other one was going like this moving toward the half circle. And there was this huge jackrabbit caught in the middle going like this, didn't know what to do. And that sound hypnotizes and makes them crazy. So finally the jackrabbit just froze where he was and the one that was zigzagging went up and broke its neck. Another one came up and took it by the throat and ripped the skin off and the one that had it in her mouth came over and dropped it on my feet. Bare feet, warm, bloody and this was the Easter bunny. One reason I was a fruitarian vegetarian was I loved animals and it was quite shocking. Then all of a sudden it dawned on me, I didn't put this in the book because a publisher wouldn't publish it. What happened went through my mind when I realized it, my family had told me that a wild rabbit contains some kind of poison in it, enzymes or bacteria or something that will kill a human in 24 to 48 hours very painfully with terrible stomach cramps and diarrhea and I thought, oh, these coyotes are telling me this is what I need. Sure, they are going to help me die quickly. This is it, because I can go 60 days or more fasting to death and it's very painful, headaches, it's crazy because whenever I would fast the chemo would come out, I could even smell the chemotherapy, it would give me headaches, cripple me, make me sore all over in the joints everywhere and I thought, oh, okay. So I picked the rabbit up and I started eating and of course it came right back up. Here it is, squishy, warm, raw. So I decided to sit down and it took about five minutes to psych myself into it. So after five minutes I ate the rabbit and I ate about three and a half pounds. And the more I ate, the better it tasted. I thought, oh sure, I'm going to die well with this. So then the coyotes shared what was left and then I went back to my campsite, lied down. Now I had died, I'd had three near-death experiences. So I knew what it was like leaving the body and how wonderful it felt. So this is the way I felt after eating this rabbit. So I lied down and said, oh I'm going to die, there's no pain involved, I don't know what the hell they're talking about.

And I woke the next morning after the best sleep I'd had in my life, the first night without a nightmare in my entire life that I'd remember. No nightmare. And I looked around, it wasn't heaven, I was still in the same place. It wasn't like in the death experience where everything is calm and peaceful and joyful. I was still in the body, but I felt much better and good. For three days I had more energy than I had had in my entire life. And after three days, and I had no cramps, no ill symptoms, nothing. So I got really excited and said, that's what it is. Raw meat. That's what I'm missing. That is the missing key. And I thought about here, the Eskimos were eating 90% of their diet is raw meat. You know, the ones that live out in the wild. The Mayan tribes were telling me raw meat, that's what we eat when we're ill, raw meat. And I just denied it because after the stomach surgery, if I eat cooked meat, I'd break out with psoriasis. That's another thing that the treatment therapies doctors call therapies. The treatments, if I ate any cooked meat, I would puss out all over. I'd break out with pustulations and ulcerations all over my body from about my thighs, all the way up to my head. And one person described me as looking like raw hamburger, squished together, molded together. And really, that's what I looked like. It was just a mess. It was ugly, horrible. So, of course, I was never going to eat meat again, and it never dawned on me that raw meat would be different. I don't know why. Raw everything else I was into, why not raw meat? So finally, at this point, I got it. And guess what came by me at that moment? A sidewinder rattlesnake. And I had watched the Indians do it. You know, they walk up behind it, step on its head, pick it up by the tail, spin it around, snap its head off. So I did just that, automatically, instinctively. I went for that snake, I picked it up by the tail, whipping it around, and then I got scared. I said, what if its head doesn't come off? I've never done this before. I haven't been trained. I've only seen it done twice. So I'm sitting there having this conversation with myself, whipping this snake around, waiting for it to snap me any minute, and finally I got the courage and just snapped it. Sure enough, the head shot right off. So I peel it. It's very easy just to pull the skin off. It just pulls right off. Very tough though. It's mostly vertebrae, and it tastes like fish, not chicken. When it's raw, it tastes like fish. Raw fish. And I started hunting. I started eating eggs, scorpions, tarantulas, anything. Of course, I'd take off the poison areas and eat them. There just wasn't enough food in the desert for me. So I went bicycle down to the farms and made deals where I would shovel goat manure, milk goats, do anything in exchange for milk, eggs, and chickens, and any other kind of meat. And it was great. Within three months, I had pumped up. I mean, I had gained about fifty pounds. I mean, I was, I had never, I was always the little, you know, my father has a Jewish side and I looked like the Jewish pear with the small shoulders and the, you know, fat down here. And then when I got ill and, you know, with the blood and bone cancer, and I was just skinny all over, except in hips, always maintained the big hips. But I was huge at this point.

And after five months, I had gained about seventy pounds. And I looked like a miniature Schwarzenegger. And it was incredible. And I mean, I was consuming about a quart of raw cream a day. Probably a half dozen raw eggs or more. Not a great deal of meat because I was still a little bit shy of having, you know, a lot. But I was probably having maybe five pounds a week. Maybe a little less, maybe four and a half to five pounds. And I decided this is it. I've got the diet. So I went back to Los Angeles to share it with everybody. And they said, you do what? You eat raw meat? You're going to get a brain fluke and you'll be an idiot. And I said, well, I've been that already. So that's no big loss. But I have to do this because it works. This is the first thing that's really given me a sense of groundedness in my body, a sense of vitality, a sense of joy. Because 365 days a year, 24/7, I was depressed, suicidal, homicidal, angry all the time. I was not a happy person at all. And then all of a sudden I found myself feeling joyful and grounded. I was that way on a raw, fruitarian diet. But with all that fruit, I was manic. And I looked at that mania as having energy. You know? I mean it drove people out of their minds. They could not keep up with me. But for me it was energy and I loved it. However, it was not conducive to good relationships because I was intense. I was a diehard radical evangelistic fruitarian vegetarian raw fooder. And it did not make good for relationships. So here with all this good meat and fat, I was getting a different sense about my life. And it was good. So I had to continue even though I was told that you are going to get flukes someday. You are going to do it. You are going to get it. And guess what? After 13 years I got none. And then it dawned on me, I mean every time I ate raw meat, I thought this is going to be the time. This will be it. So I was in fear every time I did it. It always made me feel good. But my fear was screwing me up. So after 13 years I realized, wait a minute, you are stupid. The fluke that was put in your head was the idea. Because it was not founded. I ate pin worm infested salmon. I ate all kinds of flukes and bacteria and fecal matter on eggs and I didn't clean it off and the fecal matter got in the eggs. So I was eating E. coli and salmonella and all this garbage and I even felt better. And then I remembered when I was in Alaska in 1975 in September. The multiple myeloma was pretty bad and if the temperature went down to about 70 degrees I was in pain like if I had arthritis. By the time it got down to 48-50 degrees I was crippled. I could not move from the pain. I would just lie there, moan and groan. The Eskimos dug, they had a big feast, this was late summer and this was when they did it. They dug up a bunch of these hides that had been wrapped around this green, white and black moldy stuff. I thought it was herbs. All this time I thought it was herbs. And they gave me about a golf ball sized amount and I ate it. For the entire 28 days that I was in Alaska I was never crippled with that cold. Gave me a whole different sense. Now I had cancelled that out up until about probably 15 years later. Then I said, wait a minute, that smell, it was so bad I couldn't get near it. It smelled like some dying carcass.

So I realized that was rotting meat that they put in there. So I went and looked at some literature on the eskimos and sure enough, they take caribou and they beat it into a mince, roll it in whale or seal blubber, wrap it in hides, bury it, they do the same thing with fish and they call it high meat because it makes you high. I mean the kids were running around and they were smelling the shit. I was getting a headache from it. It was so bad and it was causing me to want to vomit. I couldn't get within five feet of it and these children are running around excited. Everybody is really happy and they are enjoying it. You know I just thought this is really bizarre. I said you guys can get used to anything if you are fed that from the time of birth. But they only did it once a year in the summer time getting ready for fall. To actually eat it I had to take cotton balls with musk oil and stuff it up my nostrils to be able to eat it. The texture is fine because it is slightly fermented so it tastes like if you have ever had meat that was braised in brandy, coated with brandy and lighted on fire. It causes the alcohol to go in and soften the meat. So that is what it is like, it is effervescent. So it is very easy and a nice texture. The odor is horrific. But it worked. So I started utilizing that and understanding that wait a minute, we do have it backwards. Bacteria, parasites and all of that must have a place in reality. So then I began doing laboratory experiments with animals, with flukes and bacteria and the results were astounding. So I am going to end the opening section here and if anyone who hasn't signed up for the workshop, if you would like to stay, love to have you so you can hear some more crazy stuff. And some of the experiments that I did to prove that all of that stuff is good for us and not bad for us. Are there any questions before I, let's say, we'll take a few questions before we end this. Anybody have any questions? You look like you have a question in your head there somewhere.

Q: I was wondering what the workshop is going to include.

A: It will include about two hours of information. That information is geared to give you what you need to understand about what to eat that makes a good balanced diet. The food combining. Everything that you'll need to know to leave here so what you can eat to take care of yourself. If you also get a mini reading, what I do is I look at the mounds on the hand and I can read the glandular system in your hand so I can tell you basically some basic things for you to do to help you get started. It's not as intricate and as full bodied as the iridological reading that I do so I know exactly what's going on in the system but the mini reading helps. The workshop is $50 and then the mini reading is $30. But the people who are in the workshop can sit around and listen while everybody else is having a mini reading. So they get all this information in. 25 mini readings. Phew. That's good. Anything else? You had a question back there?

Q: It's about my dog. I feed him raw meat. The raw meat gives him diarrhea and the raw chicken with the bones gets him constipated. So I had to put him on a little kibble. He only eats once a day and I want him to eat really good. So when I feed him...

A: Feed him a little cheese with the meat. If he's having diarrhea that means his liver, gallbladder, spleen or pancreas are dumping some heavy poisons. Did he ever have any vaccines, doggy shots?

Q: Yes, and the last time I had him he was itching. Two weeks later he started itching real bad.

A: Was that after he'd been eating the raw meat?

Q: Yes.

A: See what happens is all vaccines have thimerosal, mercury poisoning in it. They call it a stabilizer and antibacterial. Hell yes, it's poison. Mercury is a poison. They put liquid mercury in there. And any time you've gotten a vaccine in your life, almost all injections carry thimerosal. So you're getting mercury poisoned every time you get an injection.

Q: With everything?

A: Almost everything.

Q: Should we just stop getting the vaccines for the animals? What do we do with them?

A: There's no different kind. I know some vets who will give a third to a fifth a dose. And what I suggest before you do that is preferably if you can get the under the skin one, what's that called, the epidermal injections rather than the deep tissue. If you can get the doctor to give that. Because what you can do is, like I've got teachers who have to have the tuberculosis test done periodically. So what I do is I have them go to a particular M.D. The M.D. shoots right under the skin and as soon as they get out of the office they suck it out. And I mean it's bubbled right under there and you suck it right out. And then put egg yolk on it and it will draw the rest of it out. But otherwise, you know, for a dog, cat, if you love them, suck it out. Put it under the skin and suck it out when they get out there and have lots of eggs. But your dog is going to have to go through diarrhea as long as he's eliminating something like that. And usually the diarrhea is a very healthy, good thing. Hell on the house.

Q: Yeah, he did miss on that, right? So I could keep giving him the meat?

A: Yeah, it usually lasts no more than 30 days.

Q: Oh, he's had it for over a year, off and on.

A: Well, he just needs to have a good one. But I'd feed him several times a day and have cheese with it. The cheese can bind with some of the toxins so it doesn't have to expel it so quickly. Because if it is, if it's the mercury, which it usually is when I was doing laboratory tests, the mercury will cause damage to the intestines, so the body has to evacuate it with lots of fluids, causing the diarrhea.

Q: A rabies shot, what do we do? It looks like it's the law. What do you do about that?

A: Well, find a vet who will give a small amount of the dose.

Q: What about heart worms? That's one more question. He's got these heart worm things he takes once a month. Do I have to do that as long as he's having them raw?

A: No. Heart worms would be good.

Q: Yeah. [unintelligible]

A: No. The heart worms live on degenerative tissue in the heart. So only if the heart has mercury or some other poison stored in it, has caused some degenerative tissue there, will they thrive in there. But what they do is they eat it rapidly so that the body can, the heart can rebuild itself. That's part of one of the laboratory tests that I did. And the animals that we let them have heart worms got much healthier, quicker.

Q: He's going to be so happy. He can eat his raw meat.

A: Good. Yeah. Yes.

Q: Speaking of dogs and animals, my dog won't eat raw chicken. I can put a chicken breast down there and she may go bury it, but she won't eat it. 

A: If she buries it, that means she needs the bacteria. She's burying it to let the bacteria, she may not be able to digest it very well unless it has high bacteria. So let it, you know, get stinky. I know lots of dogs that will not eat it fresh. They'll only eat it when it's really foul smelling. Okay folks, we'll take a break after Jill makes some announcements. Oh and there's lots of milk in there. Organic, oh is that what you were going to say? Okay.

[break]

A: I'll pick up where we left off about some laboratory experiments. I paid them a lot of money to do quite a few experiments over the years, about an 11 year period. And one of them we wanted to check to see the benefits or the detriments of parasites. So we put an ad in a paper and we asked for animals that had already been diagnosed with parasites, worms of any kind. We didn't care. So we got 32 animals all together. About half were dogs and about half were cats. They had a variety of different worms. Probably about 12-15% had brain flukes. They were mainly dogs. Lots of intestinal parasites. And what we did was we put them in three groups. One group got the regular canned food and kibble. All the regular garbage stuff they sell including the science diet, which is a joke. Those animals were given, they were split into two groups. There was group one, A and B. A was given pharmaceutical grade dewormers. Group B was given herbal or homeopathic dewormers. Second group got all raw foods. They split them up into two groups. The first group, A, got the pharmaceutical grade and the second group got herbal or homeopathic dewormers. The last group was just one group. It wasn't divided. All they got was the raw food. Raw eggs, raw meat, and raw milk. A little raw butter. And once in a while, probably once a week, I gave them a little honey too. The first group, A, 40% of them died. Approximately 40% died. Group B, approximately 30% of them died. And the second group, they were on raw foods having the dewormers. Only about 12%, 12-15% in the first group died with the pharmaceutical dewormers. And then only about 8-10% died having the homeopathic. In the group that got no dewormers and ate raw foods, there were no deaths. They took a lot longer to get well. They took a lot longer to get rid of their worms, their symptoms of worms, sometimes up to 6 months. But that group, no matter how old, and these animals were anywhere from about probably 12-16 years old. Every one of them was like a kitten or a puppy afterwards. None of the other groups had that. So what we found out was, and we followed them until their deaths, and we did autopsies on them, and their organs were much cleaner. Wherever they had parasites, their particular gland or organ that was infested, if it were the brain, the brain was much richer. It had much more pinkness to it and looked much more vibrant. If it were liver flukes, like in a lot of the dogs we had, the livers were so much healthier than the others that were in the other groups. So it was very obvious after those tests that parasites go in and eat degenerative tissue so you can replace the cells if the animal is given the food necessary to do it. And most people cannot regenerate cells without raw meat. And it's like they say after you hit 21 years old, between 21 and 25 it's all downhill. That s because your body stops producing what are called youth hormones that allow for regeneration in the midst of garbage in your system. At that point you stop generating those so-called growth hormones. But I found that on this diet you will rekindle them. You'll start producing growth hormones again by eating raw meat.

Q: Is tuna fish included in the raw part?

A: Yes. Any meat, when I talk about meat that means any fowl, seafood, lamb, buffalo, any flesh food is meat.

Q: That's not canned.

A: Any canned food is always cooked. Always. Including tuna. Tuna in a can is cooked. It s always blanched, which means half-cooked. It's like half-baked.

Q: I've heard the name a couple of times and I'm not sure what it is.

A: Flukes are parasites. I'm going to start talking about food combining first. Take a look at the anatomical system of the human being and compare them with other animals that eat foods. An herbivore has a digestive tract that's two and a half times larger, longer and larger than ours. It takes 48 hours for them to pass whole vegetation, grasses, through their systems. They have two to four stomachs, we have only one. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fats and the proteins from it. If we put whole vegetables in our systems, in our digestive tract, we will only digest one third of it. And that's mainly vitamins and enzymes and minerals. Our body takes those vitamins, enzymes and minerals and turns them into enzymes trying to digest the rest of the cellulose to get the fats and the protein. So basically it's a big waste. Now if you're a cooked food eater, it's different. If you eat cooked meat, you destroy the vitamins and enzymes in it, you cauterize the minerals, you cauterize the proteins, you create heterocyclic amines, lipid peroxides and about 40 different varieties of toxins. That causes over acidity, it also causes the meat to sit in the intestines and putrefy. So if you eat whole vegetables with it, you'll alkalinize the over acidity and provide some vitamins and minerals to help that move through. So on a cooked diet, whole vegetables are very good. On a raw diet, it's just the opposite, they're very harmful. They will create constipation because the intestinal tract has to be mainly acid to digest acid foods, all animal products. So if you put whole vegetation in there, it constantly secretes all this alkaline fluid and all of the villi and acid bacteria that digests are neutralized. What it does is it causes a repulsion to meats. A lot of people don't like meats, they're repulsed by them because they're eating salads on a raw diet. That's a problem. It destroys the body's ability to digest the meats. So guess what? You're going to be nauseous, you're going to be repulsed by meat because you can't digest it. So you need to cut out the whole vegetables. Whole vegetables is a real no-no on this diet. It will interfere with a lot of things. Appetite for meat, will cause constipation, galore. Because you have no over acidity in the system, so when that pulp gets into the colon in about 16 to 17 hours, guess what? The colon has to be intensely acid for the E. coli to feed on that matter. On a raw diet like this one, we don't rely upon pulp or fiber to move things through. Fiber is necessary for people who eat foods that don't digest well. So something's got to push it through. But on this diet, it's just the opposite. If you have all that alkalinity in the colon, it neutralizes the E. coli. 60-80% of the fecal matter on this kind of a raw diet is bacteria. That bacteria is responsible for synthesizing amino acids and B vitamins. It backs up your lymph system, which is your immune system. Now, when the medical profession talks about immune system, it's this illusory factor. You say, okay, what is the immune system? Well, it's this or it's that.They never get specific. Your immune system is your lymph system, period. Your lymph system feeds everything and detoxifies everything. Your blood mainly transports oxygen to every cell in the body. That's its responsibility. It is also an emergency exit for poisons to get into the system.

So toxins can dump into the blood, the dump can rush in through the bowels or small intestines, dump it in there and leave it or urinary tract or out the skin. Some way it can expel it quickly. The blood is not responsible for feeding anything other than oxygen to the whole body normally. If we weren't addicted to carbohydrates, blood sugar wouldn't mean much. But because everybody is eating so many carbohydrates, we have this over-blood sugar, which is not normal. Our pancreases are two and a half times larger than even the animals who feed on carbohydrates for a living. That size of the pancreas is very unnormal. The lymph system in conjunction with the lacteal system, it's like a web network all around the intestines. It takes fats, it takes proteins, and the reason they call it lacteal is because it looks like milk. And it absorbs all these nutrients into it, feeds the entire lymph system. The lymph system transports and feeds the whole body, every cell in the body, no matter where it is, and also pulls out the toxins, holds it in the nodes to neutralize it, sends it to the glands for discharge from the system, and then back out to the lymph system where it can discharge either into the bowels, the sinuses, the ears, the salivary glands, the gums, the tear ducts, the rectum, the urinary tract. We are one big asshole because we're so toxic, literally. Our bodies will use every part of itself to dump garbage. You do that to a dog or a cat, you're really in trouble. They're really in trouble. That's why dogs and cats aren't doing so well. We've had a whole body to be able to discharge poisons, but dogs and cats can only eliminate them out the rectum, the urinary tract, and their mouths and nostrils. That's it. Their skin, they do not perspire, so they cannot reject them that way. That's why dogs and cats domesticated are doing very poorly in just a hundred years of a lot of garbage food, a lot of chemicals. So the lymph system is your immune system. It takes care of you. If you've got a congested one, you're in trouble. The people I know who have the most chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, have a congested lymphatic system. I've seen it in every case. There are a few cases that I've seen of lupus where not only is the lymph system damaged severely, but the endocrine gland system is also damaged. A certain percentage of the fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue, also other glands are affected besides the lymphatic system. Occasionally, I've just seen on a rare occasion in some chronic fatigue that the lymph system isn't completely congested, but the glandular system is affected by mercury from vaccines or some other medication that is stored in the endocrine gland system. Getting that lymph gland system cleaned is a very important process. The way we can facilitate it is with bacteria and solvents. The body cleans itself in three ways. Number one, it uses a very slow process which is completely dependent upon the food we eat and the cellular activity, and that's solvents.

We make solvents just as we make them industrially, mainly with some kind of oil compound, petroleum, and some kind of alcohol and some kind of protein. The body does the same thing, about 80% fat, 15% protein, and 5% alcohol. Our bodies make alcohol by fermenting carbohydrates in the digestive tract, purposely does it. It's very important, alcohol and vitamin C are very important, either one of them, the body can use either, either alcohol or vitamin C to help ignite the combination of pyruvate, which is a protein sugar, and fat to cause that energy, so that fat can be utilized. And fat is the strongest, most concentrated fuel that there is. There are two and a half calories higher than carbohydrates or protein in a fat, much more concentrated. Take a look at your weight lifters, they're all fat. Your body builders are all muscle and they're not that strong. Your real wrestlers, they're fat, they're not all muscle, they need that fat to have the strength. To clean the best solvents I found that the body can make is from coconut cream. Take the coconut meat, you put it through a juicer like a Champion or a Green Power, a Green Star, a Green Life juicer, separate the pulp from the cream and mix that with some fruit and there you have an incredible solvent. Mix it with fruit and egg and you even have a better solvent. That helps dissolve the toxicity in the lymph system the best. It can get heavy and it can be difficult to digest for some people because it may cause too much detoxification of the liver before it even gets to the lymph system. But coconut cream is your best solvent. Butterfat is your best stabilizer. It stabilizes the bones, the cartilage, the connective tissue. Cream is best for the nervous system. Helps sedate and relax it. That's why when people eat raw ice cream they just feel so mellow because it relaxes the nervous system. If you put coconut cream in that ice cream you'll find that you'll be more charged than you will be relaxed because it s going to start kicking up some toxins in the system and cause a little bit of an adrenaline rush. The second way that the body cleans itself is bacteria, virus and molds including candida. Candida is a very good thing to have. People who don't have candida contain and do not eliminate products like advanced glycation end products which are byproducts of the body using glycogen mainly as fuel, as neurological fuel. Columbia University did tests and they found that advanced glycation store in a healthy body at a rate of 70%. It means throughout your entire life 70% of every carbohydrate you've eaten the byproduct of that is storing in your body if you're healthy, if you're an athlete in top shape. People who have compromised health 90% of it stores in your body. Well guess what happens when you re 30, 40, 50 years old all of a sudden the skin starts sagging or you bloat, your muscles start falling because it becomes concentrated like in Coca-Cola so it becomes an acid and starts dissolving the body. That's why elderly people have kidney problems because of all that sugar acid eating away at the kidney. It damages the bladder, it causes deterioration of the liver which causes the body to throw it off into the skin and cause liver spots.

Psoriasis, rashes, eczema, everything that elderly people, most of the stuff that elderly people have symptoms of it's the sugars that are stored in the body. Now when I was doing research to find out what is best for the humans to eat I also looked at what do we know scientifically about dietary patterns of certain cultures. I noticed that American Indians when they were nomadic were in perfect health. The tribes that settled around the Ohio River for 15,000 years they would go into a particular area three to five hundred years separation and they would populate a certain area. They would start getting diseased and with a hundred, a hundred and fifteen years they would break it up and go back to being a nomad. It showed that when they were stabilized in an area, when they were socialized and civilized into an area, they'd eat all the meat in the surrounding area, the population would grow and then they would be, you know, harvesting nuts, collecting grains, eating a lot more carbohydrate. They started getting osteoporosis, cavities, bone deterioration and then they'd start having other problems and go back to being nomadic, repeatedly. The Koster excavations proved that. Dr. Struever, he was responsible for those, I think it was something like twenty some years of excavation and research. Carbohydrate is worse than eating cooked foods. Even if you ate raw carbohydrate, it would be worse. That's why when I was a raw food fruitarian, I did so badly. I already had blood and bone cancer and then I put all this sugar in the system. Even if it's raw, you still have advanced glycation end products. And if you don't have any fat and protein to help get rid of it, it's going to start leaching fat and minerals from the bones and cartilage. Also makes people manic and crazy. How many people have met some die-hard vegetarians like I was? I mean, they think, they believe so firmly like I did that we were non-violent. And yet you get a vegetarian on that kick and they'll foam at the mouth. And yet they don't see their violence. I didn't see mine. I had to find a different place to be able to look at it. I mean, it was shocking to me when I went down to give a lecture in Del Mar where David Wolfe and his big fruitarian group is. And I was, I had a table set up selling my book and I lectured at the Whole Life Expo. And literally, these people were ultra-thin, manic. Women had a tendency to be puffy because their fats try to deal with the poisons and it causes swelling. And probably 50% of the women on a fruitarian diet are swollen, and the men almost always inevitably are really skinny and manic. I'm not kidding, for two and a half hours, they were foaming. I'm talking about foam at the mouth, attacking me. And I was just saying, hey, you know, if it's right for you, it's right for you. You can't convince me. I've already been where you've been. I had bone deterioration. I lost half my teeth on this. And I thought I was saving them, because after the chemo and radiation, my teeth were all, the bone rotted all the way around the teeth, so they dangled. So if I went like that, I lost a half a cup to a whole cup of blood. Not often a whole cup, but a half a cup of blood, just by biting down on my own bite, my own teeth.

And they wanted to pull them out, and I said, I'm going to die anyway, I'm going to die with my teeth. You know, I'm going to be either sucking the straw with or without the teeth, it doesn't make any difference. So I left my teeth in and guess the bone regenerated. Well, after six and a half years on the fruitarian diet, it started going the other way again, and the teeth started decaying like crazy. So I said, you know, you can make a fruitarian diet work for you wonderfully, but you're not very calm and happy right now, and you're calling me violent. And I said, I'm not trying to push anything on you, I'm just letting my information be available to other people if they want it. Yes?

Q: About raw sugars. Isn't raw honey basically raw sugar, and how is that not deteriorating at the same pace?

A: Because when the bees collect the nectar, they swallow it, and they manufacture an insulin-like substance, just like we manufacture insulin to deal with sugar. Theirs is much more efficient because that's all they eat. They produce an insulin-like substance which converts 90% of the carbohydrate into enzymes for digesting, utilizing and assimilating protein. So only 10% of the honey you eat is sugar. Very different. And for some reason, the advanced glycation end products are very minimal with honey. So there's some other factor in it besides the insulin, you know, but there's so many factors in everything we don't know about, we can't decipher yet. But I found that honey heated above 93 degrees starts destroying that insulin-like substance by the time you reach 100. Diabetics can't eat it anymore. You know, they start having sugar reactions. It isn't a radical sugar until you go over 105 degrees, but still at 100 degrees it's all sugar again because it doesn't have the insulin-like substance in it. So, candida helps break down cells that have been damaged, bruised, or cauterized by the sugar compounds in the body. It is an uncomfortable experience, but the body's trying to do what it can. The people who go on this raw diet and minimize their sugars are not feeding the candida at the same time. So their symptoms are more mellow because the candida will continue to work, but you're not adding to the foods that they're eating in your everyday consumption. So it mitigates candida activity to just a normal, bearable detoxification until it's over. There are lots of other molds, lots of other bacteria and virus which work for us. When we have a bacterial detoxification or viral detoxification like in a cold or a flu, it is an intense bout, that bacteria is going in there and feeding on the degenerative tissue. It always has to be organic. The body can only use the solvent process for things that are not organic. Pollution, chemicals, pesticides, the body has to use solvents, the slow process to do that. The solvent process, when the body uses solvents, one of the byproducts is identical to turpentine and it is as toxic as turpentine and it creates low-grade nausea, some depression and lethargy. Very slow process because it is so toxic. Virus and bacteria and molds work much more rapidly, two and a half times faster. Their byproducts, their toxicity is 50% less toxic as the solvent process. When you have a cold or flu, it is so intense at the end of its cycle that you have mucus flow, you have congestion and it feels like you can't function. On this diet, most people function even with pneumonia. They can go to work, they can act normally. If you have spinal meningitis or meningitis, that usually puts people under for a few days or a week. But those are the kinds of things that, those are the only kinds of things that will put people under. The third process is parasites. Now parasites work five times faster than the body can use the solvent process.

The trouble is when people have parasites is that they don't eat raw meat or don't eat a protein that they can digest to regenerate cells, they ulcerate. Parasites eat so rapidly it leaves holes in the body, gut exchange, you can have paralysis, death, a number of problems. All of the animals, whether human or dogs and cats, mice, every animal that I've used in experiments who've had parasites, none of them have died, all of them have gotten healthier as long as they eat the raw meat. So all those things that are considered taboo are not taboo, they're all our friends. I always thought, well, there's probably one, you know, I was raised with a very violent brother, so I got to experience somebody evil, and I always figured that there had to be some kind of evil in everything if it existed, you know, in people. But I still have not found any evil bacteria, not even the 157H7. I've seen many experiments where it didn't create any vomiting or diarrhea at all. So what I've learned is that the medical profession, scientific community, have no rationale when it comes to bacteria, virus, and parasites. None. When I was fighting the milk issue, I put 32 pages of documentation from the last 100 years. It was produced by the Mayo Clinic, top universities. They'd used raw milk to reverse diseases. St. Joseph's Hospital in Illinois used raw milk starting in about 1928 when their infant deaths rate went tremendous. The new doctor who ran the hospital said, give the infants raw milk. It went from something like 59 deaths to 5 infant deaths the next year and stayed like that until 1947, until raw milk was banned in the hospital. And then the infant rate, death rate, went way up again. Stayed there. 32 pages of documentation. Every paragraph was a different test that was done at a different university. 32 pages of this. All the epidemics that were created by pasteurized milk. One incident where 197,000 people were affected. 197,000 people were affected by this pasteurized dairy product. Raw milk has had no epidemics, ever. So you have this information right here, and I gave it to the medical milk commission and then the health commissioners, they would not take the evidence. They said, you show us the evidence and we'll come to a proper decision. Do you know what they used when we went to the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors? They said, well, the CDC put out an 82-page pamphlet that said that raw milk is bad. And it gives no facts in it, it gives no history, no statistics, no anything. It just postulates this theory. And that's what they used. They wouldn't open their eyes and say, hey, raw milk really is a good thing, pasteurized milk isn't. Let's ban pasteurized milk. That creates all the epidemics. They don't come to that kind of conclusion. So, we had to go to the Board of Supervisors and threaten them. I wrote a three-page executive summary that went with that and said, here are the points. The Health Department has used one academic piece of evidence against raw milk and that piece of evidence was nothing other than a statistical report, which was biased and prejudiced.

I got a biostatistician who's on the diet, a graduate of UCLA, 67-68 years old, who looked at that report and said, well, everything they're saying is wrong. The conclusions they're coming to are wrong. The analysis is completely improper. So, she wrote an analysis of the analysis and gave it to me. That was my 32-page report on raw milk was Exhibit A, and that letter from Dr. Mann, the biostatistician, was B. Completely eliminated the Health Department. We're talking about the most powerful health department besides the FDA. California is the strongest health department in the world besides the FDA, and they had no rationale, no sensibility, none. The Board of Supervisors, I got two senators, ex-senators, to take in and hand deliver it to each Board of Supervisors and say, and this was the day before the vote, and said, you better take a look at this, you may be in for a hell of a suit. The Board of Supervisors the next day came in and they got the, by doing all this, the man who was in charge of the health department for Los Angeles County was fired because he couldn't put together a good report against the raw milk. The next guy, Fielding, who came in, he was at the board meeting when he was coming to vote, and Yaroslavsky, who I'd been working on for two months, completely against the raw milk, wouldn't hear a thing. He said, if one child dies from milk, I will be completely against it. Not rational. And there was an accusation that there was one child. I got the documentation from the trial and everything and it was not, the child died of, who was it, some other problem that was unrelated to the milk. The child was sick and already had a problem, but they blamed it on the raw milk. She drowned. She drowned and they did an autopsy on her and found salmonella in her stomach. So then the doctor said, oh she drinks raw milk, so they blamed her drowning on the raw milk. So this is what the health department was using. They used five cases, incidences, blew each one of them out of the water. So Yaroslavsky says, I mean, didn't expect this at all. He said, to Fielding, he said, you know, we've had raw milk since the beginning and two years ago, according to this report, we've lost it. Did we do something wrong? Because that is it. He needed to know the answer to that. Fielding sat there for two minutes and babbled about nothing, not giving a response to that. And you could see all the Board of Supervisors getting ready to just ask the questions that would get the right answers and voted no against it. I mean, voted against the banning of the raw milk and allowed us to have the raw milk in Los Angeles County again. The medical profession is in fear. They are phobic. They have no rationale when it comes to bacteria, virus, and parasites. None. Don't expect it. Don't expect them to be intelligent about it. They are not. They believe in the germ theory, that germs are there to attack the body. They are not in a symbiotic relationship with the body. Completely inaccurate and incorrect. If it were true, the bacteria that's in milk would create a problem and the pasteurized wouldn't. I met a man in Oklahoma when I was bicycling from 73 to 76.

He was an elderly man. He must have been 80 some years old. We got to talking about raw foods. He let me sleep in his backyard for the night, something like that. He said, let me tell you something about our science. He said, when pasteurization first came in, we decided to prove that bacteria, getting rid of bacteria would get rid of disease. So in 1926 through 1938 or 1939 he said, Purina and General Foods went together and did this whole incredible laboratory experiments using processed food and raw foods with heavy bacteria. They spiked it to make it even go more in their favor. And guess what? The animals who got all this bacteria and all the raw foods thrived. And all the animals who got the processed food got terrible diseases. Do you know what happened to all those 13 years of papers and experiments? Shredded. Shredded. So we didn't get that information. It's a very prejudiced perspective out there. Do you know that it is illegal to sell raw vegetable juices in any store now?

Q: Since Odwalla?

A: Well, it came after Odwalla, yeah. But you have to understand that Odwalla was not a true experience. One E. coli cannot cause an epidemic. What it looks like to me was there was probably some pesticides, some kind of maybe solvent that was left and not cleaned out of the machinery properly, and the guy gave some people some diarrhea and vomiting. That little girl who died, she died of HUS, kidney failure, kidney damage. Guess what antibiotic she was given? Cipro. Guess what Cipro has a history of doing? Creating kidney damage. So if every doctor admitted that it was the drugs that created the problem, the therapy for the vomiting and diarrhea, guess what? There would be a flood of lawsuits and the pharmaceutical houses, the hospitals and the doctors would be out of business. So guess what they blame it on? Virus and bacteria and parasites. They're locked in. You just can't expect anything rational from them. Yes?

Q: So [unintelligible]?

A: Well, you have to take a look. If you looked at the history of it like I have, including the AIDS, those are man-made. You have to understand that in Hawaii, you remember the epidemic? They said, oh, the Hawaiians were not exposed to our bacteria. But if you look at some of the other material that you do not normally see, like in Brazil, a man who wrote... I can't remember if it was called Savage or something. He wrote that they would blame these poisonings that were happening. They would go around and poison their water supply, their lakes, their streams with formaldehyde and all kinds of other poisons, and then they would have these reactions like they were having tuberculosis or smallpox, things like that, when they were actually being poisoned. So you have to look at that information pretty hard and don't believe any of it. 

Q: Particularly because we're having this huge scare in this country, and all sorts of stuff is coming down in this climate that may control the way our food is shipped, [unintelligible].

A: Anthrax has been around. One cattleman who was 72 years old, he was a cattleman for I think he said 51 years in Wisconsin or Minnesota. He said, you know what anthrax is? It's a cold for a cow. Foot and mouth disease, it's a flu for a cow. They always get them, you know, unless we give them, you know, unless they get fresher foods. When cows are grown in a climate where they get green grass all the time, they get no colds or flus. But when they're living in a climate where they bale hay, especially with pesticides and stuff like that, they're going to get colds and flus because it's going to create some poisoning in the body. It's going to create some degenerative tissue. Bacteria and viruses have to go in there, eat it up for them to expel it. So they get colds and flus because of the type of food, the nutrition that they're getting in the wintertime. But you have to understand that the medical profession and the pharmaceutical companies make trillions of dollars a year in the cattle industry. Trillions of dollars with injections that don't mean anything, don't have anything to do with reality or rationale. They just have this fear thing going and say, you know we've got to vaccinate all these animals.

[audio cut]

A: Let's say they linked it to 27 people, there was one death. They didn't search it out like I did. They didn't look for the reason for the death. They didn't just say, oh this is bacteria and left it right there. There was no finite research done. So what do they do? They pasteurize. The FDA rules that all juices have to be pasteurized. And guess who was supporting them? I was on the phone with the FDA three weeks ago because I'm writing a paper just like I did with the raw milk to get it reversed in California. And then I'm going to go after the FDA with the same report. With that they said all juices have to be pasteurized because here we had this one incident. I beg your pardon, one incident? If a child dies in a car, you don't ban cars completely and outright. You have let's say 32 kids out of 10,000 that died with vaccines, you don't outlaw vaccines. And you're saying one incident of accused infection from orange juice is a reason to get rid of it, pasteurized? There is no rationale to it. There's no science to it. None. So the medical profession holds themselves up there on this pedestal saying we are scientific. We are the authorities. Yeah? Show me the science. They can't. They can't do it. So bacteria and virus, parasites, they're all your best friends. They'll get you well faster. That's why my clients, a lot of them will make high meat. Take a look at this test. Edward Howell. Does anybody know who Edward Howell is? He's called the father of enzymes. He took rats and he fed one group raw, one group cooked. The group that ate cooked foods got all the diseases of man. The ones that ate raw had no diseases. Just like Pottenger did 20 years earlier with 900 cats over a 10 year period. What confused him though was the cats who ate the cooked food lived considerably less lifespan than the ones who ate raw but the rats lived the same age. It took him a year to figure it out. He said wait a minute, the behavior is that the rats who ate the cooked food ate their feces. So what he did the next time, he did the test, he put a screen down so the feces fell through. They weren't able to eat their feces and guess how long they lived? 66%. They lived two years instead of three when they weren't able to eat their feces. All animals eat feces except humans. 100 years or so ago we didn't have toilets, we didn't have sinks. People were wiping their butts you know out there with leaves or rocks or whatever it was and they were getting all over the hands and they touched their foods. Man didn't get diseased like that. Disease is just rampant. First individual that I talked, human being that I talked into, hey, and the reason I talked her into it finally was because I was able to show her a test done at the University of Toronto where Sarah Arab, Dr. Sarah Arab was using the verotoxin produced by E. coli to completely dissolve human brain tumors that were grown in bald mice, dissolve those tumors in two to seven days including the vessels going to them. 

Q: How did they do that? 

A: They used verotoxin produced by E. coli. The thing that's supposed to poison the body is the varitoxin from E. coli and they would inject it into the system. So I thought, sure, eat fecal matter, get the E. coli going in the body. So this girl was a young girl, 28 years old when she came to me, she'd been chronically fatigued for eight years. Her right breast was about 50 rocks, one third larger than the left. She had kidney of the hip bone and kidney cancer that was attached to the adrenal gland. She'd been on the diet two years, almost two and a half years on the diet. Almost all of this dissolved, there were only about five of them left after two and a half years and they felt more like rubber rather than rocks. So you could see it was dissolving. However, iridologically, the contamination there hadn't changed. So the whole basis for the problem was still there. So I said, you know, she broke her, it took her two years to break the chronic fatigue so she was, you know, could live a normal life. She was 20 years old when she went into chronic fatigue. So I talked her into eating an ounce of fecal matter. Within two and a half months, one third of all of that dissolved. Nine months later she did it again. She ate a massive amount of sheep fecal matter including part of the bowel. After another three months it was now dissolved by two thirds. Now she's living in Hawaii, she just ate a massive amount of goat, you know, fecal matter and I'm anxious to see what's happened after that. You know, I'll find out in August. It works. fecal matter is working. I have one fellow that came to me with cancer of the lung, esophagus, liver, and I think it was intestines. When they come to me at that point, fourth stage you had surgery, you had some chemo, these people don't make it usually. They just don't make it even on this diet. They'll get better. They'll show signs of getting better but they don't win the battle because there's just too much poisoning going on, too much damage from surgery. The surgery I found isn't as bad if I can talk the people into convincing the surgeon not to use methylate, mercurochrome or iodine as an antibacterial during surgery. Mercurochrome and methylate are mercury, liquid mercury that they use as an antiseptic. Poison the body with mercury, what are you going to do? You're going to damage everything around within two inches of that area. If that's where your cancer is, you're in trouble because you're creating more dead cells to have more cancer to create more tumors. So I found that people having surgery, when they do that, they're recovering much better now and they're actually recovering. So to me, surgery may not be such a bad choice for some people because they're not going to be able to dissolve those tumors as readily to get rid of them, you know, might better make it with the surgery. However, with methylate, mercurochrome, you know, the mercury and the iodine, it creates a very poisoned area.

Anyway, this fellow that came to me was in terrible shape. I've got an outlet for buffalo fecal matter and so I have it shipped down to me and I literally spend a lot of money to get this stuff and then I give it away to these people. And, you know, I can't prescribe anything because I'm not a doctor and, you know, so I just tell them the experience and I give it to them. Normally, this kind of individual will go fast. You know, go down, they won't be able to eat because they're on so much pain medication that they can't eat. This guy ate the fecal matter and was, had an appetite. Appetite. Appetite, was eating, because I usually lose them because they're on morphine or something and destroys their appetite and they can't eat. This guy after eating the fecal matter and then another woman who came and advanced cancer and I gave it to her too. Then I ran out of it and the next person that came to me is having a hell of a problem and she doesn't have it and she's not as bad as the other people and she's having a difficult time getting beyond the pain and the morphine. So, all the bacteriophobia, all the fecal matter phobia, the E. coli phobia, don't listen to it. It's not scientifically based. Not an iota of it. Yes?

Q: So one can go into the forest and pick up like deer fecal matter and utilize it?

A: Yeah but E. coli is destroyed pretty quickly as it dehydrates. E. coli is active when it's in the colon, it's in that environment. So you'd have to have it pretty fresh and go into it in the middle of it before it cools off and dehydrates. Because then they're dead. Pardon?

Q: So in other words, I should watch the deer, and as soon as it pops out, run over.

A: Well, if you really want some good stuff, butcher the deer and eat the fecal matter.

Q: Wow.

A: Yes?

Q: Have you ever explored mushroom spores?

A: Yes.

Q: What's the truth about that, do you think?

A: Well, mushrooms...

Q: They're making a pill with ten different mushrooms in the pill.

A: Uh-huh.

Q: And I didn't know...

A: Well, mushrooms are the fruit of a mycelium. Mycelium is a solvent for roots. Mycelium is a white mold. It's a solvent for roots. Tree is dead, if a plant's dead, or any part of their root system is dead and dying, the mycelium will feed on it and dissolve it. Then a mushroom sprouts so spores can be distributed to find other roots that are decayed. But again, the mushroom does not work on a healthy root. Mycelium works on dissolved tissue. And in the human body, if you've got decaying tissue networks, whether it's the veins, your bloodstream veins or your lymphatic veins, which are even more complex than the bloodstream, and the neurological veins, if any of those are hardened and dead and you eat mushrooms, that mycelium can grow in your system. When you read my book, if you read it, I ate a poison mushroom, the death cap, and survived. I ate 15 times the amount that would kill somebody. And it certainly did change my life. It took me 11 years to recover from it, but some of the toxicity in my body probably would not have gotten rid of it. And I wouldn't be standing up here, you know, 11 days from my 55th birthday feeling better than I ever did, you know, when I was a child. If I hadn't have gone through that, it was a rough going through, and I would never do it again, not the way that I did. And I didn't do it purposely. I accidentally ate, I misidentified a mushroom. But mycelium, yes, it will help. If people are taking pills of it, it could be dangerous for them. You know, it could be very dangerous.

Q: They say our intestinal tract requires a certain amount of material to rebalance the intestinal tract. I mean, that's the guy who's promoting it, but...

A: Yeah, that's his theory. It's got nothing to do with truth. The intestines need bacteria, not a mycelium.

Q: What does the mycelium do versus bacteria?

A: Bacteria feeds on cells, degenerative cells. Cells that are dead or decaying or ruptured and are going to die soon. Mycelium feeds on hardened, dead canals. So you've had, let's say somebody who has symptoms of MS, multiple sclerosis, which means all of the veins of the nervous system have hardened. A mycelium will go in there and dissolve that network so that your body can rebuild it, but if people aren't eating raw foods, they're just going to have lupus. Because a mycelium is very much like lupus, it dissolves the connective tissue and then there's nothing connected to the skin with the muscles and the muscles with the bones, they're just dissolving and that's the danger in putting a mycelium in the body if it has a place to propagate. Yes?

Q: When I take [unintelligible].

A: He needs that bacteria, definitely. Dogs are scavengers, I poop outside so the coyotes come up every night and eat every bit of it. Every day. I've got a natural antiseptic tank. The coyotes. Yes?

Q: I've got a couple of basic questions on uncooked dairy. You're saying that carbohydrate is not good for you, so can you explain in basic terms why the milk sugar would be good for you? And then can you touch upon, I've got a source for good uncooked milk and then souring some of it with saliva, and then I'm wondering if that's sufficient to produce different bacteria and stuff, or would I need to get an external source, say lactobacillus and all these different things, as kind of whether to produce a high quality soured product, can you touch on that?

A: I was going to touch on the specifics about food later, but the sugar problem I'll take now. Any type of sugar beyond a certain amount is too much. The Fulani tribe lives 90% on raw milk. They have no disease, no heart disease, no any other kind of disease, but they do have pigment discolorations and they do have over-emotionality. And those are symptoms of sugar, too much sugar. So even from drinking too much milk in relationship to the amount of cream that you get, and the amount of meat that you eat, can be an imbalance. 

Q: Okay, and then what about the souring of the milk? Oh, and when you sour the milk, does that convert the sugar into another thing, and so it wouldn't have as much sugar?

A: It helps, yes. Because it breaks it down into something that can be utilized quicker. Now I don't like to use foreign bacillus to make yogurt or kefir, because when I was doing some tests with my fecal matter and some cats fecal matter, when we ate kefir or yogurt that was spiked with a bacillus, the bacillus that was coming out in the fecal matter was very different and the properties of digestion were very different. And there wasn't as many B vitamins formed, there wasn't as much bacteria in the fecal matter. However, when we used soured milk letting its own bacillus react in the food, we did find the natural bacteria in the fecal matter normal and high. So after that test, I used to be an avid kefir eater. And then I stopped making it with foreign bacteria. Now what I'll do is just take the milk, I'll put it in a dark cupboard because the light will turn it bitter, the fats in it bitter, and I'll let it sit for a few days until it starts to thicken. And then it's already pre-digested itself, which is what should happen.

Q: So if you expose it to light, that's not a good thing?

A: I just don't like the bitter taste. I mean if I were raised eating bitter milk like that, like the Hunza's, it probably wouldn't bother me. I haven't found anything bad about it being bitter, it's just a taste thing.

Q: Back to the fecal matter, I've heard you talk about eating your own...

A: You get shit on your brain?

Q: Yeah, I've heard it before and I find it really interesting, and I'm surprised that you recommend eating other animals' fecal matter. Would you rather eat another animal's versus your own?

A: Are you healthy enough? Am I healthy? No, I would trust any animal that lives a while to be much healthier than we are.

Q: Or organic pastures? I mean, it wouldn't be wild if it's on a farm, an organic farm.

A: Well, it depends on, if it's an organic farm, then it's fine. I mean, when I was in Hawaii last year, I slaughtered a goat, and we made a harness. One of the fellows there made a harness for the goat. And we spun it from a tree, put a, what is it called, a pulley up there, and then spun this goat around, and then there were several drummers. It was very primal and nice. And there were several drummers drumming, and I had some dirt making some lines on my face, and two people spinning the goat opposite each other as it would come through. They would just gently take its arms, like it was flying super goat, and just spin it around like that. And every time the head came around, I would cause it to look in my eyes, and I would chant to it as I did to help put it to sleep, to mesmerize it. So when it went completely to sleep, I took a knife and cut the jugular vein, and had some big bowls to catch the blood, and we used half milk, half the goat milk, and half the goat blood, the way the Maasai do. Whenever the cows are having offspring at a certain time of the year, three months of the year, they don't get much milk because the calves are eating it, so they will bleed one of their bulls and mix it with the milk, so they have their nourishment. So for some reason, this was in a Pangaia community, a community called Pangaia, and they're almost all on my diet now. In fact, they all are on the diet. And they had been on since January of last year, and this was in August or July when I was there. And they had been, what do you call that, instinctos up until then. They ate meat but not much, and they always ate what appealed to them, their senses first, so mainly they would eat 60% fruit. So they all had these sores on their bodies, staph infections everywhere, impetigo, very emotional, socially the person who made pangaia, who built it, left it because he couldn't handle the people. When they went on my diet, the whole group changed dynamically and everything. Emotionally settled and happy and cooperative. So he came back and he bought it back. Very interesting. Anyway, there were other communities around that saw this change in these guys, who were still vegetarian or fruitarian. Some of them raw, some of them partially. They came to watch this, they came for my lecture and workshop like this, and then they came for the slaughter, you know, a couple of days later. And a lot of them were vegetarians. Probably six of the fifteen people there were not from the Pangaia community, but from surrounding communities and were vegetarians. So we mixed the goat milk and the goat blood together and started passing it around for people to drink. So here were these, you know, because it was all primal and social, it was like they were mesmerized into being there and they were going to partake in this, having the blood and the milk, but you could see their eyes going, and I mean it was that slow sometimes. Just getting ready, you just see the tension and then one taste of it and you just see their eyes go, and then you start glugging it. 

We had two gallons of it and it was gone within about twenty minutes, all of it, all two gallons. It was like ice cream. I couldn't believe it. You know, I had blood and mixed it with milk before, but it was after it had already coagulated. But this, we got to put it in the milk as it was coming out of the goat and mixed it, and it was just like ice cream. No gamey taste to it, nothing. It was like rich ice cream that had melted, and I mean it was just vibrant, delicious. So if you ever get a chance, don't miss that one. Do not miss that one. Yes?

Q: So, is the fecal matter comparable to the high meat, or is it different?

A: It's different. Okay, the bacteria, unless you take fecal matter and put it with the meat, then the E. coli will propagate on the meat. Otherwise, the natural bacteria that exist in muscle meat, or you know, glandular meat, whatever you're doing, are bacteria that are natural to that body part. It's like when I did that test, because I'm like, what's his name? Bechamp, Bechamp, who believed that all the bacteria and all stages of bacteria are naturally innate within flesh, that they don't come from outside like maggots do with flies. They're innate within the body. Parasites the same way. They don't come through the feet, you know, with the tapeworm. So to prove this, what I did was I took a healthy animal from an organic farm and slaughtered him in a hermetically sterilized environment. Put a slab of the meat, and of course we did tests on it, you know, after immediately slaughtering put it into a hermetically sealed environment about this big, glass, so it wasn't contaminated, marble top that was completely sterilized. And the glass went up into, there was a HEPA filter, and the glass went down into this room that had corn dracaenas in it that produced a lot of oxygen. So I made sure that the plants airborne weren't, you know, some theories that are out there that bacteria are airborne, and that we inhale them and they invade our system. So I had a HEPA filter there, filtering the oxygen that went into that slab of meat. And that slab of meat was kept at about 98 degrees, body temperature. The animal's normal body temperature was something like, this was a sheep, I think it's 96.8 or 9, something like that. So slightly above what it's normal body temperature was. The meat was checked, there were no signs of any kind of, some of the meat was taken from that right away and checked in a laboratory. There were no signs of any kind of parasites or any kind of disease or bacterial activity. Yet in three days in this piece of meat that was hermetically sealed, there were about 12 different varieties of bacteria and parasites spontaneously were produced in this slab of meat. Now if you put meat out, let's say you take good organic raw meat and you put it out on a room like this, it will dehydrate and turn into jerky without producing parasites or bacteria or virus because of the temperature. But you keep it up at a high temperature, then they incubate. Then if you go up to 100 degrees, then it starts destroying your bacteria. Someone mentioned to me, I think you mentioned it to me, at the end, he went through a seven week detox. He went on the diet, felt really, really great. He peaked and then started going to a seven week detox. But he stayed with the diet. He said at the end of that seven weeks, he had a peak where he was in fever and turning up mucus and all kinds of stuff like that. The actual bacteria activity was going on for at least a seven week period. When it was ending is when you go through your healing crisis. That's why it's called a healing crisis, not a detox crisis. The healing begins at that point. The fever lowers bacteria levels. Anything over 100 degrees destroys bacteria colonies. 

Also, it produces regeneration of cells. So fever is very important for the healing process. So you start putting ice packs on, chilling the body to prevent the fever. You're basically preventing the healing cycle after the detoxification process. So being full of fevers in the night and having sweats, that's all part of the healing process. And it's a wonderful indication that you're at the end of a down period in energy. Because so much of your energy is going to go and your nutrients are going to go on the byproducts of the bacteria and virus and parasites feeding in your body. On the parasite, the byproducts from parasites is a hundred times less than the toxicity of the turpentine like substance when your body uses the solvent process. So parasites are very beneficial if you eat raw meat. 

Q: And in the making of high meats, from what I heard from you it almost sounds like I should make sure that I brought different meat tissues separately from one another so they all have just theirs. And I might even do well to sterilize the jars that I'm using before I put the meat in to make sure I'm not introducing anything else and just I have what's within the meat without the good form or is it not necessary?

A: I found that it didn't make a bit of difference. I used to use sterile in my, when I was first doing the tests and it didn't make any difference.

Q: I still, I'm doing my high meat in the fridge but it almost sounds like it might be better to do it in a warmer environment.

A: No, they move too fast through the stages and you'd have to eat too much of it too quickly. I found it's better that if you, what I do is I take quart jars, oh and this is going to be on Ripley's Believe It or Not pretty soon, they're coming out to film in a couple of weeks, me eating all this high meat. One of my, one of the guys on the diet called them and said you got to get this guy. So they called me and they want to do it and I said I'll do it on one basis, that you legitimize it and that you understand why I'm doing it rather than make it a joke and he said well you have to understand the nature of our show, the nature of our show is to make this an unusual rational thing, rational object, yes. Anyway what I do is I take three quart jars and I'll take a pint of fowl, a pint of red meat and a pint of seafood fish and I'll dice it up into bite sized pieces so that I have half air space to half meat in each jar, one with the fowl, one with the seafood and one with the red meat, put a nice canning jar lid on it so it doesn't stink up my refrigerator. And I use the ball jar lids because they're enameled. The Kerr jar has that plating, steel plating on it and it will rust and falls down into the meat and destroys bacteria and poisons you. So use the ball jar lids with the enamel plating, the enamel coating on it and it has a true rubber sealer, the Kerr uses some gray matter that melts into the food so you seal it tightly, you put it in the refrigerator, every three or four days you take it out of the house, don't open it in your house because it will stay in your curtains, it will get on everything for days, then people walk into your house and think I don't want to be on that diet, even if you don't tell them about the high meat they just think you stink like you're dying or rotting, it's not a good thing. So you take them out of your house, open them and make a sideways sign of infinity, sideways eight, and that gets new air into it. They're aerobic, that particular kind of bacteria is aerobic, if you have fecal matter you do not want to open it, you just want to keep it in a warm cupboard and do not refrigerate it. Put that in a jar, small jar so there's not much air space in it because fecal matter, the E.coli is destroyed by air. But with the meat you want air to get to it, that helps it grow it's different bacteria and phases. And there are like 14 or 15 basic stages and then some of them have A and B stages so basically what it comes out to is there are 17 different forms that bacteria can take in their cycle, cycles. And if you refrigerate it, it goes through only one a week. And if you're eating it every week, you're going to get cycles, those cycles. And even at the end of those 17, it starts it over again. So you know I've eaten meat, high meat up to a year old. If you do not open it, it goes dormant after three or four days when all the oxygen is used. So it just goes dormant at that stage. When you start airing it again, it will pick it up from that stage. 

Q: Do you need to stir it around?

A: No, when you're doing this, it's going to move a little bit. You're not making ground meat. Don't use ground meat. Chop it.

Q: When is it good to start? I remember before that the recommendation was to wait actually even several months, and then it was like start eating it maybe about two weeks in. Is there a minimum time into the rotting process where you should start eating or can you?

A: Well, that depends on what you want to do. If you eat it in the second and third week, you might cause yourself a tremendous detoxification.

Q: More so than the older?

A: Yep. For some reason, the second and third weeks create very radical bacterial reactions. You know, maybe if you've been on the diet a long time, it would be fine. I did that with fish one time. I ate eight ounces and I ended up with meningitis and spinal meningitis for six weeks. Sure, it made me better in the long run. I got rid of a third of the scarring in my brain. You know, I don't feel any smarter, but maybe I am. But it did get rid of that much scar tissue, but it crippled me for... I was in severe pain probably five days and I spent two and a half days of that practically just on a couch where I couldn't move my legs and my spine. You know, they had to be lifted and even with my girlfriend lifting my legs I was in severe pain. And I practically had to live in a bathtub, a hot bathtub, just to sort of, you know, get through it, to survive the pain. But it was a good thing. So, you know, and that's probably the third time I've experimented doing that kind of thing. And the second and third week, unless you're ready for it, don't do it. Unless you're eating a very, very small amount.

Q: I haven't had that problem with beef, and I actually haven't tried that particular thing with fish. I haven't, I don't think I've consumed any in the second and third week. It's either been all or it's actually been like, you know, after the first week. So it's good to know that.

A: Yeah. So I'd skip the second and third week, unless you want those very aggressive stages.

Q: Got it. That's with any of the meats, right?

A: Yes, any of the meats. So there's the fact that I'm… I ask people to wait four weeks.

Q: Four weeks.

A: Yeah.

Q: So the fact that I'm very often eating the beef in the second, third, fourth week and I'm not having a reaction is indicating that at least that particular area of detoxing, I don't have [unintelligible].

A: Correct. But somebody else might.

Q: Right. Got it. Yeah.

A: Yes?

Q: Is there a limit for the aging that you've found?

A: I've only had it up to a year and I've not kept it beyond that, you know, so I don't know on that. Yes?

Q: Did you just eat one piece at a time, or did you...

A: Well, and, you know, getting people to eat high meats probably, and fecal matter, has been the hardest thing. Probably taking me 20 years to get people to do it. I mean, get to the point where, you know, my book is down and people think that, you know, God, this makes so much sense. He can't be completely crazy on this one too, you know. I mean, he can be so rational everywhere else, he can't be all face on this one. So I'm getting people to try it, you know. I'm not a doctor, so I can't say, you do this, you know, and get away with it. It doesn't work.You know, so I have to, you know, coax people in to do it. But people are finally doing it in the last, you know, four years, five years. And the results are pretty tremendous. As far as how much to eat depends upon you, I guess. I've had people experimenting... I know the last time I was here, I talked about the girl who was on psychotropic drugs for 22 years, five a day, depressed. This woman, a good day for her was, I feel good today. That was a good day. And I'm not kidding. Otherwise, she was a bitch. Hit a PMS button that hits it ten times worse than normal, and that was what she was like every day, all day long. Not a nice person.

Q: From the drugs, do you think?

A: Oh yeah, from the drugs, definitely. But she'd been on them for 22 years. She was in her late thirties. And after a year and a half of working with her on the diet, I said, listen, I can't work with you anymore unless you at least experiment with the high meats. They really work. It's very emotional. You go on and off the diet because you don't feel well, because you're unhappy. I've seen this high meat turn people around. The Eskimos do it before they go into a heavy winter. And they stay happy all through this excruciating weather. Even if they get a little frostbite, they still stay happy. These are incredible people. So I said, they do this high meat for a reason and they will eat handfuls at a time going into the winter. And they do it every year in the summertime before it goes into fall. And I said, just try it once. If it doesn't work, we'll keep trying other ways and do it the slow way. But just give it a try. I'm already on this crazy diet. It's antisocial. I don't have any friends. They think I'm crazy. I'm eating all this raw meat and everything hung the phone up on me. This is what I've been getting for a year and a half. So finally the next day she calls and she says, okay, how do I make the meat, high meat? So it takes four weeks. I don't have four weeks. I may be dead in four weeks. So I said, okay, well, there's a guy that's actually making it and selling it now. So why don't you call him and see if he has any that's old enough for you. So sure enough, she did and he did. He had some. So she got it. So I get a call that evening. I just ate the high meat. I'm nervous. I'm frightened. I want to talk to you. Call me. She had already, now this was, she called me like 40 minutes after she had eaten it. You tell she was already changing. I get a call every hour for about four hours all the way through the night. And I'm listening to it. I'm not going to answer this phone because I'd be babysitting her all the way through the night. The phone call in the morning, she was giggling and whistling. This woman eats it every other day. She is completely a different person. Her meds, her meds, she's down on her meds to probably a fifth of what she used to take. And I think she does that because she's just afraid to go cold turkey on them. But this woman, I met her at a party, it was like in January, and she was just so, she just sat there and was so mellow and happy and light. It's like God, just high meat, that's all it took and she's able to stay on the diet better. So the high meat is very, very wonderful. Now she eats about a large marble sized amount every two days.

Q: How does it make you happy?

A: Well, take a look at what I said about the three processes of how the body cleanses itself. The solvent processes are slow and high in toxicity. Bacteria and virus are very much helpers in the body. The toxicity is 50% less than the solvent process. So the body is probably, it's like you. So you have a whole room cluttered with garbage and you have to clean out the room. And all of a sudden some neighbors come over to help you. All of a sudden you got that extra energy helping you clean up the place. It's easier to clean up the place. The whole body on a psychic, spiritual level physiological level changes. It has help. And let me tell you, we're in such a sterile environment.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh I think the helpers, the bacteria are helpers. They're energy property. Yeah. But I mean if two people walked into the room and started helping you, your whole, you know, well-being would change. God, I don't have to do this on my own. I've got help. We've got other people and then we become a community of, you know, sharing people. And you know how the energy goes when people share like that and they're helping each other out. They feel good about themselves and feel good about helping each other and working with each other. And that's what happens when you introduce the bacteria into the body. It's very helpful. And the body loves it. The psyche loves it. And our medical profession, scientific community are out there every day saying, get rid of all the germs and bacteria and how much depression is going on now. Six million children are taking drugs every day. Six million children.

Q: In this country alone?

A: In this country alone. That's below the age of eight.

[audio cut]

Q: Can you talk about parasites and their cycle in the human body? Do they increase? Do they take over? 

A: As I said, no animal, including human, has died on this diet who's had parasites. They have only gotten healthier faster. Some people may see them coming out their rectum. Other people have other indications of it. Some doctors can do tests to find out. People have come to me with parasites and said, I've been diagnosed with chlamydia or any different number of amoebas or any form of parasite. And those people get well faster because they'll stay away from sugars and they eat lots of meat and fats together with the meats. 

Q: So are you recommending that those who don't have parasites, who don't think they have parasites, go out and find some?

A: Well, I've not been able to spike them in myself. I've eaten lots of them and never been able to get them. I had my blood and feces checked for 10 weeks after and never could get them. But that may be because I had so much chemo and so much radiation poisoning. I mean, you know, I took a lot of barium and a lot of cobalt radiation therapy. So I may be so poisoned that they get in there and they're killed and destroyed in me. But I've not been able to spike them in animals either. Now, Dr. Joel Weinstock at Iowa, University of Iowa, took six people, elderly people with inflammatory, chronic inflammatory bowel syndrome. And it's a very painful disease. It, you know, like Crohn's it causes swelling of the joints and very painful all over the place. And he took the whipworm from the intestines of a pig, got their eggs and put it in Gatorade and gave it to these six suffering individuals. And five of them got the worm. And all of the symptoms disappeared for five months. They didn't change their diet or anything. All they had was the worms. And then after five months they were back on his door wanting more parasites. That's the only clinical study I know by an M.D. who's done it.

Q: What's his name?

A: Joel Weinstock, Iowa, University of Iowa.

Q: What was that swelling called again?

A: The what?

Q: Swelling of the joints.

A: Crohn's. But it's an intestinal problem. And the body doesn't digest right so toxic proteins leave the intestines and get into the blood and cause swelling in the joints and severe pain and cripple. It's a very, very bad disease, inflammatory bowel disease. Yes?

Q: So I presume you don't have any other options? [unintelligible] After all this.

A: You could drink some Drano. See what happens.

Q: I've been having a problem keeping the smell in the jar, even in the refrigerator. Is there a trick or something that I should do?

A: Get a small refrigerator.

Q: A new cap on each jar?

A: Yeah, I would put a new one on each jar or get a small... I have clients who are getting small refrigerators just for that, you know. And they keep it in the garage or something. Not in the house. I had the same problem. Yes?

Q: I have a friend who had been an operating room nurse. And we were always into [unintelligible]. And we were dealing with getting rid of parasites at the time. So she would say, well, what's happened? Because every time they have an operation, everybody is filled with parasites. And she would always wonder why.

A: Why? Because they keep eating foods that are damaging the body. And making an environment that's rich for them.

Q: But it kind of answers your question. We all have them. She was very aware that everybody has them.

A: Absolutely. And they're the best friends they can have. They're the best operation you can do. Okay, let's get into some food combining. Now, we talked about the indigestibility of vegetables. Oh, everybody get up and stand and stretch. Good idea, Jerry.

[audio cut]

A: All right, so we were talking about high meat. And somebody asked me, can you eat too much high meat? I don't know. Probably the eight ounces that I ate at that one time of that very aggressive stage was too much. I don't think I would do that extreme, force that extreme of a detoxification at any particular point. But people who have consumed, you know, like a marble size to a golf ball size amount every couple of days has never been too much. You have to understand that part of the bacteria is going to be destroyed by hydrochloric acid in the stomach. So how much is actually getting through depends upon how much is absorbed in the mouth before you even swallow. The girl that I was telling you about that had this temper, she would chew it. She chews it until it's completely absorbed, until it melts in her mouth. She will keep it in her mouth because it works. It gets into the brain everywhere quicker. So she will completely chew it. If she doesn't chew it like that, she doesn't get as good effect. That way she has to eat more. She'd rather eat less and get better quality. So she will chew every bit of it. Gordon also reminded me that when I was talking about solvents, I didn't complete that area. Other things that can be used as solvents as you use bacteria, high meat, is pressed oils. Not only coconut cream, but flax oil and olive oil that's pressed below 96 degrees Fahrenheit. 90% of that will become solvent reactive in the body. I can make some people detox too quickly with the turpentine-like substance accumulating too much. So it depends upon how you react with it. Most people can handle 2 ounces a day every 2 to 3 days, always with a meat meal. If you have it with egg and with a fruit, you're asking for a detoxification that will tear your system apart. You're going to be asking for some symptoms that you may not like. So always eat the oil with beef or any kind of meat. And rotate it. That's what I have people do. If you have it with beef every time, you may cause too much of a certain variety of the byproducts, like the turpentine substance in one part of the body. If you have it with one day, you have it two ounces with beef. Two or three days later, you have it with fowl. And two or three days later, you have it with fish. You rotate. I had a woman who has nose cancer. She came to me about a year and three months ago, and a third of her nose was gone. She had had radiation therapy before she came to me and had been on a macrobiotic diet for a year and was doing miserably. And the cancer on her nose was spreading so quickly, they said it was going to take all of her bone. So they wanted to go in and remove all of her skull, all of her face, bone, and put in a plastic prosthesis. So I said, Barbara, whatever dissolves, dissolves. Don't let them take it. Don't assume that they're right.

So a year and three months on the diet, the nose has only gone by half, and now new tissue has already regrown by an eighth of an inch in the last few months. So the nose is already starting to grow here, it's still deteriorating, and the cartilage here and down, but all that was going back has now receded and is growing back this way. Now she read an article about this man who had had nose cancer like hers, basal cell cancer, and he had used the flax oil and his cancer had stopped within months of using the flax oil. I said, well, you have to understand the principle. It's a solvent, it will react solvent-wise, so in your situation, because you had the radiation therapy, it might dissolve too much too quickly. But you can try it and see. So she did it and sure enough she said within 48 hours it had become aggressive like it was before she went on the diet. It started melting the nose away quickly, so she immediately stopped it. So you just have to be careful when you're forcing detoxifications. With the high meat, I don't know that it can be too much unless you do what I did. With solvents, even a little bit can be too much. So spread it out. If you're healthier, you may be able to take it. Fine, it may not be a problem. Okay, food combining. No vegetable juice with any other foods except for neutral fats which are butter, cream, coconut cream. Only three kinds of foods that you can have with vegetable juice. Wait an hour after you finish with the juice or an hour before any other food before or after vegetable juice and after having any other food. An hour, either side. The reason for that is vegetable juices are alkaline. You put vegetable juice in your stomach it's going to alkalinize your stomach. The stomach has to be acid for any kind of animal product to digest properly. The hydrochloric acid will be neutralized with vegetable juice. If you wait a solid hour after you have a vegetable juice before you eat any other food that's a good amount of time. It takes 20 minutes to absorb that vegetable juice. If you have cream in it it may take 45 to 50 minutes. And it takes another 20 minutes to alkalinize the stomach. If the first thing you have and I always recommend that people start the day with vegetable juice they wait 45 to 50 minutes before they have meat. That is the only time because you've gone through a long night without food you're going to absorb and re-acidify that stomach about 15 minutes faster. 15 to 20 minutes faster than any other part of the day after vegetable juice. So you can eat meat within 45 to 50 minutes after vegetable juice the first time of the day. Or if you've gone let's say 5 or 6 hours without eating which I don't recommend but if you do then you could wait only 45 minutes after drinking vegetable juice before you have meat or eggs or milk. Okay, now in the book I talk about having eggs with juices and milks, I mean juices with with egg, even vegetable juices, but I found over the long run that's another slight thing that will change in the book.

That I found it causes too much detoxification, makes too many solvents and it impairs digestion of the protein. So what I've found is that some of the proteins when you mix vegetable juice and the egg together, that some of the protein is getting into the blood without proper digestion because you've alkalinized it with the vegetable juice or fruit juice and the egg. So I've found that I get much better results when I tell people not to do that. Have their eggs with milk or cream or meat but not with fruit juice or vegetable juice or even with fruit. 

Q: So that would apply to powdered vegetables like a lot of people sell these green products which are...

A: Those again are like the herbs, they're poisonous. You have to understand that algae utilizes a lot of mercury and a lot of other heavy metals. So when you dehydrate it and then you put it in your body it's a free radical. So it works, it makes people feel better because it's poisoning the body, the blood. So then your body creates adrenaline and other hormones to deal with that poison but people get high on the adrenaline and the hormones and they think that they're better than and they're not. So it's actually poisoning and it's not a healthy reaction from it. And you're not, you're not a vegetarian and then they have it dehydrated you're going to be like a cow trying to eat dry matter. He can do it but not very well. You look at his fecal matter when he's eating hay, dry hay and a lot of, 50 percent of it, comes out undigested. And you put it in a human body which is mainly carnivore you know you're not going to digest much and that that you do get out of is going to be poison free radical metals. Other things for food combining it's always a good idea to have fat with meat. If you don't your body's going to convert a lot of the protein into an acetate which is a fat. Why make the body do that? If you're eating expensive meats you want them to turn into matter that will help you regenerate cells and become more alive. You don't want to waste your fats I mean your meats on making them into fats. Your protein making into fats. So I recommend that people have at least three tablespoons of fat with every meat meal. Preferably butter.

Q: Does coconut cream work?

A: Remember that coconut cream is about 60 percent solvent reactive. So it again it will help you get rid of certain, it'll make certain solvents that help get rid of certain kinds of decay that are in the body in inorganic substances but you don't want to do it all the time. Avocados often will do the same thing, it'll turn the protein into a fuel not a fat but a fuel. I mean if you really need high energy it's a good combination. That would be meat and avocados. Yes or a lot of sexual energy.

Q: Would you consider oils to be a source of good fat or just?

A: No, I said they're 90 percent solvent reactive so you're going to have that only once a day every couple of days unless I see that there's a condition in the body that needs a lot more olive oil. Let's say somebody was in bad shape and they had multiple sclerosis. I would suggest that they eat olive oil or flax oil every day once a day with a different meal every day. So, to get through it quicker to reverse it.

Q: Meat, would butter be the best.

A: Butter, eggs and milk. Yes.

Q: So you can overdo it with avocados in the same way as the oils or are they not quite as...

A: You can overdo it because the liver has a difficult time with avocado. Most people's liver. Avocados are difficult to digest.

Q: So every day is too often?

A: Depends on what you're eating.

Q: Every meal is too often?

A: Definitely.

Q: Okay.

A: Yeah, definitely. I do recommend if people have had lots of radiation therapy or been exposed to radioactive materials that they eat half to a whole avocado a day with a small orange to help get rid of the radiation. Like the woman with the nose cancer, you know, she had quite a 10, 12, 15 weeks, I think, of radiation therapy. Right aimed right in her brain, you know. So I have her eating, you know, it more often than I would suggest normally for people, just to help get rid of it. But I made her wait a whole year before I did that because I needed her to stabilize first. And let's see, it was almost, it was about three and a half months. I see her about every three months. And the rate of, the amount of radiation that was discharged in that three and a half months period was more than I've ever seen. Quite good. And she was able to withstand it because I gave her a year to get healthy enough. I used to just go right in and do that and they would get nauseous all the time and get them off of the diet. I've learned that you have to finesse the body as well as the person. Works better. Yes.

Q: So if you eat meat and you have one egg, is that okay then? If you don't have the butter?

A: Yeah, that's better. Yes, it's fine.

Q: But the ultimate would be the butter.

A: Yes.

Q: And how much?

A: Three tablespoons.

Q: Oh, that's right.

A: Yes.

Q: Is there an additional difference between regular ground meat and [unintelligible] meat?

A: Yes. Anything that's dehydrated lose enzymatic activity. That means you're going to assimilate and utilize a lot less of the protein, the fat, anything that's in it. As your body's going to have to go in, the pancreas will generate hormones, synthesize hormones, send it out to every cell in the body to tell it to give up some of its innate vitamins, enzymes, minerals, proteins, carbohydrates, and fats to go in there and digest the food. It isn't as bad as cooked food because in cooked food you have all the byproduct toxins that are formed from cooking like heterocyclic amines and lipid peroxides. Dried meat you don't have that, but still you're lacking the vitamins and enzymes in it.

Q: So what about for backpacking? I want to go backpacking and it'll be rather tough to pack heavy raw meat.

A: Just eat yourself. No, it's fine when you're doing that. I mean the American Indians, North American Indians like in Alaska and Canada, they used to make pemmican and they would dry the meat into jerky and then beat it into a mince and then roll it in blubber and let it sit in the sun. The sun would allow the meat to lipidize itself. In other words, instead of being hydrated, because meat is anywhere from 55-60% water. That's why when you dry meat it'll be this big and then this big when it's dried. So it's like 55-60% sometimes even higher in water, depending upon the animal. If it's a wild deer, it's only about 55% water. If you're getting a domesticated animal, cow, it can be 40-60-70% water. So what they would do is they would make this pemmican and they could take a 90-pound block and they could go all the way across from the Pacific Ocean to the Atlantic Ocean on one brick, one 90-pound brick of this pemmican. And they would eat about half a cup of it a day and drink water. You know, like 3 or 4 or 5 cups of water. And they would go constantly. But they would only do that periodically. They wouldn't do it regularly. So if you want to do it once in a while, you know, that's for your fun, that's for your activity.

Q: Yeah, I want to try that. Or maybe go fishing, eat some raw trout.

A: Well, that's not drying it.

Q: I've been searching for an ultimate pemmican recipe, and I got one from an Indian just a while ago. But the question I had, and I want to ask you this, is it's two-thirds dried meat like you said, but then to rehydrate it with some fats. They took the fats from the deer, cooked them, rendered them, and what floated to the top that cleans up, that's what they put back into the pemmican.

A: That's what they do now, but in the old days they would just let it sit in the sun.

Q: How do you feel about that though?

A: I think it's not good, because you've got lots of lipid peroxides in it.

Q: Then what would you choose to use for that one-third to rehydrate the meat?

A: Well you have to understand that the American Indians would make it every year just to make sure they could get through the winter if they had to. They never ate it unless they had to. They would bury it at the end of the year, the next season. As soon as late spring came along they would bury it. They would never eat it. They only ate it if they had to. It was an emergency food. And that was making it raw, that was without boiling it.

Q: Soaking in olive oil?

A: I've tried that, you know the deer we bagged out here and did that. I soaked it in olive oil and peanut oil when the peanut oil was good. And it never absorbed a bit of it. You have to beat it and mince it and you have to put it out in the sun again. And the sun damages pressed oils. It doesn't do that... I mean it turns animal fat bitter and sour, but it doesn't putrefy it. But sunlight will putrefy pressed oils. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, correct. Even though I have it in the book, well in the book I say never drink fruit juice. I said but you can blend it with you know like blend banana with eggs and stuff like that. I still think it's a transitional diet for people. It's a good thing. And that's why I'm not going to change some of that stuff in the book. Because it's a good transitional diet. And then as you're getting into the diet and get more refined, then it's eliminating a lot more of that fruit. Okay, eggs alone are much better than eggs mixed with other foods. For some reason when people eat, were eating lots of eggs with fruit, they would have more detoxification and more depression. And that's because it creates more solvent activity. When the eggs are raw by themselves, rocky style, they have a tendency to be similar to meat. They don't help regenerate cells but they will certainly help maintain cells that already exist. And that example that I gave, I think, before here was the woman who had emphysema. And her MD called me three years ago, last February, and said, got an emphysemic patient. She was diagnosed about seven years ago. She's been mostly bedridden for the past two years. She's on machines. If we shut off the machines, she will die. She's probably going to die this weekend. And this was a Thursday night, late. So her time, it was like eight o'clock my time, must have been 11 o'clock her time. I said, well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she said, well, I'm an MD. I have my practice to protect and my family's livelihood. I said, well, that's your conscience. But only thing I can suggest is you buy 10 or 15 dozen eggs, put them at her bedside and have her eat one as often as she can. So on Monday morning, I got a call from this woman with this raspy voice thanking me, you know. So she explained who she was, told me she ate 33 eggs a day over the weekend. So she had 66 eggs, was out of bed and off the machines, wanted to know if there was anything else she could do. 

Q: I have my eggs with milk, that seems to make me tired. Can you address that a little bit?

A: Because especially if you're not eating milk that's been out and ripe and warm and full of bacteria, if you go mixing cold milk with an egg, it's going to interfere with digestion so your body is going to want to go to sleep just like a baby and use all of its energy for digestion. And a lot of people are going to be affected with lethargy every time you have milk. Just like a baby, it's healing, it's soothing to the body. A baby grows, that's all it does is eat and grow, eat and sleep, and grow. And it does most of its growing in its sleep state. It gets its exercise and its detoxifying in its wake state. 90% of healing development, cellular development happens in the sleep state. So people who are very ill should nap more often. Should sleep more. I'm so healthy now and I've only been eating raw meat since on a daily basis, it'll be 20 years in December. And so I'm only halfway to what it takes to get to optimal health. I sleep four or five hours a day and that's it. I may go through a cycle where I need to sleep six to eight hours a day for, you know, four or five days at a time every few months. But that's it. And when I was so ill, I used to sleep 14, 16 hours a day. As a child, that's all I wanted to do. I slept through class. I slept all the time because I was so ill. Yes?

Q: So I've been making my milkshake with eggs and then a cream and milk. I generally haven't been warming up either the cream or the milk before I mix the eggs in. So would it be better if I were to let it go?

A: Much better because I've seen that when it's cold, it passes out of the duodenum before it's properly digested and undigested proteins from the milk get into the blood.

Q: And in terms of the eggs as well, I remember something that...

A: And that can cause a shock reaction that causes you to get sleepy.

Q: And with eggs as well, when I can't get the eggs directly from the farm where I get them, I sometimes do store-bought organic eggs. I generally let them sit for two or three days before I consume them.

A: So the bacteria will build up, yeah, and enzymes. Now you have to be careful with this organic when you're looking at eggs. Organic, I've found, is probably a bad signal for an egg. The organic farmers that I've questioned about their feed, feed it 75 to 80 percent processed, cooked soybeans. Who gives a shit if they're organic, you know? This is garbage, this is poison. You feed, you know, chickens will not eat raw soybeans because it will kill them, just like it will kill a human, raw. And processed, of course, you've got toxic heterocyclic amines. You have all those other hormone poisonings in the soy. So soy is basically a poison. So if you see organic in eggs, you make sure you give that manufacturer a call and find out what's in the feed. The same with our organic chicken down in Los Angeles called Rosy's. 75 to 80 percent processed soy is what they feed those. Because I called them, I said, you know, you're organic, it's great it's organic, but it always tastes like postage stamps to me. It's very bland, it has an odd taste. What do you feed it? Well, 75 to 80 percent great organic soy. I said, well you can't feed soy to a chicken without processing it. Yeah, it's processed. I said, then who cares if it's organic? So I went back to eating Rocky Junior's, which is 75 to 80 percent raw corn. And only about 20 percent processed soy.

Q: Are there any other brands?

A: I only know what we have down there.

Q: So basically you have to call someone.

A: Yeah, like we've got this farmer, Mark McAfee, to do his whole organic dairy raw. And just to keep getting into the products, we just need to find more farmers who are willing to go this route.

Q: So would you say it's better to find chickens that are 75 percent non-organic raw corn?

A: Absolutely. Absolutely. Because like I said, my experiments with animals, including me, when we ate inorganic meat, tested for the concentrations for pesticides and for hormones and inorganic fertilizer residues that were in the meat, and they were in the meat. When we checked the animals, some animals ate it raw. This was all the same animal that we were eating. All the same side of beef that was from one animal, the same animal. So we took different portions of the meat that were being eaten from all over the body, and then got the level of pesticide poisoning that was just in the muscle meat. We didn't use any bones for this or any glandular tissue. This was just the muscle meat. And some of the animals ate it cooked, some ate it raw, I ate it raw. And our fecal matter, when the byproducts came out, almost the same, almost 98% of all the residues that were in the raw meat passed out of us undigested. The fat molecules weren't even digested, their cell wall was barely fractured. So those poisons passed right through the body into the fecal matter and out of the body. So they weren't absorbed. However, in the animals who ate it cooked, very little of the residue, something like 6 or 7% passed out in their fecal matter. That means cooking it caused it to be free and absorbed into the body. Yes?

Q: What kind of residues were you looking at? Were you looking at hormones?

A: Like I said, I named them. We looked for hormones, we looked for inorganic fertilizers, we looked for pesticides, everything that's normal, even pollution, cadmium, high levels of cadmium from airborne pollution. And it all passed out. I lived 3 months out of the year in Paris for 3 years and I was eating out of Carrefour supermarkets. When my girlfriend broke up with me because I wouldn't marry her, I came across it the week that the thing broke up, the relationship broke up, I got an article that said that Carrefour supermarkets had been buying the mad cow meat. So I'd been eating mad cow meat that entire 3 year period. And I'm not too bad. And you know, thank God when I read that, I had already done the test, you know, about 3 years before. No, 6 years before. I had done the test 6 years before I had read the article. Because if I had read the article and, you know, not done that test, then I wouldn't know that those poisons probably most of them passed out of my system. So a balanced diet, yes.

Q: How about the raw eggs? How about eating it with unheated honey, blending it in a blender with unheated honey?

A: Okay, the problem with raw eggs when you blend them is that there are 3 enzymes in the egg white which is destroyed by oxygen. So when you whip the egg and it's directly exposed to air, oxygen, those oxidize. A Massachusetts scientist and researcher found that when those 3 enzymes were high in the blood, cancer could not progress. And the only place he could find it was in egg white, in that concentration. He said it was destroyed within seconds of whipping it. Unless than I did lab tests that showed that if you have milk or cream, something that coats it during blending, that doesn't happen. However, if you whip the egg with honey, it does it, because there's no fat there to coat it, protect it. Not a good thing.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: So you can blend the eggs when it's with some kind of other food that is fatty and will coat it immediately and then it has to be liquid. Like if you melt butter, you know, for the lubrication formula, I say leave the butter out so it's soft, because as soon as that blade goes on, that butter's already mixed with the egg white and prevents it from oxidizing. Yes?

Q: I have chickens and I eat mostly eggs and milk, and I feed them commercial food as well as vegetables from the garden and the restaurants, and they're good eggs. I don t know how bad it is to feed them the commercial food.

A: Don't do it.

Q: Don't do it at all.

A: Commercial food is always by-product of some other food manufacturing. It s always the garbage, literally.

Q: Do you replace it with wheatgrass sprouts?

A: Wheatgrass sprouts, well, chickens are omnivores. They can eat everything, so they can digest grains. If you give them too many grains, they re going to be over-emotional, just like, you know, and it's going to create, it s going to create a protein deficiency and cause them to start killing each other to eat each other. So, you need to give them meat scraps. All your meat scraps, you give them meat scraps. They love it. Ducks the same way. Ducks, you give ducks high meat, they will follow you forever. You know, if you walk near the door, they'll be there waiting for you. You just give them one time because they love high meat.

Q: So, if I had a leg of venison, I could cut it up in little pieces and put it out there.

A: You don't even have to do that. Just leave it there and they'll pick it off the, yeah, they'll just take it apart.

Q: Because the commercial food, they love it because it has high protein level. And I wanted to replace that. And I noticed that if I just, if I don't feed them that, they crave it really bad and they'll follow me all over the place. And then when I give it to them, they'll like stay down, the chicken can't. So I wanted to find another source.

A: Just meat. Meat scraps. You can go to a health food store and get their throwaway meat scraps, 50 cents a pound.

Q: And at the level of its decomposition, it doesn't matter for a chicken.

A: Chickens like ducks are scavengers and they love high bugs and, oh, they love it. Yeah. Yes.

Q: What would you consider to be the best store-bought egg source?

A: Well, I don't even have to deal with that because we've got somebody in Santa Barbara, Santa Isabella area, who has 10 acres who just lets the chickens run wild. So sometimes we'll get eggs that are old and rotten because they don't get discovered right away, but we like those high eggs too. They really excite the sexual, you know, people who want to get really horny. They just eat some of those high eggs and do very well.

Q: Does that?

A: Pardon?

Q: High energy food?

A: High eggs, meaning rotten eggs. Rotten. Black inside, white inside, stink awfully. Let me tell you, it gets you so excited. The Chinese call them century eggs and they bury them in clays and will keep them from 5 to 25 years. And the 25 year old egg, you open it, it's either all bacteria, white powder, or all black powder. Old wealthy men are the only people who can afford them because it's a thousand dollars an egg. And they can eat a few of those and go a whole month having several orgasms a day. And you're talking octogenarians? Can do that, yeah. So, you know, they love it. Yes?

Q: My question is just to the rest of the group. Is there anyone here who's called various places where you get eggs to find out what their chickens eat, like Chino Farms or any of these other things to know? Sometimes, I have a very limited supply of eggs. I have one woman on a farm I can get them from. I'm in a place where I can't raise my own chickens, and she runs out constantly because she only gets about two dozen a day from her chickens, and so I can't always get them. So, I tend to go to the store to buy them, but there s so many different brands, and I don't have enough time to research what they eat. Anybody with any experience?

A: We need this chicken farmer over here to start a big, big massive network.

Q: I want to produce eggs because I eat a lot of them, and I want to... 

A: You just go to those health food stores, and you make a deal with them, you know, because you can buy it by the bags, and just, you know, make sure that they're not putting Clorox around, and they're getting Clorox in the bag of meat, because they'll do that. And just buy the bags, you know, 25, 30 cents a pound. Boy, those chickens will be so healthy, those eggs will be so rich.

Q: What about bringing home roadkill, healthy deer roadkill, or something to feed the chickens?

A: Great. Yep, I almost got a raccoon on my way here. I looked at that and said, He just got hit. I can see him.

Q: Yeah, I sometimes bring home roadkill, not to eat, but to put out in the fields and watch the buzzards. My roommates, they are nuts, bringing home roadkill home. They'll stop by and drop off the roadkill for you, Chuck, right at your front door. It's like, Here's a gift for you, buddy.

A: Those chickens will love it.

Q: I want any birds out there too, so I let them run as much as they can. They still like that protein, that high protein.

A: Yeah, it's [unintelligible]. Go to a slaughterhouse, get whatever you want, because they'll eat everything. They won't eat much of the skin if it has a lot of hair on it, but they'll eat the cartilage, they'll break the bones apart, they'll just keep chipping away. I mean, if they're really big, hard, like femur joints, they may not eat it all because it's too hard for them. 

Q: But they'll pick it clean.

A: Yeah, they'll pick it clean, definitely. Yeah, if you break it up, then they'll eat it, shatter it. Okay, basically, I recommend, if you're high in energy and you re hyperactive, I recommend eating two meat meals a day. The reason for that is, is when you're high activity like that, you eat three meat meals a day, you burn it up. And nothing's left for you to regenerate cells very easily. So I suggest two larger meals of meat, so it takes you much longer to digest it. And that way your body has more than it needs for fuel, so then most of it will turn, a lot of it will turn into protein for regenerating cells for healing. People who are low in energy, they need to eat smaller meals, meat meals, that digest quicker. So I recommend three meat meals a day. And usually the best cycles that I've found is juice, meat, a milkshake or eggs by themselves, juice, meat unless you're a hyperactive person and don't have meat at that time. Have another milkshake or have, if you have a high metal problem in your body or you want to use some solvent stuff, have, you know, like some whipped cream or raw cream with some fruit or some coconut cream with some fruit at that time. If you're having three meat meals, then you have the juice, then you have the meat and then you have that fruit meal with the fat. Then wait at least an hour and have another juice, then another meat meal and then a lube formula or another milkshake or just eggs and another juice before you go to bed.

[audio cut]

A: It is the safest and those are the most progressive eating patterns that I've seen and they work for almost everyone. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Juice, meat, eggs or milkshake or if you're very dry, lubrication formula. Like you, I would have you eating, you know, make a big batch of lubrication formula and eat it with three times a day. 

Q: Like with butter.

A: Well, the lubrication formula, depending upon the person, is usually one to two eggs, three to four ounces of butter, one to two tablespoons of lemon juice and one to three teaspoons of honey. If all those are room temperature, when you blend them together, it will be a very creamy, taste like a lemon meringue drink. 

Q: Can you say those one more time?

A: One to two eggs, three to four ounces of butter, one to two tablespoons of lemon juice and one to three teaspoons of honey. So, after you have the meat meal, you either have a milkshake or eggs by itself or a lubrication formula. For somebody who is hyperactive and thin, I recommend that you load that protein up with a fat, so you don't burn that meat, so you keep it for stabilizing and strengthening the body. Let me give you an example. I had a fellow who was eating for one to three pounds of meat a day. He's about six foot tall, very slender from the waist down and a nice size shoulder. He said he's been on a diet for two years, feels great, loves it. And he said, you know, I'm thinking about bodybuilding. What do you think? And I said just eat, you know, a lubrication formula every time you eat meat. So he did it two and a half months later, he came back with six inches on his chest and four inches on his arms. Solid muscle. And he says, I'm getting accused of using hormones, you know, steroids. He says they don't have... I tell them and they don't believe me. He said, I've even cut my meat down to three quarters of a pound a day with my lube formula and I'm still building muscle. Because you're not burning up the meat. You're utilizing the fats to burn up and keeping the muscle to build the tissue.

Q: So a lube formula would be better than just eating straight more fat with it?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Just using your butter.

A: Because the lube, the reason I devised it that way is I wanted to find a way to get fats deep into the tissues because the organs and glands and basically the structure of the body is so dry and deficient from being on a cooked diet for all of your life and not having raw fats. It's so hungry for fats. You will get them and use up and you can never eat enough to get to the skins and bone or connective tissue. I would eat tons, I would eat like a quart of raw cream and two to three sticks of butter a day and my skin would still be dry. So my body was using it and I was getting bigger but my skin was still dry and my nails were still cracking. So I needed to devise a way to get fats predigested or pre-broken down so they would rush into the system and the whole body couldn't absorb it. A little bit at a time, there would be so much flushed into it that the immediate areas couldn't absorb all of it so it would get spread out to the whole system. Because when you eat your cream and butter by itself, it digests slowly and it gives out a little at a time and those hungry buggers are just like orphans. The orphans who get there and get the food, get the food and those who are in the back don't get it. Unless it's more than they can consume and that's what the lube does. It gets so much fat into the system so rapidly that not all the cells can absorb it before it gets all the way out to the outer tissues of the body. Yes?

Q: If you don't have butter and need to make a lube formula, is cream or coconut cream acceptable?

A: It will not do the same. It won't do it. The coconut cream is close, maybe by 50%, but the cream won't do it. 

Q: So you can't make butter from cream.

A: Yes. That's easy. Let's go over that very quickly. When you're making cream, cream into butter, if you do it the normal way where you have to churn it and do all that, it takes a lot of time. It has to be a certain temperature. If you want butter in a minute, take a canning jar like this. If you want a larger one, take the 12-ounce, but don't go any larger than these two sizes, 8-ounce or 12-ounce jars. Screw the blender blades on top after you put the cream in, a half inch from the top. That's the trick. If you put it down here, let's say you put 6 ounces of cream in here, guess what? When it comes into whipped cream, it stops. It won't go any further. It'll just stop at whipped cream. Then when you don't give it enough room to expand as much as it normally would, it keeps the force, the centrifugal force going. So it keeps it spinning. And then you watch it, all of a sudden you'll see it go gray. You know, this will be upside down. Let s all dry it in there. You go upside down and you'll just see this start going gray up here. And then it'll go a different color. And then it'll go another color. And then when you stop it, you can just pull it off the whey. That quickly. Less than a minute and you have butter. And you don't even have to press it. Press it out. Well, when you open it, it's completely separated. You just pour it out. The whey will just separate.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Probably 40 seconds? Probably 40 seconds. That quickly.

Q: You just put the cream in the jar...

A: No, you put on the blender blades. If you have an osterizer blender, you have the washer, you have the blades and the black base. When you're using a big bowl and somebody asks me about this, I think you asked me about using a Vitamix to make juice. If you're using the big bowl with a blender, you're destroying your nutrients in your food. It pulls air down into it. The oxygen destroys up to 20-30% of your nutrients just in the blending. When you use it in the jars, you take that washer, you put it on top of the jar first. Put the washer on top. Put the blades inside and on top of that. Make sure that they're even around. Take the black base, screw that on, turn it upside down and blend it. Guess what? No more air gets in there while you're blending. Preserves sometimes 20-30% of your nutrients because it's isolated. It's hermetically sealed while it's blending and you don't lose all the electrolytes even though it may be metal blades in there. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, I do it. Anytime I blend anything it's never in that bowl where the air is sucked down into it. I always use jars. I have quart jars. I have pint jars. I have 8-ounce, 12-ounce and 4-ounce jelly jars. And the osterizer will always fit on top. Sometimes the washer that comes with it is too thin and you need to buy one that's thicker. Go to a hardware store or a small appliance store and get a thicker washer. Or what you can do is what some people do, just to make sure, they ll put a washer on, the blades on top, another washer on top of that before they screw it on.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Me sidetrack? Okay, so you do juice, meat, eggs, or milkshake, or lube formula. If you're doing the lube formula, like for somebody who's over hyperactive and very thin, make sure that you eat lots of fat with that meat meal. So you don't have to put a space in between the fat or the other, you know, the eggs or the lube formula, the milkshake from the meat. Eat them together. When you're thin like that, you want to eat more food at one time because you digest too fast and you utilize everything too fast. So if you make it hard for the body to digest by giving it too much at one time, then you'll be able to utilize it other than burning it up. Then you have a juice again and then for those people who are having three meat meals a day, you have another meat meal with some fat and then next you have a fruit or not, fruit with some kind of fat. Usually we need about 5% of our diet, we need carbohydrates. I eat very little fruit anymore and I mainly eat so much honey that I get my 5% from my honey. No, I mean honey in the jar, not honey love. I'm diabetic so I find that I do better without fruits that are high in carbohydrates. I eat lots of tomatoes though and that seems to quench my thirst a little bit better. And then you have another juice and then for some people it will be their second meat meal, for other people it will be their third meat meal with lots of fat at that meal or weight and I recommend everybody have lubrication formulas either with that meat meal or in the evening and if you don't have time making it, no matter whatever you're doing, you can always down three eggs. Do it Rocky style, break it into a glass and down them or like I do, use an eye tooth to poke a hole in both ends and then suck it out. That's ultimate fast food.

Q: Yeah, I wanted to ask you about water and what's the rationale for not drinking much water and with respect to mineral water, if it's carbonated, isn't CO2 like a waste, a waste product of breathing and respiration? So wouldn't we be taking like bad shit into our bodies?

A: Not all, you know, byproducts, it's like saying, well, should we not eat shit because it's a byproduct? You know, it has benefits. The carbon when it's formed like that creates, what is it called? It's a chemical that helps cleanse the body. It's what people use sometimes to clean their foods with, hydrogen peroxide. Makes good hydrogen peroxide in the body as long as it's a natural carbon that comes from the well. Now, and also, you want to finish the pattern, another juice before you go to bed. Okay, water. Water has no nutrient value. Water helps dissolve compounds. It's a solvent. It leaches. It's like a black hole. It will pull stuff out and break it down. That's why when it rains it dissolves rock and soil so that plants can eat. When you put it in the body it will dissolve your intestines and your digestive juices and your bacteria. It will dissolve it all. That's why people who eat, drink 2 gallons of water a day cannot put on weight. They don't digest their food and they deteriorate very rapidly. There's these fads going on where women are drinking 2 gallons of water a day to lose weight. But what happens when they stop doing that after 4 or 5 years of doing that? They can't digest anything anymore. They're ruined unless they go on a good diet and they have to rebuild. Water leaches. That's its property. It leaches. It makes certain substances fluid. We don't need that in the body. We need nutrients. Like I said, the meat that you eat, at least 55% water. Tomatoes, 96% water. Milk, 96-97% water. It's all electrolyte bound, all ionically bound. And when your cells go to utilize the H2O, how does it do it? By ion attraction. There are 1-2 ions inside of every cell. That's the stomach, it's guts. So when an ion passes, and it's electrolyte bound, ionically bound, it carries other foods with it. Carbohydrates, proteins, fats. Guess what happens? The cell will open up and attract it in and it eats. If you have no nutrients in it and you've got heavy metals going around and they clump, guess what happens? Just like having high salt in your diet causes clumping of ions. So what happens when the cell opens up to magnetically attract that substance to get nourishment, the magnetism on the outside of the cell is so great that it pulls the ions out of the stomach of the cell and the cell can never eat again and it shrivels up and dies. Water does that. It dehydrates the system. The cells cannot utilize the H2O so it keeps fluid in the serum of the blood so you have bloating but no H2O utilization cellularly. 

Q: I pack an ice chest with me. I've been on the diet for a couple of years now. I have a little problem though, I'll pack my milk and my green drink but I need to drink a lot of water because I'm really active and I sweat a lot sometimes when I work. So this thing about doing the green drink an hour before the milk, well, if I'm drinking the green and I need something to drink between that hour span...

A: Butter, butter. Just remember, your dehydration, your taste for water has been, you've gotten a bad conditioning. You do not go for water. If I get thirsty, really thirsty, I go for butter or I go for coconut cream or I go for cream. I never go for water and I don't go for milk. I go for butter when I get that kind of thirsty, especially if it's in between that hour, you know, between milk and vegetable juice, vegetable juice and milk.

Q: Would butter be better than water, milk or green juice?

A: Absolutely. But if you have to drink vegetable juice and if you're thirsty in between that hour and drinking something else, you know, don't have the lubrication formula because you have egg in it. Just have butter or cream. Butter or cream goes with either way, either side. It'll go with milk and it'll go with vegetable juice.

Q: When you're thirsty, you can get down butter?

A: Oh God, yes. It's the best thing. It coats the mouth and all of a sudden, that instant thirst. You can drink milk. You can drink two quarts of milk and still be thirsty. Because you can't absorb it quickly. But the fats, that's really what the cells are needing. They're needing fats, not water, not H2O. If your body really needed the H2O, you wouldn't piss out as much as you drink. But you do. Because it can't absorb it. Fat is what the cells need. That's why they're thirsty. But they're thirsty for lipids. They're not thirsty for H2O. Plenty of that.

Q: If I do extreme work outside, doing my forestry work, how can I avoid drinking water? Because I drink water. It's like, right now, I have to.

A: Look how much water you have stored in your tissues and it's not in your cells. You don't have to. You just have to eat more fats. Lots of lubrication formulas, lots of butter, lots of cream.

Q: Take that to work instead of water.

A: No. Let's say you have water. No. Let's say you have a quart of water. If you had three ounces of butter, that would satisfy your body more than a whole quart of water.

Q: Wow. I'm extremely thirsty, like you were saying. If you were extremely thirsty.

A: Extremely thirsty, you go for butter or lubrication formula.

Q: Wow.

Q: And that'll take care of the physical sensation.

A: Oh my God. Yeah, it gets rid of it very easily. And there's also the relaxation. When you drink water, 15-20 minutes later, you're thirsty for more water. And it's addictive, it's a vicious cycle. You can't absorb it. The cells cannot absorb it unless it's ionic and electrolyte bound with some other nutrient. It's valueless.

Q: What about animals though? Why do they drink water?

A: The only animals that drink a lot of water are camels, because they've adapted to it by being in the desert. Most birds will gargle with water and spit it out. They don't drink much, but they eat a lot of grain, dry grain. So when they eat dry grain, they will drink more water. But there's always a relationship between that. But most animals don't drink water. You know, it's like a horse. You can be out in the desert and you've ridden them for how many miles and you can't get them to drink the water? A horse knows better.

Q: Chickens. I feed them water. I put the water in a galvanized water feeder. I don't know if that's good either because if I leave the water in there for more than two days, I think I taste the metal in the eggs. And I don't know if that's me or...

A: Better to get, you know, some concrete thing that's cured and just let it sit in there and get the mold on it and everything just like a pond.

Q: So you'd get rid of the metal container?

A: Absolutely.

Q: What about plastic?

A: No, you've got dioxins and phthalates.

Q: Stainless steel?

A: Stainless steel's okay, but it's not like... Stainless steel won't grow bacteria and molds like concrete will. Or clay, you know? Glass is okay, but still it's a fired substance that's not porous like, you know, cement and rock and clay. You know, those help produce bacteria and life, algae.

Q: Like a rock fountain or something?

A: Yeah, well like a birdbath, you know, a huge big birdbath.

Q: I'm training for a marathon. What do I do?

A: Can't get into that here, that's too much. I just want to let you know, though, that I've got quite a few athletes on this diet. I got a letter from one of them who came in number 6 just last month in the 6th in the world martial arts competition, 57 years old. When he started the diet, he does jump ropes 3 days a week as part of his workout. First time he'll do like 2,500 or 2,500 jumps with a 2 or 3 pound rope. Thousands of jumps that is. The next time he does 7,500 and the next time in that same week he does 12,500 at one time. His heart rate before he started the diet when he finished the workout was around 180-190. After a year on the diet it's down to 120. Can you imagine doing 12,500 jump ropes at one time and your heart rate being only 120? Pretty amazing. When I did exercise 20 years ago, 22 years ago, I used to run 7 to 13 miles a day and the last time I did that 13 mile run my heart rate was 98 when I finished that 13 mile run. The amount of breath that I took, you know most people do like this when they're running, my rate was down to 5 breaths a minute. Completely controlled on this diet. It's just amazing what you can do and build up. Okay, those are the basics. Now we need to start getting into people's individualities. I understand we have 25 people. I have 25 people to read, no? How many? Okay, about 10. Okay, now someone said they had to leave early.

Q: Carol.

A: Carol, okay.

Q: When you describe juice, earlier we talked about the greens aren't good for you, so what kind of juice?

A: No, no, vegetables, whole vegetables aren't good for you. Vegetable juice is. See, you don't have the pulp going down and destroying the intestinal environment. Vegetable juice, like 60% celery, 20% parsley is the best, I mean 80% celery, 20% parsley is a good base.

Q: You're not talking about wheatgrass?

A: No, wheatgrass like I said in the book, oh you haven't read the book, turns acid in the blood and the whole point of vegetable juice is to keep the blood alkaline because of all the acid foods and the toxins that are produced in blood that has been toxic from our toxic body.  

Q: The juice without the fibers?

A: Correct, so what will happen is you'll digest and absorb most of the juice, the vegetable juice, right in the duodenum so it doesn't affect the intestinal tract.

Q: So you'd stay away from wheatgrass juice?

A: Yes.

Q: Is there any way you can alkaline it?

A: No. I used it with milk to see if it would help growth hormones and you know it helps stir growth hormone activity and I did it for about a year and a half and didn't really do much. I mean there's signs of a little bit. But I'd use three ounces of wheatgrass juice with 27, 28 ounces of milk.

Q: What about alkalinizing your body with apple cider vinegar and honey mixture?

A: No. It doesn't have all the vitamins and enzymes in it and basically the apple cider vinegar is all on an acid side. So it's good for the digestive tract and it does help the blood go alkaline, but there's not much vitamins and enzymatic activity in vinegar. In fact it destroys a lot of bacteria.

Q: Raw organic ACV with unheated honey?

A: But still there's sugar in it and there's not a balance of your vitamin E and all of that that's in vegetables. Since we have all of those free radicals and toxins in the body you need that vitamin E, you need those anti-free radicals. Chlorophyll and all of that.

Q: How can you get the benefit of the vegetable juices without spending too much time juicing through the green life or other juicers that take a long time?

A: Yeah, but you just make it for three or five days at a time. You make a big batch for the whole time. Now I tell people three days because they're not as meticulous as I am. I will spend an extra twenty minutes bottling my juice perfectly. So it will last up to five days. And what that means is that when I juice, I can juice a whole, you know, a vast amount, like a gallon and a half at a time. And then I will take a twelve ounce jelly jar, like this without the meat in it, and I will put about four ounces of juice in it, and about seven ounces of honey. Screw the blender blades on top and I'll blend it. That thins the honey, because I'm going to use it as a preservative. Then I pour it into the rest of the juice. I usually use a gallon, one gallon empty honey jar and an empty half gallon honey jar. And I'll put the proportion that goes into the gallon to the proportion that goes into the half gallon. And I'll stir it. That's my preservative. Then I will take, sometimes I know that I will need twelve ounces at a time, but most of the time I need eight ounces at a time. So I will fill the appropriate number of jars. Now there's always foam that comes to the top. I always make sure that when I make the juice, the juice is the next thing I'm going to eat. Because when the foam comes up to the top, I can cut a lot off and put it in a separate jar. But when it comes to making sure that there's just a low level of foam at the top, maybe only a few bubbles, I make it so it bubbles just over the top of the lid of the jar. And I'll curl my tongue and I'll suck just the right amount off of it. So when I put that lid on, turn it sideways, I've got about a half a teaspoon of air in there and that's it. And it will last me four to five days. Most people aren't that meticulous and don't want to do that with their tongue in each jar, so they'll get a whole tablespoon of air in there or more. It's only going to last three days that way.

Q: You'll get more buzzy.

A: It's good for cleansing, but I think it's better, you need more vitamins, active, nurturing vitamins than you do need more cleansing. But it is a good thing to eat some aged vegetable juice, because you have lots of cooked vegetables in your body that don't have the bacteria and that's like high juice and it will aid that part of your body, get rid of some old toxic cellulose that you ate and it's stored in the body.

Q: So the oxidation products in the juice are actually ok, I was under the assumption that when the juice got spoiled there might be free radicals that might be harmful, so that's not the case?

A: No, not unless you cook it, not unless you pasteurize it.

Q: So the funky, sort of not very great tasting raw juice every once in a while is not a bad thing?

A: That's correct, in fact I do it purposely sometimes.

Q: Also don't throw it out.

Q: And if it gives me a headache, is that a sign of a detox then?

A: Yes.

Q: Ok, got it.

Q: I have two questions, the first one is do almonds have any nutritional value?

A: Ok, almonds are very difficult nuts to digest. Some people say well if I soak them it destroys the enzyme inhibitor. It just produces a different enzyme inhibitor. When a nut or a seed is whole and dry, it has enzyme inhibitors in it, which means that you won't digest proteins from 24 to 48 hours after eating your nut or seed. When you germinate it, by soaking it, you've just created another form of enzyme inhibitor which is from a sprout. Not a good way to do it. So I came up with the nut formula, and that's you have three to four to five, depending upon your size, three to five ounces of nuts. The nuts that are easiest to digest are walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, filberts, sunflower seeds, and sometimes pumpkin seeds. Filberts are the most difficult of those. Pine nuts can be too detoxifying for some people's nervous systems. So that may be difficult for them. The safest ones are the walnuts and pecans and sunflower seeds.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Difficult to digest for the liver and may cause a gallbladder or spleen detoxification. Maybe too radical. And you take that amount of nuts and you blend it. I put it into either the eight ounce or 12 ounce jelly jar. You know, it's like if you had four ounces, it would be half of this jar. And then once you blend them into a powder, this will rise and then you have about six ounces of nuts, unless you press it down. And what I do is I add, if I'm putting one egg in, I'll just use this, if I'm putting two eggs in, I'll use the 12 ounce instead of the eight ounce jelly jar. And then I add about three ounces of honey and blend it. No, it's three ounces of butter and two tablespoons of honey. Three ounces of butter, two tablespoons of honey. And that's, the honey, the egg, with the nuts, inhibits the enzyme inhibitors. And that's just what I wanted to do, yes, and it's delicious. And I do recommend that people have that once a week, that the body needs starch, and that's another thing in the book. I can get rid of the cooked starch for most people. I found the, you know, came up with the nut formula to do what the starch needs to do, and that's to bind with neurological poisons. Every time you've had a traumatic experience in your life, there are certain hormonal byproducts which occur in the system. And according to Elnora Van Winkle, who was a neurological biochemist with New York Medical Center University, University Medical Center, whatever it's called, she cataloged those poisons and found that on any person they will detoxify at certain times. They store in the tissues and if they detoxify, you will have emotional experience that will be very similar to those times when you had the trauma. She said when she was cataloging people's blood, you know, like one lady was angry at her husband and when she was questioned, it was very much, she started bringing up the things that her father did and it had nothing to do with the husband because he didn't do anything. Whoops, here's the [unintelligible] again. Hello. He hadn't done anything. So she realized that they were connected with that experience with the father and sure enough she found those residual hormones that are creating during trauma high in her blood at that time. She was doing it. She wrote a paper called the Biology of Emotions and if you put that on a web search you'll come up with that article. She's written it both for the technical person and for the layman so there are two ways you can read it. Very technical with all the biochemical terms and science and all that and then one just easy layman terminology. So the nut formula helps bind with those, so you won't suffer those flashbacks as much. And if you're going through them you might have up to two a week, but you have to be careful because that nut formula can cause a neurological detoxification. And if that happens it'll be very difficult to sleep between the hours of 12.30 at night to 5.30 in the morning and if you try to sleep at those times and you can't, you're going to be very disappointed and upset. If you're going through that kind of a neurological detoxification it's best to find something you like to do, work at that time, write, paint, doesn't matter, dance, just make that time active so you're not disappointed and angry and upset and then sleep right at 5.30 to 7 or 7.30, do your normal day if you have regular routine when you get home, take an hour to do whatever you need to do and then go to sleep.

Then when you wake up between midnight and 2.30 in the morning you'll have had plenty of sleep and then when you're up at those hours that you're up you'll have something to do and then things will go smoothly. People who stress out because they think they need to sleep at particular hours and their body's not going to allow it, you're in trouble. In the neurological system it takes about 5 hours, 4 to 5 hours after the sun goes down before it can go into that state and then it stays in it for about 5 hours. 

Q: How long does a neurological detox take? 

A: Depends on the individual? I've got several clients right now who are waking up between 2 and 3.30 in the morning and then are able to go back to bed, sleep at 5.30 in the morning. One of them has been going through it for 3 weeks, another one's been going on for 6 weeks and one of them's been going on it for only 10 days. It all depends. I've had that last sometimes for 5 months but I had lots of neurological damage because of the radiation. 

Q: Do the nuts perpetuate the neurological release or do they minimize it? 

A: They will perpetuate it if you have too much, have it too much too often.

Q: If you have nuts too much?

A: Even the nut formula. You can have the nuts by themselves and cause it one time because the enzyme inhibitors that will prevent you from utilizing protein could cause a terrible neurological detox.

Q: So eating a lot of, say, almonds with honey would be a strong detox, right?

A: Yes. But because you won't be able to digest proteins for a while, you're not going to get rid of those toxins. You're going to stir them up and they're just going to re-embed in your system and cause more damage. That's the problem.

Q: Okay. Because I find myself drawn to almonds and honey. So you would say, like, eat those things with them, give yourself... 

A: Have them with the butter. Have the butter in it. So if you're going to detox, if you're going to eat that and detox, you'll have the butter there to arrest those poisons.

Q: I don't have access yet to a quality butter. Is there, like, another fat that would...

A: Coconut cream.

Q: Maybe olive oil or something?

A: Olive oil... You're asking for trouble. It's a solvent. 90% solvent reactive.

Q: So, what would happen if I did do the olive oil?

A: You could cause yourself to go into fatigue for a while. Start vomiting, diarrhea. Cause all kinds of things. Neurological problems. You could find yourself angry for no reason. I've seen it. I don't trust those kinds of detoxifications. I've seen people do that, go really gung-ho about it and destroy a relationship. A relationship they maybe had with their wife or girlfriend for 11-12 years and all of a sudden they go and do things like that, heavy on the detoxification, push it hard. They go through these traumatic emotional things and for them they're going through it so they have an understanding about it, but the person they're beating up in the meantime, you know psychologically or even physically, it destroys a relationship. So I don't tell anybody to push a neurological detoxification unless you're alone. You're living by yourself and not having to interact with many people. It's a big chance. So many people think they have control of it, especially the high adrenaline people. I get that a lot. They think, oh gung-ho, they'll do it and then in three months they've destroyed all their relationships. Yeah, but I feel so great. So what? What are you going to enjoy now? Yourself only, okay, if that's what you want. So you have to be careful. Yes?

Q: The coconut leftover after coconut cream, is that good for anything?

A: Great for chickens. Sometimes I used it to make cakes for children, get them to eat something better for them. You can take it, what I would do is take a fruit and blend it with some honey and make an icing. It also is a fill, so if you want it to be pretty, you use the lighter colored dates, but ones that have to be firm because you want the pectin to absorb the fruit to thicken it to make it like icing and as a binder for the coconut. So you put a little bit in with the coconut meat, you knead it and then press it together into a cake. Like one time I was in New York City and I did one with coconut, I mean with carrot pulp and one with coconut pulp and I made two smurfs. So I took blueberries and blended them with some very granulated honey dates, the color of honey, even when they're dry, especially when they're crystallized and I blended that together and made a blue icing. So I shaped these two cakes into smurfs and then coated them with the icing and the kids loved it. It was something I could give them that wasn't so bad. It may have been high in carbohydrates, but they were going to eat that anyway, but we just filled them up with ice cream.

Q: What kind of formula do you recommend for going out in the sun and enjoying the sun? I read something in the live food list that suggested three quarters portion of coconut flesh going through a champion juicer and papaya, one quarter papaya, blend it together in a blender, rub it on your skin. Have you done that?

A: I've experimented with everything. The problem with that is on some people it can cause a breakdown of toxins on the skin. One fellow, Tony Plana, who's in that series Resurrection Boulevard, I think it was on HBO, one of those. Anyway, back in the 80s when I had him put that on his face, he was not socially acceptable. It caused his skin to smell like vomit. And it would help break down of course all the scarring because he was heavily scarred from acne. And now he probably has a tenth of what he used to have. And it cleaned the scarring up wonderfully. However, he smelled like vomit all the time. So, you know, there's trade-offs.

Q: So, what do you recommend to put on your skin for going out for sun? I want to get out for sun.

A: Okay, I've got a new one. I just came up with one in the last six months and I've been using it for everything. You see the sun I have on my face? That's from thirty-five minutes in the sun one day last week. The new skin formula is one part each of coconut cream, butter, raw cream. It has to be that combination. Put the coconut by itself, you'll burn. Put the cream on by itself, you'll burn. Put the butter on by itself, you'll burn. So let's say you re making an eight ounce jar of it. You use two ounces of butter, two ounces of cream, two ounces of coconut cream, half a teaspoon of honey, and an eighth of teaspoon of royal jelly. Blend that together. The last time when I wanted to see if it worked as a tanning agent rather than a sunblock was I put it in the jar with the blades and everything, all the ingredients in it and immersed it in warm water so it all melted. Then I blended it and I only blended it for about twenty seconds. It worked wonderfully. This time when it solidified in the refrigerator it was more like a harder butter and not as creamy. When I would do it cold it would be like a face cream, like a commercial face cream. But when you do it warm like that it's more like a butter. It puts everything into more of a solid substance with very little air in it. It lasts longer that way and it was a great tanning agent. I did not burn at all.

Q: We made some.

[audio cut]

A: ...vine jasmines around them and they are in blossom right now. So I took about thirty buds, I mean the actual open flowers, still when they were very bright and full because there's collagen in it. So I did a test with it and this was a few weeks ago and that was the last testing I did and I blended that with the flower petals. And then I had some people put it on their skin including me and the wrinkles started going away and the lines started going away like crazy. One girl was putting it on with her pajamas on over it, putting it over and going to sleep and after a week of doing that, this old dry dead skin actually peeled away like she was a snake. So now she has all this young delicious skin, you know, she's in her fifties.

Q: How about marigold blossoms? Because those by themselves feel good on your skin.

A: I haven't tried it with any of those, those are the only blossoms I've used.

Q: What were the blossoms again?

A: Vine jasmine. But you could use any flower, any flower petal. Yes?

Q: The traditional way of getting jasmine oil is in the fat method. They lay the flowers on the fat and the jasmine flower continues to release its fragrance after it's picked. It's one of the few flowers that does that, roses as well, and the rolling flowers as well, the orange blossom flowers. So that it blends perfectly with this particular formula.

A: Good. That's why it works so well.

Q: And it's about that and rose are the most expensive oils on the planet.

A: Yeah, but the oils that they use to extract the essence of the flower is always a processed oil.

Q: A solvent.

A: Yeah, they use a solvent, right.

Q: In the old way of doing it, they laid it on lard or on animal fat.

A: Yes.

Q: And then they would dry it out in the sun.

A: Right. And when I made this, it smelled like an old face cream my mother used to use in the 40s, early 50s. I thought, oh, that's what they used. They used jasmine petals. Yes.

Q: Were you blending the jasmine petals in or were you just allowing them to sit on the surface?

A: No, I blended it all together. I wanted the collagen in it, not just the fragrance. I wanted the collagen in it.

Q: And you could conceivably then use perhaps rose petals or other things?

A: I haven't tried those, but yes. I would say make sure they re, you know, they re not farmed.

Q: Right.

A: You know, if they grow in your yard, then yes.

Q: And then on to a slightly different topic. There was much discussion online for a while about using cilantro in tiny quantities in juice, but people complaining about overly rapid detoxes. What's your sense of that?

A. Cilantro pulls the metals out very rapidly and doesn't allow for binding with it. So what I did, I started suggesting that people eat one to two tablespoons of raw cream if they're using a juice that pulls out heavy metals rapidly.

A: Can you put the cream in the juice?

A: Yes. If you don't have cream and you have butter, then eat a tablespoon of butter before you drink the juice. And if you have coconut cream, of course, and the juice is cold, the coconut cream is going to sit as a lump on the top. So you eat just like the butter, you eat the coconut cream before you drink the juice. And then you won't have that kind of problem if you're using cilantro to pull out the heavy metals. I like using zucchini a little bit better because it isn't as radical as the cilantro. However, some people are so toxic in mercury and other metals that I do suggest that they eat no more than 10% ever of cilantro and they have to have cream with it or one of the fats.

Q: No less than 10%?

A: No more than 10% of the juice. Did I say no less? No more, good. Sometimes I say just the opposite of what I mean so I thought it was one of those moments.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: There we go.

Q: What's your take on eating comb honey?

A: Wonderful. The hydrochloric acid dissolves it and is a good skin protector. It's like a collagen.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, what they do is, you know, the center slab, that is one that's heat pressed and they make a cone shape and that forces the bee to build it out just the way they want them to build it in exact uniformity. So, when I m eating comb, I will scrape off and leave that center slab untouched. Now, if you get it from one of the places that I have in my product list, Pure Living Honey, they don't use those wax centers. So, when you buy their chunky honey with all the wax in it, it's all edible. I eat tremendous amounts of that. I went through, I think, two months and I went through one of those a week, you know, six pounder a week.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I only brought enough for the clients. So, if you e-mail, if you send $15 with an e-mail address.

Q: You do it with a session?

A: She's getting a session. Oh, you're getting a session? Yes, then you'll get it. Anybody who s getting a session gets it as part of the session. But anybody else who's not getting a session with me, an individualized consult with the iridology, not the hand reading, you can just send... In the back of the book, there's an order form. You can fill that out or just mark that information that I request. And if you have an e-mail address, mark the e-mail address and you'll get it right away. If I have to wait for somebody else to do the mailing and put it all together, it could take 6 weeks. But if you send an e-mail address, I can do it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's why it didn't dissolve in your stomach yet. Sometimes not all the will digest, but predominantly it will if your hydrochloric acid is good. It's like 20. No, it's by the jar. It's chunky. It's all mixed up. The honey, the wax, propolis, bee pollen, it's all mixed together. Yes.

Q: I've sometimes, there's a local person who removes hives and he does it without using any chemicals and minimal smoke, sometimes he just is able to retrieve a wild hive. And I noticed that when I've jarred that stuff up and used it, six months or so down the road, it almost tastes like it's fermented. Does that stuff ferment? And if so, is it harmful?

A: No, it's not harmful. They make wine honey, honey wine. That's what it is. The bees, they will make these very long channels so the honey way deep in the center, if it stays there long enough, it will start fermenting. Okay, we need to get on to the hand reading. Okay, first, who are you, Carol? Carol, right?

Q: That's right.

A: Okay. Relax your thumbs. Okay. Right ovary is in good shape. The left one isn't. It's debilitating. Is somebody writing for her? Are you? Okay. She's getting the tapes too. Adrenal glands are naturally overactive, so she has a hyperactive nature. So those two together probably created a high sexuality. The pancreas is pretty good for your age. It's probably one of the better pancreases I've seen in a while. I mean it is edemic. It means it's swollen with water and the right side of it is debilitating heavily, but it's still functioning. You have to eat the right food so it functions and makes the right insulin. Looks like the left tonsils are completely scarred, maybe removed. The other side though looks like it has a mound, but you have heavy scar tissue in there. Did you have your tonsils removed? You might have grown some of the left side back, even though there's heavy scarring there. When I did that fish detoxification last year, when I ate all that high fish and got the meningitis and spinal meningitis, I got a real sore throat at the end of it and I went and looked in the mirror and one of my tonsils had grown back. 50 years later, it grew back.

Q: Grew back?

A: And it took that massive thing to go through it. The parathyroids are not in good shape and the thyroids are not in good shape, both sides. The left is working slightly. Red blood cell count looks good. Circulation in the intestines is horrific. The liver is very toxic, heavy metals all throughout it. Kidneys, poor circulation. Lots of metal congestion around the heart. I'm going to recommend that your juice be 60% celery, 20% parsley, 10% summer squash, especially zucchini, crookneck, sunburst, some cucumber, and 10% cilantro. And have it with 1-2 tablespoons of cream. You need to get those metals out of the liver and the heart. Overall you've got metals all over the place but not concentrated like you do in those areas. And heavy around the small intestine, the left side. You may have some pretty severe pain in that area at times when you start detoxifying it. So just realize that it's going to be okay. Put a hot water bottle there and do some deep slow breathing like pranayama just to help settle it. Meat I'm going to suggest about a pound a day, maybe 3 quarters to a pound a day. Red blood cell count is pretty good so I'm going to say 60% red meat and 40% white. Blueberries will help get rid of some of that metal. So blueberries and coconut cream, blueberries and butter, blueberries and raw cream, whipped cream. To give the pancreas a chance to cleanse I would suggest only having fruit once every other day. Once a week having pear, make sure it's organic. And have it with a fat in the afternoon. Butter cream or coconut cream. And definitely have that lube formula in the evening. Next. Don't everybody run at once. Oh, say your name each time you come up for the...

Q: Micheal.

A: Okay, Michael. Testes are both in good shape. There's some shrinkage in the left one. Adrenal glands are mellowing. Pancreas... It's in pretty good shape. Okay. Everything looks really good except that you're just full of bile.

Q: I told you what I went through in the last six weeks. 

A: It's the bile.

Q: You're kidding.

A: No, you've got bile coming out. You know what bile is?

Q: No.

A: Bile is a substance that the body uses to help digest fats, to dissolve fats, to make it into different substances, to utilize as solvents or lubrication or fuel, whatever. It's a very caustic substance. And you have, you've utilized bile instead of fats to bind with poisons all over all these years. And now it's discharging all at once. And you've got, look at how yellow your hands are. That's bile coming out and it's burning everything, burning your nerves and everything.

Q: Two years ago I had, better than I've ever been in my whole life, two years on this diet. And then trauma, kidney problems and pneumonia. And I'm just coming off pneumonia. And the only thing you told me is bile.

A: Yep, it's bile. You don't know what bile can do. Bile's nasty, it's a caustic substance. I can take a drop of bile and burn a hole in your arm like battery acid.

Q: Okay, because in the middle of this, meat was coming out of me undigested. I felt like I had turpentine in my stomach. 

A: You were just detoxing some pretty dangerous stuff. I've seen it make ulcers. I've seen it burn holes in intestines.

Q: I want my energy back.

A: Lots of cheese, lots of cream, and lots of butter. And eggs. You just have to, I mean, really do it. Like I said, you know, just like I told him, lots of lube formulas and meat. Lube formulas and meat and lots of eggs on their own. Eggs are great to bind with that. Carrot juice is also helpful. But only a little bit of carrot juice. Because carrot juice also causes more bile to expel from the system. So, when I was getting rid of my bile, I was drinking half carrot and half cream, cow's cream together. And it was heavy on the stomach, but it pulled the bile into my stomach instead of going out my tissues. So I'd vomit sometimes, and the bile would come up. Sometimes it would be yellow and orange and green. But it's better to come out that way than debilitate the whole system. I rarely see people with that much jaundice to their skin. And jaundice is a sign that bile is working where fat should be working. Bile is very caustic and dangerous. And the people who say, oh, you're orange from carrot juice, it isn't the carotene at all. It's the bile that the carotene pulls out of the system. If it were the carotene, everybody would be turning orange. But it isn't. The way I found that out was I took skin scrapings on people who were getting very orange and I found bile components in it and no carotene. High vitamin A substances, byproducts of vitamin A utilization. Lots of bile byproducts. So you just have to get through that. So lots of lube formulas and lots of meat, lots of eggs. Just focus on that for about six weeks. Milk is also helpful. Milk can bring it to the stomach, but count on vomiting. Unless you're already peaked, maybe to the point where it's already at the end and you're just expelling all of it through the skin, the last remains of it.

Q: Meat's starting to digest again.

A: Okay, so you're at the end of it already. But I would still make sure to have enough fats for the next two weeks. Tons of them. Because sometimes it'll go into a detox and then stop for a while and then start again. If it does that, you pile on those fats. Lots of eggs, 12 to 20 eggs a day. Two to three lube formulas a day and a pound of meat a day. Don't drink a lot of milk, but drink a couple of cups a day. Green drink, continue with that. Stay away from fruit like the plague when you're going through that. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Not attack. It helps the body to digest fats.

Q: So why would he be [unintelligible]?

A: Because they could utilize, the bile could be utilized where it's supposed to. See, when the body gets deficient in fat, thin people don't have enough fat on their systems. So they don't have fat there to bind with poisons that are in the body, byproducts, inhaled pollution, any of that. So the body uses bile in place of it, in place of fats. And that means bile stores in the toxins in the tissues and it causes a battery acid type reaction, worse than the advanced glycation end products. But usually that will bind, bile will bind with even the advanced glycation end products and cause that kind of reaction that he's having.

Q: What could have caused that reaction?

A: The detox? By having too much bile in the system and not enough fat over the years.

Q: Just as a progressive thing?

A: Yeah.

Q: This hasn't just happened from his incident?

A: No, this is from, what, 35 years of eating a bad diet? He's only been on the diet 2 years. It takes 40 years to clean the body out completely. According to Howells and Pottenger's work, it took sick cats 5 generations to get well. But, you know, he let them procreate and then he would dissect them, you know, so he could autopsy them and not let the animal's cells regenerate and find out if they could reach it in their own lifetime. But my progression of watching people goes about that 2.5% a year of improvement, which is pretty good. Figure if the body is like New York City and you have a collapse of the twin towers, it's going to take 20 years to take care of those two little bitty organs. You know, tear down, haul that garbage away and rebuild it, 20 years. So our body is being able to do 2.5% and that's only, you know, like .001%, one thousandth of a percent of New York City. And our body can replace itself, regenerate itself, cleanse and regenerate itself by 2.5% a year once the liver gets back together if it has a problem. So, you know, he had 36, 37 years of garbage collect in him and now in the last two years he's been on a good diet. Now he can start getting rid of it. Okay?

Q: I expect a 40 years to life sentence for this guy.

A: Okay, Seth. The testes are in great shape, overactive, oversexual. Adrenal glands are very expanded. You could have been an athlete.

Q: Can you look up a little bit while you talk? I want to hear what you're saying.

A: I'm going to put the hands up higher if you don't mind.

Q: That's fine.

A: Okay. Pancreas is in pretty good shape on the right side. It's debilitating on the left side. Thyroid gland is overactive. The parathyroid is in good shape on the left side. Do you have your tonsils? Do you have your tonsils?

Q: Yeah.

A: Very good. It's one of the largest mounds I've seen. Both the left and right are working well. The right parathyroid is debilitated and the right thyroid is debilitated, but still the right thyroid is operating. Heavy metal poisoning is in your liver.

Q: How much?

A: I would say probably a third of your liver is poisoned with metals. 

Q: Therefore, it's one-third dysfunctional or non-functional.

A: Well, because the liver has to digest fats, and fats are so important for the body, it can cause a greater reaction. It can debilitate the body by 50%, just having the liver damaged.

Q: Got it.

A: Kidneys are okay. Throat, sinuses, full of bile, degenerative tissue in the throat and shoulders. Some of this looks like bacteria. Do you wear a mask when you cut and trim?

Q: What?

A: Do you use a mask when you cut and trim?

Q: No. What I do is when I run the chainsaw, I have a little bottle of baby powder. I check the wind with it, so I square it to see what direction the baby powder goes. Then I position the saw or the equipment, whatever the exhaust is, to have it blow away from me as much as possible. When there's zero wind, I just stop working. I don't want to stand in the cloud of shit.

A: Because you've got heavy metals and gangrenous tissue up in this area. That means you're inhaling it. Baby powder, that's so fragmented. Some of it's dust and you won't see it. Heavy metals.

Q: But the exhaust I have breathed over many times. It's just a little bit of gasoline. Let it move away from you, but I have breathed it many times over the years. Without question.

A: Because something's poisoned this entire area here. Red blood cell count is very good. Very hard on yourself. You've got to stop criticizing yourself like that. Juice I'm going to recommend... 60% celery. 15% parsley. 15% cilantro. And 10% summer squash. And eat 3 tablespoons of cream or 2 tablespoons of butter or 2 tablespoons of coconut cream with each juice. And you could have 12 ounces at a time or even 16 ounces at a time. Just don't glug it. Take about 10 minutes to drink it. Otherwise you're going to piss out a third of it. If you allow it to absorb a little at a time, your body will be able to use all of it. 

Q: Maybe I can drink it while at work.

A: Yeah.

Q: A little bit of water coming in as well as the nutrients and all that.

A: I prefer you're eating fats, you know. Because some of the swelling, most of the swelling you have is you're holding on to all this water in your tissues and you're not utilizing it.

Q: Got it.

A: It's causing you to be more dry inside. So it's causing you to be more thirsty. You need the fats.

Q: I do. Yeah. I've been getting most of my fat from cheese that I've been eating.

A: That won't give you fat.

Q: Got it.

A: Fat from cheese is a sponge. It's high in minerals. It attracts the poisons and holds on to them. Very little of that is ever utilized in the body. It's for binding with poisons. It's to keep you from getting nauseous and vomiting. To help pull the poisons out of the blood. Very little of that is absorbed. Some of the minerals will be absorbed, but very little of the fat. It's there as a binder. So cheese is not some place where you're going to get fat.

Q: Got it.

A: It has to be actually butter, coconut cream, raw cream. Meat fat.

Q: Of those, butter is the easiest to get. And that's the one that's difficult enough.

A: Soon it won't be. Another month. Thank Mark McAfee. Meat should be about a pound and a half to two pounds a day. There's a little bit of anemia, so I'm going to say about 75% red meat and 25% white.

Q: I've been eating about three quarters and I've been feeling really hungry for it.

A: Three quarters of a pound? Nothing. A pound and a half to two pounds is what you need. With lots of fat with it. That's going to help you lose all this water retention.

Q: That's excellent. So should I eat the meat throughout the day or should I... I have been the last three weeks working during the day all day, just having water and then eating everything in the evening.

A: That's not a good idea.

Q: Not a good idea. Throughout the day.

A: I would say at least twice. You've got the hormones of an athlete, so you should be eating it twice a day, large amounts, like three quarters of a pound twice a day minimum.

Q: Okay.

A: First thing in the morning, I mean after you have your juice, and then when you get home.

Q: Okay.

A: Every other day I'm going to recommend about five ounces of pineapple with five ounces of some fat, either three ounces of butter or five ounces of coconut cream or five ounces of raw cream.

Q: Under ripe pineapple?

A: Yes. Under ripe fruit is better, it has more enzymes and less sugar, like the apes. Apes eat nothing ripe. John Goodall in 1969, I think it was, yeah, in 1969 made a movie, a documentary about apes. It was called The Beginning. And they took, you know, they watched the apes eat only green bananas. They never wait for them to become ripe. So they did an experiment. They cut down about three big, big bushels of bananas and let them ripen. And threw one whole bunch of them out there. And the apes went up there. They had never seen them before. They started to eat them. And they all just went crazy. And they started eating them and fighting over them. And it got them so sugar high that one of the older ones killed one of the younger monkeys. That's what sugar can do. So that's why they eat them, you know, unripe. It keeps them calm and natural. When they were given this unnatural thing, they were so violent. The movie is phenomenal to see that. These peaceful monkeys that live together, apes that live together, and all of a sudden just fighting over these... And you see the little small ones running in there trying to grab one, and the bigger gorillas there, you know, beating the hell out of them. And they were so hungry for that sugar, it was just like a catch-22. They were risking their lives to do it. Overripe bananas.

Q: Wow.

Q: How much cream was that, Aajonus? Was it pineapple? Five ounces?

A: Five ounces of raw cream or coconut cream or three ounces of butter. Okay.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: I feel good about my sentence.

A: Good. What is your name?

Q: Ben.

A: Hi, Benjamin. Okay, here's another fellow with tremendous amounts of bile in his system. When you have that kind of jaundice, that kind of bile in the system, it creates all kinds of problems. You see the sores on his face? It's very frequent with people who have, you know, who can't heal properly because the bile prevents proper healing. The bile gets into the cells, ruptures them, and prevents proper healing. Was that an accident?

Q: Yeah, last night I went to throw up and I blacked out.

A: Blacked out and you hit the... let me see. Did you put anything on it?

Q: I put some sesame oil on it.

A: Okay. It looks like you're developing impetigo from it. One of the results of too much bile in the system is impetigo. It puts out a crusty yellow serum that can spread all over the system. And that's a condition of very bile-toxic cells. The same thing happened to me when I was about 12 years old and it spread all over my face just from one fall on my chin. And you've got more than I had. Not as much as this young man had. You've got quite a bit all in your system. A lot. And that will make you just irritable. Both testes are very full, very formed. The left one is debilitating a little bit. The adrenal glands are extremely overactive. Usually find an irritable nature when they're that strong. And the pancreas is debilitated completely on the left side. And on the right side it's working probably 10% at best. So if I were you, I would consider myself diabetic and stay away from fruits, once every 2-3 days. Once every 3 days would probably be better. You only need 5% fruit in the system. Your body uses mainly the alcohol and vitamin C from it to help utilize fat as fuel, as energy. Some people can use to make more solvents to detoxify. But it can be too aggressive. For somebody who hasn't been on the diet, I recommend in a situation like this, not eating much fruit for the first year, getting stabilized and strong, help neutralizing some of the bile, and then start eating fruit maybe once a day to help create solvents to help eliminate other poisons in the body. The right thyroid is very poor. It doesn't look like it's functioning. The right is good. Both parathyroids are overactive and that's good. Lots of scarring around both tonsils. Did you have your adenoids removed?

Q: No.

A: The right adenoid looks good. The left one looks like it decayed if you didn't have it removed. Did they remove your tonsils?

Q: No.

A: It looks like they're not active at all. It's like they're just dissolved. 

Q: Yeah, they've been scarred. Is that normal to have pockmarks near the tonsils?

A: Yeah. You have indications of about 50% anemia right on the borderline of being weak and debilitated from it. You have some very difficult combinations of problems. The bile, the inactive pancreas which relates to diabetes, and then indications of anemia. These are all difficult to move from. Kind of like I was, but not near as badly as I was to develop blood and bone cancer. I just don't see, without diarrhea and vomiting, I don't see a way out of this. Just make sure you're kneeling when you go to vomit. Crawl if you have to, that's what I did, keep from passing out. Because you start vomiting and you have signs of anemia and diabetes, it's pass out, blackout, gone. Stay close to the floor when you start feeling that way.

Q: I was feeling it, I was trying to get low, but I wasn't quick enough.

A: Don't, when you start feeling that way, you get on the ground on your knees quickly and move from the ground. Because this looks like it could go into diabetes kind of blackouts, malfunctioning. I used to blackout six, eight times a day. And as soon as I felt that dizziness come on, it was a tingling that would first come. That was always my signal. I got down on the floor, I got down in a chair, on a sofa, immediately. And sometimes it would arrest the blackout. Sometimes I'd blackout just on the way down, but at least I was moving in the right way to get the position. And I was moving away from furniture that would damage me. And when I realized that, I never got hurt after that.

Q: I've only had that happen once before, and I think I ate some oatmeal and some cooked honey, and I got on my bike, and I rode really hard, and I got to where I was going and blacked out.

A: Probably cooked honey. You know, and you're not handling carbohydrates, so oatmeal's not a thing to have. Meat, lots of meat and lots of fat, you know. I would have, how tall are you?

Q: Six five.

A: I would have, you know, because you have signs of diabetes, often that'll cause nausea from meat. Especially chicken, but the chicken will help clean out the bile quicker. But you have to push through it, allow yourself to vomit and get it out, get it over with. It can go on for about two and a half to three years. I don't know any other way to break through it. Because you've got, your whole one side of your system is very trapped in a difficult situation.

Q: So more chicken than red meat?

A: No, you have too many indications of anemia. So you need to build your blood and your liver up. And eat chicken, let's say 25% of your diet, 75% of your diet red meat and 5% fish, seafood. And make it seafood, ocean food, like swordfish, tuna, yellowtail. Things that are heavy in oil. Except for escolar, you'll be on the toilet all the time and probably going in your pants. So escolar don't have, except on rare occasion.

Q: Never heard of it.

Q: We don't have it.

A: Okay.

Q: What is it?

A: It tastes like, it's a white fish, comes from tropical areas, South America, and it tastes like lobster with butter. And let me tell you, most people it causes them to move in their pants. If you have too much of it. If you have a little bit it's fine. Escolar. Okay, for juice, I'm going to recommend 50-60% celery, you can vary it from week to week if you like. 50-60% celery and 20-30% parsley. It's a lot of parsley but you'll probably like it. You need all that vitamin E and you need the chlorophyll. When you get the chlorophyll into your system you're going to start using the sun properly. And you don't need as much red meat. See normally with a hand like yours you don't need much red meat. You should not be having anemia symptoms like this. But it looks like you're not utilizing the sun's rays in your skin properly. And the bile is preventing that. So lots of fat with your meats. Lots of fat. But I'm still going to recommend that you have a high amount of the red meat. Seventy percent.

Q: A pound a day?

A: Well, he should start off with try to work up to a pound and then a pound and a half. Just remember that the more meat you eat with lots of fat, the more you're going to be able to regenerate cells. When you're this kind of thin, you can't afford to get rid of dead cells unless there are cells ready to be replaced, ready to replace them. So you need to get ahead of the game. That's why I like people to be overweight rather than underweight. For an example, take our host here. This guy was skin and bones when I met him, and this is the way he looked. And I mean, he was like this. And I'm not exaggerating. Look at him now. I mean, he's strong and sturdy, but he has to gain that weight, lose it, gain it, and lose it. And that's what I suggest for men. Fifteen to thirty pounds over their normal weight, that doesn't mean a thin weight. That means when you get to a good, normal-sized weight. Then you gain fifteen to thirty pounds above that. And women, I'm very, very kind, ten to twelve pounds over your normal weight. And it works, because what happens is you put on the extra fat. The body can do deep tissue cleansing. It can take those fats and go deep into the tissues and start pulling them out, just like oil in a car. It grabs the carbons and the shavings, the metals, and then it turns black and gunky. You get rid of it and put new oil in. And with experiments that I did in the last couple of years, the individuals who were doing, you know, gaining the weight in two weeks and losing it in two to three, it wasn't good. They were showing signs of more toxicity as well as losing toxicity. So the weight has to stay on longer. So I suggested people gain the weight, hold it for five weeks minimum, and then lose it. And take your time in losing it. Take your time in putting it on. So the faster does not make quicker or better. It was more harmful then. I mean, they still improved, but there was, for the first time in the people who did this, I saw that there was more toxicity or there was toxicity added to areas that I hadn't seen before than people that did it slowly. I would say wait about 30 days after you're on the diet and get in the sun. And that should help a lot. Lots of metal poisonings throughout your entire abdominal area, down your gonads. With the juice, you need to drink 2-4 tablespoons of cream with each cup of juice. And I recommend you have about 12 ounces of juice at a time. Now that's going to fatigue you at times. But you need to rest a lot. It's just the way it is. You're a person that's going to have to go in slow motion for maybe 3 years. And then once that breaks, you know, you have all of your energy back. Which used to be a lot.

[audio cut]

A: Relax your thumbs. Okay. Your glands are very spongy. Sometimes find this in people who are raised vegetarian. Were you raised vegetarian?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay. Nothing's developed properly. Your glands. You do have your tonsils it looks like. The right tonsil is the only thing that seems to be working very well. The left one is pretty damaged. Did you get sore throats a lot?

Q: I used to, yeah.

A: You melted away the left side, left tonsil. The right side of the thyroid looks like it could come back as soon as you start eating meat. It looks like it's going to take you about five years to catch up, which isn't bad. If an adult had to catch up from being a vegetarian, it might take them ten years. If you go on a good diet and eat lots of raw meat, you can correct it within about five years. There's a girl in Hawaii who was 18 years old when I saw her last year. Her mother raised her vegetarian. She'd only had a period once in her life and was very, very pale and anemic. She was mainly a fruit eater. So she was very weak, very swollen all over, very long, lots of hair. She got on the diet, within three months, she started having periods regularly. Everything just started maturing within three months on the diet. It was amazing. Her whole life has changed. She's a very happy person now. It's only been a year. Children have an ability to react quicker because they have the growth hormones already working for them. You have some, looks like some joint problems because of the lack of protein to utilize the minerals properly. So it looks like we'd be going into arthritis, rheumatoid arthritis probably within about ten years. Probably be crippled from it if you don't want to change, to get on to a good diet. Circulation is very poor, very poor fats all over. You get cold very easily?

Q: Yeah.

A: I'm going to recommend that you eat lots of fat with your meat and eat at least a pound and a half a day. I'm going to recommend for about two and a half years 80% red meat, 15% fowl and 5% seafood. Seafood isn't as important right now, later on it will be. Then once you get about two and a half years, three years, you could cut it down to about 70% red meat and then 30% white, 20% fowl, 10% seafood. So when you have lots of fat with your meat, wait about 10 minutes after you finish that meal and have two tablespoons of honey that will help you rush heat into the body and get the circulation going better. You'll find you might even get heat flashes, a little perspiration right away. But you have to wait and have the honey 10 minutes after, 10-15 minutes after. Can't let it go beyond that, not earlier than that. Time it. It's a very precise formula. Very, very creative, so you're going to have to do something creative for your livelihood. Are you a musician at all?

Q: I play drums.

A: Looks like you have some good singing and writing talent. Writing is very strong. Okay.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: My name is Francesca.

A: Francesca? Okay, Francesca. You are dried out completely. You're like a prune inside. I recommend that you make a batch of lubrication formula in the morning, two of them at once, and you just have it throughout the day. Relax your thumbs. The right ovary is pretty debilitated. The left one is okay. The adrenal glands are extremely overactive, especially the right. Usually that will create an irritability about the nature, a great deal of impatience. When you get enough fats and proteins in the body, things will start making you happy. Otherwise, with this kind of imbalance and instability in the body, nothing will make you happy. I don't care if you got the greatest guy in the world and had the most money. It would be impossible to be happy because that whole body is so dry inside, everything irritates it. No matter what's in your blood, it's irritated. You just don't have the fats to do it. You need to gain about 35 pounds. Fat and happy. Let me tell you, look at Marilyn Monroe. She wasn't any thin, and you don't see anybody swooning over Twiggy. 

Q: This is [unintelligible].

A: Well, you can see that the minerals are not being utilized properly. It looks like you've been a vegetarian or just not eating meat.

Q: Yeah, pretty much my whole life. I didn't even get my teeth and my...

A: I mean indications of severe anemia and dehydration.

Q: Anemic now?

A: Yeah. Bile everywhere in place of fats. More irritability, that's what I mean. Cells can't even relax. Lots of sunshine you need once you get the fats in. Take about three weeks eating lots of cream, butter, coconut cream. In fact, if you eat that mixture that I use for the skin, you eat it too. It even helps the skin absorb the sun easier so the skin isn't so dry. Okay, lots of metal poisonings all over. You haven't been able to detox metals your whole life so they've all collected in your system. I'm going to recommend that you have 40% celery and 40% summer squash, zucchini, crookneck, sunburst, some cucumber, and 20% parsley. And eat either a teaspoon of butter with that or a tablespoon of raw cream. It may make you feel, after the juice, you may get a little tired. Metals coming out and your body just has to not do anything but take care of those metals. Just like the last fellow, you're going to have to go through a period of feeling like a baby. Newborn baby. Eat and sleep, eat and sleep. It's not going to be easy because you've got counter indications of all that irritation to the tissues, the bile and the metals. He only had metals in a few places, you've got metals everywhere. So you're going to want to feel sleep and then you're not going to sleep easy or relax well. So you're going to have to eat eggs and meat, eggs and meat, lots of eggs and meat. And have the lubrication formula regularly. I would recommend that you eat at least a pound of meat a day. Pancreas is working by about 5%. Even if you're working 30% I would say stay away from fruit. It will just make you very overly emotional. It's not that way. You do that and you're going to have more of a time. You're going to cry... Well, let me retract that. You could have 4 ounces of berries as long as you have 5 ounces of coconut cream or raw cream with it. Only in the afternoon. Don't ever cheat and have it morning or evening. Only in the afternoon. If you can get some bone marrow, that would be very helpful. Help reverse some of the joint damage. Most of the joint damage is happening on the right side of your body. And you're also very self-critical. You're very psychic. You should be a psychic. Be a healer. I mean, if you just get all your physical together, you've got one of the best relationship lines I've ever seen. You could be a matchmaker. You could be a marriage counselor. You could be all those things, and a good one. But you have to be happy in yourself first, and relaxed and calm. The tonsils look like they're in very good shape.

Q: No, they were taken out.

A: They were? Well, you've got some great glands, thyroid, I mean, lymph glands making up for it. Because they're protecting your brain. That's what tonsils do. They protect the brain. They dissolve toxicity that would normally get into the brain. When you have those removed, instead of having sore throats to expel it to the throat, guess what? It's all going to your brain. Her lymph glands all in her neck have substituted for it. In her situation, with her kind of dryness and lack of protein, she probably would have been in an institution if her lymph glands didn't work in her throat. Parathyroids are good. Thyroids don't look like they're working at all. Thymus is okay. Heavy metal in the kidneys. Kidneys are very jaundiced, very sallow. Liver's in not good shape. I would recommend that you eat some liver once a week minimum. A pound a week would be good. You can take liver and blend it with half milk, a little honey. It's pretty tasty. It's an easy way to get it down if you don't like raw liver. Or you could do like I used to do. I would put it in a Cuisinart food processor with some onion. I loved it that way, like a pate, like chopped liver. It was really good. I hated it. I used to stand up here for how many years, three or four years? I've stood up here and said, I hate milk and liver. I hate it. I can't stand it. My girlfriend loves it, you know. Now I love it, just in the last year. Ever since I had that milk and blood for some reason. I love the liver and milk. With a little honey in it. Okay.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Nice sweater.

Q: Thanks.

A: Name?

Q: Brian.

A: Brian, are you ready? Okay. Okay, Brian. Both testes are very swollen with water. Pancreas is the same way, very debilitated. Thyroid is the same way. Parathyroid is the same way. All of your glands are like mush. Heavy metal poisoning from the hips all the way up to the skull, especially the brain, the chest area. Where did you get all this metal poisoning?

Q: Well, I do have [unintelligible], but that's...

A: No, they wouldn't cause this. You have to be exposed to pollution, metalworking, soldering, or live near a factory or grow up in a toxic city. 

Q: In [unintelligible] California, I don't know if that's worse than many. Just metal shop is all I did.

A: Metal shop? How much metal work did you do in that time?

Q: I don't know, just one semester.

A: One semester is three months?

Q: Yeah.

A: Six months?

Q: That's interesting because I can't think of exposure to toxins in that fashion.

A: Unless you're just very allergic to metals and don't detoxify them. So anything from canned food or any kind of metal at all would just stay in your system.

Q: Okay.

A: I'm going to recommend a juice. Forty percent celery. Thirty percent summer squash. Zucchini, crookneck, sunburst. A little bit of cucumber. Twenty percent cilantro. And twenty percent parsley. Did I come out with the right figure? Ten percent over? Okay. Forty percent celery. Thirty percent summer squash. Twenty percent cilantro. And then twenty percent parsley. Or is it ten percent parsley? I've just lost it.

Q: It would be ten percent.

A: Ten percent parsley.

Q: Would you say again the other squashes besides summer squash and a little cucumber?

A: The summer squashes are zucchini, crookneck, sunburst, cucumber. They're all summer squash. Do you have your tonsils?

Q: Yes.

A: Excellent shape. Parathyroids. I mean all of the form of your glands are there, but they're just mush.

Q: Okay.

A: It means you're very protein deficient.

Q: Yeah, that makes sense.

A: And also have about three tablespoons of cream or coconut cream with each juice or one tablespoon of butter. Meat, I'm going to recommend about 50% red, 50% white.

Q: What kind of white meat? It's like I'm taking fish.

A: Predominantly more fish will get rid of some of those metals a little bit better. So 25% fish, 25% fowl. And in about three or four months have blueberries or any berries with some coconut cream or other cream or butter in the afternoon. Right now I would stay away from fruit for about six to nine months, except for the berries in a few months, three months.

Q: Is the honey still okay?

A: The honey is fine, as long as it's one of the approved honeys.

Q: So not even like an apple with the vegetable?

A: Apple would be one of the worst.

Q: How long did you say to stay away from fruit?

A: About six months, except for the berries in the afternoon.

Q: And what sort of quantities are we talking, like a pound of meat or two pounds in terms of the vegetable juice?

A: The vegetable juice, you should probably have about, you should rotate it, 12 ounces, 8 ounce, 12 ounce, 8 ounce.

Q: So 12, 8 every morning then?

A: 12 ounces in the morning. Around noon, 8 ounces. Around 5 o'clock, 12 ounces. Before you go to bed, 8 ounces.

Q: Okay.

A: Anywhere from a pound and a quarter, start off by working up to a pound, but then go from a pound and a quarter to a pound and three quarters. 

Q: So say like three quarters a pound of red, then three quarters chicken or three quarters rice?

A: Yes.

Q: Okay. And [unintelligible] okay, chicken, turkey, or?

A: Yes, any fowl. Very creative, so you need to do something creative.

Q: What about for muscle relaxation? Oh, and I've also been like waking up constantly like around 2 in the morning.

A: Neurological detox I was talking about. You have metal poisons all over, you can have that off and on for 20 years, 25 years.

Q: Okay, so give up water and give up tea and any?

A: Tea is going to create more of those metals.

Q: Okay. Oh, there you go. I drank a lot of tea and coffee, so would that be?

A: Oh God, yes.

Q: Okay.

A: It can be your metal poisoning. The circulation in the spine is poor, so I'm going to suggest at night putting a hot water bottle, a couple of them at your spine.

Q: Oh.

A: Could be because it's trying to shut the metal from poisoning the spine.

Q: Okay, all right.

A: And lube formulas, you know, two a day for about eight months, and then go for more milkshakes. Whenever you get thirsty, lots of eggs.

Q: So to satisfy my thirst with eggs?

A: Uh-huh.

Q: Okay. Okay, good job, thanks.

Q: Do you need a flashlight yet?

A: No. Probably in a few minutes.

Q: Are you thirsty, so you're drinking butter?

A: Uh-huh. I'm getting dry mouth.

Q: Is that a mixture of honey and butter?

A: No, just butter.

Q: How do you get heavy metals from teas?

A: Just like I said earlier, any time you cook anything that has metals in it, you cause the metals to become free radicals. They're no longer nutrients. They're poisons.

Q: What if you didn't heat the water to the limit? If it just was a four-finger, four-second finger in water?

A: Well, water's toxic anyway, because it's a leecher. To get your herbs, what you do is juice them. Juice the vegetables, and then you get your liquids that you can utilize.

Q: Sun tea?

A: Sun tea. Still you're going to have heavy metals in it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You've got dehydrated substance. There's no electrolyte. There's no ion activity.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, the water will start leeching the mint out, the oils out, yes. But still, you're going to cause some of them to become free radical because of the imbalance of minerals that are going to draw out. It's going to break it down more for, you know, plants to eat rather than for a human to eat. It's better just to juice, put some mint leaves in your juice. You know, juice some mint leaves.

Q: I was just looking for a tea alternative.

A: That's what your vegetable juice is. Vegetable juice is your tea. If you want mint in it, just put a few leaves of mint in there. You can use whatever herb you like, fresh and raw, just no more than 5%. Because remember, anything other than those that I normally suggest are medicinal. And they will cause reactions in the body. Any of them. You can have them fresh, but you use them in small, no more than 5% of the juice. Kale, leeks, any of those are very strong. No more than 5% of the juice.

Q: Spinach?

A: Spinach has the oxalic acid in it. More than 10% of that, and you're asking for trouble. For the kidneys anyway. Okay.

Q: Carol.

A: Okay, Carol. Can we have an overhead light? I think I can do it with an overhead light. Over here. Ah, there. Okay. Okay, Carol. Lots of metals in your brain. Throughout the whole body. But mainly in the brain. Sometimes I'll find it in the shoulders when it's this bad, but you don't have it so badly in the shoulders. Right ovary is good, left ovary is debilitated. The pancreas is shot. The adrenal gland is very overactive. The left one is fatiguing. The right one is fine. Thyroid gland on both sides, not very operative. The left one looks like it could rebound pretty quickly. Parathyroids don't look like they're working at all. And it looks like the tonsils are gone. Scar tissues, they're not working very well. This one's okay, but this one's all scar tissue, the left side. You see how flat and white this one is? This one's okay. It's very small, usually the mound should be large. Did you have sore throats to deteriorate them?

Q: No, I [unintelligible].

A: Just didn't develop?

Q: No, I think they're there.

A: I mean, didn't develop normally, the large as they're supposed to be. The greatest stability you have is along your spine. Severe protein deficiency, bile throughout the system. Again, what I see here is a person who's too thin doesn't have enough fat to bind with the poisons, so the poisons get embedded into the tissues. Always happens. And it's hard for those people to recover. That's why I said it's better to be fat and happy than skinny and considered fashionable. Very hard on yourself, too. Very self-critical. Poor circulation in the intestines. Esophagus is very scarred. Kidney is very anemic. Liver is 50% anemic. Looks like there's scar tissue there. Have you had hepatitis? You just didn't know it?

Q: No, not [unintelligible].

A: It looks like you had had a liver virus or infection. Tried to clear it. You didn't have the proper nutrients to finish it, so you just scarred. Like 50% scar tissue. As if you had been an alcoholic. You eat tons of fruit?

Q: I don't really like fruit.

A: Good, because that would have destroyed you probably. But sometimes I find that some fruitarians will have liver damage like that because there's too much sugar that turns into alcohol that hardens the liver. Your liver doesn't really look... Yeah, it is. It's definitely solid with scarring. Something happened to it.

Q: It's a high sugar diet in general.

A: Oh, yeah. I'm going to recommend 80% celery, 20% parsley. You're not going to worry about taking the metals out with your juice. You need to just relax the whole system. You'll probably pull metals out anyway. So I'm going to suggest that you have one to two tablespoons of cream. Cream is what you need, not butter or coconut cream. If you don't have it, take a tablespoon off the top of your milk. I recommend three quarters of a pound a day minimum and work up to a pound, a pound and a quarter. Signs of anemia. Normally with this kind of stability on the spine and this kind of firmness to the ovaries, usually it gives you enough hyperactivity to create enough red blood cells. With all the metal poisoning, it looks like it damages the red blood cells. So you still need to eat lots of red meat for probably three or four years. I would say 70% red meat. About maybe four years you could cut it down to about 50% of each. To clear up the scarring and the lack of circulation from here to here, it goes about this track all around here to here, all the way up to the throat area. I would take hot water bottles and line them on you. If you're on your side, put them against here or up your back. If you're lying on your back, then don't put them on top. Put them at your sides. The heat will still work in inwardly because that needs help to expand that. Right now it's just locked. The spine's good, but right around in here in your intestine and the tissue around outside of the spine is very scarred and poor circulation. That will help all of this relax a little bit more. Did you dance or something, to have a spine like this? Do you exercise?

Q: Jog.

A: Usually dancers have this kind of thing, but joggers do.

Q: I'm a potential dancer.

A: Obviously. And I would definitely eat an equal amount of fat to the meat. It's not going to be easy, but you really need it.

Q: Pound of fat a day? Oh boy.

A: And if you use the various fats, it will be easier. If you just stick with all butter or something like that, it's going to be impossible. Continue exercising, definitely. Walking, jogging. But don't do it on an empty stomach. I recommend you down three eggs before you do it, Rocky style. No whipping. And you have to wipe your mouth like Rocky did, or else it won't work.

Q: And find some stairs.

A: There you go. Tomatoes, very important for you. Probably at least a cup of tomatoes a day. Okay. You're welcome.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's still okay, yeah, but I can see beyond it. I've learned, I've adapted my senses. Hi.

Q: Inani.

A: You're not going to give me the whole thing this time. Okay. The left ovary is in very good shape, the right one is not. It's debilitating probably by 60%. Adrenal glands have been very overactive. Shows a very aggressive nature. And that's because the adrenals, the way that they formed and the lack of pancreatic function shows a low blood sugar level with high adrenaline. Usually means, usually creates an abrasive nature. Lots of metal poisoning in the brain. Especially around the right ear and all down through the brain stem here. Liver looks very anemic. Circulation to and from the kidney, right kidney is very poor, left is okay. Lots of metal poisoning around the heart going all the way out into the sternum. Thyroids functioning okay. Parathyroids look very good. Tonsil area looks good on all sides. So the glands up here are pretty good. And the ones down here are overactive and debilitating.

Q: Which glands in particular are overactive?

A: Well, both parathyroids, you have three on each side, very overactive. The ovaries are overactive. The adrenal glands are overactive. If you had been raised healthfully, you would be a person that wouldn't need to eat a lot of meat. But it didn't work out that way. Also, you're very self-critical. You extend that out to the rest of the world, too. It's okay to have what pleases you to know that. What pleases you. Around this kidney and liver, I suggest a hot water bottle in this area. If you're lying on your right side, put one here and one at the back at the same time. If you're lying on your back or front, put it at your side.

Q: Is it okay to heat a bag of rice in the microwave?

A: No, because there are minerals in the rice that will hold on to radiation, and they will irradiate you. And they have about, each time you irradiate it, it gives it about a 46-hour radioactive life. So, best to just use a hot water bottle.

Q: How long?

A: As long as you want. You know, so you go to sleep with it.

Q: Is this a long-term sort of thing?

A: With a liver and kidney in that kind of shape, I would say yeah. I would say it would probably take about six years. Do you walk at all? I'm going to recommend that you do some walking. Not jogging, but walking. Maybe some stairs. The circulation in this whole area is very poor. Okay, juice I'm going to recommend. The metals in you, we have to get out because that's causing a major problem. You're forcing your body to use up all the fats. So you keep calling in water and it's not helping. It's making it worse. H2O that you can't use. So you keep swelling with water and not having the nutrients to handle these poisons nor to utilize in the cells. Juice, 50% celery, 40% summer squash and 10% parsley. Two tablespoons of cream. You need the nut formula twice a week. Never less than three days between them though. Never two days in a row or just two days apart. Make sure it's at least three days apart.

Q: I can't get my sinuses to stop.

A: You can't. With this much metal poisoning, guess where it has to go? Out the throat and sinuses. So you're going to have to eat lots of eggs, lots of fat just to be able to let it flow more easily. It could take 23 years to get rid of this metal poisoning. So I would just say that, you know, your sinuses are a drain for it and just get used to it and know that it's a good thing. It's the only way it can drain out, you know, unless it comes out the gums and then your teeth may be damaged and your bones may deteriorate. Your sinuses are a little bit stronger even though it doesn't feel like it. With this much metal poisoning in the brain, what did you do to get this kind of metal poisoning?

Q: I don't know. Could my dyes have anything to do with it?

A: Your what?

Q: Dyes.

A: You use dyes? Oh, definitely. Yeah, if you're using any kind of yellow or blue dye. You've got cobalt and cadmium. Definitely. You need to get very thick gloves if you're going to continue to do it.

Q: I do.

A: And make sure you've got a mask on. And I mean one of those masks, you know, like a... Because they vaporize. Especially cobalt and cadmium, they will vaporize. What do you use the dyes with?

Q: On fabrics.

A: Like batiking or...

Q: Many different techniques. Usually I don't use wax.

A: Okay. Because wax can make it worse.

Q: Wax is strong.

A: Right. Because unless you use beeswax, then it doesn't have as much heavy metals in it. But the vapors from paraffin are pretty strong in metals. Lots of alkaloids in them. Red meat, I'm going to recommend 60% of your diet be red meat. And... Do you like fish?

Q: Yes. I like shellfish a lot.

A: I recommend that you just, you know, like down six oysters a day. And scallops, even if they're frozen. Just to get rid of some of this metal. Lots of eggs. Anything that's going to pull this metal out of your system. So about a pound of meat a day. A pound and a third meat a day would be preferable.

Q: How about the eggs in a milkshake?

A: They're going to make you feel more relaxed and help create more mucus. So you can discharge and drain better here and that's a good thing. And you need to relax just to add more cream to it. Let's say you're having five ounces of milk with two to three eggs. You need about three ounces of cream added to it and one to two tablespoons of honey.

Q: I found that having cream and milk is difficult if I have one or the other separately. They're easy for me.

A: What is the difficulty?

Q: I get plugged up in my sinus if I have them all together.

A: It doesn't drain at all, it just plugs?

Q: Yes.

A: You're not digesting the proteins properly. Are you letting the milk stay room temperature? Are you drinking it cold?

Q: It's cold.

A: It's cold, that's your problem. Toxic proteins are getting into your blood without digesting. Try letting it sit out for at least 12 hours, you know, in a dark cupboard. It can be a cool cupboard, just not cold, and then pour it into the... and see if it plugs you up. Well, withstand it for three days if it happens. If it still happens by the fourth day, then, you know, don't. Don't have the extra cream in it. Have it before or later. Before the milkshake or after. You came in with some metal toxicity from your mother. Oh, maybe it was from formula. Once a week, I'm going to recommend that you have four ounces of pineapple with four ounces of either coconut cream or five ounces of whipped cream. Not regular soft cream. It should be whipped. And a teaspoon of honey with the whipped cream. You don't need any honey with the coconut cream unless you want it.

Q: Between the five days of cream, pineapple and cream and then five days with the blueberries and cream, is that good?

A: I think you need to stabilize before you do something like that. Right now everything is fractured. It's like your tissues are so vulnerable and so weak and so dry, and they're just full of water, that everything looks fatigued. So I wouldn't force a detoxification until you can stabilize the tissues, the cells, and that means not...

[audio cut]

A: And then the cream and only once a week do pineapple, about four ounces of pineapple with, like I said, five ounces of coconut cream or whipped cream, five ounces of raw cream that whips, whip into more than five ounces, but four ounces of raw, five ounces of raw cream before it's whipped and then whip it. It comes out to about seven ounces or four ounces of butter blended with the pineapple and only once a week. I, you know, just lots of eggs, you know, rocky style, just keep downing them to help stabilize this, the sinuses. Okay, you're welcome. 

Q: My name is Steve.

A: Steve, hi Steve. And relax your thumbs. Left testis is in excellent shape, the right one is starting to, relax it, starting to debilitate, very swollen with water. The left side of the pancreas is in good shape, the right side is completely debilitated, swollen. The adrenal glands are very overactive, usually shows a very high sexual nature. The thyroid, right thyroid is overactive and good, parathyroid is overactive and good, this is the right side. Tonsil area looks scarred, metal poisoning on the left side, all around the tonsils and throat area. Parathyroids over on the left side are very bad, the whole area around the throat and neck on the left side are debilitated and toxic. Metal poisonings, bile, full of bile, you've got lots of bile too throughout your system, causing lots of adhesions. Circulation in your diaphragm from your esophagus right below the heart, all the way down to the stomach, small intestines, poor circulation. The left kidney is swollen and metal poisoned, the heart looks pretty weak, also metal poisoned. The liver is metal poisoned, some looks like adhesions, the ducts going into it, swelling in the right kidney. Could even be a node there, a nodule there in the right kidney. Do you have any pain back there, sciatica?

Q: No.

A: Don't be surprised if it doesn't happen, it's likely to when it starts cleaning it. Normally you wouldn't need a lot of red meat because the red blood cells aren't forming quite as well as they should, so they're not transporting oxygen as well as they should. I'm going to recommend about 40-50% red meat and 50-60% white meat. Lots of chicken and fish, or fowl and seafood. It's funny, your creative side, you have a tendency to be very critical, and then on your analytical side you don't. It's usually the reverse of people. Usually on their analytical side they're critical, not on their creative side. So you'd be a great comedian. Because you have a sensibility of perspective that's unusual and it would really work for you.

Q: I used to hang out with these people.

A: Which people was that? This guy, this character over here. Okay juice, 50% celery, 20% parsley, 10% summer squash, 10% cilantro and 10% carrot. One to two tablespoons... Let's make it two, don't take a chance. Two tablespoons of cream. Cream is always preferable. If you don't have cream, butter, coconut cream once in a while is okay. Even two tablespoons of avocado once in a while could substitute, but mainly raw cream.

Q: Do you just mix those in with the juice?

A: You can do that. Right before you drink, if I've given that to anybody, you do not mix the cream in when you make the juice. Only right before you eat it, drink it.

Q: The cream before the juice. Not always, right?

A: No. You can put the cream in the juice.

Q: Oh, in the juice.

A: In the juice, but you don't put it in until you're ready to drink it.

Q: Okay.

A: I recommend working up to a pound and a half of meat a day. Very poor circulation, lots of scarring in your small intestines and stomach. So, I recommend you put hot water bottles, whenever you remember, before you go to sleep. Help relax that whole area and start getting rid of the scar tissue. Because you're on the thin side and you haven't been producing many cells, you haven't been able to let go of the scar tissue, so you have adhesions all over your body. Including your skin on your face is very thick with adhesions. Once you start replacing cells, once you start eating the meat to allow yourself to regenerate cells, you'll see that disappear on the inside first and then it'll happen on your face and in your skin throughout. But the reason it's happening in your face is because all the metal poisoning is going at your skin rather than the throat and sinuses as it normally does. I recommend you to have one piece of fruit a day, make sure it's in the afternoon and with an equal or more amount of fat with it. I recommend that you have avocado with pineapple once a week. Say five ounces of pineapple with about a quarter inch circular slice of not too ripe pineapple with a whole avocado once a week. Have blueberries twice a week. You could have about six ounces of blueberries with six ounces of cream or coconut cream or four ounces of butter. And you might rotate them, different fats. You have difficulty digesting the same fat repeatedly, that's why you need to alternate them. Say you had cream in the morning and butter in the afternoon and coconut cream in the evening or avocado, just make it a different fat.

Q: Does honey help with that?

A: Well, the honey mainly helps protein digestion. But that 10% of sugar will help the fat digest because sugars are needed or vitamin C or alcohol is needed. So that 10% will give whichever one that your body will utilize at the time, 10% of the honey. So the honey will help. The honey will help more with the protein digestion, which you need anyway. But it will help the fat digestion a little bit. You need the protein to digest the fat, so that's your problem. You haven't been assimilating protein, utilizing protein properly, so your fat hasn't been utilized properly, been manufactured or utilized properly. So once you start getting the proper protein in your body, then everything will turn around within probably two and a half years. Okay, you're welcome. Is that it? Oh, okay. Sorry, too late.

[laughter]

Q: You wanted to do the hand reading and another session?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I do that in the iris reading.

Q: Oh, you do?

A: I read, yeah. Yeah, if I'm doing your iridological reading, that goes along with that. So I do them together. Gives me a broader picture.

Q: And that way you don't have to pay.

A: Twice.

Q: Unless you already paid.

A: Did you pay for both?

Q: I think she may have, but we'll adjust it.

Q: I'm Chuck.

A: Hi Chuck. Okay, relax your thumbs. Okay, the right testes is in good shape. The left one is about 60% in good shape. Stabilitating. Adrenal glands are severely overactive.

Q: Is that good or bad?

A: Well, if you were on a good mellow diet, it would be good. Otherwise, it has a tendency to make you over sexual and irritable. If you don't have sex. So, with this kind of an arrangement, I suggest if you don't have a partner, you take care of yourself. Relax your thumbs again. Pancreas is almost completely shot. It has a tendency to make you more irritable. Thyroid on both sides is good. Parathyroids are not active. Thyroids are plenty active. It looks like there's scarring all around the tonsils. It doesn't look like you have them. Did you have them removed?

Q: No, I still have them.

A: You still have them? Did you have lots of sore throats?

Q: When I was younger.

A: Yeah, it just kind of deteriorated them. So, they're not active. They're not protecting your brain.

Q: Should I have them removed?

A: No! You can rebuild them. Get the raw meat. Your brain is very poisoned because of that. You've got bile and heavy metals in your brain. A lot of heavy metals in the brain there. I've never seen a group like this before. I mean, this concentration of it.

Q: Can you tell what kind of metals?

A: Pardon?

Q: There's a lot of mercury in the [unintelligible].

A: Yeah, there is.

Q: Chemtrails too.

A: All that aluminum. They're doing it down where I live too, every day.

Q: It's all the heavy metal music, man.

A: That's it. Osmosis. Absorbed through the ears. Very poor circulation on the left side. Throughout the kidney. Especially at the part where it touches the spine. Or it goes toward the spine. Poor circulation right around in here in the small intestine.

Q: Large intestine or small intestine?

A: No, it's the small here. Your large intestine is over here and this is the small right here. Almost looks like you could have a knot in here.

Q: I have problems down here a lot.

A: But it doesn't, I mean the colon looks like it's discharging some of the toxins from it but it's not the colon. It's the small intestine. Dumping it into the colon. So your problem is in the small intestine, not the colon. 

Q: I thought it was the large intestine.

A: No, large intestine looks good. Okay, going to recommend vegetable juice, 40% celery. Not absorbing oxygen well. 40% parsley, it's going to be very rich but it will be good for you. 40% cilantro and 10% carrot. Also 2-3 tablespoons of cream with your juice. Preferable to butter or coconut cream. The others could substitute once in a while but mainly cream with the juice. The meat should be a minimum of a pound and a quarter a day up to a pound and three quarters. It should be 50% red, 50% white. Once in a while you could lean more on the red, go up to 60% the red meat.

Q: What if I don't do any white?

A: You're not going to replace the tissues as well where the metal damage is.

Q: So if I butchered a chicken once a week or once a day, once a week?

A: Twice a week. Two chickens a week is about good for the amount of meat that you'll get out of it. You get about probably four pounds of meat. And you definitely need some seafood too.

Q: I have a fear about seafood. So it's hard for me to trust the store bought seafood. So I don't know what to do about seafood.

A: From the ocean, it's from the ocean. Get the swordfish, the tuna, stuff like that.

Q: Any specific type out of the store that would be less toxic? Is seafood in the store mostly toxic or is it toxic at all?

A: Well, if it's fresh water fish, consider that 33 to 35% of all fresh water is contaminated. Ocean is only 2% contaminated. You make the choice.

Q: Ahi?

A: Tuna.

Q: What about high country trout?

A: High country trout, as long as you... Yeah, they're not throwing pellets in it and feeding it garbage. Just wild trout. It's wonderful. Trout is incredible. It's my favorite.

Q: There's a big difference between hatchery trout and wild trout.

A: Huge.

Q: Hatchery trout won't turn into wild trout after a year of being in the streams.

A: It takes longer than that to really get the degenerative tissue out of it. It takes about four or five generations of trout.

Q: What about oysters?

A: Oysters are great.

Q: In jars?

A: No, in a shell. Pry them open.

Q: I know some people eat them already out of the shell in containers.

A: Not a good idea. It's better to get them live and active. All of your shellfish like oysters and clams and scallops are all farmed. When they farm those, what it means is they get to legally put a fence around a part of the ocean. It isn't like the fish that they put in hatcheries and feed them garbage. They can't do that with the shellfish. All they can do is husbandry. In other words, spread them out. Make them develop in different areas so they're not piled on top of one another so they'll develop larger. They don't poison them. They still get fed from the ocean naturally. So that farmed is okay. You could use about two quarts of milk a day. You definitely need at least two smoothies a day.

Q: I've been doing that for about a year.

A: And not smoothies, I mean lubrication formulas.

Q: Lubes, okay.

A: Pineapple would be very helpful for you. A couple of days a week, not two days in a row.

Q: Would that be for removing metals too?

A: No, just to get rid of some scar tissue and your impacted lymphatic system.

Q: Pineapple with?

A: Either coconut cream, raw cream, or butter. So have maybe a quarter of an inch thick circular slice of very under ripe pineapple. And about six to ten ounces of cream, or six ounces of coconut cream, or three ounces of butter. 

Q: Butter can take place of cream. It seems to be simpler.

A: Once a week, with your last vegetable juice, eat about twelve to thirteen little leaves of parsley, chew them, and then drink your juice.

Q: That's the parsley juice? The celery and parsley juice?

Q: Yeah, right.

Q: After his drink?

A: No, right before his drink he needs to eat about twelve to thirteen little leaves of parsley before he has his drink.

Q: What's the benefit of that?

A: Even with the parsley juice, it won't produce, he won't utilize enough chlorophyll. There's something about having the pulp which will help him utilize it a little bit better. So that these red cells will transport oxygen better. Okay. 

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: What's the difference [unintelligible]?

A: Coconut cream is a lot more cleansing, more solvent reactive. The cream will help bind with neurological toxins that will predominantly force metal to detoxification out of nerve tissue.

Q: And between whipped whipping the regular cream versus just having the cream unwhipped?

A: If you whip it, it will digest slower, more slowly. It won't escape the berries because the berries are going to be pulling out the metal. And you want their fat to be with the solvents that are made from the berries. And if you have it fresh, it's going to be absorbed too quickly and you're not going to have enough fats in the blood.

Q: There's a number of [unintelligible] that you've recommended like berries and cream to do metals. Is it in general better for them to use whipped or in some cases it's better...

A: No, it depends upon the liver's ability to digest. Yours is rapid. You could digest cream too quickly.

Q: It simply would not be recommended with...

A: Right. Anybody that would absorb and digest the cream too quickly, then I suggest that they whip it. Okay, Adam.

Q: Yes.

A: Relax your thumbs. Okay, his left testes is in pretty good shape. The right one is starting to debilitate. Lots of edema in it. Pancreas on the left side is okay. The right side is starting to debilitate but still okay. So he's got about 50% of his pancreas working, which is pretty good. Adrenal glands are extremely overactive. The right one is debilitating. The left thyroid is debilitating but still functioning. The right one is in very good shape. The right parathyroid is overworking. The left is overworking. Lots of scar tissue around the tonsils but there's a mound there so there is activity. Did you have them removed?

Q: No.

A: I thought it was maybe because the shape sometimes looks like the lymph glands are working more than the tonsils. Do you have a little nodule on the left side?

Q: No, not that I know of but maybe so.

A: Sometimes you can feel that you're swallowing more on the right if there's a nodule on the left.

Q: Not really.

A: Pay attention. You may find one. Heavy metals in the brain again. I've never seen anything like this. I wonder if it's local. Not from here.

Q: No, but I used to be a welder and I'm now a hairdresser.

A: So you have it in both professions.

Q: Yeah.

A: Definitely. Hairspray is one of the worst. And nail polish. Full of alkaloids. Evaporate. Same as solvents that you used in the metal work. I think you need to change your profession again.

Q: I've been battling that for a while.

A: You can just cut hair.

Q: That's not what pays anymore.

A: Yeah. The left side of the spine is in pretty good shape except right around the waist. Looks like there's some congestion there and some metal poisoning. On the left side, do you get any kind of lower back discomfort?

Q: I have off and on, yeah. That's usually the weak side if there's trouble.

A: The left, yeah. Well, when that starts detoxing, you may feel like you have sciatica. It'll end all sciatica. Use a hot water bottle at that time. Okay, juice, going to recommend 40% celery, 30% summer squash, especially zucchini, 20% parsley, and 10% cilantro. One week, then the next week, use 10% carrot. So alternate. Use at least two tablespoons of cream, preferably three in each juice. Do you get any severe pain, like headaches or shooting pains, or get a crink in your neck on the right side, up around your atlas?

Q: Not really.

A: If that metal starts pulling out at that point, you're going to have it.

Q: I get frontal headaches quite a bit.

A: It's going forward instead of backwards. Usually it goes down. Yours is going forward to go out the sinuses.

Q: Super.

A: Well, that's a better way than going down.

Q: Yeah.

A: Much better. It's just as rare that I ever see it go this way, when it's back there.

Q: The best thing, what I'm told, are migraine symptoms every once in a while.

A: Yeah. Well, this is mercury poisoning. That's a mercury spot. Nothing conglomerates like that unless it's mercury. Mercury, you put it down, it finds its way back to each other. It's liquid. And they use mercury in some of those solvents that they use to lubricate for metal work.

Q: And in [unintelligible], and that's all over where I work.

A: Yeah, but that's still different because that's a dried, crystallized form. It's not a liquid form, a vapor form. You know, it can vaporize and create a gas, but it crystallizes. The solvent is a fluid, and when it finds metal in the other mercury in the body, it all gravitates to a clump. And yours is clumped right there. I recommend that you eat from one and a half to two pounds of meat a day. You definitely need that much meat just to deal with the poisons, the proteins that you need to bind with those toxins. And at least a third the volume of fat to what you have of meat.

Q: That I already do, but I don't eat that much of a quantity.

A: You definitely need it. You can have whatever fruit you like in the afternoon. I wouldn't have, for about two years, I wouldn't have more than, you know, a handful. So if you've got a big apple, don't eat a whole apple. Eat half of it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Berries are better for you to help get rid of the poison, metal poisonings. So have equal fat to volume of berries. You could have more fat than that, but just minimum of an equal amount. Did I give you the ratio of red meat to white?

Q: No.

A: No. Okay, you've got some intense signs of anemia because of the metal poisoning and poor circulation in the intestines and over some parts of the spine. So I'm going to recommend about 70% red meat and 30% white. 5-10% seafood, the rest fowl. Very creative, you do need to be into something creative. Also very self-critical, another one of these people who is self-critical on one side. Now you're self-critical all the way around on both sides. Better to just keep that with yourself to make you, that's there just to make you more creative. Just, you know, just keeps your juices going but don't push it off on other people. They're never going to measure up to you.

Q: How about sleep?

A: With that kind of neurological poisoning in your brain, don't try to sleep at night too much, don't expect to. Remember what I said? If you're not sleeping at night, know that your neurological system is trying to detox. You know, if you're going to sleep, sleeping well, it's healing, but if you can't sleep, it's detoxifying. And if you detoxify and sleep and that, and you've got some parts of your brain open, it could damage the tissue and you could never sleep again, you could never be happy again, never have an imagination again. So realize that being awake when that's happening is very important. So do something creative and learn that sleep pattern that I suggested and it will work for you. And when that's happening, lots of eggs during the night when you're awake that time. You know, you could do 6 to 10 eggs during that period from 12.30, 1 o'clock to 5.30 in the morning. Okay.

Q: Wonderful. Good.

A: You're welcome. Yes.

Q: What causes the poor circulation in different parts of the body like your intestines?

A: It can be a lot of things. It can be adhesion, scar tissue. It can be hardening of the tissue because there's not enough fats in the area. Some poison has gotten in there or even minerals that are unutilizable like from water. They get planted in a certain area and they just keep drawing the fats out of the area and dehydrating them because most people eat cooked fats. So it just dries out in the area and then it hardens like sclerosis.

Q: I stayed away from fat up until last year.

A: That's your problem. That's why I said I pointed you out as my focal point when I talked about lube formula because I could see that. You're second to that. Second to his fat deficiency.

Q: I wanted to find out, when we mentioned, I don't know if you remember, but you said a pound of meat a day, but you didn't define that as far as chicken or fish as well.

A: Let me see your hands again.

Q: Because I love fish. I eat a lot of that. 

A: Lots of signs of anemia, but you also have all this acid. I suggest that you eat, just until you stabilize, about 50% red and 50% white. You need a lot more red, but right now, any more will make you too acid. Every time you eat beef, you have to eat at least three bites of fish with it.

Q: Every time I eat meat?

A: Beef.

Q: Beef, I eat fish with it.

A: Yes, at the same time, or else you're going to get too acidic, maybe even too irritable.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay?

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Yes?

Q: I've seen in the live food list a lot of discussions about people...

A: Now, I'm not a member of that list. So, the only time that I hear about it is when somebody issues something to me.

Q: Got it.

A: Okay?

Q: On that list, they have discussed quite a number of times saying that people who have started on raw foods and have been on it for like a year, year and a half, go from 100% to incorporating 10% to 15% cooked foods, like cooked meats and cooked fish. And I'm wondering...

A: We're only talking about four people.

Q: No, that's us.

A: You're only talking about four people, and those are four people that are very boisterous on the email list.

Q: Interesting.

A: Yeah.

Q: That's creating a distorted picture there.

A: Yeah, I know. That's why I don't get involved in that. That list does not reflect... Notice that it is not the Aajonus way on there.

Q: No.

A: Yes.

Q: Two questions. Is ground beef okay, and is 5-HTP okay?

A: Ground beef, it depends on who grinds it. If it's ground in a store, they use high-pressure grinders. So what it does is it homogenizes the fat. So the protein gets locked into the fat, and therefore you can't use it as a regeneration. It's good for detoxification, it's good for fuel, but it's not good if you want to get younger and healthier and stronger. If you put it in a food processor like a Cuisinart and grind it up that way, there's no homogenization because there's no pressure, and that's fine. 

Q: So if I buy store-bought ground beef, then I'm not going to get [unintelligible]?

A: You're not going to get regenerative tissue out of it. Most of it, well, you're going to get a little bit, but most of it's going to be for, go as fuel, so it's a big waste.

Q: And then I take it you would probably recommend against, well, you don't recommend, but 5-HTP is a part of this diet?

Q: What's HTP?

Q: It's like a precursor to tryptophan, it's just something I started taking for depression.

A: It's a supplement.

Q: What about Coleman meats versus North Star bison? Coleman meats is around $4 a pound, North Star bison is around $8, including shipping.

A: Well, North Star is mainly grazed, it's more organic, and it's more wild. Coleman is mainly grain-fed, so it's much fattier, and it's higher in carbohydrates, which cows are not normally used to, so it weakens their tissue a little bit.

Q: Should I focus on North Star bison then? It's so expensive.

A: I would say when you become wealthier, do that. I mean, I lived on Coleman for 20 years before I could even get anything else, before the New Zealand or the Australian all-grazed beef came in, or the buffalo came in all-grazed. 20 years I ate.

Q: What about deer?

A: Deer are wonderful. Deer, yeah, bag them all the time.

Q: I need to go in with him or something. Bag one and you'll have plenty.

Q: More expensive than that.

Q: Oh, really?

A: Oh, yes, it's pretty expensive. I mean, if you've got them all around here, plug one. You guys can split it.

Q: In terms of chicken, it occurs to me that...

A: As long as it's on your private property, you can really fight it in court. Anything that's on your property is your property. Except if it's human.

[laughter]

Q: I realized that the chicken that I got when I was on the road was Rosy. I mean, should I not even eat it?

A: I won't touch it.

Q: Don't even eat it.

A: I had it for six months and I started getting fogged brain and problems that were related to fowl. So I thought, oh, I'd better check. So I called the chemist at Rosy and I said, hey, you know, I've got thousands of people eating your Rosy, but they're going to stop. I said, you have to find a different source of protein, but it's so inexpensive. I said, then that's your choice.

Q: So is there a place? I guess I'll ask around. I don't know.

Q: We can get Rocky.

A: Oh, good.

Q: Where is it?

A: OK, guys, I guess we're finished, aren't we? Any last questions?

Q: One more question about Coleman beef. I was getting the steak, you know, at the top sirloin, and then I started getting the cube steak.

A: What is that one?

Q: Cube steak. It's a little more tenderized. It's not hamburger, but it's just tender.

Q: They run anything over it?

A: Uh-huh. Jab it and spike it to death. That's fine.

Q: It's not that high-pressure thing that you're talking about?

A: No. That's just a roller with spikes in it.

Q: It's actually really good.

Q: It is.

A: It's usually tougher. They usually use bottom round for that or brisket, so it's really tough. So it's good stuff. They just tenderize it first.

Q: Yeah, okay, because it's just a lot cheaper, fairly cheaper than the top sirloin.

A: Yeah, they can't sell it without grinding it or tenderizing it.

Q: And the hamburgers, like you said, I guess it's just...

A: Yeah, not a good thing to get. Grind your own. I take my meat, I'll cut it up into slices and then put it in a food processor. I'm having a tooth detox right now. I mean, there's no pain until I chew. But I liquefy my meat. I mean, it's just pate here. And you can do that in a food processor without pressure, so it's fine.

Q: Did you put anything else in with meat?

A: No. I did with my fish. I made a sauce with butter, ginger, and honey. Very tasty sauce with my swordfish. So I made a pate of that whole mixture.

Q: Now, regarding swordfish, as far as I know, it's a seriously over-fished fish. And so many fishes in the seas are now seriously over-fished that it's really hard to choose what kinds of fish in accord to whether or not it's over-fished or not. Because if you're eating an over-fished fish, you're contributing to the problem of depletion of the fish of the sea. And that's a serious problem. And swordfish, as far as I know, is one of the over-fished fish.

A: Because it's a big fish, it's easy to catch. Marlins are out there, you know, you can catch one and it feeds a lot of people. That doesn't mean it's low. That doesn't mean that the population is lower. They can't tell.

Q: They're getting smaller. Their catches are getting smaller. Their sizes are getting smaller. And they're getting to the point where they're catching them before they're getting to the reproducing stage in age to, you know, continue their population. So that's a real problem.

A: Don't know that that's true, though. We don't know that the adults may be so learned now that they're not going for the bait. Just the young, hungry ones are going for it. Swordfish are one of the smartest fish out there besides dolphins.

Q: That's correct.

A: And they are avoiding us. Yes. 

Q: One more question. I'll leave you alone. I grow garlic, and I wonder if there's any benefit to garlic.

A: It all depends. It can cause high blood pressure or low blood pressure. If it causes either of those, it can be a problem. For me, it makes me so horny I can't sleep unless I have sex or masturbate or something. So, other people, most people, it lowers their blood pressure and settles them down. For me, it does just the opposite.

Q: Is it actually an antibiotic at all?

A: You'd have to take an enormous amount of it, and I only suggest people take little slices. Not eat much. It's medicinal. If you're on a cooked diet, a lot of that kind of medicinal herb is appropriate. But on this kind of a diet, you're just dealing with the poisons that are detoxed, so it's not as concentrated.

Q: When I first started eating raw, I wanted to eat a lot of garlic, and now I hardly eat any. It was kind of a transition.

A: So if you're putting out a lot of toxins that cause high blood pressure, and for you it lowers it, it's an appropriate thing to eat as long as that's happening. All right, folks. It's been a good day.

A: Thank you.
