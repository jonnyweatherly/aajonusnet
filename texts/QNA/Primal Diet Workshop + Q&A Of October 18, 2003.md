A: Well thank you all for coming. I'm here to talk about nutrition from a different perspective, so some friendly faces I've seen here before. My name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz and I was a person who was born a very sickly child into a violent household which made it even sicker. When I was a year and a half, I was given a tetanus shot, my third already at a year and a half. I had a brother who was very violent. I was born when he was still in diapers and he didn't appreciate that, me taking all the attention away. So he used to hurt me all the time and he'd always push me down on rusty nails and things like that. So tetanus shots, I got a lot of those. They say they last ten years, but you know in the forties, they would say they last six months, they last a year. They were given to me about every three months because of the injuries. The third one, when I was a year and a half, you know they have thimerosal in them, which is liquid mercury, and it causes about 6 to 800 times more autism. So that one went to my brain and caused autism. So I could no longer communicate, just beginning to, and then all of a sudden I couldn't. I could never associate words with any kind of a dialogue between anybody. I couldn't comprehend letters would become words and words could become ideas or concepts. So I had that going against me. I didn't look autistic because I wasn't born congenitally autistic. So I looked normal. So everybody thought I was just a belligerent kid who didn't talk. So I got punished even greater, especially I was raised in Catholicism and the nuns used to beat the hell out of me and so did the priests because I never answered them, didn't know what to do. By the time I was eight, I had learned to develop sound patterns, sound bites and I could most of the time repeat them, not all the time accurately, but repeat them and get some kind of response from it. So I was able to make it through and in school I would always pick the smartest girl in the room, sit next to her and copy her hieroglyphs on the page, never know what it meant, but I at least got through the school that was C's and D's with a lot of beatings and a lot of detention and stuff like that. By the time I reached 12 years old, I had peritonitis which was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. They went in there and took the appendix out anyway just in case it caused me problems in the future and they continued to treat me. I was getting injections every three to four hours in the arms and buttocks for four days. Didn't know how to treat it, didn't know what to do about it. That created a lot of problems. I went into diabetes shortly after that. Of course, diabetes runs in the family. I have eight cousins who were diabetic by the time they were 15 years old and lots of aunts and uncles who were diabetic, still are. A lot of psychological problems because of my autism but it was not diagnosed. Again, I was just a belligerent person. By the time I reached 19, I got an ulcer that turned tumors from the treatments, lots of Maalox. To handle that, they decided to commit surgery and removed the tumor, sewed me back up. They severed all the vagus nerves to the stomach. They gave me a vagotomy pyloroplasty, which means they severed all the vagus nerves to the stomach so I would never again secrete hydrochloric acid. I was put in the category of octogenarians who don't secrete hydrochloric acid. They told me, 19 years old, that I would never again be able to eat raw food because of the danger of parasitical and bacterial food invasion, that a parasite would get into my brain and I'd be an idiot. I was already an idiot. 

I was still not 20 years old and I still couldn't read. I still couldn't comprehend. I learned a lot of sound bites to be able to communicate to an extent but never carry on any kind of an intellectual debate or communication at all. It was simple, maybe fifth, five-year-old kind of communications. Then the incision went tumorous. It got to be almost an inch high at places and up to an inch wide and one place two inches and they decided that they had to treat that with radiation therapy. So they gave me ten weeks of intense radiation therapy, cauterized my spine so my whole spine was fused and this was my movement. I'm 20 years old. So after they finished burning me, that turned the bone marrow into a degenerative situation that they diagnosed as multiple myeloma which is cancer of the blood and bone. So then they said, well now you have to have chemotherapy. So I had the chemotherapy. By the time we were finished with that I was crawling on the floor because I had no muscle response from pectorals down so I had to crawl around on the floor like a worm. After three months of that I said, well this is enough of your treatments. I come to you with an ulcer and I end up with cancers all over my system. Then they diagnosed after the chemotherapy that I had lymphoma. There is nobody living on this earth which has had those cancers and has lived beyond a year and a half. So I decided to go home to die. Because I was still autistic and couldn't communicate. I didn't want to go to the hospice. So I went to my home. I was almost all children who are autistic have a particular unusual talent that they don't even know how it works. I was able to computer program. Show me a piece of paper and I could write a program, ever knowing how I did it, it would be perfect. I made a lot of money doing that. So here I was a retarded kid, able to make a lot of money. So I was able to have volunteers come into my home and take care of me. They came in twice a week. They would shop for me and clean the house and do some cooking. One of them was an 18-year-old black kid. He was one of the, I don't know if anybody remembers, this was way back in the late 60s, the Going Thing, this Ford group. They had a bunch of kids that they hired to go around singing all over the country, you know, pop songs. Anyway, he was one of the Going Things. He was a kid that got rich very quick by this and he was a volunteer. He brought me a little book that was 82 pages. What the hell was I going to do with an 82-page book? But he explained that carrot juice, raw carrot juice, this woman reversed her cancer, her uterine cancer, supposedly by drinking a gallon of raw carrot juice a day. What all that meant, I didn't know. But he got me to drink the carrot juice so I started drinking and after about 10 days, my brain shifted. All of a sudden I was no longer autistic. I understood words. I understood how to communicate. So I was delighted. So I realized that maybe it had something to do with this carrot juice. So I borrowed $110, because I was broke by that time, $110 and went out and bought all these books on nutrition. I went in a wheelchair and all that, pick out the books. All I did was stay home and read for 6 weeks these books. After a while, because everything that you read contradicts everything else in nutrition.

So it was very confusing and I didn't know quite what was the truth and what wasn't. So, and then there was all this mind over matter philosophy. These self-help books would tell you it's all in the mind. So I pooh-poohed the nutritional thing that was a coincidence with the carrot juice. So I stopped drinking the carrot juice and went back to my donuts and cigarettes and Coca-Cola and RC-Cola. And within about 9 days, I was autistic again. And that's even worse, because once you've had the ability to communicate, it's like something, the plug's pulled. So it was even more devastating. So I went back to drinking the carrot juice and some raw foods and after about 10 days it came back again. So my ability to communicate. So, you know, I'm reading and reading, getting into it, getting into more raw foods and then more books on, you know, it's mind over matter and if you can accomplish the mind over matter, you don't have to worry about what you eat. So that's the ultimate, see. So I was going to go for that. So I stopped the raw food again. I'm going to do it. But I went back into autism again. So I decided, well, I can't wait to get the mind over matter thing. I'm just going to have to discipline myself and do the dietary because that's, that worked almost immediately, so relatively. So I continued with studying nutrition for two and a half years and got a nutritionist who tutored me for three and a half years after that. And then I decided it was all too confusing because he was very, he was 80 to 85 percent raw fooder, but not raw meats. And he was against fats. Can you imagine an Italian that's against fats? This guy was against fats. And those were the only things that made me feel good was eating lots of raw fats, lots of raw cream, avocados, and raw butter. So I had to get away from him, and I thought the only way I'm going to find the answers is to go out and live in the wild, find primitive tribes, live with animals. So at that stretch between 1968 when I had my last treatments, all the way to 73, I got well enough to where, you know, I could bend over this far, I could at least touch my knees. Before that, I could not touch my knees after the cauterization of my spine. So I got on a bicycle, the saddlebags loaded with all these books, and I took off in a little bitty Lhasa Apso dog in the back of my crate, and I started traveling all over the continental United States, I mean continental America, North America, all the way from Yucatan to Alaska, and all the way from the west coast to the east coast, for three years. I lived with about five Indian tribes, several in Mexico, two in the United States, and one in Alaska, which was not necessarily the United States at that time. And they all told me to eat raw meat. Now, I was a raw food vegetarian, vegan at this point, and even when I went out in the wild, I couldn't get the dairy, so I was definitely raw food vegan. So, whenever I ate cooked foods, after the stomach surgery, I would, the meat would putrefy so badly in my system that I'd break out, I'd look like I'd had, you know, I'd gone through a meat grinder.

In fact, a friend of mine in Los Angeles said that I looked like raw hamburger after I'd eat raw meat because I'd just pustulate all over from the hips all the way up to the head. So, I was very afraid of eating any kind of meat. So, I was very against meat. I was a diehard vegetarian. I was also against hurting animals. So, you know, I didn't realize, you know, well, plants are alive. If you rip the leaves off of them, you know, it's doing the same thing. So, it's, you know, it's segregating, it's discriminating. But I didn't realize at the time I was for the animals and you weren't allowed to kill animals. So, I was a diehard evangelistic vegan. But at the end of two and a half years of living outdoors and you talk about stress, that is stress. There's no such thing as stress in our little confined environment. When you live outdoors every day going from 50 to 80 degree change every day from morning to night and living in all of the elements, that's stress. So, my skin got very thick and I looked like all the pictures of the Native American Indians that were very raw and leathery from living outdoors for that long and I was very weak again. I went down to about 118 pounds. And I had been suffering with the multiple myeloma, the bone cancer. It's like having arthritis and rheumatism together in every joint in the body. There were times I couldn't even lift up a twig with the right arm because it was so painful. So, at this point after two and a half years I couldn't even ride the bicycle. So, I decided to fast myself to death because I just didn't want to deal with it anymore. So, I chose this old Indian burial ground in a desert near Palm Springs in Southern California and began fasting myself to death, drinking a little bit of water every day just so the headaches wouldn't get so severe. And there was a den of coyotes that lived in the canyon. I had lived with alligators, I had lived with all kinds of creatures and I watched them always eat the normal thing but I was still so prejudiced against the raw meat that I wouldn't do it. So, the coyotes came down and kept waking me up at midnight every night. And they would howl, they'd sound like crazy people in a loony bin and just howling like that and they'd wake me and they'd just play this game. After about two weeks it got to be where I could sense where they were without them even moving. And I guess that was their clue, so the next night I had built this little overhang just to shelter myself from the heat of the sun mainly. Sometimes I had to go up and crawl up in a cave because it got to 140 degrees in the daytime. But the coyotes, one of the coyotes came up and put it, I was naked, and put its cold wet nose on my knee and woke me. And it backed away from where I was and went like this. So what was I going to do? I thought this is just a dream, I'm going to follow the coyote. So I followed the coyote. Feebly, you know, I'm pretty weak at this point. Two weeks into the fast and I knew it was going to take me 40 to 60 days to die by fasting. So the coyotes took me on a little hunt with them and they captured a jackrabbit, about a year old, about seven and a half pounds, ears stood about this tall, head was about like this, pretty big animals.

So they caught it, ripped it open, put it at my feet. Now I hadn't eaten meat in six and a half years at this point. And, you know, I looked at that and I thought, oh my God, this is the Easter bunny, you know, bloody and warm and all this stuff. And then I remembered all the sound bites that I heard my father and my uncles who were doctors tell all of the relatives when we were on reunions that when they went hunting, never to eat a wild rabbit because it could have a bacteria in it that would kill a human in two days very painfully. So I thought, oh, coyotes are going to help me die quickly. Two days of pain, easy, no problem, rather than, you know, 40 to 60 days of fasting with severe headaches and nausea all the time. So I picked up the rabbit and began eating and, of course, it came right back up. It was warm. It was raw. So I had problems with that. So I psyched myself up. I sat down for five minutes and I psyched myself up. It's like, you're going to eat this thing. It's your way out, quick way out. Otherwise, suffering. Two days of suffering, lifetime of suffering. What are you going to do? So I start, I picked up the rabbit and I began eating it. And, you know, I kept wanting to come up. And after about ten bites, it started to get pretty delicious. So I ate about three, three and a half pounds. And then the coyote shared the rest of it. So I went back to my campsite to die. And I knew that I was dying because I had many operations, you know, throughout the years. And I died twice on the operating table and they revived me. And you hear the stories about going into the tunnel of light and how bright it is. Well, my experience was that when I died, one time I did recreational drugs and lowered my blood pressure so badly that I died and I was out for three hours and 17 minutes. But I had died over a heater so it kept my body warm enough so I was able to be revived. Anyway, I knew that I was dying after eating this rabbit because I felt too good. And when I left the body in those near death experiences, it was pain free, it was euphoric. So I knew that I was on my way to dying so I wanted to die back in my sleeping bag. So I went back there because it was starting to get chilly at this hour, it was probably about 4.30 in the morning. And in the desert when the temperature drops, this is in mid-September, so when the temperature drops, it drops fast at night. So I got back into my sleeping bag, woke the next day, but I was still on this planet and I knew that I hadn't died, but I didn't feel as badly. And usually I had to be in the sun for two hours before I could even move because the bone pain was so bad from the bone cancer. So I noticed that within a half an hour I was able to get out of my sleeping bag. So I felt better and I was waiting for two days, I was waiting for the bacteria to hit, stomach cramps to start and to die. It never happened. Three days later I'm still feeling better than I probably had in my entire life and it dawned on me. Raw meat, Indian tribes trying to give, Native tribes trying to give me raw meat, every one of them. And I refused to do it.

Raw meat. Raw meat's the answer. So what happens, a little sidewinder starts, a big sidewinder starts going right by me. So I had seen the Indians kill snakes. So I just walked up, put my foot on its head, picked it up by right in front of the rattler and spun it. And then realized, well, I've never done this before. Do I know that the head's going to snap off or is the snake going to turn around and bite me? So I'm worried of spinning this thing for five minutes, deciding, you know, getting up the guts to snap it. So finally I snapped it and sure enough the head just shot right off and peeled it back and ate it and it tastes like raw fish. It does not taste like chicken. And lots of bones. But it gave me lots of energy and I knew that living in the desert was not going to be easy. So I got on my bicycle and visited all the farms around within 20 miles. And I got work so I could work for chickens, meat, eggs, dairy. Within three months I had gained 50 pounds and I looked like a, you know, a shrunken Arnold Schwarzenegger. So I knew this was the answer. So I went back to Los Angeles to spread the great news. And everybody says, are you crazy? You can't eat raw meat. You're going to get a parasite, a brain parasite and you'll be an idiot. I said, well, I've already been that. And this is the only thing that makes me feel good. This is the only thing that's really working. So I'm going to continue doing it. But it scared the hell out of me because I didn't want to go back into a state like I experienced with autism for 22 years. So I ate the raw meat maybe three times a week only. So maybe I can say consumed a pound and a half, two and a half pounds of meat a week at the most. It was mainly fish. And... So the improvements were very gradual, very slow. I consumed enormous amounts of raw dairy and raw cream. It was helpful. But I always worried that this is the time that I'm going to get that brain parasite and be an idiot again. After 13 years of eating raw meat and a few years later, 1982, 76 is when I had the experience with the coyotes. 82, I began eating raw meat on a daily basis. So 13 years from 1976, which was 89, I realized, wait a minute, I haven't had a parasite at all. And I have no vagus nerve. I have no hydrochloric acid in my stomach. Where do these these so-called authorities get off telling people that they get parasites from eating raw meat? So I began to question it and I looked in every university I could find and not one clinical test had been done anywhere. This was all supposition, written as law, dictated to the masses. And it's that way with any raw food, I'll tell you, that's a problem. The bacteria and parasites in it will cause that in you. So I did some experiments. I pinworm infested salmon that undulated with pinworms. It was nearly white. I had my feces, urine and blood checked for 10 weeks, now one parasite. So then I ate some calves brain that was infested. Again, no reaction, no parasites. I discontinually, and some of you may have seen me on Ripley's Believe It or Not last year, twice on Ripley's Believe It or Not, I ate meat that was infested.

There was a food inspector there who would say, you're going to die if you eat this. I mean, I had parasites. I had, you know, bacteria, E. coli, everything on this meat. I'd let some of it go for a year and three months, that long. So it was green, it was black, it had molds, it had bacteria, it had everything in it. And I ate it without any diarrhea, without any ill reaction whatsoever. So I'm telling you that the myth out there, that you're going to get bacteria, bacterial food poisoning from meat, or parasites from meat, is absolutely fiction, it's myth. Ran an experiment with 30 animals. None of them were healthy. We gave them all this infested bacteria in meat with parasites. Not one of the 30 got any parasites. Only clinical test that I know of didn't run. Proved it. Doesn't happen. So, what does that mean? Does that mean you can eat raw meat and be healthy? It certainly does. Because anytime you eat any kind of food cooked, by the time you reach 144 degrees, you start destroying the enzymes. The enzymes are responsible for separating, for fractionating the molecules in your food, and for re-assimilating them into a product for you to utilize as lubrication, as fuel, as detoxifiers, which are solvents, and as building matter. You lose the enzymes, where does your body get those enzymes? How does it replace them? It goes into every cell of your body. The pancreas sends out a hormone, a variety of hormones that says, we need you to go around like thugs and take a little bit from every cell, every time you eat a cooked food. So, this little bit taken from everything causes the depletion in health over a long period. Not only do you have a loss of enzymes at low temperature, by the time you hit 122 degrees, they are all dead and destroyed, and minerals start cauterizing, like the phosphorus is destroyed about 98 degrees. Starts altering at 98 degrees, destroyed by 103 degrees. By the time you hit 118 degrees, you start destroying your vitamin A, and vitamin C, by the time you hit 141 degrees, which is normal pasteurizing temperature, 50% of your calcium is cauterized, unassimilable. Vitamins, all neutralized, cannot be assimilated properly. By the time you hit 178, you have nothing alive left. The order of vitamins, gone, destroyed. 178, that's no big temperature, is it, for cooking? Most people cook 225 on up. That's not the only thing that happens. You start having byproducts that form, and these are toxic byproducts. The main ones are heterocyclic amines, lipid peroxides, and acrylamides. The lipid peroxides are the toxicity formed from fats, cooking fats. The heterocyclic amines are those created, toxins created from cooking the proteins. And the acrylamides are those from cooking carbohydrates. Those are the main, in my book, the recipe for living without disease. The last 70 pages, it's all the clinical information, laboratory information, that I cite all of the known toxins from cooking. There's a lot of them. But those are the main ones that have been linked to cancer, and when they accumulate, and they accumulate for a very long time, and that's why our cancer rate is, in men it's one out of every two, and women it's one of every three, gets cancer now, according to Samuel Epstein, the world's greatest, or most renowned researcher in oncology.

That's not a very pretty picture. And then you couple that with all the toxins from chemical farming, pesticides, and the basic environment, environmental pollution. You add to that, and now you can understand why there's no way the medical profession is going to get ahead. No way. Now, let me take this a little bit farther for you. Let's say that your body relies upon this bacteria to help you. Let's say that we live in such a sterile environment that you don't have parasites anymore in your body, you don't have high bacterial levels, so that's like getting rid of all the vultures and the crows and the ants, all those creatures who eat decaying animals. What happens if you get rid of all those? The whole planet becomes a gaseous, toxic waste dump because you have no creatures to eat the decaying tissue. Well, in your body environment, it's the same thing. That's what the bacteria and parasites do. They're the janitors. They go in there, eat up dead tissue quickly. Now, what happens? You feed yourself seven pounds of food a day and it comes out one fecal matter that's about this big, if you're lucky and don't have diarrhea, or if you're unlucky and don't have diarrhea. You get a fecal matter, so it reduces all this food into this amount. Same thing with parasites and bacteria. They will eat this enormous amount of toxicity in your system and reduce it to a small fraction. Sometimes one hundredth of what they eat will be discharged into a small amount. Easy to eliminate. What happens if we don't have those helpers? We have to make solvents, which are soaps, and go in and dissolve this toxic matter. Then what happens? You have all of this water that you have to dilute the compounds. What happens when you have all this fluid? It's poisoning everywhere, mass fluid. It's like, you know, you wash the floor. You have soap in this big tub of water. It's not reducing it, it's expanding it. It's distributing it everywhere in the body by doing that. So I got to thinking, wait a minute. People who are depressed are probably depressed because the body's depressed, has no bacteria in it. These are people who've been taking drugs usually or had massive reactions to things like drug therapy as a child, maybe polio treatments or asthmatic treatments. So I started looking in my patients who had had these histories and had lots of depression or psychological problems. So I went to one specifically who had been on drugs for 27 years, five a day. She was diagnosed with schizophrenia, bipolar, manic depression, everything. Here was a woman in her 40s, early 40s, who never had a relationship in her life. She wasn't stable enough to be in any relationship. She'd chew people's heads off. A good day for talking with this woman was, I feel good today. And that was good. So I told her, I said, you know, I've got this theory that your body's low in bacteria and parasites. Let's start feeding you some old-aged, highly bacterialized, probiotic meat. I'm already on this crazy diet. I have to eat this, all this raw meat. I'm not going to do this. Slam. A year and a half this went on. Tried to get her to do it. Finally, she tried it. Ten minutes changed her. Ten minutes after eating it.

I wasn't going to answer the phone, because I knew that I'd have to babysit for all evening and all night long. So I just hear these messages come on. Each time the message goes, I just ate that raw meat about 45 minutes ago. I'm really nervous. But her whole voice was different, the whole tone. By the morning, she was calling me every 45 minutes to an hour, all through the night. This is, she started about somewhere around 8.30 in the evening. So here it was, 5 o'clock in the morning. She's whistling for me to answer the phone, waiting for me to answer the phone. It changed her. She eats it every day. No longer on medication. She has a boyfriend who is a Chippendale - she's no hottie, you know, by looks. She's pretty good, but she has this guy who's 10 years younger than she is, this Chippendale model who's totally in love with her because she is so happy and, you know, not having to depend upon medications and not into depression at all anymore. And she eats this high, stinky, rotten meat every day. Only a little bit. About a ping-pong ball size amount every day. Changed her life. Stinks like hell. Refrigerator smells like hell. But it works. So I started doing it with a lot of other people. And guess what? It works with 99% of the people. I've only had two people out of a thousand come back and say it didn't do anything for them. Two people out of a thousand. Pretty good rate. So now that I've really disturbed everybody, it's about time to take some questions and answers. What time is it? I didn't have a watch. 

Q: 10 to 1. 

A: 10 to 1. Okay. So we have about 15 minutes of questions and answers, and then we're going on to the workshop. If anybody's... What I'm going to do is explain how to do a good diet, to do it balanced, to get the most effective, to get the most advantage out of a good raw diet, and to reduce symptomology. So that's what we'll be getting into in the workshop. So if anybody's interested and hasn't signed up for the workshop, see Harry. Okay? But now we're going to do questions and answers before we take a 10-minute break. Yes?

Q: Is there any way to get that bacteria without eating the funky meat?

A: Yeah, you can eat fecal matter.

[laughter]

Q: I would be interested in what would be a diet that would be useful to a person who runs marathons or practices yoga or tai chi?

A: Did everyone hear the question?

Q: No.

A: He's wondering, what is a good diet for an athlete? I have many athletes on this diet. I have a 59-year-old martial artist who went on the diet two years ago. He jump ropes to practice, to get his stamina up. You know, like a boxer, you have to be constantly on the move and you have to have good air capacity, wind capacity. So he jump ropes three times a week. One time he used to do 2,750 jumps one day. Then the next time he did about 7,000 jumps. Then the third time, 12,500 jumps. He can do it in an hour. When he started the diet, his heart rate after he would do any of those was around 170 to 180, and he had charted it. When he went on the diet, within a year on the diet, he was down to 108. Heart rate was only 108 after doing that kind of jumping. Sometimes it was all the way down to 98. It's pretty good, isn't it? I noticed that after I was on the raw diet and eating raw meat for two years, I had never been athletic because I was so sickly and I couldn't play with other kids that I was just dragged with my mother everywhere. When I started feeling like Arnold Schwarzenegger probably felt, I started exercising. I'd do 250 push-ups with my legs up at least this high. I did 50 a day handstand push-ups against the wall, and I would run 5 to 13 miles a day. My heartbeat was almost identical. You know, it was almost like 90 to 92. While I was running, and stopped. I ran barefoot on gravel around a track. What your body can do when it gets the right nutrients and it's concentrated is pretty phenomenal.

Q: How long were you on the raw diet before you started feeling some relief of the pain in your bones?

A: You know, the question was how long were you on the raw diet with the raw meat before you had relief from bone pain. That varied, because when you have that much toxicity in the bone marrow, it's hard to get out. Bone marrow doesn't have an immense amount of blood running through it, nor a lymphatic system like the rest of our bodies does to get things out quickly. So it has to move out the joints and move out slowly. So it was probably about 13 years before I was almost painless. But I was also learning how to refine the diet for the next many years. I wasn't eating meat every day. It made a big difference. I have people who have arthritis and rheumatism that have joints like this, and after seven years on the diet, they have no pain whatsoever, and the swelling's down to a tenth of what it was. And they're functioning, not in wheelchairs anymore.

Q: What I was curious to know is, the toxins, they're really difficult to get out in your bones, right? What would happen if a person spent some time in perhaps a hyperbaric chamber, do you think?

A: What he asked was, since toxins are so difficult to get out of the bone marrow, we're getting into a hyperthermic, hyperbaric pressure chamber, basically, to remove it. I haven't found that works at all. The only thing that I've found that helps is soaking in a hot bath for hours. That's how I survived with my bone cancer, because when I had the bone cancer, if I didn't, if I wasn't in a bathtub in water, warm water, if I would sleep on any area of my body, I would wake after 10, 15 minutes and excruciating pain. My body's need to move and to turn over and to get into another position. So, I never went into REM sleep. So, then I went into the bath one time and I put milk in the bath, you know, trying anything and everything, put milk in the bath, I put some sea salt in the bath, put some vinegar in the bath, and I fell asleep in the bath. And I woke up two hours later freezing, but I had slept for two solid hours. So, I re-warmed the water, went back to sleep, re-warmed the water. Every hour and a half to two hours, I'd wake up cold, re-warm the water, and go to sleep. So, I realized that when you're in a bath and you have a lot of pain, you're in there a little while, the nerves work differently. They start, instead of taking all of the pain energy and taking it to your brain to register, it starts shooting out the body. So, as long as I was in the bath, you know, for a half an hour or longer, all of the pain discharged. So, I found that the milk, the vinegar, and the sea salt created a slight buoyancy. So, it helped me discharge the pain so I could sleep. It would also make the day much less painful, or make me much less painful through the day. 

Q: Do you have a ratio for the bath? 

A: Yeah, it depends upon your water. L.A. water has 192 chemicals in it. I don't know what you have in Chicago. But in L.A. I use 3 cups of water, I mean 3 cups of raw milk, 2 heaping tablespoons of sun-dried sea salt, and 2 ounces of raw unpasteurized vinegar. Apple cider vinegar. And that works wonderfully. So, if ever you're in severe pain, no matter if it's tooth, headaches, no matter what it is, headaches are the ones that least respond, because the skull is hard to close, to relax the sinew, and allow the skull to expand. Headaches are always because the brain's expanded, and there's no room in the skull. So, I recommend people put hot water bottles against their head, not on top, but at the sides, to heat, so all the fissures can open up, so the skull can expand. Skull expands, headaches go away.

Q: Hot, not cold, huh?

A: Hot, always hot. Well, you could cause your brain to shrink, you know, by putting cold water in anywhere, cold water, but the problem with that is, and especially for athletes, once you apply cold water, cold compresses, ice packs, you prevent circulation into that area. The increased circulation is to provide more nutrients for the detoxification to get rid of the bruised and damaged tissue, and the blood and serums that are floating around there, and to supply nutrients for healing. And if you apply ice, you just create a scar tissue in that area, because you've limited the access of your body to provide nutrients for that area, so it scars. So you can do the same thing, it may take 20 minutes longer, and you may go through more pain for that 20 minutes, but once you get through that 20 minutes, the pain is released. Yes?

Q: I was wondering if you could talk about sea salts?  

A: When I get into the workshop end of it. That's a little bit more drawn out. Somebody had a question back here? Yes?

Q: Someone that, let's say, [unintelligible]. What specific thing in your diet can help address that?

A: Two eggs every hour, every 40 minutes to an hour, nothing else, Rocky style. Keep downing eggs. Remember Rocky? Who saw Rocky? Not everybody saw Rocky. But Rocky, before he goes and works out, he takes a glass, he breaks five eggs to it, and then downs them like that, and it's all running out of his mouth. You have to go like this or it doesn't work.

Q: So if you put vanilla extract in there, it still works?

A: Nope.

Q: [unintelligible] I have two of them. One of them will do it, and one won't.

A: Well, the one that doesn't, put a little cream and honey with it, and then you can blend it. But if you blend eggs, if you whip them, without something coating it like raw cream, they will oxidize, and three enzymes that are in the egg white will not allow cancer to progress if they're alive and active. And whipping them like that for even two seconds neutralizes those three enzymes. So you don't want to blend them unless you have cream with it, or milk, or something like that. Or just eat them raw, straight, Rocky style.

Q: Well, how about with cod liver oil?

A: Remember, all pressed oils, this is, I'm going to get into the workshop, but I'll give you a hint of it. All pressed oils are solvent reactive. They do not lubricate the system. They do not assuage the system. They do not heal the system. They are there to clean your system out. They are soaps. So you put that with the egg, and you're going to create a massive detoxification. It could cause more pain. 

Q: So what kind of raw fat are you talking about?

A: Well, we were just talking about raw eggs.

Q: The cream.

A: The raw cream. Raw cream is the best to mix with the eggs.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, won't work. Butter, if you melt it, you know, in low temperatures, you know, put the butter in a jar and immerse it in a bowl of warm water, and then you blend it with the eggs, that's fine. Yeah. You had a question?

Q: Yeah, I was just going to ask, did you recommend eating raw meat from non-organic animals?

A: Well, yeah. If you can't get anything else, definitely. I had a girlfriend in Paris from 93 to 96, and I was going to Paris about three times a year, and she was coming here three times a year, and I would spend up to a month in Paris with her, and I was eating out of Carrefour Supermarkets, because there wasn't anything else. Carrefour Supermarkets is like Ralph's, or A&P, or one of those. And after three and a half years, she broke up with me because I wouldn't marry her. So on the trip home, plane home, I'm reading this article that said that Carrefour Supermarkets, all of those years had been buying and selling the mad cow meat from England, and it didn't affect me. So I've been eating it. But in a laboratory test that I did, we took seven animals. I was one of the animals. And we fed half of us raw and half cooked. And the animals that ate it, raw, the toxins, and we did this also with swordfish because of the high mercury in the sea. So we took that and analyzed how much mercury was in that meat, and it was all from the same fish. So we knew how much was concentrated in the tissue. We checked urine, we checked feces, and we checked blood to see how much was active in the blood, but how much was excreted to the feces and urine within the next 36 hours. And no other food was consumed except for tomatoes. To keeps the water level up. And those tomatoes had no toxins in them because they were organic. 98% of the mercury and other toxins that were found in the raw flesh passed out in the urine and feces. In the animals who ate it cooked, 5% to 8% passed out only. So cooking destroys, fractionates the fat molecules that normally bind with the toxins and prevent them from damaging you. Obviously your body and intestines are intelligent enough to know that hey, we don't want to digest this. Because in the animals, including myself, that ate it raw, the fat molecules that were bound to those toxins were relatively undigested. So the body knows and can determine as it passes through the intestines. However, once it's cooked, everything's fractionated. Everything is dispersed. So the poisons go into the system. Yes?

Q: Why do people have problems with freshwater fish, if that's the case? Because when those pass through also, or is there just too many?

A: Well, I don't know that that exists. I've looked at the people in Hawaii who've done that. And what I find is the people who are affected by high levels of mercury and so-called raw foods are not eating the fish very raw. They're cooking it a little bit. And also, they are high fruit eaters. And the fruit goes in and destroys fat levels, increases hydrochloric acid, and a lot of fluids that will break down fats and look for fats. When you have a fat-starved body and you've got fat that comes into the system, that body is going to get it whether it's bound with fat molecules or not. I mean, whether those fat molecules are bound with toxins or not, it's still going to go for that fat. That will disperse it into your body. So that's why in the workshop we're going to get into how to do the diet balanced so you don't have any problems or reducing the problems. You're still going to have problems because if you've eaten cooked foods in your life, you have toxins stored in your body, period, absolute, that's it. This diet does not provide for you to put more toxins into the system so that when you detoxify, anytime the body tries to detoxify, cold, flu, sores, aches, and pains, the body is discharging those poisons. This diet doesn't change whether anybody detoxifies or not. All it provides is that you have the proper nutrients to detoxify properly and heal properly. So then you get younger and healthier every day instead of going downhill every day as people do when they eat cooked foods. Yes?

Q: Well, then, would you say that the meat that we buy in the commercial grocery stores would be all right to eat?

A: It's all right to eat, but why buy something if you have a better choice of more nutrients is richer? It's like, would you be satisfied for a junkyard heap or would you like to go buy a new vehicle?

Q: So then you would advocate organic meat would be the best?

A: Organic, yes. All grazed. Mostly grass-fed would be best. This grass-fed thing is a little bit confusing. Normally, grasses grow out there and seed all the time, so these animals are always eating seed. In pastures, where they're restricted in their pastures and they're cycled through different areas of the pasture, usually the plants don't get to the point where they can seed. So giving those animals, while they're being milked or something like that, providing some grains while they're milked, a couple of cups a day, is beneficial for them. So if somebody has some dairy that all the animals are grazed except when they're milked, take it. It's good. The grain, while they're being milked, is wonderful. You had a question? Somebody had a question over here? Yes.

Q: If you're 94 years old and you have cancer, will this help you?

A: I'm only 96.

Q: No, my father's 94. [unintelligible] And so when you're that old, what level...

A: Let me give you an example. I've got a client who's 92 years old who gets fed through a tube. Cancer is so bad that he cannot swallow, so he has to be fed through a tube. So what we do is we take his family, his wife, his kids are all into this, which is an absolute miracle. They take my lubrication formula. For women, it's called the moisturizing formula, which is mainly butter and egg and a little honey and a little lemon juice, and blend meat with that, and a little bit of kefir, which is a little aged milk, and put it into the hypodermic and down the tube. That man is now out of bed. He is functional. He still has to eat because the stricture is so tight, but it's loosened up now to where we can get more foods down him, and he's functioning.

Q: I guess I was thinking once you're at a certain age, [unintelligible].

A: It's like the blood. Once it starts getting the nutrients, it gets excited.

Q: You're healthy otherwise.

A: For some reason, it works for, you know, I'd have to say 96% of everybody who does it.

Q: You have said in the past, though, Aajonus, that people that have been through a lot of chemoradiation and are at that age may not do well or progress with the diet even still because they don't have the cells alive anymore to work with.

A: Yeah, that's true, but the blood cells can still give them energy.

Q: He's had no chemo. They wanted to do a chemotherapy on him. They said that if you do it, you have a year to live. If you don't, you have six, seven, six months. And he didn't want to lose his hair because he's got a nice hair.

A: Terrific. Then he'll probably react much better.

Q: He hasn't had any chemo on him. He's been eating raw...

A: It's the butter. Whenever you have a situation like that, the butter and the meat's the most important. The lubrication formula, most important. Okay. What time is it?

Q: It's time.

A: Okay. All right. Let me ask one question. Ask one question.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Definitely. Well, I'm not a god. But it's helped every other case. Hot water bottles in a general area. Lots of moisturizing formula.

Q: Aajonus, mention your books.

A: Oh, okay. This is my first book. This is two volumes in one book, so it's like two books in one. The first one is details of the story of how my son, at 22 years old, was in an automobile accident. Destroyed one-fifth of his brain, and they said nobody has ever lived with that much brain damage. He was in a coma, and they said he'd never come out of it. This is how I brought him out of the coma, and he became normal and went to college and everything. And then the second book in your second volume is over probably 6,000 remedies for over 200 common diseases with just foods. No supplements, anything, just foods. And then here's the recipe book, and it's not only recipes for food, you know, food recipes. It's how to make the diet work, and that's what we're going to do in the workshop. But it makes a little, you know, this is pretty clear and concise, but for some reason when I speak of it, people get it better. And then the last 70 pages are all the science that was left out of the first book. I did not write the first book for the average scientist, it was for the layperson. But all the scientific data is in the last 70 pages of the recipe book. Oh, and if you want it signed, I'll sign it. Anyway, they're each $30. So we're going to break down for any of those who have decided to stay, but haven't paid for the workshop.

[unintelligible chatter]

[audio cut]

A: How many people have signed up for mini-readings? 3, 4, 5, 6. Somebody let me know when it's quarter of six. I mean quarter of five. And also I need somebody to let me know when it's, Harry you'll let me know when it's 3 o'clock. Because then we'll take a few minute break. Okay. We're going to break down what is in food. There are enzymes, there are vitamins, there are minerals. These are just the basics. And we have protein, we have carbohydrates, and we have fats. The enzymes are your workers. They do all of the work. They disassemble molecules and they reassemble. 

[audio cut]

A: 104 degrees, they start being destroyed. 120, 118 degrees, gone. Vitamins are your architects. Architects for fat assimilation. Architects for protein assimilation and utilization. They are your managers. The architects. The plan for proper development is [unintelligible]. Elementary structures can be constructed in your system, in your cellular makeup. Minerals are very important to be flexible and magnetic and ionically attractive. Once they are cauterized, the electromagnetic field changes. Cauterization is, if I, let me give you an example of cauterization. Say you have bones. Do you know bones? If you put some, you know, like put them in with lemon juice, they'll bubble and melt, disintegrate. If you cook those bones at about 200, 250 degrees, it turns them into a harder substance like fiery pottery, fiery clay. The higher you get, the more like glass it will become. It will become so brittle. You put the lemon juice on it, guess what? No longer dissolves. Things in the body need to be ecologically recyclable. Cooking, cauterization of minerals destroys that. In your fats, once fat molecules are heated and burned, they swell to sometimes 50 times their normal size. So you can be full of fat, but not have a lot of fat on you, but yet be very large in structure. Because you have all these swollen fat molecules. The proteins, when they are cooked, they become dangerous. Your proteins are very much like building materials. And once they are damaged, some of them will change shapes, some will change chemical reactions in the body. And that can be very dangerous, and often is, with the heterocyclic amines. Carbohydrates in the human body are not good, period. All the high-carbohydrate diets out there for the runners and all that. That's quick carbohydrate, right. It's quick-fueled and it burns quick. And it irritates the body to excite it, but that's not a healthy way to generate energy. Because Columbia University proved it, that when we utilize, when the human utilizes carbohydrate, a byproduct remains called advanced glycation end product. That accumulates at a rate of 70 to 90 percent. 70 percent in your healthiest body, 90 percent in your worst body, like somebody with diabetes or kidney problems. But 70 to 90 percent byproduct, that's a sugary, pasty, gummy waste product that floats around in the brain, blood and lymph and your glands and congests everywhere. It's false thinking. If you rely upon pyruvate for that particular kind of sugar fuel instead of carbohydrates, it works a lot better because with pyruvate, which is broken down with glucagon, there's only a 7 to 8 percent byproduct. 7 to 8 percent as opposed to 70 to 90 percent, big difference. Remember that because when we get into eating, you're going to understand why there's a better eating program for clarity and focus. Fats, I found, are the most important ingredient to reduce symptoms and to give you strength and health and energy. One, the ratio between energy calories that can be produced by fat is two and a half times greater than pyruvate, protein, or carbohydrate. It is the most efficient fuel to use, energy builder in your system, is fat. The body, the liver, can construct 60 varieties of cholesterols. One-third are used for lubrication, one-third are used for energy, and one-third are used for cleansing the body. Protecting the body, fueling the body, cleansing the body, all so important to the system. Let me give you an example.

I was in North Carolina, Asheville, North Carolina, about three weeks ago. And this man who was probably, I'm trying to remember, it was late 50s, he had all the signs of having been into a lot of drugs, you know, and alcohol. He had the thick, you know, swellings, the adipose tissue all over his face which showed he had been an alcoholic and into drugs for a long time. But yet, his eyes were the clearest of anybody that I saw there. And there were a lot of vegetarians that I saw there who were very ill. This man was the cleaner than anybody that I had seen. And I said, okay, we have to understand this. You've been into a lot of drugs, alcohol for a long time, and you only stopped seven years ago. And the only sign of that is in your skin, not in your tissues and in your glands. I have to know, what was your weight? He said, I was 300 pounds until I went on this diet. 300 pounds. It's consistent. If I've got somebody who is really fat, the poisons go into the fat. The alcohols, the poisons go into the fat. They don't go into the glands. That's why I like people to be fat. They are protected. If you go through a detoxification, even if you're on this diet and you don't have enough fat in the blood, guess what's going to happen? The poisons are going to go into your glands or your brain or nervous system somewhere and store. Because you don't have enough fats in the blood to deal with it. That's why I like people to get fat on this diet. Women aren't going to be happy about this, but I like people to get fat. You go up and down, up and down. Everything on this diet is the exact opposite of what everybody else says. Stay away from water, get fat, lose weight, get fat, lose weight, get fat, lose weight. All the things they tell you not to do to get healthy are all the things that will make you unhealthy in the long run. However, a lot of things that they say on a cooked diet are valid to an extent for some people. Because people need to drink more water to dilute the poisons, to help flush and wash out as many as they can. But you're going to flush and wash out a lot of good nutrients at the same time. We'll get into that as we go along. Fats are the most important nutrient, especially if you're diseased. And disease is always the accumulation of toxins in your system, cooked food or environmental pollution. They collect in the body. And if that's all your body is eating, you're going to be full of it. If you grew up under an airport, you're going to be full of a lot of toxins. I have a lot of people who were raised around industry or under an airport, and they have been in chronic fatigue or fibromyalgia for years. And they come out of it when they get on the diet. It may take a few years, but they do. Fat is the most important thing for anybody who's fatigued, anybody who has a problem. You've got to control those poisons. Say you have mercury in the system. Mercury constantly irritates and sets out gases which destroy surrounding tissue. So as long as the mercury is in your body, it's going to create damage unless you are very fat. 

And if you're very fat, then it's great because you have enough there to bind with those poisons. As the mercury vaporizes and crystallizes, you have enough fats there to bind with it. But also consider this. One molecule of mercury takes up to a thousand molecules of fat to bind with one molecule of mercury. That's like having a crazy man that's worth a thousand humans. It takes a thousand humans to take care of one crazy person. Because that crazy person can do a lot of damage. Mercury is a super-toxin. It takes about one thousand molecules of fat to bind with it. Now you can understand all of these toxins that are in our environment. Why do we need so much fat? This whole psychological thing about fat is one thing we have to dispose of right away. Ladies, let me tell you, it doesn't affect your relationships negatively at all. I've got some examples. I've got three women who are in the film industry who are ultra-concerned about their appearance and thinness. The one that I talked about that was 27 years on a diet, on the psychotropic drugs, five a day, very thin woman. She did all these yogi tapes and everything. Wait a minute, you're going to go to her for help and she can't help herself? Well, now she's put on all this weight. This other one woman's a famous director. She's put on all this weight and she does not look attractive, very unattractive the way she puts it on. But she has a boyfriend now who's 15 years younger than she is, is gorgeous. It doesn't matter because now she's a sweet, lovely person. So you can't look at the weight appearance-wise as being as important as you being a nice person because there's a lot of people out there that would rather have a nice person rather than a psycho bitch, like the one woman that was that was under psychotropic drugs. That woman was insane. Insane. She couldn't be around her. And now she's lovely and a sweet person. And even more so because she knows where she's been. So don't think about the fact. And if your boyfriend starts browbeating you about your weight and you're a nicer person, you don't belong with him anymore. Pass on to some nicer person. Period. That's what it's all about. It's about you being healthy and well and a happy person. Because there are many people out there, many men, who are attracted to a nicer person than they are a physical structure. Because it's difficult to be in a relationship with a physical structure that's malfunctioning. And it's terrible. I will not date a skinny girl. I won't. I won't even think about going out with a skinny girl. In fact, I usually say they have to have padding, but I'm assured that I'll be padding. So fat is so important. I can't stress it enough. Now, we have various fats. We have avocados. We have butter. We have cream. We have coconut cream. We have fat oils, pressed oils. Each one of them provides a different thing. If you want to feel more relaxed, comfortable, psychologically, cream is your best.

Cream soothes the nerve tissues. It's the only fat that will do that. However, the liver has a difficult time digesting it, in most people, because the liver has to churn it, so to speak, and separate the whey from it and turn it into butter. But because of the mineral concentration in that whey that is in the cream, that soothes the nerves when they're put in together. It can only make that structure for the nerves when it is in the form of cream. Butter, on the other hand, will lubricate the bones, the skin, and everything else in the body is better aided with butter. Butter is the most important. So if you want to break down fats, cream should be maybe 10% of your diet of fat intake. Butter should be about 70% of the intake. Your pressed oils no more than 20%. The depressed oils all turn into solvents. It's like kerosene, it's like alcohol, not in structure but in activity, in action. It goes in and dissolves compounds and leaves a lot of waste product. So I said that bacteria and parasites are better for cleansing than solvents. But you have to have solvents because certain cells that have been destroyed by mercury or cadmium or lead, guess what? Bacteria goes in to eat those, the bacteria dies. Parasites die because they've been poisoned. The only thing that can get rid of them is solvents that your body manufactures. That's what viruses are. Viruses are not alive, they're solvents. And they don't replicate themselves by just producing. The body manufactures them. But the medical profession makes a lot of money on even non-live things like viruses are contagious. They replicate themselves. Bullshit. That's like saying Thai soap is contagious because every home has them. Somebody produced it. And each body produces virus. They are solvents to break down tissue in the system. And they're very important for those that have been so contaminated with certain poisons that the bacteria and parasites cannot eat it. Also creates a lot more toxicity, as I said, because you have a lot of waste products as a result, diluted and spread out to the system. That's why you need to keep your intake of flax oil, cold-pressed flax oil and olive oils, and any other kind of pressed oil reduced to a minimum of 20% of your diet. Minimum, I mean maximum, of 20% of your diet. Any more than that, you're asking for trouble. More symptoms, more flus, more colds, more aches and pains. The fats, and I suggest that if you eat olive oil, flax oil, even coconut oil, which is 60% solvent reactive, not like 90% like the others. It's still highly solvent reactive, so always eat butter and or cream with it. So if you're having olive oil with your meats, you have some cream and butter with it, or mix it into a sauce. Cream and butter with the olive oil. That is the best way to do it with the least symptoms. Mix them all together. What it does is the cream and the fats will help bind with those poisons that the pressed oils have dissolved and released and set free. If you don't have those other fats to bind with those poisons, guess what? A lot of it will be reabsorbed into your system. So you're just shifting it around, causing more damage. It's like you keep using the same water. 

You don't dump it out and then start off with new water and new soap. You just keep using the same old dirty water. Guess what happens? You just keep spreading the dirt around and thinning it out. That's basically what you're doing. It comes to a point where it's just too thick. On this diet, that does not happen. If you follow it structurally properly, you will have the nutrients that you need to bind with those poisons and get them excreted out of the system.

Q: So can I check in? I'm learning a lot as you speak. I'm getting dizzy. The pressed oils go in and clean it up, but they create byproducts, and that's why we would have the other things like butter and cream to bind with those. If we don't, then it's too much water.

A: Too much toxic fluid in water, yes. So let's say we say the butter and the cream are like garbage cans or drain pipes where you can put the garbage in, and it will leave the property, the body. Without it, it won't happen very well. Some of it will go, but not all of it, and probably not even half will leave without those other fats along with the pressed oils.

Q: And then just one more context. When you're talking about these percentages, what percentage of oils are in the diet? Are you going to move along to that?

A: We're going to move on to that. Proteins, as I said, help structure the system. They are the building blocks. They are supposedly 22 amino acids, which are proteins, that help structure everything, the building blocks for everything. Once they are cooked and heterocyclic amines accompany them, it causes all types of chemical reactions. And you never know how it's going to work with an individual from day to day. It can change. It's usually consistent per individual how the major effect will be. On some people it creates a lot of anger and hostility, hyperactivity. In others it creates a vast amount of lethargy. It depends upon the characteristics of an individual, which I can't go into that because that's a whole class in itself. If you eat it raw, you don't have to worry about all those byproducts and those problems. You have the proper nutrients to restructure and regenerate. Now, if you cook your meats, it does not allow for what is necessary for cellular division. That's how cells reproduce. Human cells divide, and they've got two cells instead of one. So they divide like that. Raw meat allows for that, even in nerve tissue. It promotes it. Cooked meats do not. That's why people start healing and get more energy. I mean, take a look at me. Thirty-five years ago, I was crawling on my elbows. I had no control from here down. I had to wear diapers for everything. I had to have my food close by. If I had to go from the couch, because I lived there, because it was the closest place to the bathroom and the kitchen. It would take me half an hour to get from here to that painting back there. Because I'd get a few feet, and I would pass out. Sugar problem, diabetes. Then I would go a little bit farther. It would take me half an hour to get across the room. Here I am, standing up here, focused, clear, no longer autism. I'm 56 and a half years old. I was supposed to die 35 years ago. People who have those kind of problems do not advance like that. On normal cooked diets, it doesn't happen. But on people on this diet, it does. Let me give you an example. I've got a client. When he was brought to me, he was 16 years old, 15 and a half or 16 years old. Been in a wheelchair his whole life. Mentally, probably about four years old, three and a half, four years old. Entire body was skinny, and he hadn't grown in size since he was nine years old. And he was like this, in a wheelchair. And that's as far as he can move his head. Two years on the diet now, he's gained 50 pounds. He's grown, I just saw him about three weeks ago, four weeks ago. He is much more conscious, he can tell us what music he likes and all kinds of stuff. He doesn't talk well, but he can communicate in other ways. His feet are now relaxed. One hand is completely functional, the other one is closed. The poor kid was born that way, born that way. The doctors that are on his case are just blown away. They even give him, the mother, they give her a letter. She's a stepmother. They give her letters to protect her. That she allows that child to eat raw meat, because when you have a child like that, they're somewhat wards of the state, even though they're your child.

They get involved in a child that's like that, that's handicapped like that. The doctors have given her right to feed this child raw meat and raw everything, because they've seen what it's done for this child. But only raw meat can do it. He was fed lots of cooked meat throughout his life, but it didn't do a thing. He's a child that reacts very well with getting fat. He can be huge, and then he'll slim down, and every time you can see him grow and everything get that much more relaxed. I figure in five years, he might be normal, pretty close to normal.

Q: Would raw eggs do that too, not just raw meat but raw eggs?

A: Nope, that's what I'm getting into. That's the next step of another protein. Raw meat helps cellular division. For some reason in my experiments, eggs do not. The protein in raw eggs helps rebuild and restructure cells but not help cellular division. But it sure helps everything else. If you're sick, if you have asthma, if you're running into a brick wall on the diet, cut your diet down to nothing but eggs every hour. Two or three days if necessary. Your whole body will change. There's something about the structure and balance of raw eggs that seems to be perfect. Let me give you an example. I mention this in the recipe book. I had this woman who was about 70 years old who had been diagnosed with emphysema seven years prior to my exposure to her. She was in fourth stage, had been pretty much bedridden for the last two years of her life, and on machines. Her MD called me on a Thursday evening quite a few years ago and said, I have an emphysema patient, told me a little story and said, when we shut off the machines, she stops functioning, so we have to keep her on the machines. She's probably going to die this weekend, is there anything we can do? I said, well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? She said, well, I'm an MD, I have my family to take care of, and I have to protect my livelihood. I said, well, that's your conscience. The only thing I can suggest that you do is get 10 to 15 dozen eggs, put them at her bed stand and tell her to eat one as often as she can. There's no limit. On a Monday morning, early, I get a call from this very raspy-voiced woman. She explains who she is. She said, I ate 66 eggs over the weekend. I got the eggs on Saturday morning, I think it was. She ate 33 each day. She says she's out of bed, off the machines, what else can she do? She was supposed to die that weekend. Eggs are very important except for cellular division. They help balance the body in so many ways. Also, if you have an intense amount of work to do and you can't stop and eat, always pop an egg every 45 minutes to an hour, and that'll keep your focus and keep you going. Also, a little golf ball size of meat in between can help, too, just as long as you just keep a little bit of food intake that's mostly protein with some fat. The vitamins and enzymes that you get in supplements, that's like taking, you know, would you rather have a prosthesis or a for-real working arm, feeling working arm? Would you rather be a bionic person? Do you want to be in the experience with your body and sensation, or would you rather have some live part of your body able to function and experience? That's the difference. I don't care what quality of vitamins and enzymes they are. They have to be separated and isolated. There are only two ways to do that, basic ways to do that, heat or solvent extraction and separation. Would you clean your food, your fruits, and your meats with kerosene before you eat them? No. Well, let me ask you, anybody here would do that? I don't see anybody. Gasoline? That's what happens when you take supplements. They all have to be treated to be separated. A vitamin, an enzyme, a nutrient, there always has to be some mechanical way to do it.

They are toxic. They can only utilize about 12% maximum. That means that 88% of it is toxic primarily. For somebody who's on a lot of cooked foods, less treated nutrients than they would be by high cooking would be helpful. But on somebody who's 50% raw, they are mostly damaging. Your vitamin E is one of the worst abused nutrients there are. Fuji and Kodak supply most of it for the world. Guess where their tocopherol comes from? Their developing fluid. Some scientists said, oh, this has the same structure almost as vitamin E. A tocopherol structure. But true vitamin E is a d-alpha-tocopherol structure. But because it's close, they sell everybody else, oh, this is vitamin E. This is a form of vitamin E. They encapsulate it and sell it to you. Basically, that tocopherol, what they're selling, is one of the most toxic byproducts there is. They have to have these huge thick cans when they store it in the toxic dumps. The cans have to be something like six inches thick. It has to be in a vault that's something like six feet thick in concrete. What they do is disperse it out to you and put it in everything. Anything that's got vitamin E, you can bet that 99% of it is that toxic vitamin E waste. It's not a true vitamin E. Those supplements that say that there's true vitamin E in it, they get it from soy or corn, you can bet that maybe five or six of those units are the natural that come from the food, but the rest, 95% of it, the rest of the units is all that same chemical. It's all a marketing gimmick. It isn't that the people selling it know that. Only the scientists know it. Only the people at Kodak and Fuji, they know it, and other people that know biochemistry a little bit better than your average person know it. People aren't trying to poison you purposely, except for those originators who know better. That's the same thing with the medical profession. The medical profession, once the pharmaceutical houses got control of the medical schools in the early 1900s, Carnegie and Rockefeller, the way they got control of the medical schools was to offer them huge grants for research, directed research. We want you to look for an active substance in an herb or wherever that has a reaction that's supposed to be helpful for people. We want you to find the active chemical ingredient. If you find it, we'll pay you fortunes. We will own the patent on it, and we will sell it, but we'll give you fortunes to find it. Everybody wants to find it and make that money, right?

Baby: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

[laughter]

A: So you get these chemists and these academics who want that notoriety, who want that money, who want all that, and then they paint a very bad picture. When the pharmaceutical houses took over at that point, they started dictating to doctors, use this drug, use this drug, here's how it works, here's what works, without any proof or backing. That's basically how the medical field is run from the pharmaceutical houses. Doctors only are taught what the pharmaceutical houses want them to believe. Period. That is it. Unless you have some that are more alternatively thinking and realize in their life, like Dr. Mendelsohn did, that this is all garbage. It does not work, it's futile. So then they go into alternative areas, and then they get attacked for it, because they're not practicing the proper medical protocol. Vitamins, supplements, are relatively very close in the same family as any other kind of pharmaceutical drug. You never know how it's going to react when it's isolated and imbalanced in the system. And most often it is not good. It causes a collection of toxicity. That toxicity is what causes a boost to the adrenals, which makes you feel better for a while. But then what happens when it accumulates? And when any toxin accumulates to a point, then you get an allergy to it. Even a few molecules of that same thing will then cause an ill reaction. And you won't even know which supplement it is or which ingredients of the supplement. It's just a dangerous place to go. It's not a safe place to go. Vitamins and enzymes and minerals in your food are always in a balance if you're eating the right foods. Of course, if you eat poison mushroom, you're going to have a problem. That's not in a good balance. If you eat any other kind of a poisonous plant, you're going to have a problem because it's not in a proper balance. Eating too much fruit on this diet is a problem because you have the high sugar byproduct and the body only needs 5% of its nutrients come from carbohydrates. 5% of the nutrients come from carbohydrates. That is all. That is needed for the citric acid cycle, to help utilize fat as fuel, and to help provide alcohol for the solvents that cleanse the body, but only 5%. So if you're getting a little carb in your meat, you're getting a little carb in your eggs, you're getting a little carb in your vegetable juice, you've got plenty of carbs. You don't really need fruit at all. But if you do eat it, you better eat it with a lot of fat. Remember, 5% to how much fat? So let's say the calories here, say you have one peach. The calories better be 95% greater than what's in the peach. So you better have a half a cup of cream, or butter and cream, to go with that peach, to make sure it doesn't create a severe imbalance. But let's say you do that all day long. That will create a mineral deficiency. That may cause bone loss, osteoporosis, irritability, lack of focus, scattered thinking. It can cause all kinds of serious problems. Take a look at the whole community that's on raw foods, without animal, those on raw foods that lack animal products. They are wired, they are hyperactive, they are easy to anger, most of them, unless they're so worn out and fatigued that they're calm, collected, but they have no energy. So there's always those extremes in that field. Protein, I find that in meats, a minimum of a pound a day is a safe amount to eat. Under that, it's unsafe. If you want to regenerate and heal, it's an unsafe amount. One pound minimum. I eat from one to three pounds a day. 

If I'm in a healing cycle, I will eat as much as I can, up to three pounds. I can eat more than that. If I could eat more than that, I would, but I can't. Three pounds a day. Whenever I get really sleepy and tired, that means I'm going through a healing state. Ninety percent of healing happens in the sleep state. If you're in a healing state, what does the body need a lot of? Nutrients to help cellular division. That's the only thing that comes from that is meat. When I'm talking about meat, I'm talking about whether it's red, white meat, and that means fowl, seafood, beef, lamb, whatever. All flesh foods fall into the meat category for cellular division. So you find yourself sleepy, sleeping more, tired, eat more meat. Take advantage of that sleep state. You'll find that the more meat you eat, the less sleep and the less fatigue you will have during that healing state. Yes?

Q: When you mentioned one to three pounds, that's for your healing crisis you said?

A: Not a healing crisis. Healing crisis is when the body has almost stopped its detoxification process and is jumping into the healing state. But I'm talking all through the healing state, all through the tired state.

Q: The detoxification state?

A: The end of detoxification. The cold, the flu is the end of detoxification. Diarrhea, vomiting, the end of this long phase of detoxification. Either bacteria or solvents, virus or parasites have gone into your body and cleaned up a lot of garbage. Now it's time to take the waste product out. So it will come out the mucous membranes, it will come out diarrhea, it will come out as vomit, it will come out your skin, come out your vaginal cavity, your rectum, wherever it comes out, it will come out. Your hair, nails, wherever the body can get rid of it, it will do it. So all that discharge is taking out the garbage, the waste products, during a detoxification, at the end of a detoxification. You may have a little bit happening all the time, but usually when you're into a heavy detoxification, you'll come to a point where you get a cold or a flu or diarrhea or vomiting. If you have any aches and pains, you're in the heart of detoxification, whether it's local or systemic. Now let's take a look. We've gone over all the nutrients now. You understand what they do, so you know how to think when you're eating. This one does this, this one does that. What do I want to occur in my body? I'm going to need to suck an egg. And I mean to suck an egg. This is the ideal, fast, convenient food. Free package, perfect balance. And it's so easy, and the waste product is easy to get rid of. Blend it and put it in your rose garden or garden. Ah, the yolk is so delicious.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, I love it. Do you like soft-boiled eggs?

Q: Yeah.

A: That's what it tastes like. Like a soft-boiled egg.

Q: It would be better if you put salt on it.

A: They're very salty tasting, let me tell you. Especially if you get rotten eggs.

Q: [unintelligible] I sat and looked at it in a cup, which was a big mistake. For like 20 minutes, I'm not kidding. And I kept, and I thought I did it. And I don't know how long it took me. And I thought, I don't know, maybe like 30 times before I really drank it. And when I did it, I couldn't believe how refreshing it was. And it wasn't really that bad, but I found a trick. Like I had to close my mouth after each little bite. And you know, just get it down. But if I could do it, anybody could. Because I was really grossed out. So you can do it. Don't give up.

A: There's some people I suggested, you know, they can do it like that. The egg white comes out first as you're sucking. Okay. Tasteless. It's kind of slimy for some people, like oysters. You know, some people don't like that. If you put just a small amount in their mouth, it's easy to swallow and get rid of. And then the yolk is the last. And that's so tasty and rich. I like that a lot. What time is it?

Q: 2.30.

A: 2.30. Okay. I forgot where I was. Does anybody remember where I was going to go?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That means if you want to heal and you want to build and strengthen your body, your body cannot do it without at least a pound of meat a day.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Remember, meat does not detoxify you. Meat never detoxifies you unless you're eating high meat. Then you can add to detoxification. As long as you're eating raw meat, you're not...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Raw meat does not cause detoxification unless it's high meat. Now, you'd have to eat a lot of it. Asking about the quantity of meat has nothing to do. It will just allow your baby to grow more healthfully and strongly if you eat a lot of raw meat. Remember, a pound of meat a day is minimal for safe healing and development. 

Q: The safe is what I'm confused also.

A: The what?

Q: When you say it's safe, that implies that something would be unsafe.

A: Well, if you don't want to go toward deterioration, that's what I call unsafe.

Q: Okay, so it's as a strengthener. You want to stay as strong as possible.

A: You want to stay going toward healthier state of being.

Q: Got it.

A: When you get up to the pound, you're at a safe point where I've seen no degeneration happen accompanying the diet. When people go into, you know, a lot of meat products, I mean a lot of dairy products and don't have the meat, I see all this cleansing happening, but I don't see regeneration of tissue in the system. Sure they're getting cleaner, they're getting stronger, but are they getting younger and healthier? Are they becoming more alive? Let me give you an example. When you see a person walking like this across the street, how many cells do you think is alive in that body? Not many. Maybe 25%. And that 25% is not well. And it's holding up this 100% body weight. Moving like this shows there's a very weak, dead system. Who wants to be that way? You know, I don't exercise. I don't do any of the... well, roller skating once a month, once every two months. That's all I do. And I'm solid and thick, massive. If I go without eating a pound of meat a day, I will start losing weight. I'll start losing muscle mass after about six months. I've experimented and done it. A pound of meat keeps everybody, unless they're under 5 feet tall, then it's about 14 weight ounces a day will keep them fine.

Q: Can I ask you one more thing? You were saying something about women being fat. What's your weight now?

A: Well, I'm at my bottom side. We're going to talk about that. Remember I said up and down, up and down? No, I'm just going back up right now. But if you'd seen me two months ago, I had a 38-inch waist. Right now I'm at a 32. A few weeks ago I was at a 31, so I was at my bottom size. So I go up 7 inches in the waist. I get quite big, and my face gets full, my neck gets bigger, and everything gets bigger. And I look like Russell Crowe as the gladiator. Yes?

Q: When you're talking about those fluctuations in body weight, does that mean [unintelligible], or do you actually psych yourself through changes in your diet to cause that weight?

A: I do explain it in the recipe book, briefly, that I like people to go on a structured weight gain plan. And it's structured. You eat so much fat with each meal, and you structure the meals. And the way I've outlined it in there is for people to be as balanced as possible. I've taken into consideration all the stuff that I've given you today is all in that plan that I put in there. So you understand the intricacy of what I've formulated in that plan to work for you. It's to keep you symptom-free, or as little symptom as possible. It's to help you detoxify with the least amount of inconvenience and disability and fatigue. And then the weight loss program is to help you lose it. And what I suggest people do is they gain a lot of weight. For men, 20 to 30 pounds. For women, I like 12 to 20 pounds. That's safe. I'd like you to do more. Like this. I would say this is the high end. Perfect. Come here. This is the high end.

Q: You did this to me once before. I have to tell you the truth.

A: This is the high end.

Q: I went home and I told my mom, I said I was the example of being perfectly fat. An hour later, one of my sisters called me and said, Mom called me and told me you got an award of some kind.

A: Yeah, you did. That may be unrealistic for some people's psychological framework, but when I've seen people get healthy quicker, it's because they've gone up to this weight. There was a girl that was 118 pounds when she came to me. She had numerous breast cancer. She was 28 years old. Numerous, about 30 tumors in her right breast, a large one in her right kidney attached to her adrenal gland and her right hip. 28 years old. She'd been chronically fatigued for eight years. Gorgeous girl. Model, but no energy. Worked six hours a week. Six hours a week, that's all she could work. Chronically fatigued since the age of 20. Started getting very sick by the time she was 14. Also, she was the only one in the family that had brown eyes. Now that she's been on the diet for six years, her eyes are almost blue. Cleaning out the toxicity. Doesn't mean everybody who has brown eyes should have blue eyes. But she should have had blue eyes. And the brown in her eyes reflected the toxins stored in her since she was a fetus. Remember, it was 1969. Her mother was in college doing drugs, smoking, drinking, partying. She got pregnant and didn't know it. Carried that on for four months. All of that drugs and the chemicals damaged the fetus, the placenta. So the placenta couldn't filter out all the garbage. So they went into her system. So she started getting sick at the age of 14 pretty badly from it. 118 pounds, skinny little gorgeous girl. Everybody considered model type. But she didn't have a life. Always angry, always upset, nasty. Went on the diet. She saw what it did for her after about six months. She says, what can I do to make it faster? And I said, get fat. She said, how fat? I said, well, you've gone from 118 to 130. I'd like you to go to 170. She said, 170. OK, I'll do it. So she did it. She did that. She did it. She stayed in that place for about nine months, three times, over a five-year period. And let me tell you, her eyes were the quickest ones I've ever seen, going from dark brown, almost black, to a blue-orange. And now she lives in Hawaii, lives on a farming community that's on my diet. And let me tell you, she works 14, 16 hours a day and still has more energy than she can deal with. Totally different person. But only the women and men who will allow themselves to go that kind of a massive weight gain have that great, quick progress. So it isn't that you won't have the progress, but it'll just be slower. And if that's okay for you, that's okay. But if you want fast results, embrace the fast. 

Q: What if you're at the peak of that?

A: Then you go on the diet, and what I suggest is people go on the diet and hold that weight for about six, seven months, and then go on the weight loss program that's suggested in the book. And then you lose it, and you get to gain it back again. Gaining it back can be fun. You can get a little ice cream. All that good stuff, all that rich foods, all those... I've got 87 sauces in the recipe book. And all of the good chefs always say it's in the sauce. You're always eating the same meats, always eating the same food. It's always in the sauce. So I've got 87 sauce recipes in there that can be made three to five different ways each. So you have about 400 sauce recipes. And they can be magnificent, delicious. Get into it and enjoy it. So getting fat, gaining and losing the weight is important. Losing it is just as important as gaining it. I had one woman who was born in Auschwitz. She didn't leave Auschwitz until she was four and a half years old. So she saw all these skinny people around her. At 59 years old, she came to me because she couldn't gain any weight. She was skin and bones, just like she saw in Auschwitz. She was terrified. She was dying. She had nine chronic diseases. I put her on the diet, and within about six months on the diet, she gained 48 pounds. She went from 92 pounds to about 138 pounds. And she was on the full side, about like this woman. Stand up. Right here.

Q: About 136 right now.

A: About the same size and everything. So that's what she got. And then I talked her going up 10 pounds more. And then I wanted her to take it off, and she refused to take it off. Two and a half years, I said, you've got to take it off. Remember, all those fats are collecting all those poisons, and you've got to get rid of it. Because it'll come to the point where it'll start eating away at your tissues. And she refused. And I had one tennis player that did the same thing. When you're out there playing tennis every day, you get bone thin, and you get chronically ill. Once you gain the weight, you don't want to lose it if you've been at that end of it, that skinny, decrepit end of it. Those two refused to do it. The guy wouldn't do a detoxification for, he went five and a half years. And she went three and a half years with no weight loss program. And both of them developed lupus. Lupus is a degeneration of your connective tissue. Remember, you've got to lose the weight, too. Yes? I have a quick question.

Q: Is lupus similar to MS?

A: Pardon?

Q: Is lupus similar to MS? Because MS deals with the tissues of the back.

A: It's a little different. MS is a hardening of the nerves. They dry out and they harden, and then there's no more neurological relationship, communication with the rest of the body. So then everything atrophies. But this is the dissolution, the poisons in the lymph system. The lymph dumps its waste products into the system, and it dissolves it. The lymph system is, I consider, the immune system. It's not this ghost thing that the medical profession talks about. Well, the immune system is this ghost, and it's damaged by this and this and this chemical and this reaction, this boosts it. If you ask him what it is... 

[audio cut]

A: ...we're immediately following. 

Q: Toxin also means scar tissue?

A: Scar tissue can, a lot of scar tissue. Scar tissue, for everyone, are basically dead cells that the body has mummified. And it's using them as bricks in the system, or the lymph system can't dissolve them, or bacteria and parasites will not eat them because they're too poisoned. Most of your scar tissue has poisons involved in those cells. So scar tissue is a very toxic substance, just like the rest of the system. Anything that has killed that cell can cause the body to encase it, mummify it, and to isolate it like that because it can't discharge it and keeps it in the body. That's a toxic cell. Bacteria and parasites can't eat it, or else it'll kill them. So your body has to use solvents. That's where the lymph system comes in. It uses solvents. So the lymph system does not use bacteria or parasites to help it. Other systems can, but not the lymph system. It has to use the solvents only. Yes.

Q: What about cleansing the liver with the oranges, ginger, garlic, and olive oil?

A: What about it?

Q: Yeah, is there any problems with that, or is that a?

A: That mixture? There's a lot of problems with that mixture. It's high carbohydrate, high acidity, a high amount of fat dissolution. It will rob the fats out of the bloodstream. If somebody's very fat and overweight, for a while, that could be helpful to some extent. But you could have some brain or neurological damage from it. Because it robs the blood fat within 20 minutes. Now, what happens if you have no blood fat? Any poison that gets into the bloodstream can get to the brain or anywhere in the body and cause damage. It's not safe. Yes?

Q: What would you suggest for [unintelligible]?

A: I don't like to go into that kind of a specific thing unless somebody has hepatitis or something like that. And just remember, hepatitis are always viruses or bacterias that are trying to save the liver. You don't want to get rid of hepatitis. Hepatitis is usually your last-ditch effort to save the liver. So if you stop the hepatitis, you're going to end up with chronic fatigue most of the time, or fibromyalgia. Not a good thing. You notice that all the people who are treated for hepatitis are much weaker people with usually dark circles around their eyes. They will never be the same because the liver is in an extreme danger, a dangerous situation, and the hepatitis is the last-ditch effort, whether it's your body using the solvent, a viral, using bacteria to eat up the degenerative liver tissue. It's a helpful thing to do. Whenever you get a pain, like I said, it's the increase in circulation of nutrients to an area. You know that there's toxins in that area. The body has to cleanse, repair. You apply heat at night. Take hot water bottles, not heating pads, because they have electromagnetic fields which alter the molecular structure of cells. If it weren't disadvantageous, the city of Los Angeles 10 years ago issued a paper that they would not have issued, and they said, it has been discovered by scientists that electromagnetic fields of varying degrees over three gauss create molecular structural changes. We do not know if these are detrimental, but we want to caution people. You know that it's detrimental if they're issuing them, because they'd just be fighting. There's no proof that it's not detrimental, just like the smoking, the tobacco companies did. But this is proof, so that's why they came out with this. And they said that if you're going to use an electric blanket, you put it on before you get into bed, heat your bed up, and then turn it off, and make sure it's off when you get into that bed. They don't issue any kind of a warning like that unless they're protecting their butts. Yes?

Q: What do you think of something like [unintelligible]?

A: But that's not a direct charge, and it's not high gauss. Did you put a gauss up against it, a meter? Anything that's electromagnetic and you're sitting into it for more than ten minutes, you're going to have a problem.

Q: When you're talking about Wright, you're talking about micro-currents. Very small amounts.

A: I don't think it's over half a gauss. They say that three is dangerous. I won't do anything over half a gauss. If I'm using my laptop computer, I have a separate keyboard because I've got 35 to 80 gauss coming off of that microprocessor in that laptop. I like the laptop because it's less gauss than a tower. A computer tower could be emitting 125 to 200 gauss. It's got to be over three feet away from you, not to affect you. Most people have it up here. It's going to affect their shoulders and their ribs, their breasts. Down here, it's going to affect their knees and their hip joints, and that's where you produce most of your red blood cells, red and white blood cells is in the femur joints and the knees and the hip bones. 

Q: What is the outcome of this?

A: It causes a weakening in structure. That's mostly your ergonomics that they talk about, you know, the tunnel syndrome. It has nothing to do with angles. People have been typing for ages. When they got electrical with computers, they had electromagnetic fields that affect the bones. The way I discovered that was I had an old-style computer, but I was aware of it. It kept the tower away from me and kept the screen away and had a screen protector. However, after using it for three years, it burned this eye because I could see the change in it. The structure and vision was slightly reduced. Then I got a laptop to get rid of that because I didn't want the radiation from the guns. Each monitor and television has three laser guns, and they emit radiation for 27 feet, even if you have a screen in front of it. So the LCD screens, their radiation emission is about an inch. The fallout goes there. So I got a laptop. Everything is very condensed. The field of EMF field breaks down six inches away from the end of the laptop, so I use a keyboard away from it. The way I found that out was after having my eye damaged after three years, I went to a laptop. When I was using the laptop, I moved into a new home, a new house, and I started getting the carpal tunnel syndrome. I had used typewriters for years and never had a problem. I had used the other computer with the tower away with no problems for years, eight years. I wrote the first book with that. When I got the laptop, I started having trouble, but I didn't relate it. Maybe I've got a field in the new house. So I had that environmental expert come in with all of his gauges and went around everything. He just found one hot spot in the house that was in the bedroom. I had that rewired. But in the laptop, he said, look at this. It was cranking out a field of about 75 to 85 gauss. Three is okay, supposedly. And this was cranking out that much. He said, just get a separate keyboard and see what happens. And keep this six inches away from your keyboard. I did it. Within three days, all the pain was gone, and I've never had it since. So they do affect you. Hot water bottles, let's get back to it. Hot water bottles are the way to do it. So you stick one under your arm. If you've got pain anywhere in your torso, you stick them under your arms. You don't put the hot water bottles on top so they're putting pressure. That defeats the whole purpose. If you're trying to have the heat to cause expansion, so you can have more circulation into an area to allow the tendons and everything to stretch and swell to reduce pain, just like in the skull, remember, the brain expands and the headache comes because the skull doesn't expand with it. So any area where there's pain you want to cause the relaxation so everything will expand to allow the higher circulation, the increased circulation, to not cause pain. Heat does that wonderfully. Put them everywhere. I've gone through, you know, when my bone, blood and bone cancer, and I used to use five at a time. I'd have two between my legs, one under each arm, and one up here above my head. But none of them resting on top of anywhere, just around. And then if you cover upon that, the amount of heat that is stimulated is impressive. 

If it's to the bones, it's going to take probably the bath to discharge out into the water because it would reduce the pain, but not to the point where I could sleep more than 45 minutes in a particular situation, in a particular position, unless I was in the bath. But the hot water bottles relieves it from almost everything. It increases health and increases circulation. It increases health and decreases pain. If you're in severe, uncontrollable pain, get in the bath. Yes?

Q: If the person has cancer and it's diminishing or retarding or whatever in terms of the tumor or whatever, what's good for the liver cleanse or kidney cleanse or the body cleanse for that type of person?

A: Very bad. What he asked was, if somebody's in a serious situation with cancer, how about one of the liver cleanses or one of the other cleanses that will help repair the body? Only people that I lose, that I've lost during cancer, well, let me put it this way. I've lost one that was overweight and could eat fine because he just kept taking drugs for it. But the only people that I lose normally to cancer is the people who can't eat. A lot of times when they do one of those liver cleanses, they cause anorexia. Once they cause anorexia and the body gets too thin, usually they cannot recover because the cancer starts multiplying rapidly. It isn't that the cancer is multiplying, it's that the body is losing more mass. That means that the body has to clean itself out more. If it had more mass, it would have a lot of areas to hold these dead cells in the body and would not have to form into tumors. But when you lose all this weight, where is the body going to take these dead cells if it can't dissolve and get rid of them? It's got to build them into tumors so it spreads rapidly. So being fat is very important. These liver cleanses break the fat down and cause the body to shrink. Then you're just asking for cancer to grow and spread. Now it doesn't happen in everybody, but in most cases, I'd say in 85% of the cases, it's dangerous.

Q: What about the coffee enemas?

A: Coffee enemas are horrible.

Q: What?

A: Coffee enemas are horrible. 

Q: 3 o'clock.

A: Okay, 3 o'clock. Let's take a 10-minute break. Go to the restroom if you need and eat something if you need. Yes.

Q: When you soak in the tub, do you put epsom salt in there? What do you put in the tub?

A: I told you. The milk, the sea salt, and the vinegar.

Q: So that's Celtic salt. You told me on the tape.

A: I don't know if I put that in the book. How are you doing?

Q: It's in the book.

[audio cut]

A: Do they still have those questions? Yes?

Q: I wanted to know if there's a relationship between having radiation in the body and a child's [unintelligible].

A: If the child has EMF fields?

Q: Electromagnetic field, like radiation.

A: If they found radiation, that means that, did he get exposed to?

Q: We don't know how. [unintelligible]

A: Probably wouldn't be, it would have to be something that you had in your lifetime.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I know. Did you have barium enema? Did you ever have x-rays when you took a fluid to contrast? Were you ever a round radioactive material that you know of?

Q: No, I had x-rays done on my back.

A: Yes, but usually you take, especially for the spine, you take a contrast fluid. They inject it in you. Maybe you just don't remember.

Q: Is there a relationship between that and the speech delay in the child?

A: If it got into his nervous system.

Q: And you get rid of that by?

A: Eating what she just ate. [unintelligible]

Q: I'm curious about emotional release. You made one reference to it, and in the past I've done body electronics, which is a lot of emotional release with cleansing. What have you come up with or dealt with in regards to emotional release?

A: Well, you know, there's a whole... She's asking about in relationship with his diet, is there anywhere, any area for emotional release. There are those that believe in primal therapy, which I guess could be related to primal diet, only I don't advocate it. Primal therapy is, they call it the primal scream, where you just get it all out and you kick pillows and just let all that rage and that kind of energy out. But Elnora Van Winkle, who was a scientist that cataloged all of the chemicals within the nervous system at the University of New York City Medical Center, Elnora Van Winkle, she wrote a paper called The Biology of Emotions. It was a very technical paper on the internet and a layman's paper on the subject. She believes in primal therapy. I don't, because as she says in her paper, that when she found people going through a lot of emotional turmoil for no direct cause, with no direct cause in their life for stress and anxiety, she found certain chemical properties that were the byproduct of earlier times of trauma or anxiety or angst floating in the blood. So it showed that these byproducts of neurological trauma, the body produces these psychotropic compounds, store in the body like any other toxin. And when they get removed, the body goes back into the same kind of behavior as when it was produced. To me, logically, my mind says, okay, if you want to get rid of it and not have it again, you don't do the same thing over and go through the same rage again because that's going to create more of it and store in your body again. So what I found for myself was that when I went through the whole primal rage thing in the 70s and a little bit in the late 60s and all through the 70s, when I tried that as a therapy, it just kept the momentum up. So I feel if you've got high anxiety, go take a walk among flowers, anything that will make you feel good. Take that and transform it. Sing, listen to music, dance. Get rid of it. Burn it off. And some activity that you enjoy. Turn it into something favorable. So when you get angst, you're automatically programmed to channel it into happiness. If you release angst with angst, you're going to be living in angst, period. That's why I don't like primal therapy. It works temporarily, but it just keeps the whole cycle going. And to me, that's a vicious cycle. Answer your question?

Q: Yeah, and my reference was really oftentimes people who have a toxic release or cleansing end up having these strong feelings come up, not the other way around. So you're just saying stay focused on where you're going, even if that comes up.

A: But like you said, if they're going through a detoxification, they're detoxifying these hormones.

Q: Exactly, and so it's like...

A: So the angst is there. You just need to transform it into something happy to get out of that vicious cycle. Because it goes away and it's fine. It's like, you know, you get into a situation where before you would have panicked and gone into great rage and disappointment. You find yourself looking at it with, you know, a different whole piece of mind. And it's like you can say, oh, this is how I solved that problem. And you don't have to go in to keep it going and the angst going. There's a resolution to any situation. And that becomes clear when you're not emotionally pumped in all that hormone and all those byproducts of rage and anxiety and angst and fear. It makes everything easier and clearer. Okay. The thing we talked about mainly was the lymph system and how important it was to the body. And detoxification of those fluids, vomiting, diarrhea, throw a party. Because you're taking out the garbage. Don't go into angst because you're spitting up mucus. Or you're having diarrhea. Before, 41 days was the most I ever saw anybody go into diarrhea. I now have the record. This guy, he's been into diarrhea for seven months. And because he doesn't become afraid and he looks at it as a major detoxification, he was very ill. He does the diet just as if there were no other problems. The weight gain cycle. And he just keeps doing it. So he always keeps ahead. He doesn't lose any weight. He isn't in angst. He functions. His job is great. He just visits the toilet often. That's all. And it's great. And he gets to discharge all this stuff. And here, what usually takes people four to five years to get where he's gotten in seven months, because he's had this constant discharge in diarrhea of these highly toxic poisons from his liver, gallbladder, spleen, and pancreas. It's the quickest way. Like I said in the book, vomiting is the quickest way where you don't lose many nutrients at all. Diarrhea is the second way. You lose a lot of nutrients, but you keep up with the eating. It won't be a problem. But both of those are your best ways of detoxification. Be thrilled. Throw a party every time you vomit, every time you have diarrhea. It's a quick way out for poisons. And those are usually the most toxic poisons that cause you to vomit or have diarrhea. So celebrate. Don't go into fear, and don't go into a pattern of got to stop this. This is a bad thing. It's a great thing. They are great things. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Only if it's cooked. You don't have a high amount of urea and acids forming with raw meat. Unless the body is using the protein to break certain cells down. Then you may have. But then the vegetable juice keeps you on top of that. And we're going to get into now, we're going to get into eating patterns. How to eat to facilitate everything. Yes.

Q: The guy with diarrhea, long-term diarrhea. Is he eating high meat or could it be a problem?

A: He's not eating high meat.

Q: What about, because doesn't bacteria, there's enough there to prevent diarrhea. So could he be short on the amount?

A: Well, he's had his tests done. He's had some tests done with it. Because I wanted to find out what poisons he was discharging. And his E. coli content was still high. So he doesn't seem to be having a problem there. But he had a lot of cadmium and mercury. And he was a fellow that grew up in a very toxic environment. He was a lathe operator, I believe. You know, they've got the metal, the oil evaporating and breathing in. Those are the most toxic people I see. Usually don't do well. It's too hard for them to do well. Very big problem. That much metal in the system. Oil and metal. Highly burned, petroleum oil. Okay, eating pattern. As I said, if you start off the morning with carbohydrates, you're going to have a lot of waste products floating in your brain, nervous system, bloodstream, and through the glands. It's a sticky waste product. Fog, sticking. Also makes you crave more carbohydrates through the day. When you wake up in the morning, you're acidic. Your body will have gone at least five hours without eating. Once you go five hours without eating, that's if you're of a normal weight. Once you go five hours without eating, your body starts eating its own cells. And your cells are not healthy. It's not going to eat the healthy ones. It's going to eat those toxic ones. So you're going to be even more toxic if you slept over five hours. I suggest people set an alarm for five hours after they've gone to sleep, have a few eggs by your bed or a milkshake or a cream shake, and down it and go back to sleep. You'll be a lot happier and a lot healthier. I know some people know John Fox, right? John Fox, for years he was on the diet. He woke up in the morning and was just fatigued because he'd wake up after five, six hours, have some water, and go back to sleep. I said, no, John. And there's one of these seminars that I do at his place in Nevada City. And I said, no, when you wake up, you've got to eat something at five o'clock in the morning. So now he wakes up. He has something he gets up in the morning. He doesn't have all this acid, acidic toxicity in his system where he's just so fatigued and worn out. He wakes up with energy galore. This was a man when I met him before he went on the diet. That's what he looked like. Now he's got all this weight on him, and he's strong and vibrant and healthy in just three years. Three years to that it's been about five years from now. But after three years, he was pretty well. Changed his whole life and his wife's. So it's better if you do that. If you really want the best feelings in your life, if you want to have the most quality of health in your life, do it with the way the body cycles work. Over five hours, you're in trouble. Your body's going to eat itself, and it's going to be very toxic.

It's better that the lymph system take those dead cells and that toxicity and those weak cells and decompose them or dissolve them and eliminate them rather than you start feeding on that garbage, because your body will start feeding on that garbage after five hours. If you're really skinny, it could happen within three and a half hours. So you need to eat frequently, never more than five hours. So set an alarm, wake up in five hours, down an egg or a cream shake or something like that or a couple of them, go back to sleep, and enjoy your sleep. So when you wake, you won't feel all toxic. But still, you're going to have acid compounds in your blood. Have some vegetable juice, green vegetable juice, not high carbs. So let's say 80% celery, 80% to 90% celery, 10% to 20% parsley. Basic, clean juice. Have 8 to 12 ounces of it.

Q: Do you recommend other vegetables?

A: Those two to be safe. You don't want to cause detoxification. You can cause detoxification if you use other vegetables. And if you use carrots or high carbohydrate foods like root vegetables, you're going to cause too much sugar in the system, and you're going to have that carbohydrate sugar byproduct clogging up thinking in the brain and nervous system. Not only that, if you start off with fruit or even milk with high lactate in it, you're going to have all that gunk in the system and guess what happens? Your body gets nauseous, does not want to eat meat. When the body gets over alkalinized from that kind of thing, and the high sugar byproducts, it causes a repulsion to meat. So then you'll be locked in that cycle, catch 22. Carbs, carbs, carbs through the day. Not clear thinking, more emotional, more distracted. All those problems. So you start off with a clean vegetable juice, there's almost no carbohydrate in the celery, and very low in the parsley. You're getting all the vitamins, minerals, and enzymes, supplementation from that juice. So what you're doing is filling the body with lots of excess enzymes, vitamins, and minerals. How about tomato juice? Tomato juice is okay, but it's acid. You don't want any acid to start the day off, okay? So you start off with alkaline, hold on, yes?

Q: How about the half a lemon with 8 ounces of water? Is that a good drink to start the day?

A: No, I'm going to get into that. It's a terrible, terrible thing to take. I'm going to tell you why later. Pardon? He said lemon and water. How about that? Terrible thing to take. Okay, so you have your green vegetable juice relatively carbohydrate free except for maybe a little honey in it. And if the honey is truly unheated below 93 degrees, 90% of that carbohydrate is going to be used as enzymes for digesting, assimilating, and utilizing protein. And only 10% of that will be used as a carb. So it tells in the recipe book how to make the juice so you don't have to make it every day fresh. You can make it up to three, four days. And it tells you how to do that using honey and how to bottle it into glass canning jars. So all you have to do is reach in the refrigerator when you want to juice, so you have to juice every day or every time. Yes?

Q: I always wondered, [unintelligible] it from alkaline or anything?

A: Honey's very alkaline, unless it's heated. Unless it's heated honey. So you start off with the vegetable juice. It provides all the vitamins, enzymes, and minerals that you need to get everything ready for digestion and to have food. Now, we want to keep the mind clear, and we want to get the mind clear. How do we do that? By making the body use pyruvate as its nerve fuel, as its nerve energy. And the only way you can get pyruvate is from meat and eggs. It's a protein. It's a protein sugar. Glucagon goes in and transforms it into being used like glycogen to be utilized. But as I said before, it's only 7% to 8% waste product. Carbohydrates, 70% to 90% waste product. So you've got all this debris floating around in the system with carbs. So if you eat your first solid meal, a meat meal, with lots of butter or fat, any other kind of fat, but always butter, some butter in it, you will start a balanced day and a balanced system in all ways. 

Q: That's the first meal?

A: That's the first meal, yes. Meat and butter. Correct. Steak and eggs. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: 45 minutes, least amount of time, hour max.

Q: Between meals?

A: No, after the vegetable juice.

Q: Oh, you have the vegetable juice first and then the meat juice.

A: Yes. 

Q: 45 minutes in between meals?

A: 45 minutes for the first, after the first vegetable juice of the day.

Q: Uh-huh.

A: If you're a, normally a diabetic type person, a person that has hypoglycemia, it's good to eat three meat meals. So you break your one pound up into three meat meals. Basically, that's a pound of meat is three cups of meat. So you'd have three cups of meat, one cup, three times a day. If you're normally not a person who has hypoglycemia or any kind of a sugar problem, you have a tendency to be more hyperactive or energetic or just mellow in between, two meat meals a day is preferable. You have a cup and a half minimum twice a day of meat. And that's any kind of meat. With the structure of most people, most of it should be red, anywhere from 60% to 85% red meat. If you have a hyperactive condition and the red meat makes you irritable, then you need to eat some white meat with it. It could even be just eggs, and that'll balance the system. Then after that, if you need to calm and soothe your nerves, which is a good idea, you have cream and eggs together with a little honey. I call it a cream shake. You get a little bit of milk in it. Whenever we call something a cream shake, it has equal amount of cream to milk or more cream than milk. 

Q: Are you talking about raw milk and raw eggs?

A: Absolutely, raw milk, raw eggs, and raw cream. Absolutely, and unheated honey. So that soothes and calms, makes the system very relaxed. Then about, you know, that could be two, two and a half hours after your meat meal, or it could be an hour and a half after your meat meal, depending upon if you have high metabolism. Then about an hour later, after you finish the milk cream shake, or just suck eggs and have some butter and cream afterwards, then have another vegetable juice, eight to twelve ounces, depending upon your system. However, some people, if they take vegetable juice at that time, which is around noon, it causes them to get very sleepy. If that happens to you, cut it down to four ounces. If it still makes you sleepy, cut that juice out. Those people who are going to eat two meat meals a day, you have the juice a couple of hours later. If you get too hungry, less than that. Always at least an hour before or after juice, before you eat anything else except for fat. Cream or butter or coconut cream can be had with juice, and very close to juice. But you don't want eggs, you don't want meat, you don't want dairy products other than the fat dairy products, within an hour, either side of vegetable juice.

Q: Is honey okay?

A: Honey's okay. Pardon?

Q: Why do [unintelligible]?

A: Because the vegetable juice is alkaline. All the other foods are acid, except for fats are neutral. Unless they're pressed oils, then they're more acidic. What happens is that if you mix this alkaline and the acid foods, they neutralize each other and you don't have proper digestion. Or they'll turn into solvents and cause you to detoxify very quickly.

Q: So you separate the acid from the alkaline?

A: Correct. That's why you don't mix vegetable juices with other foods, except for the fats. Yeah. Okay? So, you have your second vegetable juice or none, depending upon your system. It's preferable to have it. If you get sleepy after you have it, you can take a 10-minute to 30-minute or an hour nap. Have that juice anyway and take advantage of the nap. Always good to have a nap. If I go a day without a nap, 10 minutes to an hour nap, I will sleep 6 hours a night instead of my normal 3 1⁄2 to 4. That means I don't get as much time of my life. I sleep more. If you take that day, that part of the day to sleep, your body gets to catch up on rest and healing. If you make it do it all at one time, it takes longer. Also, you have a lot more toxins in the body at one time. So the body gets very sluggish and wants to sleep a longer amount of time. But if I have my nap even 10 minutes, I only have to sleep my normal 3 1⁄2 to 4 hours a night. And I love that because then I can do so much more. I can live more. Of course, when I was doing my healing and I was so ill, I would sleep anywhere from 10 to 16 hours a day for the healing process. But now that I'm well, it's excellent. I went through a 21-day period where I did an experiment. I sued the police department and the city of Los Angeles for harassing people on Venice Beach. You get these runaway teenagers who are left home because they're abused, and they were going out there making jewelry and doing hair wraps and stuff like that. And the cops were ticketing them and running them off, forcing them into prostitution or drug trading. So I sued them, and I got them into federal court, and I'm my own attorney. That's the only way you're going to get that kind of case into court. So I actually got it through, and I was the first person to ever do it that was a non-attorney. And I had 22 officers in that room for a two-week period. I cost them a bloody fortune to do this. But I had to prepare every day, and I only had the time for an hour and a half's sleep a day. And I took it in 10-minute doses. Every hour I ate either an egg, a golf ball size of meat, or half a cup of milk. Never enough to satiate me, but enough to keep the body moving and moving. I lived that way for 21 days on an hour and a half sleep a day with no fatigue and no stress. I'm clear and very alert. I mean, I was right there in front of the jury and everybody, you know, doing my stuff right there. Because I let the judge know ahead of time that I had to have it. And I petitioned to have my food in the courtroom. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I sucked them right in front of them. But, you know, anybody who has to keep focused, just remember, stay away from fruit. It will clog the brain up, clog the system up. It will cause you to go alkaline. So you have some vegetable juice, you know, in the morning and evening or spread somewhere throughout the day. But you eat small amounts so you're never satiated and always protein-oriented foods.

Q: Did you win?

A: It's a little thing. No, I didn't. What they did was they took a juror out of the courtroom and planted a woman who had been in the police department for 10 years. And she... And I had two jurors wait outside for me and said, this woman, you know, messed the whole room up. So I took a look at her and I said, wait a minute, who is this woman? Who are you talking about? And she wasn't anywhere. I appealed it all the way to the Supreme Court of California. They just completely ignored it. Completely ignored it. But it was pretty quick. But I got to get them into court. It cost me a phenomenal amount of time and probably $25,000. But they left those people alone on Venice Beach. Those young girls and young guys. Pardon? Yeah, I did a good deed. Anyway, there's always ways that you can make things work for you when you have to. And that's a clear way to keep focused and keep moving and keep going if you get into situations like that. In the afternoon, normally though, a good weight gain diet... In the afternoon is when you should have your fruit. And we do need some cleansing help. And that fruit helps build alcohols. Because they will ferment in the digestive tract. So the body can make solvents to clean the body. And you have it with fat. Remember, like I said, you have, you know, like a peach, you have a half a cup of cream. That's about the ratio. So equal, almost an equal size and amount. Unless it's butter, it can be a little less because there's not much whey in the butter.

Q: So fruit with fat.

A: Fruit with fat. Always fruit with fat.

Q: So if it's...

A: You have it with, you know, fat and cheese. Fruit with fat and butter and cheese.

Q: Or yogurt.

A: Well, yogurt's not a lot of fat.

Q: What about raw milk?

A: You can do raw milk, but not as good. You have to have extra fat, concentrated fat. Milk won't do it. Milk is high in lactate, high in sugar. So you're having it with a fruit, it's going to be too much sugar. You have to have lots of cream or butter or coconut cream in that meal. If you have a lot of plaquing, if you have a heart disease, if you have thrombosis, varicose veins, spider veins, anything like that, you know you have a breakdown of toxicity in and plaquing inside the tissues and maybe in the cellular wall itself. And a good way to get rid of that is to have coconut cream. So let's say you have two ounces of coconut cream with one ounce of cow's cream and one ounce of butter. Good combination to be with your fruit. And the way you make the coconut cream I explain in both books. You take a coconut, aged coconut, a mature coconut with good thick meat in it. You pry it out, you cut it up, and you put it in a juicer like a Green Power or a Green Star 1000, Champion is okay.

Q: Not a blender though?

A: No.

Q: How about Vitamix?

A: No. Vitamix is one of your worst machines there is for food. Just like in your regular blender, you take the bowl, what happens? You blend, and what does it do? It draws air down into your food. And what does air carry? Oxygen. And what does oxygen do to nutrients? Destroys them. So if you're blending in a regular blender container, like a Vitamix, you're destroying a third of your nutrients just by blending. At least a third of your nutrients, depending on how long you're blending. And that's only if you're blending for 30 seconds. 

Q: What do you have to buy?

A: Well, you get like an Osterizer blender, and it comes with a bowl, and there's a base. Unscrew the base. Get rid of the bowl. And you get all these canning jars. This is an 8-ounce canning jar. They have 4-ounce canning jars. They have 12-ounce canning jars. They have 16-ounce, and they have quart jars. Regular canning jar size. Osterizer screw right onto it. You put the washer on first. Put the blades inside and on top. Make sure it's kind of lined up. Screw that on top. Turn it upside down on the blender. You've got a closed environment. You have very little air space. Very little oxygen in there. So it preserves 99% of your nutrients.

Q: Osterizer?

A: Osterizer blenders are the best. Sometimes they come with a very, very thin washer. They can fall down the side easily or leak out all over the place. So go to a small appliance store and get a washer that's a little bit larger in diameter, just a tiny bit, and thicker, that's at least 3/32nds of an inch thick. And then you put that on the jar first. The blades inside and on top. Line it up. Screw that on top. Turn it upside down. Turn on your blender. Pardon? That does not lose nutrients by doing that. Pardon?

Q: Can you buy coconut cream?

A: No. Well, we can in Los Angeles, but we have it bootlegged. Because it's illegal. Can you imagine that? In California, in almost all states now, they've adopted it. The federal rule is you cannot go into a store, even a health food store, and buy fresh juice. It has to be flash pasteurized or pasteurized or irradiated. The only place you can get raw, fresh juice is at a juice bar.

Q: Oh, what about raw milk? Same thing? Almost illegal.

A: Almost everywhere.

Q: What type of glass jar will fit in the osterizer?

A: Just regular canning jars. Ball is the best. Ball jars are better because if you get the Kerr jars, their ball used to make these very colorful. As you see, I like colorful things. With peach tops. But all the ball jars, lids, whether these are metallic looking on the outside like they normally are, all the inside of the ball jars are enameled with a true rubber seal. Kerr jars have this metal plating that comes off in your food and a gray polyurethane seal which melts into your food. So get the ball jars. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You're going to lose a lot from the egg because you're refrigerating it. You don't have to store it in a refrigerator. Store it in a dark cupboard. Fine. I've kept cream shakes for two days before I started tasting fermentation and still it's okay. Just remember, raw food never goes bad. It only starts breaking down. It pre-digests for you. Bacteria starts breaking it down. So pre-digest for you. Eggs can be 25 years old rotten and be good for you. The Chinese call them century eggs. And they are all black or white depending upon what they bury them in and which kind of clay. And they charge $1,000 per egg. And you know who pays for them? These old octogenarian rich Chinese men who can't get it up anymore. They have one of those and they can go several times a day for a month. That's a Viagra for you. From one egg, 30 days. 

Q: Okay, I'm going to start storing eggs. This is my retirement.

Q: You have to live past 100 though.

A: So, you know, whenever I get a rotten egg, I cheer. In fact, I cause them to get rotten sometimes. And a rotten egg, it smells terribly. But it just tastes like a hard-boiled egg and you put too much salt. You poured the whole salt shaker on top of it. It tastes like you've salted it so there's no tomorrow. I mean, this tastes so salty. That's just the minerals becoming very, very active in it. So it's just like a hard-boiled egg over-salted. It just smells terrible. And it's very invigorating. I mean, I remember one woman who was having... You know, she was overweight and she'd been a vegetarian for 35 years. Done all these things that she thought was right. You know, macrobiotic diet, all this sugar. And she was your weight, but not a good weight. It was all white and it was all, you know, just...

Q: Lumpy.

A: Lumpy and sanguine and looked horrible. And he'd say that about somebody who looked horrible. And she'd been on the diet for a couple of years, started getting better, but that sanguine look, couldn't get rid of it. So then she called me one day and she said, I've got all these rotten eggs and, you know, do you want them? And I said, absolutely. She says, well, I've got a dozen and a half of them. I said, bring them over. A couple of days later she brought them over, so I ate a few in front of her. And then, you know, after she saw me eat one, she tried one. She says, God, the odor is terrible, but these are easy to eat. And it changed the whole makeup of her skin. All of a sudden she started getting circulation in her skin, so she started getting color for the first time. Just from eating rotten eggs, high eggs. It's the bacteria that make a big change in her system fast. Her whole body's changing because she's eating more of them.

Q: So we need bacteria.

A: That's right. We're in a sterile environment. Everything you do, air conditioners are full of formaldehyde and other things to keep molds from growing in your homes and buildings and theaters. And that formaldehyde goes in and it's an antibacterial. And every time you use a soap, kitchen soap, detergent, ammonia, you're breathing all of those antibacterials in there and you're destroying your bacterial environment in your body, your natural bacterial environment. So we're all deficient. We're in a sterile environment. Dr. Joel Weinstock of the University of Iowa, I think it's Iowa, got the theory a couple of years ago, or ten years ago, six, seven years ago, something like that, that we were getting too sterile and that bacteria and parasites, he had been to one of my seminars, was not the good thing to do. We were getting too sterile, too clean. So he took the whipworm from a pig and gave it to, he was a gastroenterologist, and he dealt with a lot of people with chronic bowel syndrome. And the medical profession said you can do something outside of the normal medical procedures if a patient doesn't react within ten years to normal medical treatment. Ten years? Give me a fricking break. But some of these people had been on medical treatment and not reacted to medical treatment in thirty years. And he took six people who were very, very ill and gave them a solution of these eggs from a whipworm from a pig, put it in Gatorade and had them quaff it. Well, the Gatorade is an alkaline solution which will allow it to carry it down past the hydrochloric acid. It will neutralize the hydrochloric acid and take it down to the digestive tract. Five of these six people went into complete remission and had suffered their entire lives. And they were back five, six months later asking for more because they started wearing off. The parasites were eating the toxicity in their body and the colony was starting to break down and die, so they needed more. If they'd been on a good diet, they might have been able to help keep them going a little bit longer. But that proves, again, that we're too clean, we're too sterile. We need these parasites, we need these bacterias in our body, so we eat lots of rotten food, lots of bacteria. Now, the University of Toronto, in association with the Children's Hospital, the Hospital for Sick Children, the Hospital for Children in Toronto, had been doing experiments with bacteria using E. coli, the verotoxin, the bad thing produced by E. coli, for over 30 years now. They took and they injected the verotoxin produced by the E. coli into a human brain cell, a brain cancer. It dissolved the tumors and the vessels going to the tumors in 2-7 days, every day. Why isn't this on the market? It's 30 years now. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's right, that's right, because they made $80,000 to $120,000 for chemotherapy and all this other radiation treatment. Vion products came out with attenuated salmonella because Yale had been using salmonella, doing tests with salmonella for about 12 years and found that salmonella goes in, chokes off the oxygen to a tumor, then eats up the tumor. So what they did, Vion products, they attenuated the salmonella so the salmonella goes off and chokes off the oxygen to the tumor but does not consume it. So the second part of the therapy is to take an injection of a solvent which dissolves the tumor. So the injection of the attenuated salmonella cost you $8,000 each injection. The injection of the solvent to dissolve the tumor is $12,000, $20,000. Hell, go out and eat shit. Eat high meat, full of bacteria. My next book is going to be called Eat Shit and Live. You think I'm kidding? The next book is going to be on detoxification and I'm going to produce the exact same book with two covers. One is going to be called Eat Shit and Live and the other is going to be for a normal average person. You know how many people are going to eat, buy that book? This is Eat Shit and Live. There will be a lot of people that will wake up. It's a lot of things. But there are tribes on the planet which eat fecal matter. You have to understand when an herbivore eats the matter, they have a digestive tract two and a half times longer than we do. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fats and the proteins out of the vegetation. We don't have that. Plus they have two to four stomachs. We have one. Vegetation goes through our system, whole vegetation, in 24 hours. It goes through them in 48 hours, twice the time. They have to work on it. And you still see their patties. You've got all kinds of fibers all over it, all kinds of matter they still didn't digest. Well, there are certain tribes that don't have access to a lot of meat, so they eat fecal matter from these vegan animals, these herbivores. And they get all this protein because it's already pre-digested, and they put it through their system. They have no disease. They've no dental caries. They don't have any problems. There's another tribe which hunts for meat, cuts it out in thin strips, lets it sit, lets all the flies lay their maggots on it. And when the maggots are five days old, right before they're ready to hatch into flies, they eat them. They only eat maggots. They don't eat the raw meat. They eat maggots. No disease, no problems. Tribes eat crickets and worms and stuff like this. There's a man in Thailand that just got great recognition. He eats earthworms to keep his virility and everything up. All of these things, as long as they're raw, will work for us. They are food for us. Don't be afraid of them. Crickets just taste like the grass that they eat. Earthworms taste like dirt. Not such a great appetite, but still, they're good and healthy. All of these things that are supposed to be taboo and unclean are the very things we need. Yes?

Q: Are there some insects that may be bad, like the one tribe ate the maggots, but what about flies? I'm just curious.

A: Well, it's hard to catch flies. Maggots are very easy to catch. It's not a problem. And you'd have to catch a lot of flies.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They don't. They don't. That's a myth. You know, everybody gets diarrhea and everybody gets colds and flus and symptoms. Just remember, they are the vultures and the crows internally. They only find degenerative tissue to eat. When you see a vulture and crow eating an animal, you don't blame that creature, I mean the vultures and the crows for killing that creature. They are there for a purpose. What is causing the toxicity in the body that causes the vomit and the diarrhea or the flu or whatever? It's not the bacteria or the virus or the parasite. It's the toxins that are in the body causing the damage to the cells. The medical profession loves to point to bacteria as the cause. It's not the cause. They are the clean up crew. When people die from that kind of poisoning, they don't die from the detoxification process, they die from the treatment, anaphylactic shock, from the vaccines or the antibiotics. Because if you look at those cases, they have the exact reactions of anaphylaxis. They don't have a dehydration and complete debilitation to where they die of starvation, which is usually what would happen if an animal was so toxic and they broke out into a too high of a state of bacterial cleansing. So it is medically induced, like the little girl was supposed to... 

[audio cut]

A: ...pull over and cause that to happen. No, she probably got some kind of chemical or was exposed to something, went to a detox to eliminate it, and they used Cipro on her. Cipro has a history of creating kidney damage. They blamed the E. coli on creating HUS, which is a kidney disease. But it was the Cipro which killed the little girl. But do you think the medical profession is any cop to that? Absolutely not. I was on with the doctor's husband, online with him about that, and I brought all the facts to him up, and never heard from him again. Never heard from him. He argued with me for a week until I brought up the documentation on the kidney disease caused by Cipro.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Those are the people who believe that bacteria is bad for you, that's all. No, no, you're just making this body more sterile. You had a question?

Q: Well, it was just interesting, you were talking about the E. Coli. There was a recent outbreak this past summer, and I think there were 12 people eating at this place, a Mexican restaurant in one of the malls. And I think one person died, but I know one of the most severe is that one had seizure and brain damage. But it's interesting that you're pointing out that as I was reading the article, I wonder, I'm like, [unintelligible].

A: Everybody, exactly.

Q: These people were at a different place, I guess, in that sort of, but anyway, it's interesting.

A: You'll find people all around you are having diarrhea and vomiting, having flus, all around you. It's just that when some doctor all of a sudden decides that there's an epidemic, that they'll find those people who are being treated and call it some kind of problem. And then they'll find a relationship maybe with a few of them, or they've all been to the same restaurant. Now that doesn't mean that you can't have food poisoning, because you can get food poisoning if you've got botulism. Botulism isn't a natural bacteria that exists in the human body. It occurs when you've cooked a food and you canned it in metal. It creates a bacteria that doesn't normally grow in the human system, and that can create quite a bit of illness, vomiting and diarrhea. That's still a detoxification to get rid of it, so it's a good thing. But you need to eat lots of tomatoes and lots of eggs to help yourself through that. Also, when bacteria grows on cooked food, just like we become toxic, they mutate, they become toxic too, so their byproducts are a lot more toxic. So if that food has been cooked and sat for a while, and the bacteria starts feeding on it to degenerate it, the byproducts are going to be highly toxic in the system, and for some people it's going to create a reaction. Yes?

Q: So kind of back to you, I don't know if you remember in the 80s when [unintelligible].

A: They don't have any excuse in the world to sign the law, but like I say, it's an associative, they associate it with the milk, but there's no scientific proof to believe it. That's the problem with our system.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They throw all that information out to confuse people, because they're confused. They really believe that bacteria and virus, that's the whole germ theory. The germ theory is that pathogens create disease. The whole word pathogen means to create disease, organisms that create disease. But these organisms don't create disease, they go in after disease exists to clean it up. But the medical profession is sold on the germ theory. Take, for example, the whole medical issue. Raw milk was outlawed in Los Angeles County unless it was a certified milk. That milk had to go through such rigorous processes that nobody could produce it. It was financially unworthy. Couldn't happen. So the existing raw dairy couldn't sell their milk in Los Angeles County, raw milk. We had no milk in Los Angeles County.

Q: When did that law pass?

A: The last one?

Q: I remember in 1984 I couldn't buy Alta Dena at Mrs. Gooch's.

A: Yes, yes, yes. They made the rules for the passing of certified milk more stringent to the point where by 1992 they practically wiped it out.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, I did. I went in and got the reports, all the reports that I could, on the advantages of raw milk from Yale to John Hopkins, anywhere I could go. I found all this data that showed that the helpful reports of raw milk, and I put some of it in the recipe book, in the back of the recipe book. All this data, and the only data that I could find that was scientifically linked to food poisoning in dairy was from pasteurized dairy. One incident involved 197,000 people from a pasteurized dairy product, scientifically linked, but they've never been able to link any epidemic with raw milk. It's always associative. Oh, this means, let's say, three of these people out of this whole group of people, all these people who got sick, had raw milk, so we're going to blame it on the raw milk. Or, like in Wisconsin, you know, 30 people went out to this farm. Five of them didn't go out to where the animals were. 20% of them drank raw milk, but they blamed it on E. coli and a poisoning from the farm. Well, did they go to Jack in the Box earlier on their way out there? They didn't ask any questions like that. They just blamed it on the raw milk. They still use that incident to support their campaign against raw milk. Well, I blew them out of the water when I made my report. A 52-page report. There was an attorney that had been fighting that law for 36 years in Los Angeles County. His report was 500 pages. It was so confusing, so belabored with information, that you couldn't get the point across. It wasn't made. I did it in 52 pages, actually 32 pages, with exhibits from other people. You know, people telling their experiences. Doctors, MDs who were in favor of raw milk. But I did it in 32 pages. I got to use Dr. Douglas' name on it, as if he were to write it. But I wrote it entirely. I wrote the legal brief that went with it. Two of my patients who were lawyers, they submitted it to the Board of Supervisors. And basically, I threatened them. I said, here's the facts that show raw milk is nothing but good. Pasteurized is bad. If you discriminate, we've got the facts here. Are you ready to go to court and face a class action suit over a billion dollars? Guess what? The law was changed around very quickly. Got the law changed.

Q: So now it's available in stores?

A: Everywhere in California.

Q: When did they get changed?

A: It was 2001, March 2001. And I helped the state of Indiana and Wisconsin and Pennsylvania now. All these states are trying to close them down. I write them a legal brief and give them that report and say, go ahead and do it. We'll own you.

Q: You're surrounding us. What about Illinois?

A: Yeah. Well, that information's there. Nobody's come to me and said that they're strapping down and making it worse.

Q: We don't have farmers here.

Q: Yeah, I think in Illinois you can actually buy it on any farm legally. They can't sell it, but in Illinois it's legal for anyone to go to the farm and buy it.

Q: Yeah, that's OK. Find a farm, though, with grazing cows. That's a critical key.

Q: There's a lot of difficulties with it. In Wisconsin, I have to be part of a cow share program, so it's even harder.

Q: You actually own, well, I heard the cow shares have been illegalized.

A: No, they're trying to do that, but they're not able to do it.

Q: Well, I was buying my milk up in Wisconsin. They had a big problem, I believe, with one farm. Because I know you're talking about, I believe, Hayward, where they were having that problem with those people.

Q: Yeah.

Q: And I was buying it closer, just outside of, above Wisconsin, into Wisconsin. But anyway, nonetheless, I heard the cow share was illegal. I just read the article. What you've got to do now is you've got to buy a part of the farm. And that's what they're...

A: No, no, it isn't. It's like, say, I have to go buy a whole dealership to lease a cow, to lease a car. No. It's completely argument, if you can argue that legally. That's why, did anybody see Wall Street Journal a few months ago?

Q: Absolutely.

A: Okay. You saw that it didn't say, you know, we're going to wipe this out. It said this is the structure and this is the way it is. And it is legal to do that. Because it's a legal system to be a share owner in the cow, in the herd. Not the farm. You're a lawyer. You go in and say, wait a minute, do I have to buy the whole dealership to lease a car?

Q: Well, I didn't understand. But I'm saying that the farm we were going to, they were trying to close them down too. They closed down the Hayward place because of that. They're making them buy part of the farm.

Q: I just signed a cow share in Wisconsin like two months ago.

A: So they were stopped, basically. They were stopped. But it took a few months to get there. It took some threats to get there. And they took my report and they used it in every place. If you want that report and all of the whole process I went through for that three-year period to change the law, it's at www.rawmilk.org. And you can cut and paste anything on there and use it yourself in your own city. www.rawmilk.org.

Q: What's your feeling on raw goat's milk compared to the cow's milk?

A: Good question. Okay, the difference between cow's milk and goat's milk. Goat's milk has a lot of precursors to adrenaline production. If you're a hyperactive person, if you're too thin, do not use goat's milk. If your children are hyperactive, too thin, do not give them goat's milk. You want to give them cow's milk, which is very calming and very relaxing.

Q: So it's an adrenal producer, is that what you said?

A: Yeah, it helps the body. In fact, it encourages the body to build adrenaline.

Q: Okay, so if you have problems with adrenals...

A: Then it could be helpful, yes. If you're a person who's overweight, if you're sluggish, and you have adrenal problems, then goat's milk is wonderful.

Q: What do we do about pesticides on our food?

A: Lots of fat. Lots of fat. And eat organic foods as much as possible. Remember, the toxins bind in the fat, or the fats bind with the toxins. 

Q: What are your feelings on the high cholesterol business?

A: There's a book that I refer to in the second book, it's called The Cholesterol Myth.

Q: That's [unintelligible].

A: No, there's another book. It's in the second book.

Q: Oh, it is?

A: Yeah, it's there. I don't recall the name of it, but it's by a brilliant biochemist. Pardon? No, it's a man. And he talks about every facet of how the body uses cholesterol. And like I say, we manufacture 65 varieties of cholesterol, and none of them are bad. All of them have an advantage in the body. It's just what kind of cholesterol from what products are you building the cholesterol. Now, we talk about hardening of the arteries. And this whole vegetable industry, this, you know, safflower oil, seed oil companies came around to herald in their product. They were calling all of these animal product fats the cause of arterial problems and heart congestion and arteriosclerosis and all kinds of problems. However, all of the tribes that eat nothing but fats, even if they're cooked, have no heart disease and have no hardening of the arteries. Only people who have that are vegetarian-type-oriented tribes because you cannot break down the fats in vegetables properly, so they harden like a resin. You know what amber is, the stone amber? It's fat from a tree. Hardens into a crystal rock. Animal fat never does that. It'll just mold and become earth and go back into it. If you take dirt and you put flat safflower oil in it, you will have a rock. Once it dries, you'll have a rock. If you put animal fat in there, it will mold and turn back into dirt. The responsibility lies with pressed oils. All your seed oils, all your safflower oil, all of those pressed oils is a problem. The flax oil in small amounts is okay as long as it's raw. Olive oil is good in small amounts as long as it's coal stone pressed. Pressed below 96 degrees. But they have to be had in small quantities or else you'll have a problem.

Q: So what about salads? What do we put in our salads?

A: You don't have salads. Don't eat salads.

Q: Juices.

A: That's right, vegetable juices. You're not an herbivore. You cannot digest the whole cellular structure. So if you take the juices, you're getting everything that you need without exhausting the system. Plus your digestive tract has to be acid. The bacteria that normally reacts with food and the E. coli is entirely an acid environment organism. If your bowel becomes alkaline in any way, your E. coli will no longer work. E. coli is responsible for the final phase of protein digestion assimilation. That's where your B vitamins are synthesized, most of them, and your amino acids in the bowel. If you're passing a high amount of vegetable matter through your intestines, you're going to turn that environment alkaline and your E. coli is not going to work. That's why vegetarians become progressively less able to eat and digest certain foods to the point where they can't digest any food after 30-40 years of being a vegetarian. They completely wipe out their enzyme activity by trying to be an animal they're not. Way back to the cycle. In the afternoon, somewhere between 1.30 and 3 o'clock should be the fruit meal with lots of fat or none at all. If you're a person who is highly emotional and reactive, I would say take a break until you're well enough. Don't eat any fruit, except for maybe tomatoes and cream. Something that has hardly any carbohydrates in it. Or eat green fruit like all animals do, except for crazy monkeys. John Goodall, the man who did a film called The Beginning, won the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature. I think it was 1969, 1970. I edited a film right next to him in 1972. I was well enough to work. He followed these gorillas around, this tribe of gorillas. They only ate green bananas. They would bite the skin and eat the whole thing. Very alamine, but that's the way they ate. So they couldn't figure out why they didn't let the bananas go ripe before they picked them. So they cut down a big stalk of bananas, from here to here, and it was like this. They put it on their jeep, and they wanted their jeeps, and they carried it around until they ripened. And they followed the tribe of gorillas. When they ripened, they threw them out to the gorillas. The gorillas were very curious, went out there and were picking them off, trying to bite them, and they'd just have a [unintelligible]. They made squishes, all of that. It took them a while. About 40 minutes later, they got to the point where they were peeling them. After about 20 minutes of eating them, they started fighting. They started fighting over them. They had this sugar reaction. One of the babies got killed. One of the teenagers got a broken leg. Another one got a broken arm. And they were all fighting over these bananas. And they couldn't even get there to get them out because the big gorillas were fighting the hardest, keeping everybody away from them. They went sugar crazy. That's what happens when high sugar is in the system. Most animals, except for the crazy monkeys that eat ripe fruit, and they are crazy. They go around screaming and hollering and beating each other. They live on ripe fruit like that. But the animals who live on the green fruit with lots of enzymes and low sugar don't have any psychological problems.

Q: So green bananas are better, huh?

A: I can't say you can eat them, you're not used to it. But any green fruit, green papaya, green apples, green figs. If you would buy your fruit, green pineapple. All of those, you'll have more enzymes and less sugar. Lots of enzymes, low sugar. That is your best. Then even if you had emotional problems, you can eat some fruit once a day in the mid-afternoon. 

Q: But it has to be green.

A: It has to be green and with lots of fat still. Then let a few hours go by. If you're one of those people who has to have three meat meals a day, what you would do is after that noon juice, you would have a meat meal about an hour later, and then a couple of hours later have your fruit with the fat. If you're a person who only has two meat meals a day, you just go from the juice to the fruit and fat, and then you'll go to the next juice. It's got to be at least an hour after you finish that fruit meal where you have your juice, third juice. For some people who get very tired and can't take a nap, they cut out the juice that will be the second juice for them, but normally it's the third juice. You've got to keep alkalizing the blood. You don't want to alkalize any of the intestines, so you don't eat the whole vegetables. You want to alkalinize only the blood. That's why you drink the juice, the green juice from the vegetables. Then about an hour, an hour and a half later, you have your second or third meat meal, depending upon what type you are. And I'm not talking about blood type, that's all garbage. 

Q: Would you substitute your juice that you would make with maybe barley, green, or...

A: No. 

Q: ...dried stuff?

A: Anything that's dry is not alive, and it just takes a lot of digestion to break it down. Would you eat hay?

Q: No.

A: Okay, it's basically what it is, it's hay...

Q: Cows eat hay in the winter.

A: Cows? You're not a cow.

Q: They have four stomachs, huh?

A: A cow can digest some of it pretty well. But there's no way that we can do it. So it robs you of a lot of fluids and a lot of nutrients trying to break this down and to rehydrate it. And you can't do it. The human system can't do it.

Q: So dehydrated fruits will keep it from doing it?

A: No. In fact, they have more sugar in them. Concentrated sugar. Except for dates. For some reason, dates and butter work very well together without creating a sugar high. Dates and cheese and butter even better. It tastes like a cheesecake. And there's a recipe for it. Cheesecakes. Cheesecakes. Recipes of cheesecakes.

Q: Fresh dates or dried dates?

Q: You can have dried dates.

A: There's no difference. The only thing on a fresh date is that they're really mushy. But you can't get them in the market that way because they ferment and go bad. You have to let them hang on the tree until they dry.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, but they don't sell those normally. I mean, it's rare you can get them. Yeah, but they're usually yellow. That's a young fruit. That's a green fruit. They're good. They're very good.

Q: What about cabbage juice?

A: You know, I'm going to have to keep on track here because if you don't keep on track, you're going to have a problem. Okay, so vegetable juice, again, to alkalize the blood. And you go to your meat meal about an hour, an hour and a half later or more and have that second or third meat meal, depending upon, and also a lot of fat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Not really.

Q: No?

A: I eat that way all the time. When I'm on my weight gain, I'll eat a lot more. This is a butter and honey mixture. I may go through two of these a day. 

Q: That's not on your weight gain, though.

A: The weight gain.

Q: Oh, on the weight gain.

A: In the recipe book, it's called Moisturizing Lubrication Formula. I call it moisturizing because moisturizing appeals to women. I call it lubrication because lubrication appeals to men. That's what it's called. Moisturizing Lubrication Formula. Moisturizing slash Lubrication Formula in the book. And I'll have that with my meat. Each time I have meat. And I'll have meat two or three times a day. So that's basically a pound of butter a day sometimes.

Q: Wow.

A: Or close to a pound of butter a day. Two-thirds of a pound of butter.

Q: Wow.

A: During my weight gain cycle. And then on the weight loss, I'll only eat maybe a third of a pound of butter a day. I have to eat more because I've been on this so long I can lose, you know, 20 pounds in two weeks. Because my body's so efficient now. And I have to slow it down because I want it to go on slowly. Because I like, like I said in the recipe book, I like people to take two months to gain the weight, hold it for two months, and lose it for two. Take two months to lose it. And that works the best. It's the cleanest, easiest way to do it. Two six-month cycles a year. Of course, people just starting the diet, people that have a lot of weight problems for a long time, they should be on the diet for about a year before they even try to, or six months before they even try to lose. And then that may take them a lot longer to lose, and they won't be able to get down as much as they'd like to. And then they just go up and down, and just keep breaking the weight off slowly. So there are all kinds of ways to do it.

Q: So for those people, you'd say to make...

A: Then after that meat meal, then, you know, a bunch of eggs, Rocky style, or another cream shake, and then a juice before you go to bed.

Q: You're eating all day.

A: How many times do you drink coffee, or a vegetable juice, or a Coke, or a fruit juice, or something? Everybody's always sticking something in their mouth about every two hours. Okay? You're having vegetable juice. You're having milkshake or egg. Basically, those are liquid things that go down quickly. You're only sitting down to two meat meals, two or three meat meals a day, and that's it. Yeah.

Q: I think we have about... It's about 4.30, about 15 minutes we want to get into this.

A: Okay. So, also, once a week, I recommend that everybody have a nut formula. And the nut formula is the place where I get... Those who've read the first book know that I used to use cooked starches combined with those neurological compounds that make us crazy. Excess adrenaline, excess all kinds of problems. However, in following people over the years, I found they still would store, even on a good, raw, primal diet, store some acrylamides and some advanced glycation end products in their system. So I had to find the starch that we could use without storing. Nuts, I tried before and they work. However, you don't digest protein for 24 to 36 hours, and seeds because of the phytic acid in it. And then when you germinate them, then it turns into three other enzymes, which are of the vegetable nature, which create the same problem. So germinating doesn't help. It just compounds the problem. You not only do not digest the protein in the nuts and seeds, you don't digest the protein and assimilate the protein in other foods that you eat, in eggs and meat. So it's a problem. So I kept experimenting with blending different foods and preparing the nuts and seeds differently to see what worked. And I finally found what worked. You blend the nuts, and softer nuts are always better. The walnuts, pecans, sunflower seeds, filberts, hazelnuts, you can call them, and pine nuts. Pine nuts are a problem sometimes because they have a tendency to suppress thyroid production. So if you have a hyperthyroid reaction, pine nuts can be good for you. If you don't, if you have the opposite, a hypothyroid, you don't want to have pine nuts. You take about 2 1⁄2 to 3 ounces of those nuts, or any combination of those nuts. If you have a liver problem, stick to walnuts only. And then you blend it into a flour. You add egg, butter, and honey. And it's about 2 ounces to 3 1⁄2 ounces of butter, 1 to 2 eggs, 1 to 2 tablespoons of honey. Yes, it's in the book. And then you blend that, and it tastes like a delicious nutty candy. And you can have that with your last meat meal, or you can sit there and spoon it out one evening. But have it in the evening, once a week. You know, people call me and say, Oh, man, I'm having a problem. I'm doing the diet perfectly. I'm getting stressed. I'm having a lot of anxiety. I'm not working things out as well. My relationship's not going well. And I said, When's the last time you had the nut formula? Six weeks? Well, have the frickin' nut formula. So they have the nut formula, everything will be okay the next 24 hours. Everything's fine. It'll last for a week or two.

Q: I tested that. I had depression after doing some high-meat. I called and I said, Oh, this high-meat's not working. It's making me low. He said, [unintelligible] nut formula? I said, Oh, really? [unintelligible] the nut formula and the depression was instantly gone.

Q: I thought the high-meat was supposed to help the depression.

A: Pardon?

Q: I thought high-meat was supposed to help the depression.

A: It usually does. It usually does. If it doesn't, that means you've got too many psychological by-product hormones that don't react with bacteria. Bacteria has nothing to do with those. It doesn't break those compounds down. Then you need the starches in the nuts to bind with it. But like I say in the book, 95% of all psychological problems are low-bacteria level. The other 5% you need the nut formula. If you have it once a week, you're not going to have a problem with that ever. You just have the low bacteria unless you're eating high-meat or high-eggs.

Q: So you eat the whole thing, the whole ratio?

A: Correct.

Q: Can you say something about water?

A: I want to talk about water in general. Water is a big no-no. What is water? 

Q: Water?

A: Water. What is water? Water rains, doesn't it? What happens to the rain? The rain goes in and dissolves rock. That's what water does, it dissolves. That's its nature, it dissolves. Put something in the ocean, it'll dissolve unless it's a fish. It dissolves rock, it dissolves steel, it dissolves everything. That's what water does on this planet. So if you put water into the body, you're going to leach your nutrients out. You stay in water, what happens when you sit in a bad bathtub for a couple of hours? You start shriveling up. They call that waterlogged, I beg your pardon, waterlogged, if you're shriveling, you're logged. If you're logged, you're going to get bigger, right? What it does is it draws the nutrients out of your tissues. That's why I say you put the milk, you put the vinegar, sea salt in there, it doesn't happen. You can be in there 12 hours and you will never wrinkle. Milk, sea salt, and the vinegar in the water, in your bath water. It won't happen because the water has the milk and those other things to work on. It doesn't work on your tissues. The heat will help you perspire some of the toxins out of the lymphatic system and help the lymphatic system discharge, but it won't be the water drawing it out, it will be the heat. Water will destroy your system, too much of it. During the fall and winter, by the time it hits November, I don't drink any water. I don't drink any water from November through April or May. Then, from May through November, I may drink a half a cup of water a day, and that's it. We are delipidated, not dehydrated. Drying out, that's because your body's taking most of the toxins, mineral toxins are in your brain. The highest storage of mineral toxins are in your brain. They discharge from the mouth, out the gums, tongue, everywhere. You get cotton mouth, that is not a dehydration. Your body's used all the available fats all throughout the system to bind to those toxins as they come through your gums and your tongue, and your salivary glands, and dries out your entire mouth. So, what do you go for? Honey and butter mixture. Put some of that in your mouth, and let me tell you.

Q: Oh.

A: Does that blow your mind? That's honey in it.

Q: I know.

A: It's like candy.

Q: But I see you have the mineral water.

A: It's not November yet.

Q: Okay, no, I'm just...

A: That's what I will have for a whole day. Half a cup. Okay.

Q: What about candida?

A: Candida is a yeast. It's a mold. What does yeast feed on?

Q: Sugar.

A: Right. And what does it feed on normally? Damaged cells, damaged by sugar byproducts. Candida does not live on honey. You put candida and honey together, they die. Candida dies like that. But what sometimes happens is when people are eating honey, they assimilate their proteins better, and guess what gets thrown off? Sugar byproducts. The yeast in the skin. So it makes you feel like the honey is made in candida worse. But what it does is it makes it better. You're getting rid of the tissue. What you need to do is I have the primal facial body care cream on page 145 of the recipe book. You make that and apply that to any itchy area, no matter what your problem is, no matter your skin problem, drying of the face, anywhere. You put that anywhere on your skin, anywhere on your body, itching goes away in five minutes, and you don't have to reapply it until you take a bath or a shower, or subject that area to fluids to dry it up again. The primal facial body care cream, page 145 of the recipe book. And that takes care of it. Let me tell you, I have covered everything that can be covered. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, what I usually recommend is honey, water, lemon juice, and cream. That lasts longer. If you use just the honey and water, it's not going to last very long. But it will work quicker and work better. Remember, a headache is a swelling in the brain. It's a detoxification. The skull doesn't expand with it. So the three headache remedies that I have in the first book are that. They're the lemon, the honey, the water, and the cream. You should always have the cream with it. And even though I didn't put that in the first book, I'm changing it on the revision to come out next year. But what it does is it helps pull the toxins out of the blood so it doesn't cause as much swelling. And it neutralizes some of those toxins. Also, the minerals, the high mineral content in the honey and to the water keeps the water from seeking the blood for some of those nutrients. But it still goes for minerals from your blood. And if you can pull those minerals out, the minerals usually attach to some toxin. So if the water is there pulling some of those minerals out, it lowers the toxicity level in the blood. That's why I say some water is important, but not a lot. You need a little help every day to leach some of the poisons out of your system. But too much is going to leach all the good nutrients out of your system, and you're going to have a problem. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it usually happens with diabetics and people who, athletes who have a sluggish lymphatic system. They don't clean the lactic acids out of the muscles nor the sugar byproducts out of the muscles. So when the body starts trying to clean them out, the sugars are highly acidic, caustic, and they burn the nerves and the muscles, and they cause them to go into a charley horse and cramping. So high fats. Drink lots of cream if that happens. And within 20 minutes, put hot water bottles around the area until it goes away. But that person needs a lot of cream and a lot of butter.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Soy is the most toxic substance that is out there in the food. Human, nor a chicken, nor any bird can eat raw soy. It will kill us. They have to solvent extract it, heat treat it. They're calling lots of organic eggs and chickens that are grown on organic soy. But let me tell you, they have to treat the soy, they have to solvent treat it, plus they have to heat it. So those chickens are eating cooked, unorganic food. So it's a misnomer and it's a fraud. And I'm already starting to fight that. I'm trying to find an attorney right now who will handle it. And we think we might have one. And we're going to stop these companies from doing that. So, you have your information out there. That was finished. Soy is toxic in any form.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It doesn't make any difference. That enzyme does not get neutralized. It will poison your system. It won't cause, if it's completely raw and not fermented, then you're going to probably die from it, eating it. But fermented, it does break it down, but it still poisons your liver. And your nervous system.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Absolutely. All of it's poison. Soy sauce is poison. High salt. Salt is dangerous. Salt is the worst thing next to cooking.

Q: Could you mention sea salt?

A: Sea salt doesn't make any difference. Anytime you take a concentrated salt-sodium, it causes the sodium ions to clump. Your body, your cells, eat by the process of ion attraction. So whenever a cell wants to eat, let's say it wants to eat some potassium, I mean some sugar, or carbohydrate, or pyruvate. It attracts a potassium molecule, because that's what usually carries that. So open up, and the ions inside the cell would attract the potassium ion, and it eats what it wants. When there are clumped molecules of sodium passing by a cell when it opens up, the attraction outside is so great, outside of the cell, that it pulls the ions out of the cell. That's its gut. That cell will never ever eat again, and it shrivels, like a raisin and dies. One grain of salt will destroy one million red blood cells.

Q: Celtic salt, too?

A: Even celtic salt. Any salt of any form of any kind.

Q: What about inorganic salt that's in celery, though?

A: No, that's a bioactive sodium product. It's a food when it's in that. It's not an earth mineral. It's bioactive in that property.

Q: What about if you smoke something? If you smoke fish, is that no good?

A: That's terrible. You're getting all the carbons in there and the ashes, and you're creating still a form of dehydration and cooking. So smoking food is not good. This is the last question, and then we've got to end it. So I have to start with a mini consults.

Q: You said like a bath. You said vinegar, salt, and milk. [unintelligible]

A: No, epsom salt is a concentrated focus of certain kinds of minerals. It's not good. Sea salt, sun-dried sea salt. Okay, now what I'm going to do is I'm going to do mini readings. What I do is I look at the palms, and I see the mounds that I can see activity. I can see the color. There are lots of patterns on the hand that I can read some health from. So I'll be doing that for people. It's just like my iridology, where I can see what's in the body and the toxins in the body, except for metals like you see them in the hand. So I give people a kind of a head start, and a little bit more analysis of how they can start doing it on, getting on to the diet. And each one takes about six to ten minutes. So if you want to listen and learn, you will learn. So you don't have to be somebody who's getting a reading to sit and listen. Anybody can listen. Hi. Okay. What's your name again?

Q: Edward.

A: Edward. Okay, Edward. Both hands just fall limp in my hand. Did you have a [unintelligible]?

Q: Yeah, let me get it to you.

A: Okay, Edward. You're about 60% protein deficient. It looks like you've been a long-time vegetarian or non-meat eater. Even along your spine, all of your glands are debilitated. You have very good recovery ability. So the basic genetic structure is good, and you should recover quickly. Your red blood cell count looks very good. Some lymphatic congestion all in the chest and esophagal area. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You should have let it go on its course, because it left all kinds of scar tissue all over in there. So you should have another one or two spells of pneumonia. And be happy, because it will break that tissue down quickly. You have a massive amount of scar tissue, especially on the left side, and along the lower spine on the left side. It looks like you might have a tumor in the liver, but it looks like there's an infection, so you're trying to break it down. You have lots of scar tissue. It almost looks like cirrhosis of the liver at the bottom fifth of it. The kidneys, the right one is okay. The left one is very debilitated. Both adrenal glands are very debilitated, especially the left. The thyroid gland is barely working. On the left side, the right side is okay. Parathyroids on both sides are okay. Lots of scarring around the tonsils. Lots of lymphatic congestion in the head. I'm going to suggest about two pounds of meat a day, juice. You have a lot of bile everywhere in the system, so your body has used bile to bind with poisons instead of fat because you're fat deficient. When your body uses bile in place of fat... Bile is to digest fat, not to be used as fat. It creates a caustic condition, and it starts eating away at the tissue of the cells that it enters. It creates an oversensitivity in the cellular structures. I'm going to recommend that you have 10% carrot juice to help get rid of the bile, pull it out. When people turn orange from carrot juice, it's not from the carotene. It's because carotene has a propensity to pull bile out of the system. The only place the body likes to discharge bile is through the skin. When you're on this kind of a diet, you eat carrot juice, and you start discharging, and you've had a lot of bile in the system. Sometimes you'll get bright orange spots, and then they'll turn brown. It'll look like a birthmark for about 6 to 18 months, and then they go away. But it freaks some women out for a while, because they think they have this big ugly birthmark somewhere on their face. So 10% carrot juice, 10% parsley, 10% zucchini, and 70% celery. For the nut formula, you could use pecans or walnuts, sometimes sunflower seeds. I recommend that you have 3 12-ounces of juice a day and one 8-ounce. The one about noon should be 8 ounces, and the other two should be 12. You have lots of metals all around your heart. So you might eat about maybe 4 sprigs of cilantro with a meat meal about every fourth day. Only. Lots of metals in your brain, especially around your ears and your left ear. It can cause some earaches. For that lymphatic congestion, I'm going to suggest hot baths, you know, about one every three to four days that last at least an hour and a half. With the formula in the bath water. Just remember that the lymph system doesn't move. I don't care if you're on a trampoline or what, unless you melt it first. It's as hard as hard can be. And the only way you can get it to dissolve and soften is to get it above body temperature, because once you've taken a vegetable oil and it's hardened in the body, it takes a temperature above 102 to get it to soften. So if you soften it first and then get on a trampoline, you'll get some good activity. Otherwise, the trampoline isn't going to do most people much good. Pears would be good for you to eat in the afternoon as a fruit. So green pears, green papayas. I recommend that you have about 18 eggs a day for at least eight months. And some of that can be in one or two lubrication formulas a day that I suggest that you have with your meat meals. I suggest you only have two meat meals a day. About two pounds, that would be three cups twice a day. Work up to that.

Once in a while you can have about a half of an inch circular slice of green pineapple, but only once every five days in the afternoon with lots of fat. If you're going to make a coconut cream and don't have time, because it's a lot of work. What I did was, when I was living in Venice, I got a 3x5 card and I put it up at Venice High School. Venice High School is known for the gangs and everything. So I worded it this way, I like somebody who likes to break shit. And I put a telephone number, $10 an hour. So I got lots of these gang kids and kids who like to break things. I paid them, you know, if you make the coconut cream and put the lime juice in it, like I recommend in the recipe book, it'll last for six weeks to two months. If you don't, it's gone in four days. It ferments that quickly. So then when I moved to Malibu, then I put a sign, I need somebody who likes to break things, $10 an hour. Still got the people that I need to make the juice for me. So they come in with this every six weeks. They do ten coconuts for me, which gives me about ten cups of coconut cream. So I have it for six weeks. Because, you know, it can take you four or five hours to juice that many coconuts. It's a lot of time. When a kid, you know, you can pay some kid to do it. You know, maybe it takes them five, six hours to do it, but it's only once every six weeks. And you can get a guy who's, you know, he's not having to show up every day. He just goes every six weeks, and he gets his 50, 60 bucks, and he's very happy. So that's the easy way to do that, to get coconut cream. But coconut cream is the best thing to get rid of intestinal plaquing and lymphatic congestion. So I'm suggesting you use two to three ounces of coconut cream, two ounces of cream, an ounce of butter with that circular slice of pineapple, green pineapple. Okay? About every five days, help it move. Okay? All right?

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome, Ed. Nice meeting you. Take care. This is for you, Ed. 

Q: Oh, okay.

A: Well, wait, I guess that's for him. I don't know, is it?

Q: Yes, yes.

A: Harry, were those to pass out?

Q: Yeah.

A: The tapes? Okay. And your name?

Q: Mary Ann.

A: Mary Ann? Okay. I'll get it on the tapes for you. Mary Ann Ludwig? Hi. Okay, about 50% protein deficient. Very fat deficient. You have lots of lymphatic congestion. Extremely a lot of lymphatic congestion. So you need baths about every other day, at least an hour and a half. Sleep with hot water bottles so your whole bed heats up frequently. You need to really dissolve that stuff. Coconut cream is good for you, but it's going to make you nauseous if you have more than three tablespoons at a time. And there's lots of metals in your liver and in your kidney and around your heart. I'm going to suggest in your juice 5% cilantro, 15% parsley, and 80% celery. And I'm going to recommend that you have a tablespoon of coconut cream before you have the juice. It'll help get out the metals a little bit better. And a tablespoon of cream in the juice. Right before you drink it, you add the cream. If I recommend anybody have cream with their juice, they put the cream in right before they're going to drink the juice, not before. If you make the juice and you put the cream in then, it's going to bind with all the minerals and you're not going to get the value of the juice where we want it in the blood. It's going to go to the glands. How old are you? Okay. I recommend that you have about 12 ounces of meat a day by weight. 12 ounces by weight, which is about two cups of meat and two separate meals. If you can eat more, it's fine, but it may be more difficult to eat that. Oh, and another thing. There's a lot of people, especially women, who don't like the meat. You don't have to chew the meat. You can just wash it down with a lubrication, I mean, a moisturizing formula or milk. Just wash it down. 40 of my healthiest clients are women who wash their milk down because they'll eat from one to three pounds a day. Those that do the diet, everything else 100%, but only eat maybe two-thirds of a pound, do not progress like those 40 women who just wash it down. Digestion of meat does not happen in the mouth at all, and no tribe chews their meat. They swallow it after crushing it about twice with their teeth and swallow it whole. So you don't have to worry about chewing meat. I'm going to recommend that you have a moisturizing formula. Make one for a large batch and then separate it into your two meat meals and have it with your two meat meals. If you want to, you could still have one of the sauces that makes the meat more enjoyable for you. Drink half of the loop formula after each meat meal, within 15 minutes after each meat meal. Red blood cell count looks pretty good. It looks like you could heal very quickly. You do have a lot of bile everywhere else. So I'm going to recommend about every 12 days that you have a cup of carrot juice with two ounces of cream and two tablespoons of coconut cream. It isn't as necessary to add the coconut cream, but it is very necessary to add the cow's cream with the carrot juice. And no sooner than 12 days apart. It would be better if you didn't have fruit. Just eat lots of tomatoes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's because you're so fat and protein deficient. Once you start having the cycle, it will be fine. But like I said, tomatoes and cream together make a difference. You can blend the tomatoes with the cream, and you'll find it won't cause that kind of sore. Tomatoes help people get rid of and eliminate nerve platelet toxicity. 85% of the population has oral herpes because of the toxins and metal poisons that come from the brain and discharge through the mouth. Herpes helps break down nerve tissue, toxic nerve tissue... 

[audio cut]

A: Otherwise, it's not gonna move. From your clavicle up, it looks okay. But from the clavicle down, everything is very congested and not moving. Very poor circulation on the right side of your digestive tract, small intestines. Red blood count looks okay. Juice I'm going to recommend, about 10% carrot, 10% parsley, and 10%, excuse me, 80% celery. You can have a tablespoon of coconut cream before the juice and a tablespoon in the juice. A tablespoon of cows cream in the juice right before you drink it. That will help clean the lymphatic system. 

Q: Is that coconut before and cows cream?

A: Melons when they're in season are okay three times a week, but never two days in a row with lots of fat. Whipped cream would be good with cantaloupe and a couple of tablespoons of coconut cream with it. Other times, whatever fruit appeals to you. But I wouldn't have fruit more than four days a week and always in the afternoon. And applying a hot water bottle on either side of your intestines is going to be very helpful. This side or sides, both sides. Because that scarring around the heart does not look good. So if you have heart palpitations after the first juice, don't worry about it. Just sit down, breathe rhythmically, and get through it. If you feel a little pain or congestion, it's probably the muscles trying to contract to move circulation, and don't worry about it. Don't think you're having a heart attack. Just remember a heart attack is the body trying to free up the congestion in it. If it locks into a spasm, that means that the muscles, the lactic acid is built up in the muscles in the heart, and that's why it just goes into a charley horse. It stays there, and then it stops pumping. But normally that spasm is to get things moving and free up the congestion in the heart. If you're on this kind of diet and you have that reaction, don't worry about it. Just sit down and relax. Put a hot water bottle near your chest and help that flow move through it, but don't panic. I recommend that you eat a pound of meat a day and have at least one moisturizing formula a day with one of your meat meals. A pear once in a while would be good for you too, a green one. For some reason, whipped cream is going to help you a lot. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Whipped cream, not whipped eggs. Take cow's cream and whip cream. For some people it helps.

Q: When are you gonna be [unintelligible]?

A: I'm usually there in the spring, anywhere between March and May. Thank you, nice meeting you. Next. What's your name again? Do we have a tape in there, somebody taping this or writing it or what?

Q: I don't know.

Q: I hope this is a blank tape.

A: Let me ask... Harry, are those blank tapes in there? Is that a blank tape from there?

Q: I put the number one back at the blank one.

A: Okay, this is Dawn. About a 30% protein loss. It means your whole body's about 30% low in protein. It means you've got some catching up to do. That means eating more than a pound of meat a day if you want to catch up. Just wash it down if you can.  Very poor circulation in your intestines on the left side. Lots of lymphatic congestion in the glands. It's almost like there's a psoriasis or an eczema-type reaction going on. There's almost like a bleeding internally, sores internally, like ulcerations. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it's a fat deficiency. And also you're deficient in vitamin U and vitamin K. 

Q: Vitamin U?

A: Yeah. So I'm going to suggest that you have some cabbage juice, about eight ounces every four days. First thing in the morning. That will be your juice for that day, the morning juice for that day. 

Q: I'm taking probiotics. Do I do that before or after the probiotics?

A: You're taking probiotics pill form or powder?

Q: Powder.

A: Okay, that's fine. You can have probiotics any time. Not with the juice, though. Are you having probiotics with the juice?

Q: First thing on an empty stomach.

A: Everybody who's taking probiotics, what does the bacteria live on?

Q: Sugar.

A: No. That's worm casings, worm shit, basically. So it lives on the proteins in the soil. So if you want the probiotics to be effective, you need to eat them or drink it with a meat meal. If you have it with water, you're just going to destroy the probiotic activity. So you're just going to be washing most of it out of your system. So you want to take anything that's probiotic with meat, something you can feed on to help the bacterial activity. 

Q: But they say...

A: I don't care what they say. They're all theoretical. They don't do anything from practice. They get this into this theoretic bullshit.

Q: Even the HSOs?

A: HSOs?

Q: To help the soil organisms?

A: Yeah. When it rains, it lowers the probiotic activity in the soil. 

Q: So it needs something acidic.

A: Yeah, it needs something acidic, and it needs animal tissue to grow on.

Q: Can I use this?

A: It looks like once you stabilize the cell walls, you'll get much healthier much quicker, but you're extremely fat deficient everywhere.

Q: Could you tell?

A: Pardon?

Q: Could you tell?

A: No, but I mean there's some thin people who still have enough fat everywhere, but you have no protection anywhere.

Q: How do I do that?

A: It's like you have bile everywhere. Everything's very thin and very irritable and very sensitive. I recommend that you make a huge batch of the moisturizing formula and have it with two meat meals, half of it each time. And like sirloin, you should have at least three cups of meat a day, a cup and a half at a time. Like I said, you could use the baths every day.

Q: Which baths?

A: The baths, you know, with milk and cream in it just to get some of that fat moving, especially on the left side of your body. It's like the whole left side of your body is arrested, even around the upper part of the spine, right around the shoulder blade down, almost to about two inches above the waist. It looks like the back's very sore there. As far as fruit goes, I would only have the custard with green papaya, lots of tomatoes with cream, raw cream. For normal juice, I recommend just a straight 85% celery, 10% parsley, and 5% zucchini or cucumber. Cucumber more often than zucchini. And if the cucumber isn't organic, peel it. If you're somebody, I recommend that you definitely set an alarm, wake up and eat something. And I recommend that you have 12 eggs a day minimum. You don't have any mucus flow. Everything's very irritable. You need protection.

Q: Nervous sytem okay?

A: Nothing's okay. Everything's very thin and in danger. It's like you've got this gauze as protection. All of that's going to help a lot to start building that up. Eggs, the cabbage juice, the meat, and the lube form... the moisturizing formula are very important.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, yeah, definitely. Yeah, as long as you take care of yourself. You're still young, beautiful, so it's fine.

Q: Oh, you're a nice guy.

A: You're welcome. Very nice. Okay, just let them go limp. And your name?

Q: Julie.

A: Julie. A lot of protein deficiency here, about 40% protein deficiency. Were you a vegetarian?

Q: For four years, yeah.

A: It moved you like you had been a vegetarian 12 to 15 years.

Q: It's terrible.

A: Well, the red blood cell count certainly does not look well. The red blood cells don't look well. Lymphatic congestion everywhere. It usually will make somebody very cold. I suggest you sleep with hot water bottles. Have them as your teddy bears. Lots of hot baths, you know, up to three hours several times a week. Even though you might be inclined to want to just go to sleep and go to bed, do some exercise afterwards. Wash yourself, do at least 15 minutes of exercise. Whenever you do the baths, you can do it any time of the day. Any time of day or night. But after you do the baths, do some exercise. I recommend that you have, you know, about four cups of meat a day, which is about a pound and a third. Eat a balance of cream and butter with it. Mostly meat, probably, I mean mostly red meat, 90% red meat. Tuna, you know, red fish, you know, ostrich, which is deep red is not red meat. Red meat is a large animal like, you know, a buffalo, a sheep, goat, cow, deer. Ostrich is good, but it's a white meat. Any fowl is white meat. Pork is fine as long as it's organic. Yes. Just know your pig. All of the glands look like they will function fine as soon as you start eating properly. The left side of the tonsil area has a lot of metal poisons in it, so you may get sore throats and earaches on this side. Well, at some time in your life, you're going to detoxify. The diet has nothing to do with it. It will just help you detoxify properly and heal properly. And you have lots of metals in your left ovary, so it's doubtful you'll ever get pregnant with that left ovary on that side. Less of inflammation in the pancreas, so I don't suggest many fruits. Have honey and butter and cream all mixed together. Let's say you have one and a half ounces, which is three tablespoons of cream, three tablespoons of butter, and a tablespoon of honey all mixed together with your meats. You have a lot of metal in your ears, so that can, both ears, so that can cause some earaches when you start detoxifying. A hot water bottle on either side of the face will help. I gave you a juice, right?

Q: No.

A: I thought about it. Eighty percent celery, ten percent parsley, and we don't want to cool the body, so do five percent cilantro and five percent carrot juice. When you do cilantro, you have to have some fat in the juice, so have about a half a tablespoon of cream, cow's cream in the juice. And ninety percent of your meat should be red meat. 

[chatter]

A: Okay, let your hands go limp. Okay, your name?

Q: Gloria.

A: Gloria. Okay, a lot of protein deficiency in the left ovary, the right seems to be okay. Adrenal glands, the left is very deficient in protein, the right is okay. Pancreas, both sides pretty shot. Protein deficiency in all the upper glands, even into the brain, but especially in the throat and chest, the thymus, thyroids, parathyroids. There is some activity, but not much in the left thyroid, and the right is a little bit better. Parathyroid on the right is okay, left is not working. Lots of scarring in the tonsil area. Very poor circulation in the small intestines, especially higher up. Lots of scarring in the hiatal, the diaphragm, membrane between the stomach and lungs. Could cause a lot of heartburn and acid reflux as those acids dump out the esophagus and into the stomach. Looks like you have some hardening of the liver. Looks pretty advanced too. Lots of scarring around the heart. Left kidney isn't very good, and the right is okay. Red blood cell count looks fine, just need to get the red blood cells healthier. Very fat deficient, very protein deficient in good raw products. Quite a bit of lymphatic congestion all throughout the chest and groin area. Lots of drying, it's almost like you have an internal eczema. So for you I'm going to recommend every once a week having a cup of green cabbage juice. When I mention cabbage juice it's always green to stop ulcerations and eczema type reactions. Never red. For a juice I'm going to recommend 80% celery, 5% green cabbage, 10% parsley, and 5% zucchini. I'm going to recommend that you sleep with a hot water bottle between your legs or on either hip, higher up though, through the waist and the hip, pretty frequently. Just to increase the circulation in that area. I'm going to recommend that you have olive oil with every fifth meat meal, about two ounces. Plus... Everyone, if you're talking loudly it's going to pick it up on this tape and the person's not going to be able to hear very well. So if you're going to talk please go way down the end of the room. Thank you. So I'd like you to have two ounces of olive oil, two tablespoons of butter, one tablespoon of cream. Make that into a sauce. You could add tomatoes if you want. Have that with every fifth meat meal. And I recommend that you have two meat meals a day for two days in a row and then one day three meat meals a day. Then two days with two meat meals, one day with three. Just keep alternating like that. I'm going to recommend that you have about two and a half cups of meat a day. And you can break that in. On the days that you're having two meat meals, break it up into two meat meals a day. You're having three, break it up into three meat meals. And you can wash it down if you don't like it. But usually with different sauces, it'll be easier to eat. In about two years, I think you'll be stable enough to start removing all this metal toxicity you have in the system. Then you can start eating a little cilantro with your meat meals. And about 90% of your meat should be red meat. But I recommend that you have an egg almost every time you have meat just to help balance the acidity level. Or some white meat with the meal. But if you don't have fish or chicken with that beef at one meal, have an egg before or after. Or with if it's steak tartare. About every four days, I suggest that you have some lamb.

And about once every 12 days, I suggest you have an eight ounce cup of carrot juice with three tablespoons of cream. And make sure that's in the afternoon. I don't recommend fruit for you unless it's very green. And it's not very sweet. And not very acidic. Ice cream, raw ice cream, something you can make every once a week will be good for you. It may cause a little tightening in the chest and a little coughing, but you need to move it. You need lots of that fat. That kind of fat, just raw ice cream, just make it. Also the moisturizing formula, I suggest you make a big batch and you drink two ounces of that throughout the day. As long as it's not within an hour of the vegetable juice. Just keep that nursed into your body, two ounces at a time. You should make about a ten ounce batch of it. And then, as it is in the recipe book, do you have the recipe book?

Q: No, I ordered it.

A: Pardon?

Q: I ordered it.

A: Oh, okay, well let me give you the recipe for it then. Two eggs, four ounces of butter, one and a half tablespoons of lemon juice, and one tablespoon of honey. That should make about nine ounces, but that's close. And drink two ounces of that at a time, you know, about every four hours, as long as it's not in conjunction with a vegetable juice. Okay? Feed that into your system. Okay?

Q: Okay.

Q: Does honey ever [unintelligible]?

A: Pardon?

Q: I've found that the moisturizing drink is separating, so it becomes difficult to have it over long periods of time. You just have a bunch of butter on top.

A: It might be that way in a colder environment. I haven't found that it separates when I make it. Well, I'm in a warmer climate, California. Shake it up.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I put it on tight, and then if it jams up, I'll open it up until it starts flowing again, and I'll tighten it again. Okay, relax your hands. Still not eating enough meat. You need to eat at least a third of a pound more than you're eating, so you're not eating the meat. How much? How much?

Q: Twice a day.

A: Yeah, but how much?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Not enough for you. Yeah, you need at least another third of a pound. If you're eating a pound a day, then you need another third of a pound, so another cup of meat. You still need protein... It looks much better than last year. Still bile everywhere, so juice, now that you're a little bit more stable, I'm going to recommend 10% carrot juice, 15% parsley, and the rest celery.

Q: No lettuce?

A: No. No what?

Q: No lettuce.

A: Well, if you need the opiates, yeah. Yeah, well it doesn't look like you need the opiates anymore. No. You're cool enough.

Q: That's me. I am.

A: You have a lot of lymphatic congestion, so you need to do those baths at least every third day, hour and a half at a time, and then exercise afterwards. Moisture, I mean the, the lubrication formula, you need to have, are you having one a day?

Q: No.

A: You need at least one a day. Yeah, you need that formula. Coconut cream, remember, is mainly solvent reactive, 60% solvent reactive, so it's going to dry you out, and you're too dry still. So you need that lubrication formula to start moisturizing everything. That may be the reason you're not, you know, assimilating your protein as well. Maybe the pound is appropriate for you, but for some reason you're not, you're not assimilating at all, or you need both the extra third of a pound of meat and the lubrication formula. So I'd do both, I'd rather be safe than move slowly. In that vegetable juice put a tablespoon of cream. I suggest you have 12 ounces of juice three times a day and one 8-ouncer right before you go to bed. I recommend pineapple three days a week, about a third or a little bit more than a third of a third inch circular slice of green pineapple with about three table, I mean three ounces of coconut cream, two ounces of cow's cream, and two tablespoons of butter. A little honey in it if you like. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's not going to do what I want it to do, clean out the lymphatic system. That'll clean the liver and the kidneys a bit, but not where you need the lymph system to cleanse. And once a month, I suggest that you have 16 ounces of carrot juice with four ounces of cow's cream. And take about two hours to drink it. But I'm having you have carrot juice every day, not once a month with a big batch, okay? And are you exercising?

Q: Yes.

A: Okay, and how much?

Q: Uh, about a solid [unintelligible]?

A: Well, I'm talking about something more aerobic to get the lymph system moving. So, taking a good brisk walk or jogging, you know, something, or jump roping, something like that. Do it.

Q: What size are your coconuts?

A: Uh-huh.

Q: In the book the size of the coconuts that you said, that you get cream out of it? What size coconuts? Are those big coconuts?

A: No, they're about this big.

Q: In the Champion juicer, they'll come out with the screen or do you want to go with the screen?

A: The screen. You need the pulp to come out, yeah.

Q: Is it still going to come out of there?

A: Well, what you have to do with that is you have to push down on the front as you're pushing down so that shaft doesn't move forward. It'd be much easier to just get the Green Star juicer. It takes so little, I mean, you have to slice everything and put it through because it has to be smaller than the Champion, but it juices easier. That's why I hire somebody to do it.

Q: I found that wine works well, to drink it while you're doing it.

[laughter]

A: Okay, your name?

Q: Barbara.

A: Okay, Barbara. All right, just let your hands fall down. About 25% protein loss on the left side of the body. Very fat deficient. Also, vitamin K and vitamin U deficient. So I'm going to recommend either a half a cup of green vegetable juice a day or 5% of your juice green cabbage. The rest will be 80% celery and 15% parsley. And if you're not having the cabbage juice, green cabbage juice in the juice and you're having it separately, then increase the celery to 85%. I recommend that you have a moisturizing formula. Make, you know, like a four or five ounce batch and then have it twice a day with your meat meals. And I recommend that you have two and three quarters cups of meat a day into two meat meals. You have a lot of scarring in your stomach, especially the right side of the stomach, going into the duodenum. It's almost like you have a growth in there. Lots of metals in the liver and around the liver. So I'm going to recommend about three sprigs of parsley every other day with one of your meat meals. On one day that you have it, have it in the morning. The next time you have it, have it in the evening meat meal. Don't keep it the same one. It causes too much of a detoxification. Protein is deficient in the spine. Suggest that you sleep with a hot water bottle on either side of your waist. If you have fruit, it should be very, very green fruit. Apples, pears, okay. Right now, melons, if you have them only once a week. Tomatoes is your best fruit. Tomatoes and cream. So if you blended, let's say six ounces of tomatoes with two ounces of cream, that would be a nice mixture for you. And one tablespoon of butter in that, even if it calms. Hot baths would be very good for you also. Eighty-five to ninety percent red meat. You have lots of metal stored on the left side of your spine, in the spine, from your, just about an inch and a half above your waist, all the way up to your shoulder blade. I'm surprised that doesn't cause some pain. I know, that's what I'm seeing. It doesn't look like there's pain there, but it's buried there. But you might, you might get some pain if that starts moving. Because it's starting to look like it's becoming active. The body's going to start moving it. So don't be surprised if it starts. Just eat lots of pain formulas. 

Q: I'll call you.

A: Okay. The pain formula's in the recipe book. Go for it.

Q: Okay.

A: And you have lots of bile, so I would say once a week for you, have eight ounces of carrot juice with two ounces of cream.

Q: Once a week?

A: Yeah, once a week.

Q: I can do it.

A: Can you?

Q: I can do it.

A: Okay. With two ounces of cream?

Q: Yeah.

A: Good. Continue doing it. And I do suggest that you eat pork once every six weeks. Okay. Let me just take a moment to suck an egg. Okay. Okay. We have to get out?

Q: Yeah, we have to get out in the next five minutes or so. So thanks for everything, everybody.

Q: Hey, Gary, can I come for a reading?

Q: Can he read my hand? Can he read my hand? Monday?

Q: Yeah.

Q: Oh. Well, okay, what hours is he going to be there? Monday. Well, actually, I'm working [unintelligible], too.

Q: Well, why don't you come...

A: Were there some more I had yet to go? Was there some more I was supposed to read? Oh, is that it?

Q: Well, what time is it, Miss Burrell?

Q: It's a quarter to two. Do you have time yet?

A: Oh, we've got time yet.

Q: Do you want to do one more?

Q: Okay.

Q: Do you want to do it now and get it done with?

Q: Okay.

A: Is that all I have, one more? Oh, definitely. Let's do it.

Q: Well, I was going to... She was going to come tomorrow.

A: Oh, no. I'll stand up. I don't have to sit down and do it.

Q: Well, you said, oh, yeah, I need to get this.

Q: Let's do it tomorrow. Let's do it. We got to do it tomorrow. We got to go. We got to put all this stuff away.

Q: Let's do it tomorrow.

Q: OK. OK. 

A: What I gave you is I plan for, you know, a while.

Q: I'm going to get the recipe book.

A: We start with the juice and the meat meal and the eggs or a cream cake. [unintelligible]

Q: Joy is going to bring some chairs for us.

[chatter]

A: So I say you have to suck eggs, suck eggs, suck eggs, suck eggs. [unintelligible] Eggs would help that. If you don't have all the other things in the eggs, you utilize mainly for that. [unintelligible] Do everything in the pattern that I gave you. [unintelligible]
