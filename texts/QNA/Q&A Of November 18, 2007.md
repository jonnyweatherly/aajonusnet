A: I guess people got my email this morning that I wrote last night. Ron Paul, all the lobbying that five of us did.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Pardon?

Q: It's hard to hear you.

Q: [unintelligible] upstairs.

A: Who’s upstairs?

Q: My mom.

A: Oh, ok. We’ll just have to put up with some of the talking. Anyway, five of us were in Washington, D.C. I went May 28th and stayed through August 1st. We lobbied Congress five days a week, had meetings with Senators and Representatives, two to probably seven a day. It was very rare that there were seven a day. We had meetings with them, convinced them that the raw milk was a safe and good thing. Of the 537, we only saw 76. It would have taken probably a year to see all of them. However, we did have a plan to go to each office with the report that I had printed. Just the printing alone was $15,000. The rental of the unit was $10,000, the house. Very expensive to live in D.C. in a nice neighborhood. The Cohen family out of Colorado funded the whole thing. It was very good. We went to Ron Paul's office. His chief assistant, Norman Singleton, said, if you want a bill, we'll write a bill for you. I said, sure, let me see how many co-sponsors we can get before you write it. We had about 70 representatives and senators who agreed to sign on as co-sponsors if they would get somebody else to write the bill. Ron Paul was way out there, so I was afraid for him to write the bill, even though he's an M.D. He's a doctor. It would be perfect to have an M.D. write it. However, the stature that he's accumulated in the past few months is incredible. So, we've been writing the bill for the past 6-7 weeks. We're tossing the bill back and forth, rewriting it to make it as simple as possible, like a one paragraph or less, three sentences. We're trying to whittle it down to law. He did the final write of it, and he submitted the bill to Congress on November 5th, and just last Thursday, Dennis Kucinich and Peter Welch signed on as co-sponsors. So in the email that I sent this morning, or last, during the middle of the night, I asked people who are pretty savvy about the milk, who understand it, can call all these 70 representatives and get them to sign on as co-sponsors, the ones who promised that they would, and we got somebody to submit a bill. So we need people who can get on the phone in this next week and call everybody. I will be calling some, I've got this other California law that passed that is going to wipe us out of milk in California. So I need people who can call in the next two weeks to get as many to sign on as possible.

Q: ...the ability to drink milk or have milk pass state lines?

A: The federal law allows raw milk to go interstate. Right now it's outlawed and the FDA is using that as a reason to say raw milk is bad. But if this law is delivered to Congress by an MD, they're going to have a hard time using that defense anymore. So I'm also planning to do a class action suit with them starting somewhere around April. But this class action that we're going to do against the California Legislature is a law that was just signed in by the Governor on, I think it was October 10th, October 8th, somewhere around there. The Governor signed it in that will make the regulations for raw milk for the coliform count so strict that the milk will pass no more than 50% of the time. And that way it'll put the raw dairy producers out of business because they won't be able to afford to stay in business. Same thing that happened to Stubies, that's what they did with Stubies. Here with the Los Angeles County Medical Milk Commission did that very same thing. So I took it to the Legislature, showed them all of the documentation on raw milk, that was a good thing. And Dr. Vicky Yun, who was the head of the Health Department at the time, issued a five-page letter to the Board of Supervisors stating that it killed children. Like one girl, she had really drowned in a lake, had nothing to do with Salmonella. So I showed that every statement that he put in the letter was false. He was fired a week later. They had to, because they set them up for a suit and I was getting ready to file a suit on them. So with him having created all this false information, it was blatant that they were prejudiced and creating a situation of fraud to defraud the public of the raw milk. So of course the bill passed. Four out of five, so it was close to unanimous. So we got the milk. So now we're facing the same thing, the state did it. Pass that law. So I have to go on with a class action suit. I just got an attorney who's going to help. He's not licensed in California, but he's a constitutional attorney out of Washington State. He's the head professor at Pepperdine for constitutional law. So he's agreed to do for half price, you know, $350 an hour instead of $700 an hour. 

Q: Oh wow.

A: So we need your donations. I have enough to probably get us all the way through to the court steps with donations already. But if it goes to court, then of course we're going to need the extra money, another $30,000 to get us through the court. Don't want to do it pro bono, because that means if there is money that we get, it's all going to go to the attorneys, and we'll see $5 apiece, something like that. And I don't think attorneys deserve that kind of money just to go in pro bono. That's like, you know, 100% interest on the money. Not right. Of course, it is a high risk gamble, but everything's a risk when you're investing, whether it's a savings account or whatever. So, need your donations, you know, to help out here. Also, I'll be getting another large donation, $25,000, from the Cohen family this February. They gave $25,000 to Right to Choose Healthy Food. That's why it took two years to receive the $75,000 before we could go to Washington, D.C. to do that. And that whole episode cost about $40,000.

Q: To be in Washington?

A: To be in, two months. That was pretty good. Most lobbyists charge $100,000 a month.

Q: Do you have to pay them?

A: No, we did it ourselves with all the expenses. It was for five of us, and all the food, especially Little Piggy Nation. Where is he? Hey! The amount of food that boy eats? There you are. You know, he's skinny now. He doesn't have all the food that we got.

Q: Caviar.

A: But all of us ate well, and Nathan did a lot of work there. He made our food for us. He wasn't there the whole time. He came about a month later. That would be about four weeks after we were there. So he prepared our food for us. He even went shopping, and then did a lot of computer work too. So we all worked very hard, very long hours. So we worked very hard to make raw milk available. And then for them to pull this clandestine thing, and California state legislators, they slipped a one-page bill that nobody noticed into the farm bill, regulating raw milk, and it didn't belong in there. They snuck it in. So, of course, Schwarzenegger grew up on raw milk. He trained with raw milk all while he was in California. [unintelligible] So I'm sure he wouldn't have signed it if he had seen it. But he's the only one that can issue a letter to the health department and say, back off, you cannot enforce this law. And he can do that. He can't rescind the law, I found out from the constitutional attorney. He can't rescind it. If he was going to rescind it, he had to do it within 30 days, he didn't.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, he'd already signed it before anybody found out about it. Too late, yeah. He had 30 days to rescind it, he didn't do it.

Q: Why is that?

A: He wouldn't have signed that. He would have had to reject it from the bill, from the farm bill. Because he's for raw milk. You know, unless he's in the hands of big corporations like Enron, because he's in Enron's lap. And the Bush family, he's heavily in with the Bush family. So he may have, you know, I doubt that he knew about it, I doubt that he would have let that fly. Yes?

Q: Did the Vicky Yun, the attorney, do...

A: I will be in touch with them again on Monday, tomorrow, because they couldn't tell me anything really at that point. So I've got an attorney in San Francisco who looks like he will be doing the submitting of the law and the briefs and the injunction and the lawsuit itself. I've got Martin, Charlie Sheen, and Emilio Estevez. They will go and do a press release. When we file the suit, they will be part of the lawsuit to get us some publicity, because all you have to do is make enough noise and the health department doesn't want to be seen as a bad guy. And the government doesn't want to be seen as, I think, a bad guy. So that's why I'm getting them. I'm also trying to get Leonardo DiCaprio. Now Martin Sheen and Leonardo worked on the Departed film that was released last year and won all those awards. So Martin's going to call Leonardo. Now Leonardo was raised on raw milk because he was a patient of Paul Fleiss, who was a pediatrician. So... Thank you. So, you snuck in?

Q: I snuck in.

A: So, it looks like everything's going very well, but I don't know if we're going to be able to get a hold of Leonardo because he's probably one of the busiest actors there is. Raised on raw milk, he's one of the brightest young minds we have.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Pardon?

Q: He's got an 11th Hour documentary also.

A: Yes.

Q: About planetary survival.

A: He's a very conscious young man. Okay, so I'm going to start. Oh, there's one other thing. Ebrahim has some dairy and meat that he brought from Rawesome for anybody who needs meat. And he brought some pig brains.

Q: Pig brains and intestines and buffalo meat.

A: And buffalo meat and dairy.

Q: Eggs and dairy.

A: What kind of dairy?

Q: Milk and butter.

A: Milk and butter.

Q: Those intestines are mine, [unintelligible].

Q: Oh, they're yours?

Q: Thank you for bringing them. Trying to get a parasite, has been unsuccessful so far.

A: Too toxic.

Q: Did you bring any books?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do you have books?

A: Yes, I have one of each. Somebody called and asked me to bring them. So it was you, okay. So I have one of each that I brought. In the car I have a lot of recipe books, but I don't have any more of We Want To Live right now. I'll have to go to [unintelligible] after this, it's near here. So I'll be picking some up there. But if you need the books, you know, you can go to Rawesome. Rawesome sells them.

Q: I've got them on the site.

A: Oh, on the website. Also, if you want to get the downloadable versions, the PDF versions, you know, you don't have to go through the index that way. You know, in the book you have to go through it. If you have it on your computer, you just put the word that you want, and you can click on every spot that relates to what you want. You just click to those pages. So it's the same cost as the hardbound books. You know, so it's good to have both for quick reference, if you want to reference something quickly without having to go through the books, the hardcover books. And the only place those are available are on WeWant2Live.com. The WeWantTo, the two is the number two. WeWant2Live.com. Okay? All right.

Q: Aajonus, before you start, on the legal thing, is the OPD and Claravale, are they working with you on this?

A: No, I don't want them working with us. I want them separate suits.

Q: Oh, they're doing their own thing.

A: Because we're going to go in, I think even Sally Fallon's attorney's doing one, and then Marques' own attorney, so we're going to go at the state of California with three lawsuits.

Q: Oh, wow, okay.

A: Yeah, because it's always better, because a judge can't get by with throwing out three. They may get away with throwing out one of the cases, but he's not going to get, no judge is going to get by throwing out all three cases. And even if they throw out mine, we're in federal court overnight. Because it's a federal issue, it's a constitutional issue. It's even in the California Constitution, but I've dealt with California before, and ended up having to take them to federal court to deal with that. So, I'm not worried about all that, it just needs more money.

Q: Who started this against the milk industry?

A: The health department.

Q: They just wanted to deprive us of as much nutritional food as possible, because it's big business, disease is big business. You know, doctors and pharmaceuticals. It's like, keep the nutritional fare with everyone very, very low, so none of our brains can grow and get stronger, and get more intuitive on what's really right for us.

A: And you know, this stuff made me, I was autistic before I was 22, when I started drinking the raw carrot juice and the raw milk. You know, within about 10 days of drinking those, all of a sudden my autism, you know, I was able to read, I was able to comprehend language for the first time in 22 years. You know, 21 and a half years. So, for me, it's, you know, of course they don't want the raw milk. You know, they don't want good minds. They want people sick and subservient.

Q: Yes, like little dummies, really.

A: Now look at our educational system. If you look at who created the educational system, mainly the Rockefellers. And the Rockefellers are known to want to run the world, rule the world, and they have ways and all kinds of ideas on how the educational system should be set up to make us dumb. And there's a few books on it, on how the Rockefellers wrote the whole didactic approach to our educational system in America. Okay, let's get off of all that politics now.

Q: It's right over there.

Q: So, is this the milk?

Q: That is.

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible] allow raw milk [unintelligible].

A: There's only 15 states that actually have all of it outright. Most of the states where you can get it, it's not available in stores except in Connecticut and California. Otherwise, you can buy it at the farm. So, that's the only way you can get it. Buy it at the farm or have somebody who gets it from the farmer and distributes it. Now, that's what I've created all over the United States. Like we have the Rawesome Club here, we've got branches of Rawesome all over dispelled differently. This Rawesome has an E after the R-A-W-E-S-O-M-E. The other Rawesome clubs throughout the United States are R-A-W-S-O-M-E. And what I do is I contract, we lease the herds, or chickens, or flocks, whatever it is. The club leases the herd or flocks, the herds, whatever it is, for milk or meat. The co-op, the co-op, the Rawesome club leases it so that they own the herd. They own all the product. So the farmer works for us by taking care of the cows, feeding the cows, housing them, and milking, bottling the milk, and delivering it to wherever we need it to deliver it or pick it up from them. So we pay them per bottle or per pound, whatever it is, whether it's meat or eggs or dairy. We pay them per bottle for handling all that. So that is a sure-fire way. Pennsylvania was the first one with the FDA who tried to shoot that down in court. And I wrote the legal documents for it, a 67-page one and a 19-page one, because they were going into court on the same day, these two farmers. So I had my milk report attached, so that took up 53 pages of the 72 pages. And the rest was a declaration that we are not commercial. The FDA, the Health Department, has jurisdiction over commercial dairy only. This is not commercial. This is private enterprise. This club's members own the dairy. They're not buying it. So we can ship it across any state line we want. We can do anything with it. We don't have to label our milk. We don't have to label our meat. We put on the contracts. Each member has to sign a contract that says, we want bacteria like E. coli, salmonella, trichinosis. If you've signed with Rawesome Club, you've read what I wrote. So it completely takes you out of any jurisdiction that they can have. L.A. County came after Rawesome here to close them down. You know, James and everybody just freaked out because they were intimidated. So I called the health department and I said, listen, your guy trespassed. It says no trespassing except for members. Your guy trespassed. He broke the law. We will not press charges, but you're going to have to leave us alone because we are not commercial. We are private. You have jurisdiction over commerciality only. We don't want to see you again. Thank you very much. That was the end of it. They haven't bugged us in three years. So I sent them a copy of the lease agreements that we have with our farmers that show that we own the milk, and then the club members' agreement showing that we want everything out of the counties and states with federal regulation. Because you're the only allowed to have so much bacteria. We say we want all we can get.

We don't want any kind of anesthetics, no Clorox, no bleach. There's nothing near our food. We want bacteria. So with that kind of a representation. We took it to their attorneys, and they got back to me a week later and said, OK, you're right, we don't have jurisdiction, and that was that. And we took it to the court... Now I didn't even go with the farmers, because I just wrote out the documents for them pro se. So pro fer. Pro se is federal, pro fer is state or local. So they took their documents in there, and the judge said, are you sure you want to find this against you? And the health department said, no, we don't. So they just dropped it. They dropped the charges for selling milk without certification and without permits. And I said, we don't need permits. You're not selling it for the public. So all my farmers that we contract with for all the different clubs, most of that dairy comes from Michigan, Indiana, and Pennsylvania. It's supplied even to my clubs in Florida. So they have those contracts set up. Now, Sally Fallon had a good idea, but it doesn't hold up in court all the time. She has a cow share agreement. That means if a judge takes you into court and says, how much of the cow do you own? Do you own the ear? Do you own the leg? Who owns the udders? The milk belongs to the udders. See, the judge can pull crap like that. So, having a cow share program has been outlawed in several states, and it's been rejected in courts. Lease, you can lease anything. You can lease a fingernail. You can lease a person, a home, a chair, a plate. You can lease anything in our country. If they shot down one lease, all the others could tumble, so they don't touch leases. It's a sure fact wire away method of ownership. And you, the leaser, the leasee, is the owner of that property as long as the lease contract is in force.

Q: One question. They shot down the liberty dollar [unintelligible].

A: We don't have time for that. We're going to go around with questions now. Oh, some more people. Hi there. How are you doing? Also, I need somebody who can enter about 1500 names into a database, preferably FilePro. I've got the program with me. And these are the class action suits. All the people who've joined, what you'd be doing is putting their name, their address, and telephone number, and that's all. So, if anybody can do that, I would appreciate it. Also, I'm going away for several months. I'm going to Thailand, to China, Thailand again, to Finland and Estonia to do workshops and seminars in all those places, and also Singapore. So, I'm going to be gone for almost two and a half months. And we're going to have people who are going to be sending in their class action, you know, joining a class action suit, and plus donations. So, I'd like somebody to go to my post office box in Santa Monica, 5th and Arizona, once a week, once every two weeks. Pick out the mail, take the mail. If you do it every week, then you have to wait at the window. But just take the mail. You know, anything that's right to choose healthy foods, open it, and then deal with it. I have an account in Right to Choose Healthy Foods where you can just deposit it with any Washington Mutual. Anybody here that can do that? You can do that? Terrific. Okay, do you have FileMaker Pro? Okay, do you have a computer? Okay, terrific. I brought the program with me and the documents. And we'll set up a meeting before I leave. I leave December 4th and I'll give you the key. Okay, to the post office box.

Q: When are you coming back?

A: I return the third week in February. So it'll be December and January and three weeks of February.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it's okay. It's not going to go, it's not going to fall apart if you go away for three weeks. Yes.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay, so the two of you can work it out. Terrific. I really appreciate that. And, you know, if you need, you know, like $15 an hour, Right To Choose Healthy Foods, we can arrange that for you. Okay? And could you stay after and then let me get your, well, write down your names and numbers and that you're volunteering to help with that, with the mailing and the deposits of the checks to Rights To Choose Healthy Foods. Any mail that's addressed to Optimal Ways of Living, to anybody else, to me, you can just leave those unopened in a box and I'll get them when I return. Usually when I go away that long, they've got a whole box like this at the post office that I pick up on the day I return, but this way I won't have to let them back it up. Because I have to go through, I have to give them an arm and a leg, you know, and please to get them to hold it, because they only hold for 30 days. So I have to keep giving them and call them and then give them new 30-day, you know, documents showing that they need to hold the mail, but they don't like to hold it over 30 days. So that will really help out in a lot of ways. Okay? All right, we're going to go around the room, and you have a question about nutrition? Great. First. Okay? Kathy, do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, well, I want to just ask you something. If this would be appropriate to put up on my window, I brought this material here with me. It's a, sort of like a plastic, you know, when they're spraying, I seal my window. And that air doesn't go through, because I've been feeling it when they're chemically spraying our air. That that's a good thing to put up on the window. It's plastic.

A: Well, you've got a powder here that they use to keep the plastic from sealing to each other when they melt it and form it. So that powder is very toxic, probably more toxic than what they're dumping in the air. So if you're going to do that, you need to wear a mask, spread these out on the driveway out there, and then hose them down and wipe them down to get that stuff off of there.

Q: Just hose them down and then wipe them off after?

A: Yeah, and then you can tape them around your windows for that, yeah. And if you're going to do that, this is how many mills? Oh, it's 3.66 millimeters. That's very thick, you don't need anything that thick, but it's okay. They probably will tear less easily, so it's probably better to use this if you want to repeatedly use them.

Q: All I need to do is spread them out and hose them down?

A: Hose them down and wipe them dry and make sure you have all that powder off. Okay. Okay. Do you have a question?

Q: Oh, by the way, can I just make an announcement?

Q: [unintelligible] sleep apnea.

A: Pardon me?

Q: Sleep apnea, is there any nutritional way you can help that?

A: Well, if you have true sleep apnea where you can't sleep any time of the day, that's a severe protein deficiency. And sometimes a person can digest the protein but not utilize it or assimilate it because they don't have enough fat. So that can be a problem. Now, if your sleep apnea, your inability to sleep is because you can't sleep at night time, that's not sleep apnea. That means your nervous system is detoxifying and you can't sleep, usually between midnight and 5 o'clock in the morning. And if you go to sleep earlier, you'll usually wake up somewhere around 2 o'clock and you won't be able to go back to sleep until about 5.30. That's usually how it works. If you try to go to sleep at midnight, you won't be able to and you won't be able to get to sleep until like 5 o'clock in the morning. You may doze a little bit. But when the nervous system is detoxifying like that, it's like a person who's had a head injury and you can't let them go to sleep because they may not wake up, they could go into a coma. So when the nervous system is detoxifying during the night time, and that's when it detoxifies, 95-92% something like that, it detoxifies the brain and the nervous system detoxifies at night. When everything else is shut down but the heart and the lungs and neurological activity in the brain. So if you can't sleep at night, it's not really sleep apnea. It's your nervous system detoxifying. So what you have to do is sleep 5.30 in the morning until 7.00. You have to go to work, go to sleep at 8 o'clock in the evening, up by 1 or 2 o'clock in the morning. And then do something constructive between that 2, 1.30, 2 o'clock and 5.30 in the morning. If you try to sleep and you can't, you're just going to drive yourself crazy. Okay? Do you have a question? Do you have a question? Okay. Do you have a question? Okay. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes. My mom mentioned that my father has a fungal infection.

A: I couldn't hear you. How did you start that out?

Q: My father has a fungal infection he came to see about.

A: What infection?

Q: Fungal.

A: Fungal. Oh yes. Okay.

Q: So he started with the salt and so his blood pressure has gone down quite a bit so I just wanted to find out what you would suggest to me to do to increase the blood pressure.

A: To increase his blood pressure? Onions or garlic or both. It just takes a little bit.

Q: Onion and garlic?

A: Onion and garlic.

Q: Together or separately?

A: You can have them together or separately but it doesn't take a lot. In fact, having too much can create the opposite effect. It can lower it. Most people take garlic and onions to lower blood pressure when they eat a lot of them. But it raises it when you have a little in certain people. Like me, if I have garlic, even a little sliver, I will be horny for days. It just drives me crazy. It just raises my blood pressure, raises hormone levels and everything. So it depends upon the individual. And people who naturally have low blood pressure, that's the way it works. It works the opposite. It works to raise it instead of lowering it. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It depends upon the person. Start off with a sliver. What I usually do is I'll take a little garlic clove, one out of the whole bunch, and I'll peel it or purl it and then take a very thin, like a 32nd to a 16th of an inch slice out of the center. And then I'll blend that with a whole cup of butter to make garlic butter. And that is enough to get me going. So it depends upon the individual. Start off with a little amount and raise it if he needs more.

Q: And the right amount would be when he gets a little excited, so thicker...

A: Well, it depends what his blood pressure is like for him. I mean, I'm just saying, for me, it raises my blood pressure so high, it also starts the sexual thing going on. And that's just a small amount. So, I mean, it used to work when I was very ill, I could eat that much and it wouldn't do that. It would raise my blood pressure, but not cause, you know, hormones to produce or anything like that. So, he's not a well individual, so, you know, he may eat just that much to get his blood pressure up, without exceeding, you know, the other function. Disturbing them, promoting them. Okay? Alright, do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, what about [unintelligible]?

A: Well, when you have, she asked how about dental, you know, amalgams, which have a lot of mercury. They're like 25 to 30 percent mercury. And, of course, mercury is methylmercury. Even when it's solidified and crystallized into a metal form with alloys, it is still highly toxic. And it's liquid and it will leak with your body acids and get up into the nerves and go into the brain. So when you have those removed, I suggest that people be on the diet at least two and a half years before they do that. Because I've known some people, I had one fellow, I pleaded with him, he has severe chemical sensitivities. And he's getting better and better on the diet. Everybody kept telling him, oh, on the internet, oh, if you have your amalgams removed, it will change your whole life. I said, don't do it. Don't do it. Don't do it. You've only been on the diet, you know, nine, ten months. Don't do it. He did it and he's never been the same since. He can't even recover, so he's having a hard time recovering.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You know, your body starts pulling the mercury out of the nerves. So you're in a constant detoxification. And for one molecule of mercury, it takes about a thousand white blood cells to ten thousand white blood cells to harness that one molecule of mercury to keep it from doing damage. That takes a hell of a lot of nutrients.

Q: So you're saying there's no safe process, really, to remove?

A: No, you can be safe in your mouth, and you may not inhale it, but it's the nerves that are detoxing that have collected all the mercury from all the years that you've had it in your teeth. Then the nerves start detoxifying.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Most people don't have bad symptoms when they go on to a good diet.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, yes. Mercury is the worst animal toxin we have on this planet. And thimerosal is next.

Q: I did have one removed [unintelligible], felt better after about [unintelligible].

A: But that was just one, you know. Maybe if you want to have one done every six months, you might get away with it, but still you're risking it if you're in bad shape. I always suggest people wait two and a half years.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You don't want to take that risk. Yours are from pesticides, agricultural poisons. It's pretty bad. It's pretty dangerous.

Q: Would you think that I would ever be able to take that [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah, I'd say two and a half years. Okay, do you have a question over here?

Q: Yes, for like me who have fats in my body, could I eat meats and chicken without the fats?

A: Could you eat it without the fats?

Q: Without the butter and cream on a daily basis or once in a while?

A: Yeah, that would be fine if you want to lose weight. That's why I have in the recipe book the weight loss, you have meat without any kind of fat with it. Except for a little bit just so you don't dry out completely. So you eat lots of eggs and meat without much fat to pull the fats off of the body if you want to lose weight.

Q: How about a person who has fat from bad food? When they eat meat without the butter and cream, would the fat in their body [unintelligible] themselves?

A: Well, any kind of fat, good or bad, will bind with poisons. That's why even if it's bad fat, people who have bad fat are still healthier than people who are skinny. Because those fats bind with poisons. So I like people who have this weight right here because she's well protected. I like somebody who has weight like this because they're well protected. Unless they get so old with toxins and this starts breaking down their body, the fat that they maintain isn't good quality enough. If you have that much fat on this diet, you shouldn't have to worry about any kind of imposition in the system. So, I like fat. Fat is very important. And I know you're saying, well, you don't look fat Aajonus. I am. I'm 27% body fat. For a man, that is fat. It's just that raw fat molecules are very tiny. When you cook and heat fats, they swell 10 to 50 times. Got that? 50 times their normal size. So these fat molecules get huge when they're supposed to be tiny. So I'm full of fat, but you just don't see it. Because it's small. Small molecule. Okay? Do you have a question? What is your name?

Q: Danielle.

A: Danielle.

Q: Yeah.

A: Danielle or Dan-yell.

Q: I guess it's Dan-yell.

A: Okay.

Q: You pronounce it Dan-yell.

Q: You can call me Danielle.

A: Okay.

Q: [unintelligible] So the raw fat actually interests me the most. I read your book, and I read how you healed your son neurologically by eating raw fat. So my concern is I want to eat a lot of raw fat, but I don't want to gain a whole lot of weight. But I do want to kind of, because I suffer from like depression and anxiety a lot, and I don't want to take prescription pills, I don't want to become an alcoholic, which could be, it's on the brink of it sometimes. So I am interested in replenishing my growth neurologically, but not gaining a whole lot of weight.

A: Sorry, I forgot that bit. I'm getting tired of sitting, so I'm going to stand like I do in my workshops. Okay, first of all, the depression and psychological problems are all the response... If it isn't a drug, it's a response in your colon. You don't have enough E. coli. The E. coli is the last stage of digestion for breaking down the fat and protein molecules into the finest, tiny little molecules to feed the brain and the nervous system. So if you have psychological problems, it is because you have a low bacterial E. coli level in the colon. Period. That is it. Unless you're taking some kind of medication that causes alterations, a destruction of the E. coli, or the body's using the food that would normally be produced by the E. coli for the brain and nervous system, used to harness [unintelligible] chemical in the body. So it's either chemical response, but it's always an E. coli, a lack of E. coli nutrient product. Now take a look at this. We have hydrochloric acid and other acids that go in and help dissolve food matter. Then we have bacteria that go in and eat that. And its excrement, its urination, it's all the secretions are our food. That is the way the body works. We are animals. We eat shit. We eat urine of bacteria. That is our food. So the health departments and the medical professions, bacteria theory was adopted in the late 1800s to destroy mankind, to control mankind. The bacteria, if you destroy the bacteria in the body, you're going to have a weak society. A very weak society. Vaccines is one of the worst things to weaken our society. When I was a child, a very infant even, I remember the workers on my grandparents' farm throwing bales of hay, 90, 60, 90 pound bales of hay up 12 foot into the loft, even 15 foot. You see these farmers now, and these young guys, they can't even throw a 10 pound bale in there. Or a 15 pound bale. It's all forklift. We've lost a good source of health and constitution because of our antibacterial activities and to trying to get rid of disease, which is really poisonous because you know the vaccines all contain mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, and detergent. And the amount of mercury that they use, even though you'll see now preservative free, they're not mercury free. They've just changed. They used to call mercury a preservative. Now they're calling it an antibacterial antiseptic. So they've just changed the name of it, but it's still mercury. They've gone from 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury to 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury. When I did my laboratory work, it only took 3,000 molecules of mercury to make 2 cc's of fluid sterile. Why would they be using 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury and almost an equal amount of aluminum and formaldehyde in a 2 cc's of a vaccine? To hurt you, that is the only reason. 

That's the only logical sense about it. It's to hurt you. Nobody's challenging it, because all the people who work for the pharmaceutical industries are under contract, so they'll be whistleblowers. And we just don't have a whistleblower yet. We have one. One came out with, and you go to John Rappaport's site, that's called https://NoMoreFakeNews.com. I put out the email without his permission, and we wrote it a little bit, that interview with him and that man, that man from the vaccine industry. Anyway, it tells a lot about that particular activity and how vaccines are no good, and they've never proved to be good, and they're just nonsense. So, your E. coli is destroyed. How do you get the nutrients if your E. coli is damaged? High meat. High meat.

Q: Ah.

A: You let the bacteria that's in the meat naturally digest and feed it, and then it's already digested for you, and you don't have to rely upon what you don't have to do that. That's why people who have been on psychotropic drugs, like the girl and one of the guys who was on Ripley's Believe It or Not, when we ate all the high meat there, one woman had been on psychotropic drugs for 22 years, 23 years, 7 a day, and when she started eating the high meat, no more drugs, just like that.

Q: What do you mean high meat? [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: It's in the recipe book. It's like eating rotten, stinky, foul-smelling meat. Just put a nose clip. It's only scary because you're taught to be afraid of bacteria, and it's going to hurt you, and it's all falsehoods. In fact, you will get healthy.That's what the Eskimos do, because they go through a freezing time of the year, and everything is destroyed by the freezing bacteria. So in September every year, they'll eat a couple of pounds each of this stinky, high, foul meat. And the kids smell it, and they jump around like it's candy.

Q: Jumping up for joy. They obviously know how good it is. It doesn't really matter. It goes beyond the sense of [unintelligible].

Q: Does it replenish E. Coli or just [unintelligible]?

A: No, it's all pre-digested. So you're eating it already digested. So all those nutrients go immediately to your brain and nervous system. That's why you get giddy and happy within 10-20 minutes after eating it. Please don't talk, whoever it is, because other people can't hear. And I can't think, because I'm always wanting to hear. I like to listen a lot. I like to learn a lot. So if somebody's talking, I'm trying to give out information. I want to listen at the same time. I can listen to many conversations at the same time, but I cannot talk and listen to a conversation at the same time easily. Okay, you were asking?

Q: I just want to know if it actually replenishes the colony of E. coli.

A: It depends. It doesn't really. It could help. It depends on what poisons are dumping into the colon. Those are the ones that destroy the E. coli. If you're taking medication, you've had a vaccine, of course your intestinal environment, your E. coli is going to be destroyed for quite a while. Why do you think a lot of children go into depression for a year after a vaccine, after a round of vaccine? They get more irritable. Look at the kids nowadays in their teens. They're getting, like in New Jersey, 128 vaccines by the age of 15 and a half. In California, it was 98, 102 now. By the time you're 15 and a half, if you don't sign that waiver on the back. And you wonder why these kids are depressed and anxiety, and they're never satisfied. They don't want you satisfied. They want you consuming, consuming, consuming. Food doesn't have any nutrition in it, if it is processed. You're always going to be hungry and eating and eating and eating. Unless you're anorexic, then you can't. Because you're so nauseous from all the poisons, you can't eat. But most people are overeating, constantly. I know people who eat tons of food and can't gain an ounce of weight. Every day. And Jeff Slay was that way. So he's on the diet 5 months, you look at them, the picture's on the website, wewanttolive.com. And you can see the difference between somebody who ate good raw nutrition and then processed nutrition. Whole different thing entirely. So the E. coli is very important. Now, my E. coli was destroyed from chemo and radiation therapies. I was depressed as a child from all the medication. So it was just continuous. I was suicidal from the time I was 6 or 8 years old, that I can remember. So until I started eating enough meat. Well, when I started eating kefir and yogurts, raw kefir and yogurts, that started alleviating my severe depression and suicidal tendencies. Of course, after chemotherapy, I was even homicidal. I wanted to track down Reagan and kill him. Any excuse to kill somebody, that's the kind of angst that I had inside. And then after the poison mushrooms, it was Reagan and Bush.

[laughter]

A: All this high anxiety and having my E. coli destroyed. So, you can replenish the brain and nervous system by eating high meat. I had one fellow who was chemically sensitive, who hated people. So antisocial, he was homicidal. [unintelligible]. He was on medication. And he became a landscape artist, so he didn't have to deal with people. And he was on and off the diet, after he heard about the diet. He was on and off the diet for a year and a half. Of course, when you're having those psychological problems, and you're eating good food, and it's not feeding your brain the nervous system, it's not going to help your brain the nervous system. So he was on and off the diet. So I finally convinced him to eat the high meat. It changed his life. He now eats one to two pounds of the high meat a day. He won't eat any fresh meat. He's a bear of a guy. He is now the funniest, congenial person that I've ever met. And this is a person who hated people. The last time I went there to do a workshop and seminar, he had three, ten girlfriends. How do you get one girlfriend into a situation where you know she's a girlfriend, both of them are girlfriends in the same room. He had three of them. All supporting. Because he is so funny and so charming and such a great guy. And that's what he does. He eats only high meats because that's what he needs. Now maybe in another ten or fifteen years, his colon will cleanse to the point where he can grow and breathe and support the E.coli in his intestines, but that isn't the way it is right now. Some people only need ping pong ball sized amounts a whole week, and that takes care of it. Other people need to eat a lot.

Q: You mentioned raw kefir and yogurt, or in yogurt?

A: No, raw kefir and yogurt. Those are pre-digested, proteins. So in the human body, at least those are broken down way in advance of going into your system. So your bacteria in your intestines can break that down and feed on that bacteria. And then when it gets to the colon, E. coli can do it easily and take care of you, even if you don't have good colonies of it. It's already so reduced that when they get a hold of it, it can produce it pretty easily. But still, the meat has protein concentrations like tryptophan that are not high in milk. They're high in meats. And tryptophan is good for relaxing, for sleeping, for things like that. So that is still not quite the value that high meat can give you. But it can still take care of a lot of psychological problems.

Q: And anything [unintelligible] instantaneous?

A: Within 10 to 20 minutes. I've only had one person that didn't react within 10 to 20 minutes. He wasn't that depressed anyway. 

Q: And that's how you have to experiment. Individually, like on how much you need.

A: Right, and how much is proper for your system. Now if I were to do a consult with you, and I can see your colon, I can tell you the likelihood of how much you would need, and how long it would take your intestines to be clean enough to foster and nurture the E. coli on your own. 

Q: That was actually another part of my question. When you do your individual consultations, do you conduct different tests, like blood work?

A: No, I do iridology, and then I check the glandular activity, and the blood and everything on the hand. Similar to the Chinese method, but I developed my own because I didn't agree. The Chinese method was built on the Ayurvedic system, which is prejudiced toward yin and yang, hot and cold. It's too narrow of an arena to be able to distinguish what I need to distinguish.

Q: Because you mentioned looking at the colon, how would you do that?

A: It's in the iris.

Q: Oh, it's in the iris.

A: Yep, all through the iris. Where'd that envelope go?

[unintelligible]

A: Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay, yes.

Q: [unintelligible] because the high protein [unintelligible]. 

A: Okay, let's just take a look at this test. This is going to show you how ridiculous tests are. You have to understand that the pharmaceutical industry has made sure that they have created tests that convince you to take drugs, to take medical therapy. Now, if you've got a high ketone level in your blood, they automatically say you've got a kidney problem. 90% of the people who have high ketones don't have a kidney problem. But they want you to think you have a kidney problem, so you start taking medication and treating for a kidney problem. And guess what? The medication for the kidney problem usually will create a kidney problem. So you say, yeah, they were right. I've got a kidney problem. So you have to be very careful. I don't accept not one of their tests, not one of them, because look what they're doing. They're taking a shot of your blood, a photograph of your blood, for one moment in your life. And they're basing all of this stuff about your health on a blood test. Oh, well, it's got to be this chemistry and this balance. Everybody is so different. Let me finish. So, all of these tests are ridiculous. I'm talking about blood test chemical analysis. You go to the colonoscopy and you go up there and see cancer, what do they want to do? Surgeries, chemo, radiation. This doesn't nurture the body. This destroys the body more. It'll make you sicker in the long run. According to Hardin B. Jones, who was head of medical physics and physiology at Berkeley for I don't know how many years, headed the oncology department, oncological department there. And he testified before the California Senate and Congress that his research, his follow-up on people who had cancer and therapies, the people who were diagnosed with cancer, refused therapy at Berkeley, lived an average of twelve and a half years. The people who were treated lived an average of three years. That tells you right there that they're telling you will help to extend your life. 

Q: But I had to do that in the hospital because I had to go to a operation and cut my ligament here.

A: Uh-huh.

Q: So I had to do something [unintelligible].

A: You cut your ligament? What makes you think it wasn't going to grow back?

Q: They sew them together.

A: Why do they have to sew them back?

Q: Because of my chest.

A: Yeah, but it would grow back. If you were on this diet, it would grow back. I ripped the tendons from here. You know, I got a rope of them here and here. Just last March 5th. I ripped this one down here and this one up here. What was it? No, this one down here and this one up here.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh yeah, completely ripped them. Ripped them off the bone. And they were bubbled up here and here. And within a week, they had grown back and attached. I still had a slight bit of pain there. And I split the tibia in two. And they said, I would never walk again. I'd never be able to stand again unless I had surgery. [unintelligible], and I didn't have any surgery. The leg doesn't stretch all the way completely yet. Straightened, but it's still. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you have surgery, what do they do? They put chemicals in there, and then they put an antiseptic that's either methylate or mercurochrome. Both of those are liquid mercury, or iodine, which is a highly antibacterial, just like mercury is, only it's radioactive if you get an x-ray. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They always coat you with something, with an antiseptic. Always coat you inside and outside. And it's usually, if they're using methylate or mercurochrome, either one, or even the iodine, it will look yellow, kind of an orangish yellow. If you took your bandage off, you would have seen it. They do it on the inside. So it may be ten years before you heal. This one will heal in a year, completely. And this was a split tibia. I split the tibia in two in a motorcycle accident. I ripped this and this. I ripped the tendons off of this ankle, and shaved this whole bone down on the pavement. And then shaved all this bone down on the pavement. You don't see any scarring there. All the skin was gone. 

Q: What did you do?

A: Well, what I did first was I put lime juice on it. Because lime juice is an antiseptic. It will coat any particle that's entered the body. And coat it so your body doesn't have to use white blood cells to surround it so you don't have a mass infection. Then I put coconut cream over that. Everything stings. And then honey over that. And then the areas where I lost more than just skin, when I had muscle and bone removed, I put thin slices of meat over that. And then I took little pieces of plastic and then put that over so the meat wouldn't dry out and then wrapped it in an ACE bandage. And that was all over the leg and all over this arm, all the way back to here. Because I had taken all the skin off. And I healed all of the skin in two weeks. Just this little bit of scarring here. And here I have this little bit of scar here, this dark color. That's all that I had left of it. A few little discolorations here.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: But you know, you just stay on the diet, it will heal eventually.

Q: [unintelligible] high meat?

A: Well, high meat isn't necessarily appropriate, that's for the brain and nervous system. You know, meat is good, red meat, and fish together would be good to heal that a little quicker. And you could put lime juice and coconut cream on the outside to try to draw those poisons out.

Q: No operation?

A: I'm saying no operations. If I went to the hospital because I thought I was in so much pain that I thought that I was, that my knee was dislocated because I had a lump here and a lump here, so the whole knee looked like it was like this. But after the x-rays it just showed that was in place, it just, these tendons here had ripped. And they were bubbled up like that.

Q: Were they cut?

A: They were ripped off, completely ripped off.

Q: So did they grow together back or...

A: They grew, this one grew this way and reattached. No, it was the other way, it was lumped here because the pain is still here where it was ripped. So it was ripped from here, completely ripped from here, and bubbled up here, bunched up here. So in a week it grew all the way back, right back to where it was supposed to attach and reattach.

Q: You stayed off the [unintelligible]?

A: I stayed off of them for six weeks. Very little, to go to the toilet, to get in a wheelchair, for six and a half weeks. I did go into the ocean twice a day, in the morning and evening, to walk. I did walk in the ocean where my body was lighter. I walked about a mile each day, you know, in the ocean. No, two miles each day in the ocean, almost every day.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I did it for a few days. I got them to turn the chlorine level down on the pool in the hotel I was staying at. The accident happened in Jomtien, Thailand. So I was stuck in a hotel for six and a half weeks. But I got sick. I started getting ear infections and toothaches from the chlorine, even though they had reduced it for me in the pool. So I stood that five days, and that was it. I couldn't stand it anymore. The hotel was about this far from the ocean, so that's all I had to do was walk out there to the ocean with my crutches to the sand, and then I went into the ocean. Exercise. Okay, do you have a question?

Q: So I'm still experiencing kind of like fogginess of mind, and it comes and goes, and it always accompanies a feeling of nausea and what feels like blood sugar drops. And then that is accompanied with psychological things like, I don't know, irritability or anxiety or whatnot. And they kind of come and go in waves, and since I started the diet, I mean dramatic improvement. But it's still, it's kind of plateaued, and it comes in waves every three weeks or so.

A: Well, just remember, whenever you get nauseous, you're dumping poisons from the stomach walls and the esophagus into the stomach. You get nauseous from that. That's an indication to eat cheese. I don't care if it's just a little sugar cube-sized amount, which is about half of a teaspoon of cheese. That may be all it takes, but if it's dumping every few minutes, just keep dumping, you may have to eat a sugar cube-sized amount of cheese every 10 to 20 minutes until the nausea is relieved. 

Q: So that was one thing I wanted to ask him, because I'm not gaining anything. I'm not really losing weight, but I'm trying to just, you know, put on some fat and what not. But it could vary, and I think there's such a [unintelligible]. I just get so bloated, and even cheese, too much cheese and yogurt, and bloated again.

A: Bloated's good. Bloated's good. Look at children, babies, they're all puffed out in the stomach, because they have to digest a lot of food at one time, and then provide it to stretch it out to the rest of the body to grow. If you want to gain weight, that's when you have to get a big stomach, and you have to let that bloating go on for a while.

Q: What about rampant diarrhea [unintelligible]?

A: Well then you shouldn't be drinking it cold. Are you drinking it cold?

Q: No no no.

A: Then you better make kefir. I have that once in a while, I can't drink any fresh milk. I have to let it get thick, into kefir. But that's rare anymore.

Q: Can you mention that for weight gain purposes, they sometimes do an egg fast?

A: No, not weight gain, that's weight loss.

Q: I thought you meant [unintelligible].

A: I have some people eat only eggs because they don't digest. So when you eat an egg, an egg is the easiest food in the world to digest. It takes 23 minutes to digest an egg. Only 3 inches of your small intestine is utilized to digest and absorb that egg. That means your body gets all this intensely small, pre-digested or easily digested liquid, fat and protein. It goes right in the system to heal, cleanse and heal the body. So if you've got a bad digestive tract, you eat lots and lots of eggs. Not enough to lose weight, so you have to eat 25, 50 a day. So you don't lose weight for somebody your size. I'd eat up to 50 a day. But if I eat, let's say, only eggs all day long, 25 and I won't lose weight. If I eat 22, I'll still lose a little weight. So I just have to find my level when I'm just doing an all-egg. And when I do an all-egg diet, it's because something is dumping into my intestines, poisoning the bacterial environment in there, so they are not digesting food particles anymore. So I need to eat things that don't require much bacteria. And that's the egg. The egg is the only one. It takes milk a minimum of six hours to digest, and that's if it's kefir. If it is whole milk, unkefir, or yogurized, yogurtized, then you're looking at 19-20 hours to digest. Even 24 hours to digest.

Q: So your recommendation would be to just continue the raw diet and it'll gradually improve it?

A: Yes.

Q: Is that high meat, is that good for anybody?

A: If you're depressed because you're getting nauseous, because those poisons are getting in and poisoning your digestive tract, you don't need the high meat to take care of you. You need the cheese to absorb the poisons and deal with your bloating.

Q: So bloating will go away? Like, it won't be there all day long, will it?

A: Yeah, usually it's there all day long. It usually takes somewhere around, depending upon how severe somebody's digestive system is. I've had people deal with the bloating for about, if they've never had a child, they can get over it maybe a year, year and a half. They don't have to experience regular, constant bloating. If they've had a child, then it could last three years. If they've had a cesarean, it could last six years, bloating. Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, I've been eating [unintelligible] pancreas and it helped my digestion for a while [unintelligible] start having digestion problems again? What should I do so I don't have to eat that all the time?

A: Well, you know, the pancreas does have a lot of hormones to pull out nutrients out of your body. It doesn't necessarily mean that the pancreas is providing you some nutrients to do that. It's just providing you with its own hormones that it uses to attract and recombine enzymes for enzymatic activity for us. So when you take in an enzyme of a food, your body has to realign it. It has to fractionate it and then have to realign it for the cellular structure of the human body. The pancreas is responsible for that. Mainly responsible for that. And if you're eating cooked foods, the pancreas is responsible to form hormones that leach it from the rest of the body to provide it. And of course that just spends your bank account. If you have that reaction, you know, it's best to just eat a small amount and wean yourself off of the pancreas. If you don't want to eat the pancreas all the time, then eat more honey. More honey with your meat meals. Honey with butter. Because right now your body's not having to work so hard because it's got all the enzymes already. The enzyme fractionation and recombining nutrients. So your body doesn't have to do anything with it. If you wean yourself off, your body's going to start building its own ability to do it. If your pancreas were healthy, it wouldn't be doing that. You wouldn't be taking a cessation, a vacation. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes. Anything to help with generating bone? I've had your bone growth formula from the potluck earlier.

A: Anybody know what the bone growth hormone stimulator is?

Q: No.

A: It's pineapple, like I say in the book, to help heal and regenerate bones. Pineapple helps, I don't know if you've ever seen under a microscope, bones have like a web system that grows out and then it fills in. And pineapple for some reason stimulates this. I had pineapple every day. I had a cup of it every day when I broke this leg. Because I split that tibia in two and it was separated in the back. And they wanted to go ahead and push it back together and pin it. Plus the tibia, the top of the tibia looks like this, and the top and the bottom of the femur sits on it like this. I broke off the top of the tibia and it jammed up in the femur. They said that there's no way that the body can dissolve that and get rid of it, that they'd have to go in surgically, cut me from here to here, open up the leg and do all the surgery. And I said, shit, if I do that, it's going to take me five, seven years to heal just from your surgery. You know, I can eat pineapple. He thought this guy was crazy, you know. And I was walking and I said, listen, if I can't walk in six weeks, I'll be back for your services. I was walking without crutches in six and a half weeks. So it works. So pineapple, cheese and honey together, any of those things. Pineapple, I mean butter, [unintelligible], cheese and honey together in the mouth digests all the minerals and the fats and proteins in the cheese. Cheese when it's raw will not digest. The body will always use it in every lab test I've done with any kind of animal, given them raw cheese, it passes out the feces with toxins attached to it. Which is good. That's what we want. If you're eating cooked cheese, pasteurized cheese, it's all fractionated anyway, so it just attaches to poisons and stays in your body, instead of coming out. Now to get the cheese to digest, I racked my brain and it was very easy. Honey is a digestive enzyme, mainly digestive enzymes, because when the bee collects the nectar, the bee swallows the nectar. Predigestive, it creates insulin-like substances which convert the sugars, the carbohydrates, into enzyme structures to digest, mainly protein and fats. So when you're eating honey that's unheated above 93 degrees, that's not heated above 93 degrees, it has all of those insulin-like substances available for digesting whatever food you're mixing with it. If you lack good digestive enzymes, bacteria, or the acids in your stomach, honey will help any kind of digestion. So when you have the honey and the ice-dried honey, eating it after the cheese, before the cheese, and still it comes out in the feces. When you mix the cheese together in your mouth, or mix it together, mash it together, or make it into a cheesecake fill, where the honey is directly mixed into the cheese, it digests. That's where you get your mineral supplement. That's where you get your highest calcium, magnesium, phosphorus, potassium. All of that to strengthen and take care of the bones. If you're taking a mineral supplement that is clay or anything else, that is rock. You are not a plant. Plants eat rock. We are not plants. We don't spend our lives in a pot, in the dirt, absorbing minerals, because it takes a phenomenal amount of energy to eat rock, and to make it into a bioactive form like the plants do. We are mobile individuals. We need everything already in a stage that can make us react instantly, and that's mainly meats and dairy and eggs. That's our main diet. If we're too alkaline, like the gorillas, we'll chew a few leaves, spit out the pulp, and there they have some green juice. So, pancreas, more honey. And cut down on it. Do you have a question, Jim?

Q: Yeah. If gout comes from inability to process uric acid, and uric acid comes from, I guess, poorly digested protein, is animal protein any different than vegetable protein? Or should there be both there, or does it matter?

A: Well, if you have vegetable protein, you're only going to have vegetable fats accompanying it. You're also going to have a high amount of alkalinity. Not something that the body utilizes properly. So it'll take you twice as long to heal with that kind of mixture. And also, vegetable oils in the human body. Remember, herbivores, animals that eat vegetation, have a body temperature of 101 to 105 degrees all the time. If they go into a fever, it can get up to 107 degrees. 108, sometimes 110. Ours can go up to 106.8. That's the highest I've ever seen. And on this diet, no brain damage. Even if it goes that high. Just eat some tomatoes and the vitamin A and all of that, the acids in it will bring the temperature down anyway. It's not that you want it. But if people start panicking, that's what I suggest in the book. If they panic from fever. So, the herbivore has a very high body temperature. So it handles the vegetable oils very well. Keeps them fluid. At the human body, normal temperature is 98.6 and lower. Vegetable oils, if we use vegetable oils in our cells to structure the cell, it will have a tendency to crystallize. Crystallize. That's what causes hardening of the arteries and heart. Not animal fat. Again, they want to confuse you. Take a look at the tribes who only eat cooked meat. And almost no vegetables. If you want some vegetables once in a while, eat a little bit of fruit. Like in Borneo, New Guinea. These are 90% cooked meat eaters. They have no arteriosclerosis. They have no heart disease.

Q: They eat raw meat?

A: No, they eat cooked meat. They still won't have it. That's what I'm saying. Raw fats, meat fats, do not cause arteriosclerosis or a heart disease. Yet, our medical profession and the pharmaceutical industry are conditioning you every day. There are talks about drugs. There are talks about food. Talks about advertising the food. Oh, this will lower your cholesterol level. This will keep you from heart disease. And they're selling margarine and vegetable oils. Which do just that, create heart disease. When people mainly ate animal fats before pressed oils came into fashion, how many heart attacks were there a year? How many people died of heart attacks? One in 500,000. Now what is it? One in three. So we can't listen to them because they're just lying to us. So your vegetable oils are the problem. So you've got gout, it just means you've got a lot of toxic proteins in your body. From having been thin a long time. When you're thin, you've got no fats to arrest the poisons. They go intercellularly and damage your cells. A great example I like to use is, I go usually once every year and a half to Asheville, North Carolina. A bunch of hippies there. 

Q: Earth David.

A: Everybody there was a hippie, from way back. Sixty, seventy year old hippies. All the way out to young newborn hippies. They were all vegetarian. One of the guys there was so sick and skinny, I mean really he looked like a raccoon. He had dark circles, black, all around him. And it went up above his eyebrows and all the way down to the bottom of his cheeks. And gray skin. So he started doing the diet in the closet. All around these vegetarians. And he started blossoming and getting healthy and everybody was saying, what are you doing? Can't tell you. Can't tell you. So finally after a year, everybody started getting upset because they saw his transformation in a year. And he said, OK, if I tell you, you have to promise me that you cannot take any kind of action against me and you cannot kick me out of here. And they agreed. But they still tried to kick him out. But then 80% of them, within a year, were on the diet. They were raising pigs, chickens, goats and cows, milking and everything. So when I went there to visit again, it was a huge transformation. All of a sudden, the third year there, this guy comes in and he looked like he came right out of a motorcycle gang. Drug abuse and everything. His skin was thick and hardened, like he had abused drugs and alcohol for 25-30 years. So I had a consultation with him and looking at his irises, I said, this is just not possible. Are you from this planet? Because his insides were so clean and his skin showed me that he had abused himself terribly with drugs. And he admitted 30 years of drug and cocaine and alcohol addiction and abuse. And I said, well, it doesn't make any sense. You're maybe 25 pounds overweight. He said, before I went on your diet four months ago, I was 300 pounds. Even bad fat will protect you from toxins. Of course it's going to make you sluggish, there's going to be a lot of problems, functioning, breathing and stuff like that. But at least your cells are protected. The poisons won't go intracellularly and damage the RNA and DNA of your cells. And make you diseased. Kill cells.

Q: Is that why people that are heavier don't wrinkle as much?

A: Exactly. The fats are holding the poisons and not going out through the skin. 

Q: To some extent my friend is obese. He is this big or bigger and always checks out his heart. Everything's fine.

A: But the medical profession tells you now overweight is terrible. Now they're going about the children. Why? They want to make the children even sicker. They're going against fat children. The best thing we can have is fat children. With the garbage that's in the food. They get rid of fat children, what are we going to have? We're going to have the same thing we have with killer monkeys. The skinny killer monkeys that go on all this carbohydrate. They eat the fermented fruits and what do they do? They go on a killing spree for 24 to 48 hours and kill everything in their sight. Snakes, other monkeys, tigers, moles, rats, birds, they kill anything that they see. And they hunt and they move fast. Because they've got all that sugar and alcohol in their systems and they're rapid and fast. And they will slaughter thousands of animals in 24 hours.

Q: Can you elaborate on what?

A: These are killer monkeys in the jungles of Africa. They feed on sugar, fermented fruit, very fermented fruit, like figs.

Q: They're called killer monkeys?

A: Killer monkeys, yeah. There's another technical name for them.

Q: Well, is that what gorillas, monkeys or gorillas, primates eat? Fruits and plantations?

A: Gorillas eat meat.

Q: Gorillas eat meat?

A: Yeah, gorillas will eat 20, 14 to 20 pounds of meat every 28 days. It has, at one time, it will kill an antelope and they eat it within a day or two. See, nobody hangs around with them. To know that, but John Goodall did. He did a film called The Beginning and he got an Academy Award for it in 71 or 72. So I shared an editing room with him while he was editing his film I was editing another film. And he told me that. Because he lived with the apes, you know, for about 8 months.

Q: But it's not a...

A: They don't do it every day. No. Nobody advertises this stuff. And the gorillas, man, they're laid back. They roll around and pick each other. They have a good life. They have a good life. Roll around with each other, play with each other, and groom each other. And eat green bananas. They don't eat any ripe fruit. They eat green... Have you ever tried eating a green banana? They eat the rind with it, the peel on it. It's like alum. Can't get enough enzymes. But they have all this digestive juice and fluid which digests their grain. There's no high sugar in it. Lots of enzymes though.

Q: Yeah I read in your book that you mentioned that eating unripened pineapple and banana... It didn't sound very appetizing.

A: Once you make the change, it may be a big difference. You'll have less depression, less everything.

Q: Is it less fermented?

A: Well it ferments in the body, but the high sugar causes stickiness in the brain and nervous system fluid.

Q: So when it's unripe, there's less...

A: Sugar. Less fermentation.

Q: Can I ask a question? Did you go around already?

A: No, I'm going this way.

Q: Well, you don't get [unintelligible].

A: I just want to thank our hosts. Thank you very much.

[applause]

A: Okay.

Q: So that was my question.

A: The gout?

Q: Meat is okay.

A: As long as it's raw. The tribes who do eat cooked meat have gout. They have a little arthritis and rheumatism and some bone loss from eating all that cooked meat.

Q: How about if I substitute for a meat meal like a yogurt or some pre-fermented milk?

A: That's fine. Sometimes when I'm having some bone problems, because I had cancer of blood and bone, multiple myeloma, sometimes I don't eat meat for three or four days. And I'll eat dairy, dairy, dairy, dairy. Lots of eggs and dairy. And then, you know, I give my body a break with the meat. But that's mainly people who have had bone problems. Most people don't need to abstain from meat unless they have a bone problem or a gout problem. That's fine.

Q: Okay. Okay.

A: You're welcome. Roger, you have a question?

Q: Yeah, can you eat yogurt and meat together?

A: Absolutely. Anytime you eat a dairy that's pre-digested, you're going to get a lot more from it, no matter what you eat it with. Whatever you eat with it, it's fine. 

Q: You can eat it with fruit or...

A: You can eat it with fruit, fish, fowl, anything. Dairy will go with anything. Even vegetable juice, but it kind of is a little contradictory there. Because when I give somebody vegetable juice, I don't mean it to be utilized with the milk. I want it to take care of the blood. So if you mix those together, it'll do something different. It won't create a bad situation, but it won't do what I want to do, which is alkalinize the blood. Okay? Do you have a question?

Q: Okay, yeah. Yes. Regarding the diet you put on people who are sick from colds and flus, that daily regimen, does that preclude eating anything else on a regular routine?

A: No. In the recipe book, on page 146, I have the regime that I suggest for people who have colds and flus. And that's mainly milkshakes and one smoothie a day. A smoothie is a milkshake with fruit in it. That's what a smoothie is. So I suggest an orange, maybe a little banana, if you've got soreness throughout the body, and the muscles or wherever, the high potassium in the banana will help remove that. And on a slow process, because banana is one of the hardest foods to digest, longest fruits to digest. So that is a good slow time release one. As long as it's not too ripe, or as long as it's not really ripe at all. It should be half yellow, half green at the most, ripeness. So, you can, if you feel fine, eat meat, eat anything you want. That's just for people who are really overwhelmed with the cold or flu. Just remember, a lot of people say, well, I don't want to eat the dairy, it creates mucus. What the hell do you think the cold and a flu are? It's a detoxification through your mucus membranes. You have diarrhea involved in it. The mucus binds with those poisons that are coming through those mucus membranes. It holds on to the poisons and you want good mucus. You want lots of it to hold this poison. Because if it doesn't, what it's going to do, it's going to create more vomit and more diarrhea. So, you want the mucus to bind with it. So, you want the dairy. You have to have the dairy. Now, the difference between cooked dairy, pasteurized dairy, and raw dairy is that if you drink pasteurized dairy, a lot of the mucus that you form is to get rid of the toxicity from the pasteurized dairy. When your body makes the mucus from raw dairy, it does not create mucus to get rid of the poisons in itself because there aren't any. So all that mucus will be used just on the poisons that are already in your body to remove it from the system. Yes?

Q: Why do colds appear to be contagious?

A: Why do what?

Q: Why do colds appear to be contagious if they aren't?

A: Because it's seasonal. Okay, why does the sun rise when the rooster crows? Rooster crowing makes the sun rise.

Q: Why do like 1,000 people get the cold?

A: Not all of them get it. Why don't all of them get it? In every household, if everybody got it, you could say there's a good probability of contagion. But it isn't. The bacteria that you find in one individual is very different from another. It could be the same strain. And just whenever you hear, oh, we fingerprinted the bacteria. Big frickin' deal. All fingerprinting does is tell you the strain, particular strain of E. coli, listeria, or salmonella. It does not tell you anything about, yeah, the bacteria that's in you is the exact same one that's in the food you ate. Absolutely bunko. So fingerprinting a bacteria is not like our fingerprints, which are individual to the person. My fingerprints are on a crime scene, I was most likely there. Or I have been there at that location at some time. And I may be a suspect. But did I do it? Don't know. In bacteria, in the fingerprinting of bacteria, all you know is strain. That's like knowing a race. Okay, an Irish person was at the scene of the crime. So, okay, we blame all Irish people for the crime. And that's what happens when they go, when the health department and the pharmaceutical and medical industry attack a bacteria and say it's contagious. Not contagious. Everybody has bacteria in their body. Everybody is cleaning. Most families eat the same things, the same garbage. So, of course, they're collecting the same kind of poisons relatively uniformly together. So what happens? They detox together. The whole planet detoxes together. That's why we have a flu season. And get it, flu season. Not flu epidemic or pandemic. You know, they're advertising we're going to have the Avian Flu epidemic soon, right? Plastered all over the news. Well, this Avian Flu vaccine that they created, that virus was active 18 months ago. It's not active now. Flus, I mean the viruses, flus are mainly viral detoxification. Colds are mainly bacterial detoxification, which can involve a little bit of virus. And colds are mainly bacterial, but they involve a little bit of virus. So, you don't have a contagion involved in that. Viruses are not alive. You've got no nucleus, you've got no respiratory system, you've got no digestive system. They are protein structures that either disassemble or reassemble. And during a flu, you have specific viruses which will disassemble certain kinds of tissue. So, let's say you are going to clean out your respiratory system and the cell itself is cleaning out its respiratory system. The viruses, you could have 300,000 viruses just for the inside of all the various tissues within one cell. If the body had all those viruses working at one time, the whole cell would dissolve, your whole body would dissolve, and you would be dead. And that's what the pharmaceutical industry wants you to believe. So, they show you a little picture of one virus working to dissolve a certain tissue and they say, oh, it will spread and go all over and it will destroy your whole body. No, those viruses are specific to that particular tissue. It will only disassemble that tissue. That is it. And then they say it's contagious. How can, is Tide soap contagious?

Q: And they say fever is to kill the virus.

A: Yes. That's what they say. Well, they say it's to kill, but that's what I mean. Thirty years ago, doctors understood that virus was not contagious. That's why they didn't use antibiotics with the virus. Pharmaceutical industry says, hey, we can make a lot of money just saying that they're alive and contagious. So now they're giving antibiotics for viral infection. It's the most absurd thing in the world. Going on their premise, even. Yes.

Q: So would you say that it's a lie that people, say, a hundred years ago would catch a cold and die? Is that not true?

A: No. You have to understand, people froze to death all the time. Or died of heat stroke. You know how many people would be dead if we didn't have air conditioning and heat the way we have it? The bubonic plague, the black plague. You know what that was from? England was making their first kill on a big product besides salt and tea from China. Coal. They sold coal. People were burning coal in their homes. Cooking with it. Heating their homes. Do you know what's in coal? Mercury vapors. 110 years of that and what happens to all generations? You've got three generations full of mercury in their lungs. Finally it breaks down. It takes three generations for a whole civilization to disintegrate, according to Pottenger's work and Howell's work. So here you had all this lung disintegration. It didn't happen to the people who lived on farms. They were still burning wood. They didn't get the bubonic plague or the black plague. It was only in their cities where all this coal was being burned.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Pardon?

Q: No involvement [unintelligible]?

A: That's again, they weren't afraid of anything in nature. They want you to be afraid of nature.

Q: That's my question. And the purpose of eating chicken as part of the sick formula regime.

A: Well, that's because usually the body is trying to heal itself. And it needs some extra proteins. Usually the proteins in the eggs are enough. Because you're having lots of milkshakes in the smoothie. Two to three milkshakes a day and one smoothie. That's a lot of eggs. There should be enough protein. However, if the body needs to restructure a cell and start healing quicker, you need meat to do that. The body does not produce growth hormones with egg protein for some reason. Okay? Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, you told me to do eggs two days a week. Can I drink anything with those eggs or eat any fruit?

A: If you do, you're not going to go on your weight loss. It's not going to cause weight loss. Remember, eggs eaten with other foods causes weight gain. Eggs eaten alone causes weight loss.

Q: Okay, the reason I ask is because, and I've even put the coconut cream on my lips, but I get so incredibly thirsty, not so bad now, but in the summer, that finally when I drank the milk with cream and honey, I would drink that, and then I would polish two quarts of milk after that because I just had to drink something. 

A: You're drinking it too fast. You have to sip it. And if you get thirsty like that, just take a tablespoon of milk at a time. Every hour if you want to do that.

Q: Really? Okay.

A: A tablespoon of milk at a time.

Q: And what about, can I do vegetable juices throughout the day too?

A: Yes, you can do vegetable juices when you're doing eggs.

Q: Lots of it? If I get really thirsty?

A: Well, I would say no more than a quart a day.

Q: Okay.

A: It might demineralize the body.

Q: But not eating fruit?

A: Never fruit.

Q: Like tomatoes? Not even tomatoes?

A: Tomatoes, yeah.

Q: Cucumber...

A: Tomatoes are okay.

Q: I can do those.

A: Absolutely. Tomatoes, fine. You can eat cucumber, fine, peeled. That's fine when you're doing an egg day. You can make in the recipe book, or I've forgotten now. It's either in We Want to Live or the recipe book. It's that athlete's mixture, hydrolyzer of cucumber, about two cups of cucumber, one cup of tomato juice, a little bit of lemon juice, lots of honey, a little cream, a little coconut cream, and mix, blend that all together. And you can sip on that.

Q: Okay.

A: But just leave out some of that cream, don't put as much in.

Q: Now, was the purpose of the eggs to lose weight, or was it to...

A: Purpose of the eggs is to burn the fat off, the excess fat, so you put new fat on the body.

Q: Because I thought it was because of my weak digestive wall.

A: That too.

Q: Oh, okay. Because it helps.

A: Yeah. Well, your intestines weren't healing like I wanted them to do. So I thought if we take off the weight and you put on good fats, your body's going to be able to clean the intestines faster.

Q: Oh, okay. All right.

A: Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah, I think you kind of answered it, but I don't get involved in the water as far as washing myself, and I do a lot of work out in the dirt and stuff like that. The ocean? Can I bathe in the ocean? I'm looking at drying out the skin, because I run into that when I'm in like, you know...

A: Well, you're going to dry out the skin any time you get in water.

Q: Any water at all?

A: Any water, and of course salt water is going to be more drying.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: Because, you know, salt dries things out.

Q: Right. But I'm just curious, you know, as far as I guess the chemicals...

A: Well, you know, that water's pretty sticky, so I'm not sure that you'll get very clean. You know, you'll not feel clean. It will clean you.

Q: Right.

A: Because that salt will break down the fat on your tissue, you know, on your skin and help, you know, open a layer up so that you can get, you know, so that more nutrients can flow to the skin. And that's okay. I mean, I've done it when I've lived near an ocean and didn't have a lake to go into. But, you know, people on this diet don't need to take baths every day. I take a bath... When it's not winter and it's not cold, I take a bath once every five days. When it's winter and I'm cold, I get into my hot tub every day. But I never use soaps. I use coconut, fermented coconut cream. My old coconut cream's for my bathing.

Q: Do you have well water out there?

A: Yeah, I have well water out there. So I don't have to put the milk and all that stuff in there. I still put coconut cream on my body and then go in. Coconut cream in there. And every, you know, after a few months of using it, because I go away for some time so it doesn't, you know, [unintelligible]. But after I do that and have enough coconut gum in there with enough coconut cream, all of a sudden it comes out. When I backwash it, it'll start spraying out this clay. Because I use a sand filter, so it breaks the coconut cream down into a clay. And it feeds my algae. You know, it keeps the clay, I mean, the sand filter keeps the water crystal clear, but allows algae to grow. And that algae is nice and soft. In there. I don't want to destroy the algae. And then when the clay comes out, the clay made from the coconut cream, it helps feed the algae. It's a very strong algae.

Q: What's the benefit of the algae to the body or do you just like how they feel?

A: Oh, on the outside it helps give nutrients and pull metals out of the body. Algae eats rock. It feeds on rock. It eats metals. That's why people take algae as a supplement. But dry, it's not going to do you much good. So you soak it for a while and then have it with maybe a quarter to a half a teaspoon a day with some vegetable juice. If you have a cancerous condition, you get a teaspoon a day. But break it up into two, half and half. Do you have a question?

Q: I do, I had two questions. What is a great detoxifier for the lungs?

A: Well, one of the best detoxes for anything is coconut cream. Any fruit along with that... Tomatoes and coconut cream are a good combination to clean lungs. Ice cream is wonderful for cleaning the lungs, especially if it has lime or lemon in it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Eating raw ice cream, raw milk, raw milk and raw cream, ice cream with raw egg in it. Especially with lime, lime and lemon, lemon-lime combination. There's a lot of people who have lung problems, and as soon as they eat the lemon-lime or lime-lemon or just straight lime ice cream, usually within 10-20 minutes they're coughing and choking, because it's already moving it out of the system, already moving it out of the lungs.

Q: My other question is, could you share why colonics are so bad for the intestinal system?

A: You weren't here at the beginning when I talked about E. coli?

Q: Oh yes, I was here.

A: OK, it washes out... Colonics, enemas, wash out your E. coli. So what don't you have? Brain and nervous system food. Take a look at all the people who live on colonics and enemas. They have a lot of psychological problems. They're very needy and very, very dependent people. And they just keep flushing it out. And look at what happens. But after the enema and the colonic, they feel really good. Why? Because they flush the E. coli of some of the food that they've digested directly into the bloodstream. Hundreds of millions of bacterias and particles they flushed into their systems. But they prevented their bodies from utilizing E. coli. They destroyed the E. coli colonies for sometimes 45, 60 days. It takes that long to build it up. And there are some people who have enemas every day. And they are going to get psychologically worse and worse and worse and more dependent, codependent, codependent, more and more codependent. And let's hope you're not at the other end of that codependency because you'll never satisfy it. Do you have questions?

Q: No, I never thought...

A: You just like listening. Steve, do you have a question?

Q: I was just wondering if there's a way that you can counteract the effects of...

A: Steve comes up from San Diego to do this.

[applause]

Q: Just to counteract the effects of like chemical sensitivity to like colognes and stuff like that and laundry detergent. You know, working with people like that and you're just inhaling it all the time.

A: Gotta have a lot of fat in the body.

Q: What did he say?

A: Gotta have a lot of fat in the body. He's talking about people who have allergies to colognes and perfumes. How to desensitize yourself to that.

Q: What do you do?

A: Lots of fat. You're fine.

[laughter]

Q: I mean, I've heard of the thing you wear on your neck. I mean, I don't know if it's separate or something like that.

A: Yeah, that's not really... Well, what it can do is some of those pendants that you can wear that say clean the air. What they do is they generate ions. California, we all know about too many protons. Goes a long time without reading and everybody gets crazy. You have more road rage. Everything increases substantially, psychologically. People are... Buttons are pushed very easily. Very sensitive at those times. And then when it rains, the body brings all these ions there. It balances the intensity of protons. So what happens? People feel better. So those things are ionic generators. However, the problem with that is that when you send out these new ions, guess what happens? The protons start bombarding anything. So they're going to go into your lungs, into your respiratory system, into your mucous membranes, and bombard and cause proton toxicity. So it's going to imbalance your own electrical system. So that's not the way to do it. You know, especially right up against your face and over your chest. Sure, it will work, but the end result is not, longevity-wise, proper. I tell people, they say, well, you know, I'm in a very toxic area. Should I use an ionizer in my house? Sure, use an ionizer in your house, but you put it in a room that you're not in. Night, you put it in the living room or the dining room, and let it take care of those rooms. And you close your bedroom door, and you put a towel down at the bottom. Okay? And then during the day, you know, half an hour before you're, you know, going to get up and move around, you way... Set your alarm, go out there, turn it off, hold your breath, keep your eyes squinted, turn it off. And then go back, and most of the protons will already be bombarded into your rug and walls and everything. So it's not likely to harm you, but just in case. Go there, turn it off, go back to bed for 30 minutes, and then get up. Take it to the bedroom, close the bedroom after you, you know, you're dressed and everything, and let it, do it in the bedroom. Or, if you want to do it the perfectly natural way, get three plants per room, and they'll take care of it for you. And on the website, wewant2live.com, I wrote a newsletter about three newsletters back. I put in there about the plants that are most effective in pulling toxins out of your home. Either building materials and toxicity that's airborne, so those plants can help you maintain a very healthy environment.

Q: [unintelligible] air filter.

A: Like I say, they're the least, I mean, they are an option, and they will help, but they're not the best.

Q: What about ionic [unintelligible].

A: What did I just talk about? Ionics. Ionics. That's a problem. Your HEPA filter is okay, they're just going to run the air that's present in the system through a filter and help pull out the toxins and poisons that are larger particles. But the protons, it's not going to pull out the protons out of the air. You need plants or an ionizer to do that. Do you want to come and sit?

Q: You've got five minutes.

A: Okay. I need to go around here. Do you have a question?

Q: I'll be quick. When I first started doing your diet, I used to eat a pound of meat a day or more. And I'd eat the meat and I would feel my stomach wrap around it. It was good. In an hour and a half I could eat another meal. It would digest really solid.

A: You were so hungry then.

Q: I know.

A: Now you're not so hungry.

Q: I know.

A: But he's happier.

Q: Well, now when I eat meat, it'll just sit there for like four hours and I can feel it kind of... It won't go down and digest as well, like any meat. And even like with milk and cheese and stuff, it's not...

A: What did I just say? You have a problem like that, you eat eggs all day long for days until it stops. Until you're rebalanced.

Q: Okay.

A: Remember, eggs only take 23 minutes to digest.

Q: Okay.

A: So you get to utilize all those proteins and fats to heal and cleanse the body. So you don't have to worry about digestion.

Q: Okay. Because it's weird because it's like I'll crave meat and I'm like I need to eat meat and then I do it...

A: Well, just eat a little at a time.

Q: Okay.

A: Eat like a half a cup with some butter or cheese and then maybe twice a day, once a day and the rest of it do dairy. I mean do eggs and just a little bit of dairy.

Q: And in general, I'm not really craving any food, like I don't really enjoy the food as much anymore.

A: Again, you're not digesting right now. You must be dumping some toxins in and out of the pancreas and your intestines.

Q: Okay. Thank you.

A: It's a cycle. I've gone one time and I wrote in my book that I went 16 months doing that, eating eggs and dairy only. Because I couldn't eat the meat, I couldn't digest the meat. It caused bloating and problem. One time I couldn't eat anything but chicken for six months. And I talked about that in the book. You have to go with what your body needs. If you have a digestive problem, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs, eggs. Because it doesn't take much to digest them. Your body can spend its energy and those nutrients on cleansing and healing. Do you have a question?

Q: Yeah. My husband doesn't have really muscles. And...

Q: [unintelligible] over the years.

Q: Yeah. And that I noticed with his father, that he was very athletic when he was young. And it surprised me that he didn't have. Because I look at usually and you can compare with, you know, the same roots.

A: Well he stopped digesting his proteins, digesting his fats. Lots of eggs. Eggs, eggs, eggs.

Q: You said that you eat the eggs with a meal to gain weight, right?

A: Yeah. But sometimes when you can't digest, you have to just eat a lot of eggs by themselves. Like I say, for me, maybe 22 eggs a day, I lose weight. By 24 a day, I don't lose weight. But I force my body to heal and to cleanse and heal rapidly and only focus on that. So then I can go back to eating meat and I can digest it. So when you have a situation like that, he needs to eat as much eggs so he doesn't lose weight, maybe even gains a little bit if he eats enough of them, till he can digest properly, his meats properly.

Q: Do you just eat the eggs and nothing else?

A: Well, he might still want, you know, usually when you're having eggs, you're going to get very dry. The body starts using a tremendous amount of H2O with it. So, you may need to just sip on, you know, like a tablespoon of milk every 20 minutes, just to keep hydrated. And coconut cream on the lips, a little bit of honey with some coconut cream on the lips and on the tongue, just to keep moisturized. And remember, it's not mainly the H2O that causes dry mouth. The poisons leave the brain at the gums, the tongue, and the salivary glands. Just pulls all the fats in the face. That's why all people who eat cooked foods get wrinkled in the face before they wrinkle anywhere else. Because all the fats are being pulled out of the face to bind with all the metals that are in the brain. Remember, the brain is 60% fat, and where do the mainly toxins store? In the fat. And if they're thin people, they only have two places to store it, the brain and the bone marrow. So when that poison is dumped out, it rips all the fat out of the face, so people get dry mouth. You need to put the coconut cream with honey on those lips, because the coconut cream will absorb quicker into the tissue more than anything else. Okay? Alright, let's see. Do you have a question?

Q: When you gave me the diet, you said in any of the foods that you told me to eat, I could eat more of one if I wanted to. But specifically on the moisturizing, the lubricating formula, if you like it with more coconut cream and you add more, should you keep it the way that it is?

A: You do not want to add more coconut cream than I suggest. Because then you're going to detox more, you're going to go into diarrhea, and you're going to have a lot of other problems. Coconut cream is mainly for cleansing the body. Any kind of fruit or vegetable oil is cleansing. 90% cleansing. So, no. You can add other fats. You can add dairy cream to it. You can add more eggs. More honey? Fine. Just not more coconut cream. I always push everybody's limits with the coconut cream. I always push everybody's limits with the coconut cream, so please don't add more than I suggested. That's the one thing I ask you not to change. You can add less, but not more. 

Q: What about washing?

A: Washing, you can wash as much as often as you like. That doesn't bother me. When I'm in Thailand, it costs $8 an hour for a massage. And it costs me 80 cents a quart or a liter for coconut cream. So I go, instead of sleeping a normal five hours, like they do, four to five hours, four and a half to five hours, four hours to five hours. Sometimes I'll only sleep three and a half hours. But I'll go take my naps during my massages. So I will have coconut cream massaged into me for sometimes four hours a day while I sleep. 

Q: Is the coconut cream organic in Thailand?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Have you been going around?

A: No, I'm going around to, well I've got two more here. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes.

A: Okay.

Q: Okay, the green drink. What changed?

A: What changed?

Q: It was changed for me.

A: Yes.

Q: It was cucumbers, celery, carrots, cilantro, parsley. And it's my heart palpitations.

A: Okay. Whenever you have heart palpitations or pounding hearts after a vegetable juice you have to whip an egg into it.

Q: Whip an egg?

A: What's happening is the enzymes that you're getting in the vegetable juice, and I put her a little cilantro in it. It's pulling out heavy metals. The heart does not want to allow those heavy metals to lock into the tissue, heart or any other gland, so it sends the blood more racing through the body, so the blood passes through the intestinal tracts more often, and that poison will hopefully dump into the intestinal tract and not the heart, brain, or one of the glands.

Q: What do you mean whip? Do you just stir it?

A: Just whip it. Stir it.

Q: With a [unintelligible]?

A: No, don't blend it. Just whip it right before you drink it.

Q: With a spoon?

A: With a spoon or a fork.

Q: Okay, but do you actually add the cream to it?

A: Well, if the cream is not doing it, it's the protein you're missing and so you have to add the egg.

Q: So do you get the three together?

A: No, don't put the three. If you're using cream, you stop using the cream and you use the egg. Egg has plenty of fat, so you don't need the cream.

Q: Okay. Eggs and I, we don't have a real [unintelligible].

A: I know. But you have to get acclimated to it. If you need to, you know, have you ever broken an egg for making a cake?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay. Well use half of it. Let's get one of those little one-ounce jars at the Rawesome Club.

Q: Yeah. Yeah, I have those.

A: Okay. Just take out half of the egg white and half of the egg yolk and put it in one of those one or two-ounce jars and save it for the next time.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay. And use half of it in that vegetable juice. You should be able to be okay.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah. Okay. And then half an egg each time. Okay. But I'd like you to work up to an egg at a time.

Q: Well, I'd love to do it. I'd love to do an all-egg regime.

A: Yeah, good [unintelligible]. If you could.

Q: With the heat, you know, the hotness.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay. Do you have a question? 

Q: Just general heart restimulation, generation, circulation, buildup, what food formulas, just in general, like for just...

A: Well, if you want to really build the heart, you get heart. You eat heart. Chicken heart, buffalo heart. And you get heart every week, you know, at the Rawesome. And that's the best thing for the heart. Any kind of red meat is good for the heart, especially with tomatoes. Red meat and tomatoes is good. Sometimes the peel isn't as good, so you might want to peel the tomato, because it can interfere with digestion in a lot of people, especially over the age of 40, 45. So if you're having tomato with meat, it would be best not to eat the peel on the tomato while you're eating the meat. Okay, so, let's see, you didn't give me a question, or did you? Yes, you did. You didn't give me a question.

Q: Well, now I have. I notice that, like, I'm eating more raw burger and meat, and whenever I do, I feel like, I have soreness right here. And you said you examine the hands, and so I was wondering, what does that mean for the left hand right here?

A: It means you have some kind of toxin stored in that joint down there. In this joint, this one or this one?

Q: No, it's right here.

A: Okay. You've got to come in from this joint. It goes out here, leaks out, and tries to eliminate some [unintelligible] things. And it causes pain in the muscles.

Q: Okay. But it has nothing to do with any organ, right?

A: Usually penicillin or tetracycline, some kind of antibiotic, lives in the bone marrow.

Q: I have to ask you, I saw you have a recipe for like a chocolate [unintelligible]. How much, you said that you can have as much as you want.

A: I didn't say you can have as much as you want.

Q: Or as much as you crave or something. I can't remember what it is.

A: I said I have probably two tablespoons over a ten day period, maybe five times a year.

Q: [unintelligible] make the chocolate shavings?

A: Yeah, it will. But usually, like I said in the article, usually it's the butter and the honey that you need, not the chocolate. The butter and honey your body's craving. Okay, anybody else didn't get a question?

Q: Wait a minute.

A: We're almost finished. Anybody else have a question that didn't get one? Okay.

Q: I just want to make an announcement.

A: Okay, I've also got another announcement. I'm leaving town December 4th, and I'm not coming back... I come from Estonia, from Finland and Estonia, the third weekend in February. So I'll be gone a very long time, so there won't be any potluck unless you guys want to present one. Just add a potluck in [unintelligible], and that would be a good idea if you did it.

Q: What is that?

A: You know, so if somebody here wants to organize a potluck, you just need a place and let me know, and I will issue the email to my list so everybody knows. Otherwise, it'll be March.

Q: March.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I only have a few left. I think I have two left. [unintelligible] call in the morning.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's $300. That's about an hour and ten minutes. If you want a consultation, you have to go to the website and find out what I require for health history and download the request for advice and fill that out, and then bring it with you to the consult. Oh, wait a minute. So I guess this is the last time I'll see you, unless I see you at Rawesome, at our food co-op, and have a great holiday season.

Q: Thank you.

[applause]

A: Kathy has an announcement, I don't know what about.

Q: Yes, quickly, I just wanted to know around here if anybody, excuse me, I talked to the producer in Alaska, he went out already hunting for seal, and if there's anybody on the list that has not been on the check, questioning to me, need a seal or buffalo glands or organic, I get it from Nebraska, we can get it as well.

A: So anybody who wants specialty meats, they can get in touch with Kathy.

Q: I want to give you my phone number, because I need to have it this week. I want to give you my email and phone number. My email address is Kathy, K-A-T-H-Y, Ann, A-N-N, Ornstein, O-R-N-S, T as in Thomas, E-I-N, at ca.rr.com, and my phone number is 310, anybody have a pencil or pen, 657, I'll repeat it twice, 5174, again it's 310, 657, 5174. So this way I'll know, if you want to be on the list of the glands, and also the man I talked to, he already went out for the seal, we have to get it this week, and hopefully next week.

A: And that seal's incredible meat.

Q: [unintelligible], Alaska, this is near Russia. So I have to know from the list from you, because we need to have amounts of money. Cause this cost, last time $600, the whole thing with shipping.

A: What it amounted to was about $37.50 a pound. That's a lot to pay for meat, let me tell you, that seal is a specialty. One quarter of a cup is worth a whole cup of any other kind of meat. So you don't have to eat much of it, it's extremely concentrated. And the fat is phenomenal. I bought 10 pounds last year. So I spent $400, because I gave her some 40 extra dollars. So I bought most of it. And I let some of it sit in a jar. And to see... Because like you do in a snake, you let the oil ferment as it sits. So I let it sit in the refrigerator. The oil that I got from that half of a cup of meat filled the entire cup. So it reproduced itself. It reproduced itself. So seal is phenomenal stuff.

Q: Anybody that didn't hear me, I'll repeat again my e-mail address. Kathy Ann Ornstein.

Q: Why don't you write it?

A: If you're going to do this again, you come out with little cards. You pass them around. That way people will have it.

Q: I didn't think about it. Did everybody get it?

Q: We got it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's just high meat at that point. That's black meat. Hello? The seal is black meat. It tastes like cooked sirloin. It is a real treat. It tastes like cooked sirloin.

Q: You're not really feeling that you're eating something very unusual, but it is unusual.

A: It is very unusual. Yes.

Q: Can I have a piece of paper? I didn't think about this.

Q: I have two announcements. One, if you guys get a chance to go to the We Want to Live website run by Jim, check out the blog. On there is my Amish diaries of where I lived with the Amish family for 30 days.

A: And that's where you found out about this diet, right?

Q: And that's where I found out about this diet. All the Amish products you get at Rawesome, I hooked up Rawesome with Amos in Pennsylvania and talked about what it's like to transition to a raw food diet as well as, or the primal diet specifically, as well as what it's like to live with an Amish family. It's really fascinating and Jim did a great job setting it up as a blog. So you can actually, you save the blog and you can save the diary. So, you know, it's really cool.

Second thing, you guys make sure to please take all your food in all your containers when you go. Or, if it's not yours, take it anyway.

[laughter]

Q: That'll really help. Thank you all for coming.

Q: Thank you.
