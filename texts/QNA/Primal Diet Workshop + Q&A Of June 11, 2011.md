A: ...famous consumer advocate and I was on a radio show with her and got introduced to the whole thing so I started investigating involved with her and Dr. Eleanor McBean, who was an MD in San Diego, who was saying it's a hoax, the swine flu, nobody gets swine flu, only pigs get swine flu, and that was my first introduction into that phase of pharmaceuticals. You know, I knew that they had certainly messed me up and violated my health for all those years, but I didn't know that they could plan such a scheme. So I brought all the information up, I brought up her book on the show and the whole show became about the hoax of the swine flu and that only pigs can get swine flu, even if you work with pigs, you can get their dander and you will still get a human flu to get rid of the swine tissue, it still would not be a swine flu. And also the fact is that virus change forms every 72 hours, so if they make a swine flu vaccine it was good for 18 months, it takes them 18 months to produce and market a vaccine so it's already obsolete. So I had all this information and I got death threats for like five weeks before I left the country and went abroad. And a lot of other people picked it up, a famous rap group in England picked it up, saw the show, so this rap group, and you can still go online and listen to it, just say no to the vaccine. And it goes on about the genocide, even that they used this type of campaign against people in Auschwitz and the concentration camps. In this film they put about a million dollars into it and did it in two weeks. And they got my name, I mean my voice coming through it, "the only way you can get the swine flu vaccine is to get the swine flu vaccine". So they had my voice throughout dispersed through the information. So I went away in March. In March I went to Asia and I was in the Philippines at the time in a hotel room and I woke up in the middle of the night. It was a small town, Tacloban, and it was the nicest hotel there and it was a pretty good hotel. So I woke and there were all these windows on one side that led to a courtyard. And so there were lights of light coming in, but it was backlit. I woke with these two guys on either side of me that were pretty brawny looking, but they were Caucasian. The light was behind so I couldn't make out a lot of detail. And I was sitting halfway up when I came conscious and a hypodermic was hanging out of my arm. There were two on the bed next to me and they were shocked that I woke, I guess. And the cloth was falling off my face, one grabbed it and pushed me back down. I was out in a second, second and a half. And I've had ether quite a few times in my life, so it took 12 seconds for me to go under, but this was a second, second and a half and I was out.

So I woke the next morning thinking it was a bad dream until I moved. And I was aching everywhere, my skin was burning. I had three huge bumps there that turned into scar tissue. And then within 24 hours I had big pustulations coming out like tumors, scars, open wounds that were pussing and pussing. Not necessarily blood, but they were pussing fluid, mostly yellow crusty fluid that was grayish in tint. So, you know, there was no evidence there. I looked around the hotel room, there were no hypodermics, there was nothing left. So calling the police would have been ridiculous, so I didn't. I got very sick, very nauseous. I kept falling to the right when I would walk. And I had diabetes, you know, for years from shooting up insulin. And get out of the chair, I'd get dizzy and I'd have to sit right back down or get on my knees. When I did this, even during this kind of an episode, I'd get completely dizzy and just pass out on the ground. So this was going on for days and days. And I realized that I had to get a lot of ammonia in my body and pull some of these chemicals out of the system. So the only foods that I knew that were high in that were old shark or stingray. So I went to a village at the end of Leyte. I couldn't drive anymore. I had to get a driver to drive me. So I was looking for a way in to buy a farm. So I wasn't, you know, my life was going as it was, so I had to deal with the way I was and the condition I was. But it wasn't going to stop me from doing what I was doing. So I went down to this wharf and I found a stingray. And it was probably a day old and they said, you don't want to buy this? And I said, yes I do, that's exactly what I want. It stinks and it reeks of ammonia. So I chopped it up, I tried to eat it. Stingray is very tough, like eel. So I had to get a knife, a big cleaver knife and a board and just chop, chop, chop, chop, chop it. And then eat it. And it started helping, of course, if you eat a lot of ammonia like that, you can get sick and die. Because it can cause your red blood cells to not pass oxygen or anything. Like when the kidneys make ammonia to prevent the red and white blood cells from leaving with the urine. That's what the kidneys do. They filter out fluid out of your body so you can thicken your blood or dump what you may need to dump. If you're detoxing from your urine or your blood stream. So, if you eat a lot of ammonia, you can stop your red blood cells and white blood cells from functioning. So, I just had to deal with that every day. I had huge sores, huge sores. You see this? Stuff was just coming out all over and I had them all over the body.

And they were just coming out. It went on for four months and finally it stopped and I felt okay. I said, well, I'm going to probably make it. And then the anniversary in April, when it happened, I think it was April 2nd, detoxed that year. This year, same thing, April came along, detoxed again, had these sores. I mean, it looks like I had shrapnel. You see these big scars, white scars. And these things were five times that large. All over my back, all over my legs and feet. So, it broke this time. I was losing my hair, everything went gray. And then just four weeks ago, after the detox, almost finished, it's not even finished yet. I still have one sore yet. And it grows into a tumor and I soak it in hot water with coconut cream and a little sea salt and some milk. And I'll let it soak for five hours and that tumor will actually dissolve. But I have to do it like every three or four days to keep the tumor from coming and going. Anyway, my hair started growing, you know, about three weeks ago, three and a half weeks ago. All the gray is almost gone again in a matter of just moments when the toxins got out of the system. So I still don't know how much, you know, I have to go. I know they shot me with three injections and two in the hands. Whatever they did, what they shot me with here, you can see it's, you know, got a hardness. And when I went through security, my hands bust. So they put some kind of chip or something in my hands. So if you buck the system, you know, you can be in a lot of trouble.

Q: Do you know what the injection did to you? Do you know what it was?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do you know what it was with the injection?

A: I imagine it was swine flu vaccine and they wanted to say, see, he got swine flu. He said, you can't get it, you know, but I happened to wake. And I put everything in a file and sent it to a lot of different people to open it if something happened to me. So about that incident in that hotel room.

Q: Did you take the chips out of your hands?

A: I tried to cut them out, but they injected into the tendon. And it's a fluid chip as far as I understand.

Q: I think they can be removed.

A: No, they'd have to actually remove the tendon. I tried cutting it out. You can feel it. Feel it, there, in the tendon.

Q: I had to get one removed from my dog. They didn't want to do it.

A: But they didn't put it in the dog... They don't put it in the tendon. They don't normally put it in tendons. And I've got one on each hand in the tendon. You have to cut the tendon out. That means I wouldn't have use of these fingers.

Q: Have you used the chip readers and seen what it says?

A: No. I have to go to a vet and find it.

Q: Yeah, you need to just go to a pet clinic. Put them to a dog pound and they'll read your chip.

A: But he got a regular chip like this, right?

Q: Yeah, but the chip readers can read them.

A: No, but this is a fluid chip. The new fluid chip.

Q: They must have a reader. It would be interesting to know what they did to you.

A: Yeah, the NSA, whatever it was. Anyway, they made 225 million vaccines. They only sold 6 million over the planet. Only 6 million took it. So, we really shot their business. They have it in storage. That's why they didn't like me. As soon as I got back into town again in June, I started doing radio shows about swine flu. Because then the vaccine was out. It came out in June of 2009. So, I kept speaking out against it. They were going to stop me as long as I'm alive anyway. Or as long as I can talk. Alive and talk. Okay, so we're going to get into... I was buying time for more people to come. So, welcome everyone. I see some faces I've seen before. Hello. Good to see you again. How many people have been to my workshops before? Two, four, six, seven. Okay, that's good. Then we have a lot of newcomers. That's great. Okay, my name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz. I got into health as a matter of default. I grew up in a very violent household. I had a brother who was 18 months older than I and very jealous that I took Mom's attention away when I came home from the hospital and he was still in diapers. So, he would push me on rakes and anything that was rusty, nails. And my mother was a nurse and, of course, she'd rush me to a doctor. She had only seen one case of supposed lockjaw in her whole nursing career, but the boy died because he couldn't eat. They even put a tube in his mouth and for some reason he couldn't eat even that. I don't know if it was really a story that she heard at the hospital or if it was a real thing because I'd never seen a case of lockjaw. The pictures and everything that I'd seen about them didn't reflect lockjaw the way they described it. So I think like rabies, lockjaws were really non-existent things to sell vaccines. And malaria is another one. Now malaria is a filaria, which is a tiny worm that comes from human blood cells. It doesn't come from a mosquito. The mosquito gets it from us. We don't give it to the mosquito. And your red blood cells have to be very damaged to have these minute, I mean infinitesimal, microscopic parasites, worms that are janitors basically. They clean up the red blood cells so that they don't have to die. Of course, if the red blood cell is completely degenerated, then of course the filaria will completely consume that red blood cell. But if you look at the filaria of malaria under a microscope, you can fit 100,000 on the end of a pinhead. 100,000. That means that five white blood cells could consume them in an instant. So the idea that we get malaria is absurd. From mosquitoes. Can't happen. Scientifically cannot happen.

So you have to understand that a lot of this information out there is geared to get you to take medication. That medication will make you sicker to take other medication and medication after medication. And that's who runs the medical industry, is the pharmaceutical industry. Merck's, all the manuals that tell doctors how to treat disease are written by the pharmaceuticals. Merck's is this thick. And do you think it's geared toward cures? Taking one medicine and if you've got a side effect for that medication, take a medication, medication, medication, medication. My parents, my mother died in February and was taking 83 medications, 83 pills a day, 23 different medications. My father died a year ago at 93 and he was taking about 76 medications, pills daily and about 30 medications. You don't get well when you take medications. And that's just the sad part of it. So my mother would take me to the hospital. I had three tetanus shots by the time I was 18 months old and it gave me autism. The idea that mercury, which is a neurotoxin, does not cause autism is the dumbest, stupidest thing to accept in the world. You've got the deadliest neurotoxin and if you go on to Alberta University and you Google for neurons, thimerosal or mercury and YouTube or video, you'll come up with a video which shows neurons growing. They put a 2% solution of thimerosal in there, which is what is in vaccines. And that's about 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury. And you see those neurons just start disintegrating and disappearing. It's like that. And this is an actual live video. It was done on neurons that they were growing in a petri dish.

Q: What was the site again?

A: Well, you put Google in or Yahoo, Alberta University Mercury Neurons and you'll come up with that video. I've downloaded it, so I keep it. I'm sure it's still available, Alberta Canada University. So, I haven't looked at it in probably 7 years, but I don't think they got rid of it. So, it made me autistic. It cut off that part of my brain that deals with education. So, it's like that part of my brain went blind. It's like you can't get a blind person to see if that part of their body is malfunctioned or disturbed in some way. So, it was impossible for me to understand that hieroglyphs, designs on a paper, meant something. And that added together, they could come up with phrases and sentences and ideas. My brain just didn't work that way. So, I was always getting beat up because I parroted what I heard at home. And in my home, it was, you're an idiot, shut up, sit down, leave me alone. All the negative things you say to people. So, of course, when I was out with the other kids, I would repeat phrases like that and always get beat up. So, that went into school. I always get beat up every year many, many times because I would say, oh, shut up. And people weren't taking that funny because I didn't know them. And I didn't know it was really a bad thing. So, by the time I was eight years old, I had got enough of sound bites. And everything to me was a sound pattern. So, I would repeat sound patterns that I had heard. And I got a few of them down. I kind of understood the nature of some of those sounds and phrases. And I was getting by okay, but still getting beat up a lot. So, then I started picking the biggest kid in school. It was the first day of the school year. And I would sucker punch them and beat them to a pulp until they didn't move. And people thought I was crazy and then left me alone. No matter what I said. And that's why I was surviving. And you see people fighting and wrestlers and stuff like that. These people could put each other out in a second. Elbow to the throat and the person is gone. They're not going to move for 30-45 seconds. And the number of times that you can hit somebody in 30-45 seconds. They're not going to move. Again, so that's what I would do. I would sucker punch them in the throat. And then just beat them until they didn't move. And so that saved me. I got through my daily life even though I was autistic. And I always picked the smartest. I wouldn't say most intelligent, but always the smartest and kindest girl in the class to sit next to. And copied her hieroglyphs. Because that was always what it was for me. By the time I hit high school, I could copy somebody's paper almost identical.

So it looked like this one person wrote my paper that I was sitting next to. So I was getting in a lot of trouble. And I was always accused of cheating in math. Because like the Rain Man, I didn't have to write out the formula, I just wrote the answer. And that was the idiot savant thing that I had. So they could give me a complex problem, just write the answer and that was it. It was always right. They couldn't find me in a room to test me. And I'd write down the answers. They'd say, how did you do that? How did you get those answers? So then eventually they made up their own problems right before they took them into the room with me and gave them to me. And when I'd get them all right, they thought I was a genius then. But still couldn't communicate. They'd call me to read in front of the room and there's no way I could. I'd just stand there dumbfounded. And they thought I was a wise guy. Just a guy who was very intelligent, that looked down on everybody. Because I couldn't communicate properly. It was trying. I wasn't allowed to look autistic. If you look at autistic children, I just had an autistic child brought to me the other day. And the autistic child just goes off. And it's a dream state where it readjusts the emotional system. Because an autistic child is always under stress because everybody is trying to change them. Trying to make them better. And that child feels that I certainly did. So I go into that state and my father would hit me on the back of the head or my mother would hit me on my back. So I was never allowed to stare off or act unless I were in my room and away. But they usually put me with one of my brothers and my brothers would do the same thing. So I wasn't allowed to do that. So what I did was I found that they watched movies and TV. And Paul Newman and Elvis Presley and James Dean were the big ones of those days. So I emulated taking stances and postures like them so I'd be cool. And people would accept me or leave me alone or just let me be around them without having to interact. So I became a pretty good actor with that kind of behavior but still could not read. I could not put the word the together and tell you anything about what a the was. No comprehension. So this continued all through school. When I hit 12 years old I got a case of peritonitis that was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. And the peritonitis was a bleeding and ulcerated intestine.

It was swelling and going back and forth in gas and I was excruciating much more than somebody with appendicitis. So they were giving me injections like every two to three hours and within four days of it... Well first they went in and when I got to the hospital they took out my appendix and there was nothing wrong with the appendix. And in the medical report, the surgical report, it said his appendix was in fine shape and we took it out in case it would cause problems in the future. That's the way the medical profession thinks. I've been saying for ages, because when I did laboratory analysis of appendices, I found that it was like a library. Every foreign substance that had ever been in the body and it seemed to be a library to say, okay, when we get this element, here's what we do. And usually a person who has appendix, if they've been introduced to a toxin before, whether it's a chemical or let's say a poison mushroom or an insect bite, the body will respond if it's happened to them previously within 20-40 minutes. People who don't have an appendix may take 42 hours for their body to start reacting to that chemical poison. It has to reevaluate it. So appendix is a very important organ, gland, whatever you want to call it, to have in the body. So they robbed me of that for no reason, because they didn't know what it was for back then. It was only three years ago that a doctor came out and said, my studies of the pancreas show that the pancreas is a storage area of every toxin that's ever been in the body and basically what to do about it. It took them 30 years to come up with that when I was saying that 30 years ago. But now it's being confirmed. But nobody's taking off on that research, because what will they find in that pancreas? They'll find that every medical toxin that ever went in the body, and especially vaccines. Vaccines cause 70% of all of the diseases in the civilized world. 70%. And you have to take a look at those chemicals in any vaccine. They have five major ingredients that are always used. Liquid thimerosal, liquid aluminum, formaldehyde, detergents, and ether. All of them are serious poisons on their own. And that soup? Even worse. And we give our babies born one day. Soon as they're born, within an hour, they're getting a hepatitis B vaccine with all this stuff. Plus they have from 39 to 58 other ingredients. All toxic. Every one of them is toxic on their own.

So you've got a soup of anywhere from 50 to 63 toxins in a vaccine. And then you look at the number of, and nobody discusses it or talks about it, how many diseased cells or particles do they have in a vaccine? Let's say there are 100,000. How infinitesimally small is that? You can fit it onto a pinhead. How is that going to create immunity? It's the most ridiculous and absurd thing I've ever heard. When I studied at the Sorbonne Institute in Paris between 1993 and 1996 with a translator, I don't read or, I read French okay, don't speak it well, but there were a lot of terms that I didn't understand, so I had somebody help translate it. In all of Pasteur's stuff, not one animal survived vaccines, not one. They were putting massive amounts of diseased tissue in there, not just the pinhead work. And when that much disease got into the blood, what happened was the body thought it was dying. It was a signal that that is a death situation. So the body would go into anaphylactic shock and die. Not one animal that Pasteur ever injected lived. Then Rockefeller and Carnegie decided they wanted to get into the business. They thought it was still a good idea. Pasteur couldn't prove it and couldn't make it work, but they thought that they would. So what they found out was everyone was dying. Every animal died, no matter what they did. Then when they found that they put formaldehyde in, less died, but still a lot. So they started mixing a little brew of different chemicals and saying, okay, the body is in such shock from all of this, it's dealing with the chemicals and not dealing with anything else. Also, it prevented normal detoxifications like flus and colds from coming about, because flus and colds are cleansings of the body. You dump mucus, you dump poisons in the mucus. If you have your mucus tested when you have a cold or a flu, you will find that there's not only bacteria or virus in it, you'll find all of these foreign chemicals, industrial chemicals, that do not belong in the body, and that's what's leaving in the chemicals. The bacteria is helping you do it, or the virus or the fungus or the parasite is helping that occur. So, the idea that vaccines prevent anything is absolutely absurd. There's no science to prove it. And they say, well, we cured polio. Well, what happened in polio? They started making the vaccine for polio. It came out in 1958. What was the incidence of polio that year, before it came out? It had dropped to less than 1%. So, then the vaccine came out and said, oh, see, we did that. And it had nothing to do with it.

Every time a vaccine comes out, it always comes out after the disease is gone. And we have to understand that diseases are cyclical. And if they are detoxifications of the body, as I understand them, you're always going to have them as long as you're polluting your body, in any way. Whether you're doing it dietarily, or you're doing it chemically with medication, or you're doing it breathing and inhaling in the environment, or touching chemicals and absorbing into the body, you're going to degenerate animal tissue, human animal tissue, that has to be broken down and discarded. Now, if you've got big cells and you've got little tiny pores, how does that cell leave the body? How does it get from, let's say, the tissue inside from a muscle cell or a venous cell? How does that get broken down to be discarded from the body? It has to be dissolved by something. Bacteria are the main product or process of doing it, microbes that do it. Parasites do it faster and with less symptoms. And then we have the fungus that's a little bit more dry and causes more itching. Of course, women and men know with crotch fungus, it's very uncomfortable in there. Fungus love cold, yet it gets very hot in the crotch and then that causes them to sweat a lot. Fungus, so they throw off a lot more of their toxins before they're neutralized. And then that causes more itching and dryness in the tissue. But it's still a process of detoxification. So we are always going to go through detoxification as long as we're polluting our bodies. So we're always going to have a disease. And the medical profession loves to come up with a new name. Because that means a new drug. New name, new drug. Look at this Lyme disease. What a fiasco. That is the most obvious idiot thing I've ever heard. They've got five tests to look for something they're not looking for because they don't know what they're looking for. But if you come positive on five of these tests, you have Lyme disease. But what is the Lyme disease? Oh, now they say they're these spirochetes. Well, spirochetes occur in many situations, not just in so-called Lyme disease. It's garbage. It's nonsense. Absolute nonsense. But they're making them new, and they've made a new disease, and they're making money on it. A lot of money. And a lot of your alternative therapists are running away with the same stuff. Because their therapies don't work. So they have to have something to blame. What I like on this diet, there's nobody to blame because everybody gets well.

Not everybody gets well enough to survive or live if they have an advanced case of cancer or poisoning. This diet will always make the situation better. But not always save everybody. 95% of the time it does. It reverses 95% of all diseases. Let me tell you, I wouldn't be wasting my time. I'd still be an actor making $13,000 a day. Now I'm lucky if I make $13,000 a month. So if this didn't work and it didn't help, and I weren't committed to it, I would be back there making money and not standing before you today. So I'm not here selling you anything, and I don't sell anything, except I do have a few DVDs and stuff like that if anybody's interested. But I don't even sell my books. I let all that go. The reason I bring the DVDs is because it's not easy to get them. So anyway, when I was going to school, I had a peritonitis. I got very sick after that. They came at me with more hypodermics, and I started knocking the trays off, sending the hypodermics all over the floor, the walls, the ceilings, everywhere. So then they left me alone after many hours of doing that. And when a nurse came and stabbed me while I was sleeping, boy, did she get it the next time she came in. I kicked her in the stomach and knocked her out. So that ended that. They decided they weren't going to mess with me anymore. I was out of the hospital in 24 hours after that. But it took me many, many months to even semi-recover from that. I was going through colds and flus. Normally, from the age of about three years old, I had colds and flus. That's as far back as I can remember, three, regarding colds and flus. And I would hold them two to three months a year. After that peritonitis episode, I was having colds and flus three to five months a year, bedridden about three months a year. And from the time I can remember, three years old, lifting my arm, I had fibromyalgia. If I held that arm for ten seconds, I would ache and burn as if I had done weights. Fifty rounds, and then I was just so fatigued that you can't lift anymore. Well, lifting my arm for ten seconds would create that kind of pain and fatigue. So I was poisoned all over in the system. I couldn't sleep at night. I could only sleep in the day in the classroom. Why? I don't know. And so I would lie awake all night, you know, in agony with nightmares. Something's under the bed going to get me. I wish somebody said, well, just cut the legs off. There's never anything under your bed. That would have been good, you know. Nobody told me that.

So I had nightmares all the time and my brothers were pretty violent. Especially the one brother. He'd come in while I was sleeping, punch me in the chest and knock the wind out of me. I'd pass out because I couldn't breathe. Couldn't catch my wind. And it was like that, you know, my whole childhood. They really, they didn't understand autism at all. And they certainly were in total denial of it. They didn't want to have an idiot in the room. My father was a brilliant man. He was an inventor. He invented the first Bering computer when he was in college at Purdue. You know, when he was in his 20s, early 20s. And he went on to create other inventions for General Electric. It was all for the War Department. You know, which I wasn't happy with when I finally realized and was able to communicate what he did. He was violent enough to me as it was. He put me in the hospital many times. One time he even broke my eardrums. He said, I told you to listen to me. He popped my ears. I was smoking. I was about 9 years old when that happened. And I had no choice because I had chronic fatigue. I could not get up out of bed. I really had no energy. Couldn't get out of the bed. I was pre-diabetic at that time, but they didn't diagnose it as diabetes. And so, at 8 years old, I saw my parents drinking coffee. And I saw that they got a buzz. I really paid attention. I said, they're getting high. They're getting a buzz off of this. They're getting energy. So, in my language, it wasn't anything in words. And so, I grabbed a cup of coffee in front of them and started drinking. They blew their stack. Kids can't drink that. These hypocrites. Because I couldn't communicate with my parents. There was nothing they explained to me they understood. But I understood that 95% of what they came out of their mouth was all a lie. 95% of what came out of their mouth was always a manipulation and a lie. So, after that happened, they didn't want me to have the energy. They had no concern about me whatsoever. And they didn't take interest in me. That's when I completely voided them from my heart. And I just looked at them as wardens that I had to live with. So, what I did was I'd go in at night. They always left about a half a cup of coffee in the pot. Nobody wanted to drink the last half a cup of coffee. So, I poured into a glass in the middle of the night, like about midnight. Put it under my bed so when my father came in or my mother came in and said, Rise and shine. It was never happy rise and shine, it was riot and shine. 

So, if I didn't get out of the bed, then they came in with a belt. By the time I was eight years old, they were coming in with a buckle. Using the buckle on me to get me out of bed. And they had no idea, I said, you know, no arm aching. And they said, oh, stop that, you know, there's nothing wrong with you. And that's the way it went through my whole childhood. So, I grabbed the cup of coffee, you know, half a cup of coffee and drank it. And within about two or three minutes, I was getting wired. And I mean, I would just shake from it. And then after that, I would settle down. After about five minutes, I'd get out of the bed. Body temperature would raise. And then in school, to keep it up, I would smoke between classes. So, by the time I was eight years, I was smoking a pack of cigarettes a day. And drinking as much coffee as I could get. And by the time I was sixteen, I was smoking two packs of Lucky Strike non-filter a day. Eleven cups of coffee a day. And then I couldn't sleep at night at all. And I had to sleep because I had to function like everybody else. And I wasn't allowed to sleep in class. So, I started drinking alcohol at night. So, I'd go to a fifth of gin or a fifth of bourbon a night just to be able to sleep. So, I was a drug addict at sixteen years old. And I graduated from high school with D's. I got married when I was sixteen years old. This girl was a year older than I in high school when I met her. And she didn't really know about my behavior. But, you know, we had some kind of communication that went beyond language. And we could look at each other. We could laugh and just be together without ever saying anything. And she just thought I was just a quiet, normal guy. Until we got married and started living together. Then, you know, she would say things. Of course, I wasn't, you know, do this and help me with this. I don't know what the fuck she's talking about. You know, so, you know, she realized that she was living with an idiot. So, of course, a few months later, that was over. That was the end of the relationship. And moved out. And I certainly didn't want to be in that situation. She had a baby, you know, the first week of my senior year in high school. And everything got complicated. I would go to school in the morning, take care of the baby in the afternoon. She'd come home from work. I would go to work. And I didn't want to come home to a screaming baby all night. Because that's the way it was, week after week after week. And so I would stay out with the guys and drink after work. 

And of course all I did was I was buying, you know, chicken and french fries. It doesn't take brains to do that. And that's what I did, I'd go out with the guys. And to drink with the guys you only have to know three words, shit, hell, damn. You know, and then you're with the guys and that's all you have to do is drink and say those words. So, and smoke. So that's the way it went for quite a few years. Graduated from high school and my mother really didn't know what to do with me. She was still in denial that I had a brain functional problem. So she took me to a new technical school that opened. And what they taught was systems analysis and unit record wiring equipment. So that was mostly math and systems analysis and stuff like that. So I did very well. I did better than anybody that had ever been tested. There was no language there. There were always figures and designs and stuff like that. And for me that was a breeze. The only time I ever got anything right besides math and language and literature was when they were diagramming symptoms. I don't know if they still do that kind of thing. You've got your subject, your preposition, and your object. And then... I mean the subject, verb, and object. And then you have prepositions, adverbs that run off. And these are linked to a particular word and they're junctured on that in a system. So I would just look at it and I'd know how the patterns were supposed to go. So this was in high school and everybody said, Boy, this guy is a genius. And they couldn't read a word. Not a word. So when I got into this unit record wiring and computer programming school, they accepted me and they interviewed me. And right away, they were all younger. Nobody was over 54 and all the professors were between 29 and 54. So they were younger. They were more understanding that there were things like learning disorders and autism and things like that. So they took me under their wing because I could write a program in an hour to two hours. It would take them six months to a year to write, and almost flawlessly. So they farmed me out. Farmed me out to IBM, to Time DC, the third largest trucking company in the world at the time, and the Carblanche Corporations as a systems analyst. And they had projects that they had worked on for six and a half years, like a Carblanche. They put me on it and I did it in six weeks. The next day is another six weeks and the whole project was done. Twelve weeks, three months, so it was easy.

So I was making a lot of money as an idiot. They had somebody right there write all the language out, the manuals in English, and I would write all the math and the designs and the flow charts. So it was a great exchange. Then my uncle, who was matriculating for his doctorate at UCLA, he realized there was a problem. He came visiting after he left the monkhood. He was becoming a monk in the Catholic Church. He read a lot, because he was such a scholar. They put him in the censorship, and they sent him to the Vatican. He got to read some of the original transcripts in Sanskrit and Hebrew. He said, the Bible is nothing, nothing like what they have interpreted today, and it's all about controlling the people. So he left the Catholic Church, completely left. He said, you can't do this, this is all government control of the church. He was pretty open-minded, so he thought he could help me. He had me come out to California, from Cincinnati out to California. They put me through all kinds of tests at UCLA, put me on LSD and all kinds of things. Between 732 micrograms in like six hours, and it didn't even take me off, so they took me out of that test. But they put me through all kinds of different tests, and nothing worked. So they just kind of gave up. I was still working for the trucking company as a systems analyst, too, and helping them, especially in their designing how trucks could go, and the fuel exchanges, and how far what kind of trucks would go, and stuff like that in their, what do they call it, dispatching department. Then I got access to all those bins and all those uppers that truck drivers take to keep going and driving, so then I was in heaven. But within a few months, I was vomiting blood, because I was drinking, smoking 11 cups of coffee a day, and then the binnies on top of it. So I was throwing up a cup, cup and a half of blood at a time. So they treated my uncle, took me to the hospital, treated me for that, and the treatment for that caused a tumor to grow right on the ulcer. So now I had cancer of the stomach as well as a stomach ulcer, and nothing was healing. So they went in and gave me a vagotomy pyloroplasty, which means they cut out the tumor and sealed the wound, the ulcer, but it didn't stay sealed. And after the surgery, the incision from here to here turned tumorous, and it was up to an inch and a half wide and three-quarters of an inch high. So it went into metastasis. So they irradiated me, and they gave me ten weeks of intensive radiation therapy, where they had this beam. They would shoot it like this and go like this. And it was about a 15- to 30-second pass, and they had it timed at different times. But they kept doing it. And if you'll look at this, they had the pinpoint going at the same place in the back.

So they cauterized my spine. It was like taking malleable clay and putting it in a kiln with nine-cone or ten-cone. And they turned my back into a solid piece of rock. So if I went to move, this area of my back was excruciating pain. I mean, so excruciating, I couldn't stand, I couldn't sit, I couldn't live. I had to be on the floor. I couldn't lie in a soft bed or on a couch. Had that kind of movement, it would pinch and scrape like granite to those nerves. So I basically had to live on the floor. And then the radiation therapy also disintegrated all the bone around my teeth. So my teeth dangled, and I, biting on my own teeth, I would bleed. Half a cup, whole cup of blood at a time. I was getting two to three transfusions, one to two transfusions weekly from that. That also gave me blood and bone cancer, multiple myeloma, from the radiation therapy. So then they said, we have to give you chemo. Of course, they're talking to my uncle, and I'm just letting them do whatever they do. And then, you know, the chemotherapy, I was vomiting all over myself. Diarrhea, you know, and urinating. Couldn't control it. I was in excruciating pain. I couldn't get on pots or pans or jars. I just had to go all over myself. So I stopped wearing clothes. I lived on the floor, my hardwood floor, now. I was an idiot and had a two-bedroom house in Beverly Hills. And that was pretty nice. But the whole living room and dining room were open space and two bedrooms on the back of the kitchen and a porch on the other side. So this whole room I had that was probably twice as big as this room that I would go around and crawl around on my elbows and go to different parts of the room every time I'd vomit, defecate, or urinate. So I had about a two-day pass around the living room before I needed help. And my owner took me to a hospice because they said I was definitely going to die. And I stopped the chemo. I just wasn't going to have it anymore. They wanted to pull all my teeth. Here I'm going to die in a few weeks and they want to pull all my teeth. Like I'm going to suffer all these extractions. Every time the doctors came in theory after that I just said, no, no, no, no. And I didn't know what they were saying, but I knew whatever they had for me was not good. It was going to be damaging and harmful. And I confronted several doctors in the last 30 years and said, what about your Hippocratic Oath that says, first do no harm? Well, we don't swear on a Bible or anything. That was the comment I got. These people are treating us? You know, that's not very intelligent at all. So, my uncle took me to a hospice, and of course I was still autistic, 20 years old, I still can't communicate. I've got a lot of lines down, but if you ask me, what does that mean? What does this word mean? I had no comprehension.

I could pair it and had an understanding of words, what I thought they meant. And my meaning was derived from being an artist, from copying people's stuff. I became a good artist. When you're an artist, you think of, oh, well, this should be pretty. So, a word that had a pretty sound had a pretty meaning. A word that was hard to say and hard and guttural must mean something difficult. So, that's the way I interpreted language to be. Also, like lugubrious, I thought, meant hardworking. Instead of laborious, it means hardworking. But that's the way I had a lot of malaprops from that. So, I was in a situation where I was dying. I refused to go to the hospice and be around people who would be insulted by me and offended. They were already dying and irritable. Most of them had chemo, so they were all irritable. Nobody was happy. I didn't want to die there, and I understood what death was because I saw my grandfather in a coffin, dead, and touched him after being with him a few days before when he was alive, so I understood death. I'd seen animals and insects die, so I knew what death was, and I understood that word, death, die. When they said that was going to happen to me, I understood I was going to die, and that was happy for me because I wanted to die my whole life up to that time because I was always miserable and sick. So that was fine, but I wasn't going to do it in a hospice around people who would be abusive to me because they just didn't understand me. So two volunteers from the hospice decided to come two or three times a week and take care of me. They would go shopping first, they would come to the house, and my food, my diet at that time was Cheerios or Sugar Crisp, and I'd put an extra two to four tablespoons of sugar on top of Sugar Crisp. And donuts, I loved powdered donuts, RC Cola, Sprite. So when I showed them what I ate, they went shopping and got me those things. Because of my tooth problem, I couldn't chew anything, so I had to suck it through a big fat straw, so everything had to be liquefied. So the donuts and the Sprite or the RC Cola went in together. So that was my diet, a very, very bad diet. No wonder I was so sick on top of all the chemicals and medication and everything. So one of the volunteers was an 18-year-old African-American boy, grew up in Watson, Los Angeles. How he knew anything about health, kindest man in the world, beautiful voice, and he was working for the Ford Motor Company. He was one of the going thing group that was sponsored by the Fifth Dimension. And, you know, pretty popular group in those days.

And here he was, 18-year-old boy, making 80 grand a year, more, 80 to 110 grand a year, singing. And here he is doing volunteer work and stuff like this. It was amazing. He got me into the carrot juice and raw milk. And, you know, he had to really coax me into it. But you have to understand, at that time, after chemo and radiation, everything tasted like cardboard, chewed cardboard, or postage stamp glue. Everything, even my donuts, everything that was processed had that flavor to it. But when he gave me the carrot juice and the milk, there was richness to it. There was vitality. There was flavor. There was enjoyment. And I wasn't enjoying anything at that time. So I started drinking this stuff. And after about ten days, I woke and language was there. My brain had opened up, that part of the brain. And I thought, oh, this is what a verb is. It's an action thing. Oh, it's action. I see. And I just started realizing all of what language was. Preposition is a direction, you know. A subject was a noun that you were discussing. And it just all fell upon me. I called up my uncle and said, you know, this is me. And, you know, I can think, I can use words and understand. I have comprehension now. And he thought it was a comedian buddy of his that did voices. So this conversation went on for 30 minutes. And he's thinking he's talking to his comedian friend. And finally he said, okay, that's enough, you know. The joke is enough, okay. And I said, no, it's really me. And he said, okay, come on. I thought it was Edward or whatever his name was. And I said, no, Lanny, here's what we did when I first moved down here. Nobody would have known that for me, you know, except us. You know, what happened the day I arrived in California from Los Angeles. I mean from Cincinnati. So he said, oh, really? He said, it had nothing to do with the carrot juice and raw milk. You know, it's all that stuff we did at UCLA finally is working. That's a psychologist, that's a doctor. They did it all. It has nothing to do with diet and food, right? If it had a chemical, if it had been LSD that did it, of course that's reasonable, right? But why not carrot juice and milk? Raw milk and raw carrot juice. Why not? That's the way the body's been functioning, cells have been functioning for hundreds of millions of years. Bacteria eating substances that are food. And our bodies are 150 bacterial genes to one human gene. You're not even 1% human. So think about that. Why would we accuse bacteria of causing disease? The whole bacteria theory is absolutely absurd when you think about it in those terms. It is always pollution, industrial chemicals that cause disease, even if it's just cake, cookie, but I'll get into that later. 

So, I had a conversation with my uncle, and then because he wasn't supportive of my viewpoint, I called Steve, the African-American boy, and said, Hey, I can communicate now, I can talk. I want to go to a bookstore, and I want to get as many books on nutrition as I can, and I want to learn. He said, OK, and I said, but I've got a problem. I'm being evicted if I don't die soon. My uncle's got the bank to allow me to die in the house because it's only going to be in a few weeks I'm supposed to die. The medical profession has taken my $80,000 in savings, and this was in 1968. I still owed them $80,000 to $90,000. Cancer therapy now runs, on the average person, $280,000 for their life. They will die paying $280,000. That's basically what it is now. So, it's a big business, huge business. So, I refused to pay them the last $80,000 to $90,000. I said, take me to court. I'm going to tell them everything you did to me and my experience after you treated me. And then I'm going to take your oath of practice up to them, to the jury, and say, do no harm. They made an oath to that. I don't care if it's on a Bible or not, they made that oath. So, of course, they wrote the $80,000 to $90,000 off and completely left me alone. So, Steve went through four days of preparing to take me to a bookstore. Because, like I said, I was living on the floor, vomiting, defecating, urinating all over myself. So, he had to get a catheter, a bag that would catch your diapers, and a bag that would hold it. And then, you know, have enough fluid for me to drink in a wheelchair. A back brace that would hold me up so I wouldn't go into screaming, screeching pain and end up on the floor. So, he had to go through all this, and this boy took the time to do all that for me. So, we went and I bought $127 worth of books. And in 1969, 1968, that was a lot of books. You could buy a paperback for like 25 cents, even if it were 800 pages long. You could buy a hardback cover book with pictures in it, color pictures for $2, $1.95. So, I got a lot of books for that, and all of them were junk. Why? Because we put kids into schools brainwashed with nonsense. Don't put them in any kind of an inquisitive, what do they call it, internship to really prove the knowledge is right. And everything was an internship 200 years ago, 150 years ago. If you went to a college, you had to work with an expert in the field. You had to learn what worked and what didn't work, and your teacher or your master would tell you to do things wrong so you would know. All we do now is spit this junk information in the kids and tell them they know it, and they go out and practice. Nobody has any wisdom.

So when I read these books, it was like this person was saying the opposite of that book, and that book said the opposite of that. And nobody was in agreement on anything, and everybody had their theories, but nobody had an experience. So as I was drinking this carrot juice and milk, I started getting better and better. I started eating raw eggs, raw cottage cheese, and things like that, that I could gum. And within a year, the bone grew around my teeth. So I didn't lose my teeth. And I was supposed to have lost my teeth in that time. See, here, there, oh, here's some over here. So I started getting better and better by the time I was 27 years old. My back was only in pain about 10 hours a day instead of 24 every minute. And I would go into yoga postures to stretch out the back. And I would try to keep myself elongated so it wouldn't grind and crunch. And I decided at 27 years old I was not going to find out what was real in the nutritional and health field unless I went out and lived in the wild. So I went out to live in the wild. I lived for three and a half years off of a bicycle. When I would go off into the jungle, I would hang it in a tree, way up in a tree. Of course, I was bicycling every hour to an hour and a half. I'd have to get off the bicycle to get into yoga postures to stretch my back out to stop the pain. And I was always in pain, but it was mitigated to a point where I could tolerate it. So I lived off of this bicycle. Now I live with alligators, chipmunks, coyotes, you name it. I lived with every animal. I lived with four Indian tribes. In Mexico with the Mayans down in the Yucatan. And then in northern Mexico with the Yaqui. And in America with the Sioux and the Dakotas. And my great-grandmother was a Sioux Indian. So they kind of accepted me into there. And then with the Eskimo, the Inuit in Alaska. And all of those months that I spent with each tribe, they all told me raw meat was what I needed. And I thought they were just trying to kill the white boy. I had turned raw and completely raw in 72 when I helped my girlfriend get through a case of peritonitis and get back... I took her out of the hospital and everything. I was threatened by her mother. It's in the book there, that episode. And she got well. She was back to ballet classes in six weeks. They told her it would take her 18 months if she did recover. And she was very normal in a very quick period of time, like six weeks. So I thought raw is absolutely the way. In February of 72, I committed to all raw for the rest of my life. Almost did it, probably 98% up until 74. And since 74, I've been completely on this kind of a diet. However, without raw meat. I realized raw for everything else was good. But for the meat, I was told that you'll get a brain flu. You can be an idiot, and I had already been there and done that. So I didn't want to get a brain flu. 

So anybody who said raw meat, I thought they were out of their mind. There was no way I was going to do that. So these Indian tribes are telling me raw meat was what I needed to heal my situation. And that there was no way that I could progress to a healing state quickly without doing that. And I may never without doing it. So I didn't buy it. Each tribe, I thought maybe they had these smoke signals. They were sending up thousands of miles. This is the white boy, let's get him. They've taken over our land and everything. So I ignored it. And then when I was in, I was leaving Alaska after two and a half years of living outdoors. It was early September. And their summer is one month, August. And it's daylight all day long. 24 hours a day, it's daylight. And it gets a little dull a couple of hours of the day. And it's slightly just, you know, like turn down the lights. But never turn out the lights. And then in September it starts getting chilly. It was getting down to like 50 degrees. And by this time living outdoors. And I had been a fruitarian vegetarian. I stopped eating dairy when I started living outdoors. So I got down to about 118 pounds. And I'm 172 right now. So you can imagine how thin I was. Skin and bones. And very weak and very achy in every joint. Especially if the temperature dropped below 50 degrees. I would be immobilized in joint pain. So I would go to my sleeping bag. All the time I lived outdoors I would go to my sleeping bag before the sun went down. Or before the temperature cooled enough. So in Alaska the sun was starting to go down. For about an hour and a half. In the beginning of September. Two hours a day. And I'd have to let the sun bake on the sleeping bag for two hours before I could get out of the sleeping bag with some kind of pain. And then I would get out and get naked. And then lie in the sun. And that would heat me up for about 30-45 minutes. And I decided well I've got to leave. You know I'm not learning anything here with the Eskimos. They're telling me raw meat. And that doesn't work. So I was leaving. I packed my saddle bags on my bicycle. And was going. And they were digging up. They were digging this hide out of the ground and they unwrapped it. And it was this moldy stuff. It was patina. It was black. It was white. Every shape brown. All kinds of colors of mold. And it reeked. It smelled like an abandoned. You know only a two week old abandoned slaughterhouse. Terrible. But you know at that time I had done... I had taken physiology, biochemistry books with me. I had to be self-taught because I couldn't understand the teaching methods of anybody in any university. I tried and had to drop out every time. Because they were nonsense to me. But I could learn on my own by reading. And letting my mind calculate and assimilate the way I did. 

So I thought meat, yeah. We get a fungus called gangrene. And that breaks down tissue. But there were all these other kinds of molds. That I had seen in compost piles. With leaves and fruit and stuff like that. So I thought that's what they had in there. And for whatever reason burying it in the hide. I thought maybe the hide created that odor. And they were jumping up and down. Kids were ready to eat it. And there was a bird call from downwind. And they wrapped it up and buried it again. And I thought what the hell are they doing with this. Didn't smell a mile downwind. And that's what the bird call was. They said to rebury it, they're going to dig it up in a few days. So I said I've got to see to this. So I unpacked my bags and put my sleeping bag up in my little campsite again. And stayed there waiting to dig it up. They dug it up in four days and it really reeked in. I think if I was in five feet I'd get a shooting headache and start dry heaving. The call downwind was some kind of moose call. The meat was good. They started digging them all up. And there was a whole area bigger than this, almost twice as big as this. So they had probably about 300 pounds of this stuff buried. And for 36 hours they ate all of it. Even babies were eating a pound of this in 36 hours. We're talking infants who are crawling. And this is rotten meat. Of course, I didn't believe it was rotten meat. I thought it was some kind of herbal formula. But it stunk like hell. And the kids are jumping up and down eating it like it's cotton candy or something. It was repulsive as hell. So they got me, they taught me eating a ping pong ball size amount. And of course, I got within five feet and I was dry heaving. So I had cotton balls because my gums never stopped bleeding from all of that, you know, the radiation therapy and the chemo. So I would take cotton balls and put clay on it and pack it in there. I mean, they didn't bleed. I maybe lost a tablespoon a day of blood in my gums. But I was very weak at that point, so I was trying to stop it. I couldn't afford to lose any blood. My multiple myeloma was surging and the blood and bone cancer, and especially in Alaska where it was getting cold. So they took two cotton balls and put musk oil in it, stuffed it up my nose, and then gave it to me. The musk oil was, okay, it's a cool smell, you know, moose balls. That's what it is. It's from moose balls. Pheromones from moose balls. That's what musk oil was when any of those from the 60s and 70s would remember that. The true musk oil was moose ball fluid.

So I was able to eat that ping-pong ball-sized amount of that stuff, and it just sort of melted like warm candy, like chocolate. Melted chocolate. Or like braised in brandy lamb, if anybody's had that. Melted in the mouth. So it was easy to eat, as long as you don't smell it. But they loved the smell. To them, it was like gourmet. And, I mean, how many of you would let your month-old baby squirm around on an igloo floor on ice? Nobody. Exactly nobody. These guys do it. And they're incredibly healthy. And all they ate was raw meats. Raw meats. Maybe a few blueberries when I was there. But mostly the grizzly bears ate there, so you didn't... The day I arrived, outside, I went to Anchorage and took a bus out to the wilderness. And the bus stopped. I took the farthest point they would go. And I had bungee-corded my bicycle to the front of the bus. And got off and hung the bike up in a tree. And then went off over this hillside, came down. There was this whole field, about maybe 10, 20 acres. Probably 20 acres of blueberry bushes. I thought, oh, you know, I was a fruitarian. This was heaven for me. So I was there eating blueberries and blueberries and blueberries. And then I sneezed, and all of a sudden I saw a little furry thing. Furry thing down there, furry thing down there, sneezed again. And these bears stood up in this field. There must have been 25, 30 bears. Grizzly bears. I said, you guys got the blueberries. I'm gone. So I backed out of there. But they were busy eating the blueberries. They didn't come after me. But I was still paranoid. I mean, I lived with all kinds of animals. I even swam with alligators. But bears, a big grizzly bear, that's something else. A little bit of paranoia there. So I backed out of there. And then after they ate this stuff, after I ate that ping-pong ball-sized amount, I went back to my campsite to get to sleep before that two hours of really cold, two and a half hours when the sun was down. And it would get below 49, 48 degrees, and that was an excruciating pain. So I went back to my sleeping bag, and I woke the next morning, and I was able to get out of the sleeping bag with the sun beating on it for only 30 minutes, 45 minutes. And then I got out naked in the sun for only 10 minutes, and I was functional. I thought, oh my God, I've got to find out what that herbal formula is. So I went to the chief, and I said, listen, you've got to tell me. It's raw caribou and blubber. I don't remember if it was seal or whale. And they beat it together, and then they roll it in there so the bacteria and the molds in the ground will pre-digest it. So they will get all the nutrients in it in a rush. Because when they go through the winter, they get no bacteria. Everything is frozen. If they get a fish, it's frozen by the time it reaches their mouth. 

So they don't get any rich bacteria. So they fill up on it before they go. And I thought, this guy is pulling my leg. This is all crap. So I said, he's killing the white boy. He's going to kill the white boy. So I didn't believe it. And after a few days, I said, they're not going to give me the secret. So I was really in a lot of pain. So I couldn't bicycle back to California. It was about a 6,300 mile trip, which is what, 12,000 kilometers, or about 11,000 kilometers, something like that, 10,500. So I hopped freight trains and rode the freight trains back to Southern California and picked an old Indian burial ground to die. And I was going to fast myself to death. I wasn't going to deal with it anymore. I hadn't found the answer. So I set up my camp, and I was just drinking water for the whole time, like two gallons a day. I would go down about a quarter of a mile and fill my jugs and haul jugs up of water to last a week. And I started drinking the water and getting dizzy and couldn't sleep, headaches, all that kind of stuff. I had to start doing enemas to keep the headaches away. Doing everything I shouldn't do, but to die, that was the thing to do. So a den of coyotes lived up in the canyon right above in one of the caves. And they'd come down every night at midnight and wake me and play this game, sound like a bunch of crazy people as they're coming down the canyon. Then when they would reach me, one of them would distract me, howl, yelp, giggle, whatever you call it. And the others would go down around the wash around me. And I thought, well, they know I'm not violent, so it's not their problem. They're playing some kind of game. And after about probably 10, 11 nights, got to be where I, you know, when you get, when you're fasting a long time, you get, you have hallucinations, you become more psychic and perceptive. So I was able to sense where they were. And the next night, they brought a jackrabbit that they had caught and put it on my feet, ripped open for me, and gave it to me as an offering. And I thought, mmm, I'm a vegetarian, I've been vegetarian, I haven't eaten meat in six and a half years, and I eat dairy up to, you know, lots of raw dairy for up to three years before that. And then I stopped because it wasn't spiritual to, you know, harness animals and take their milk, especially mothers. So I got out of doing dairy. So I was a pure fruitarian, vegetarian, vegan. And the coyotes laid this rabbit on my feet and I wasn't going to do it. Then I remembered a dialogue that my uncle had had with my brothers and cousins when they were going rabbit hunting.

Now I was so sickly as a child, I didn't get to play sports, I didn't get to play with the boys. I stayed home and wanted to sew and cook because I was so sick. And so they went to hunting and my uncle said to them, now rabbits have a microbe that can kill you in 24 to 48 hours. So if you kill a rabbit and you're going to eat them, you have to cook them all the way through until the inside is brown, there's no pink in there. They said the same thing about pigs, they'll get trichinosis. So that went through my head and I thought, oh, 48 hours of excruciating intestinal pain, I can handle that and I'll have a quick death. So the coyotes are trying to help me die quickly, is what I thought. So I picked up the rabbit, took some bites, came right back up. It was slimy, it was raw, and here was the Easter bunny. So all of this stuff's going through my head. So it was very difficult to eat it. So I went back to all the times that I had to stay for an hour and a half to two hours at the dinner table because my body did not like cooked vegetables. It wasn't a conscious choice. It wasn't because I didn't like the taste of it. I would swallow Brussels sprouts, I could hit that wall, projectile vomit. Peas, I could hit there, mid-table. Carrots, here. Corn on the cob, although that's not a vegetable, it's a fruit, never made me vomit, I like that. But any cooked vegetable, I would projectile vomit and probably Brussels sprouts was the worst. That would even give me diarrhea the next day. So they made me stay at the table every night and consume it. And if I vomited, they would put that much more on my plate. So they went and watched the new black and white TV that was this big, you know, watched the law man and stuff like that. You know, I had to sit at that table, cut off my taste buds, mash up the food, take a teaspoon of milk, wash it down, then the hard part came, not vomiting. Making sure my pylori glands stayed tight so it didn't come back up. So, that would take sometimes five minutes between bites, and no wonder it took me that long to eat. So I went back to that time, came back to the rabbit space, and I said, okay, I can do this. So I psyched myself in, I cut my taste buds off, got rid of my squeamishness about the raw meat texture, and then started eating the rabbit. After about 13 bites, it started tasting delicious. So I started devouring it. In 45 minutes, maybe 50 minutes, I ate three and a half pounds of that jackrabbit. And I gave the rest to the coyotes, and they finished off the rest of it.

And let me tell you, there's no survival of the fittest. Those coyotes were always considered always the weakest one, or the nursing one, or the pups ate first. The strong ones always went hungry. There was no survival of the fittest there. And this is in a desert environment. It may happen with cats, wild cats like lions and stuff like that. They'll even eat the young, but not with the coyotes. It wasn't like that. A lot of animals I saw, they shared, the weak ones ate, but it wasn't like that. That's the way it was. They cared, and they understood, and they were inclined to have compassion for their fellow animals. Only in the cat environment did I see differently. The coyotes who needed the jackrabbit ate, they obviously felt I was very sick, and maybe wanted to kill me quickly is what I thought. So I went back to my campsite to die, and I knew I was dying because I felt good. The only times I had felt good were twice in my life, or three times when I had near-death experiences. I had left the body twice on an operating table, and they revived my body and brought me back into the body. But while I was off of the body, circling around, I had no attachment with the pain in the body anymore. In fact, I had no attachment with the body anymore, until I was pulled back into it. So I had that feeling as I was walking, I'm already dying. This feels good, I've got no pain. I'm walking, you know, lifely, and I thought, oh, this is great. So I thought I'd be dead in the morning easily. So I woke in the morning, I'm still in my sleeping bag. I was able to get out of the sleeping bag, it was only two hours from here. I'm back in the United States, southern United States. It was getting to about probably 41, 42 degrees at night. It gets very cold in the desert at night. And I was feeling good. I got out of the sleeping bag in about 30 minutes, 45 minutes, laid in the sun for 5 to 10 minutes. I was functional. And I thought, oh, okay, all right. I will wait for the disease to come, take me over. I'm getting better. I'm already dying because I'm feeling better. So three days went past, no diarrhea, no vomit. I felt stronger than I ever had in my life. And I thought the Indians were right. It'll be raw meat was the answer. So I started killing everything I could find in the desert. There's not many things alive in the desert. So I had to get on my bicycle and go to the farms. And I made deals with farmers to milk cows, shovel manure, whatever I could, to get chicken, beef, goat, milk of any kind, butter, cream, cheese, everything I could eat that was like that. And in two and a half months, I gained 55 pounds and looked like a scaled down Arnold Schwarzenegger. It was the first time in my life I could do hard labor. And it was phenomenal.

So I went back to Los Angeles to spread the word. Raw meat is the answer. And they all said, are you crazy? You'll get a brain, brain food from being an idiot. And I said, yeah, I've been there and done that. You know, this is the only thing that's working. It really works. So I got hundreds of people. And I started working at the biggest health food store in the world, Aunt Tillys. And worked with movie stars and everything. Getting them to do it a little bit. And I only ate the raw meat. You know, meat meals three times a week. And still doing, I did mostly dairy. Lots of raw dairy, raw cream, raw cheeses. And fresh milk. So I was eating mainly that. But I was also eating the raw meats. And that would really give me the strength to keep on muscle without working out. And I found out, wow, I can work out. So I started running around the Hollywood track. And the Hollywood track, they have gravel on it. And I was barefoot. I'd been barefoot the whole time. So I lived outdoors. I climbed up Mount Shasta in the snow on my bare feet.  So I really tried my body. By the time I started eating that rabbit, I was 98 pounds. 98 pounds, that's how skinny I was then. So I started running. And within six months, I was up to running 13 miles a day on gravel. I could sprint backwards. I could sprint sideways and everything. People would just watch me go around that track. It was funny. Just the other day, I was in Chicago. And I went to the co-op. I usually don't have time to mix. But there's hard times. People don't have the money they had before. So I didn't have as many clients. But I was scheduled to stay there longer, and I decided to. So a bunch of the kids who grew up on the Diner, really energetic and powerful, challenged me to a race. I said, oh, they're going to show the 60-year-old, 5-year-old man up here. So I said, oh, I'll do it just to play with him. So we got on the soccer track, and it was raced over to the pond, which was probably about 100 yards, you know, 100 meters. So everybody gets in to prepare, and I'm there, my bare feet. I took off my sandals, and the little girl says go, and we go. And I just started moving, and I thought, wow, this is easy. I hadn't run in 30 years. So I started running and running, and I thought, oh, this is easy. I'm just concentrating on my breath, not who's beside me or around me or anything. And I get to the end, and I turn around, and they're only halfway up. And they're going, 65-year-old man. And I thought, wow, I wish I'd been able to time that or something, but I was certainly out of breath. It took me 10 minutes to get my breath back, just because I'm not used to it. So this diet is phenomenal. This diet can create all kinds of things when you never knew you could do it. 

And it isn't an aging thing every day. It's a getting healthier and younger thing every day. Does anybody know Paul Cohen, the famous Olympic tennis champion in the 50s? Well, he's been on the diet now for about 14 years, and he said, if only I had known this diet when I was a kid. And he's near 80 years old now. And he still goes out there and plays tennis and tears up young people. I've got a Hall of Fame basketball player that tears up young kids on the tennis court. And he has 627 cholesterol. He keeps it there. That's right for him. So this diet is great. That is the information that's a free part of which we've gone over half an hour. So I'm going to do a workshop now. And in the workshop, I'll tell you how the body works, not how the pharmaceutical industry tells you how it works, so that you will never be afraid of your body. You'll know how to handle your situation without any kind of drug, so that you will get well rather than not getting well, staying on medication and medical help. And then I'll take you through a diet, and a day in a diet, and why your body functions best by eating that pattern every day, so you can be most productive you want to be. So we'll take a short break. Is there anybody here who has lunch this day for the workshop? It'll be about six hours or more, and when you leave here you'll have the knowledge to take care of yourself plenty. Anybody here who's going to stay for the workshop that hasn't paid already? Okay, so take care of that now.

[break]

A: How the body was constructed to eat what it should eat. Now we'll start with in the mouth. Now what do we have in the mouth? We have saliva. What is in the saliva? Bacteria is the predominant thing. We have like one to two percent ptyalin, and that is there to digest some carbohydrates, but that's only one to two percent. The rest of it is putrefactive bacteria. Now it's not anaerobic bacteria, it's putrefactive bacteria. The bacteria that predigests and breaks down animal cells. Not vegetation, not fruit, not anything else other than animal cells. Whether it's meat, dairy, eggs, it's animal cells. We swallow that, and where does it go? It goes into the stomach, and what is in the stomach? Hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is putrefactive. It's not for digesting nuts, grains, or vegetables. It is a hydrochloric acid to break down animal cells again. And the hydrochloric acid is not really a digestive factor. The hydrochloric acid breaks down large pieces of food, like we have a slice of meat here. Now the bacteria will only be able to get into the upper two layers, and in each slice there you have about eight layers of tissue. So the bacteria is only going to be able to get into the top two and the bottom two. So the four in the center are not going to get consumed. Hydrochloric acid breaks that down and dissolves it into smaller particles of food so the bacteria can completely infiltrate it and eat it. And then it moves into the lower part of the duodenum, the stomach, and what happens there? We secrete bile from the bile duct, from the gallbladder, into there. Now what does bile do? Bile digests fats. Now when we take the bile from a human and put it with different foods, what fats does it break down? You put it with vegetable oils, it won't do a thing. You put it with fruit oils, it won't do a thing, except for avocado. It'll help break down avocado and some coconut.

Q: What about olive?

A: It will help olive a teeny bit. Olive's already highly acidic so it doesn't need a lot of bile. So again, everything's putrefactive. We are meant to eat animal cells, animal tissue. Then that food travels through the small intestine. We have villi. It's like you see those milia in the ocean and you see fish go through them and particles go through them. Well, in our intestines, that registers how big the food particles are and how much more hydrochloric acid do we need if those food particles are very large yet. So the body will secrete more hydrochloric acid. Even though it was mainly made in the stomach, the intestines still can form hydrochloric acid, just like the stomach can, but in very small amounts. And then also bile is transported through the lymphatic system, out from the stomach to different areas of the intestine. So we have hydrochloric acid and bile that all throughout the small intestine travels into the intestinal tract to digest larger particles of food. And they don't break it down into the substance that we absorb. Bacteria does. Bacteria is 80-90% of digestion. If you chew your food really well, you're going to get a lot of bacteria and you're going to digest better. But I tell people, don't worry about, you know, chewing your meat. If you haven't got a vagotomy like I have, you'll have enough hydrochloric acid to break it down, rather than people being put off by eating raw meats. But if you go into my recipe book or the recipe DVD, you'll know how to make the sauces to make a good tasting so you can chew all you want. So that's the way it travels through. Now think about that. What does a bacteria do to allow us to eat the foods that are passing through our intestines? They eat them. They eat the food. Their urine, their feces, their sweat is our food. When you think about it that way, you're going to stop being squeamish. All this nonsense about, oh, you went to the toilet, wipe your hands, you're going to get E. coli and die. It's an absolute absurdity. It is the chemical industry trying to get you to buy their chemical poisons. Antiseptics. We've got antiseptics blankets for children. Think about this. All fabric will lint. You've got a poison inside. It's usually heavy metals. You could have fluoride in it, which is a rat poison, insect poison, rodent poison. They put it in our water. And whenever you look at a rat poison or a rodent poison, what is it? Sodium fluoride. And that's what they put in our water. That is in a fiber, a plastic fiber. You're talking about plastic. You're not talking about cotton. You're not talking about wool. You're not talking about linen. You're talking about a plastic fiber that has poisons in it.

What do you think when that baby breathes that, gets all that into the lungs, what do you think is going to happen to that baby? Asthma, emphysema, lots of colds and flus, all kinds of medication that child will be taking its whole life. So each industry feeds the other. You get sick, you go to the hospital, you go to the doctor, you get more treatment with more medication, more chemicals, and you just keep going back for more and more. It's a rat race. You make them rich and you get sick and die. Or your child becomes hyperactive because they've got this chemical inside. They've got BPAs in there, bisphenol phosphates, which are carcinogenic. They cause erratic, violent behavior. And you have all these chemicals doing that in the body. It's funny, when I was studying nutrition, a tutor tutored me for three and a half years. And the first book that he gave me was a book done at three universities or five universities here in Canada. And they showed that the children that were fed food from packages that had any kind of additive in it had very bad behavior and poor scores in their classes. And even violent behavior. And the children who were fed from scratch food, like right out of the market, the chemicals weren't big in those days, this was in the 50s, that these tests were done. They were perfect students, perfect people. That book was buried. Buried. It was Toronto, Alberta, and the University of Edmonton. It was a great book. It took it down and broke it down. And then about in 1993, 1994 in the United States, I don't remember what the name of the book was, and it was about the studies and tests. It wasn't a book that was out to the public. It was for universities and for professors. My teacher was a renegade doctor. After a second year getting his doctorate in medicine, he quit. He said, this is absurd. He was from an old Italian family that used food as medicine. He was watching in school this whole movement toward chemical and chemical on top of chemical to treat chemical reactions, side effects. He said, this isn't right. He just quit and became a nutritionist, one of the top in Los Angeles. How I got him was just a miracle. He's the one that led me more into a lot of raw foods. He ate 80% of raw foods. He didn't get into the raw meat, nor did I until much later, years later. But he was fat-phobic. Fat is so important for the human body and I'm going to get into that.

So the food goes down to the intestine, gets to the bowel. Now you've got a different set of bacteria here. Now what are these bacteria? How are they different? Mainly E. coli is in the colon. We've been told E. coli is a bad guy, E. coli is a bad guy, but the more we got into science and the more intelligent the students became and more inquisitive, they said, wait a minute, 70% of the bacteria in the colon is E. coli, it can't be a bad guy, it's part of the digestion. So then they came up with 157H7, E. coli, that's the bad one. It's like, first it was the Russians or the Koreans. You've got to have a bad guy so they can have a war department and a war machine going to make money. So they needed an E. coli bad guy. Now this 157H7, when I looked at it under a microscope and studied it, when you put an enzyme on a bacteria, it will fractionate into parts, like if we were to come apart at our limbs and head. You have five parts, six parts for us. For a bacteria, it's usually five parts. What happens when you put that enzyme on an E. coli 157H7? Splits in two. Only a man-made organism splits in two, splices. They splice them together. So as far as I'm concerned, E. coli 157 was invented and made probably by General Electric. They were working on bacteria like that way back in the 40s and 50s. Now it's the opportune time to come out with it. All this E. coli business you hear? When they had the E. coli spinach thing and tomato thing in California, I was out there in the nights in the field, even though there were guys out there with machine guns, and I took 53 samples with four other doctors. Not one E. coli 157 showed up anywhere in that soil. The only place I've been able to get my E. coli 157 was from Davis University, California Davis. Now they got theirs from, guess where? FDA and CDC. They didn't get it in nature. It doesn't behave like that. Totally, it's a monster created in a laboratory. The bacteria, the E. coli is the final stage of digestion. It breaks down the fat and the protein molecule into the finite form and size to feed the brain and the nervous system. The brain and the nervous system mainly get their food from the colon. If you've got anybody who's got a psychological problem, it means they have low bacteria in the colon. Bacteria digest food. Understand that. If you eat rotten meat, you eat rotten eggs, rotten milk, kefir, yogurt, rotten. They're fermented, full of bacteria. Bacteria's pre-digested them. We're going to eat lots of feces and urine and sweat of the grains, the bacteria in the yogurt and kefir. You get rid of squeamishness and you'll just say, oh, it's a matter of fact. We eat urine and feces and sweat. That's our nutrients. That E. coli in there is very important.

Like when I did, did anybody see my segment on the rotten meat eater on Ripley's Believe It or Not? A few of you have seen it. I had two people who had been on psychotropic drugs, one for five years, one for 20 years. She was depressed all the time, all kinds of problems. He was. No energy. And when I finally got them to eat some high meat, rotten meat, rotten eggs, they started giggling and laughing. Giggling and laughing and whistling and being happy. 10 to 20 minutes. They eat rotten meat as a regular part of their diets. Because they don't want to take a chance on being depressed again. Always suicidal, always homicidal, always problems. And you eat some rotten meat. Why is the rotten meat good? Why are the rotten eggs good? Because the bacteria is already pre-digested. Somebody in South Africa, and I just came back from South Africa, sent me a DVD of a couple of native, natives who had been taken off their land. Their land has been turned into a game reserve, a national reserve, so you can't hunt anymore. They have no food. So they show the last hunt. And these guys were hunting an antelope. They outlast the antelope. How fast they run. These guys track them for five days until the antelope can't even move, can't even walk. And they can run just as fast. And they're phenomenal. And they cook their fresh meat. But when they find a dead carcass of a stinky, old, rotten, I think it was a buffalo, a water buffalo, they don't cook it. And they say, that's the best meat they ever had. They get to strength in the next days when they ran down the antelope. Rotten meat. They got high, they got happy, and they got strong. You have to understand that nature is not making pollutants when it does that. Only man puts pollutants in your meats. If somebody gets a bad reaction like the so-called jack-in-the-box episode back in the 80s, that E. coli wasn't the problem. The problem was that they got a detergent, they got ammonia or something in the machine that got into that meat and contaminated it. It was a poison. So people were poisoned with this chloroform and this chlorine that went in the system that was combined with ammonia. Always poisons in the body, disease in the body is created by industrial pollution. Cooking itself is an industrial pollution. You've got 32 known toxins that are formed from just cooking your food. And I named them in the third section of my recipe book, The Recipe for Living Without Disease. Three of the main ones that even the media acknowledges on a regular basis is acrylamides formed from cooking carbohydrates, lipid peroxides from cooking fats, heterocyclic amines from cooking proteins, from cooked proteins.

So all these are carcinogens and they collect every time you cook a food. If you pasteurize at only 141 degrees for 15 seconds milk, you will cauterize 50% of the calcium. That means 50% of the calcium you don't absorb and you don't utilize. Your enzymes are all neutralized by 22 degrees. They become affected at 105 degrees. Phosphorus, mineral phosphorus, starts cauterizing at 98 degrees. And that's one of the major cleansers of the body.  So even temperatures very low can cause a minute kind of destruction. By the time you hit 118 degrees, you're altering your vitamins to a state that they cannot be utilized. And you're rendering them toxic. So by the time you hit 123 degrees, you have no stable nutrients and a lot of toxins. And the higher you go, the worse it gets, the more compound and complex. So cooking is destructive. That's only with about 12 research experiments that were done that you have 32 toxins. There are a myriad of others that they haven't identified that are sub under those toxins. So you have to understand that cooking causes problems with the body's functionality, creates chemicals that are poisons to the system. That's industrial pollution. The worst industrial pollution is when they take chemistry that doesn't have anything to do with food. And we have 60,000 chemicals now that have nothing to do with food, as products from food or made from food, or made with food. They are complete derivatives of a laboratory that go into preserving food, giving a long shelf life. Just remember that when they go to make a food that have a longer shelf life, the first things that they do is eliminate all bacteria. Bacteria is a process of digestion and movement and change. Bacteria is responsible for every function that happens on this planet. So, they have to completely destroy all life to give it that long shelf life. And a lot of these products you will buy in the store today, even junk whole foods, will live a hundred years on a shelf life. Think about that. What's it going to do in your body? If it has a shelf life on the shelf, it's going to be nothing in your body. It's going to be empty calories. Empty everything, no vitamins, nothing. And then they'll say, oh, we fortified it with vitamins. Well, wait a minute, if it's good food, why do you have to fortify it anyway? And with what do you fortify it? And if you look at the chemistry, they have this idea that they can form vitamins and enzymes and other nutrients, hormones and all that in a laboratory and they're the same as would be in food and the human body. And it isn't. Take for example, one of the most ridiculous insults in the world is vitamin E. 99% of the vitamin E out there is from Kodak and Fuji. Developing fluid. 

As developing fluid, they were spending a hundred million dollars, several hundred million dollars a year in burying this in vaults inside 55 to 100 gallon stainless steel drums. In vaults that were 12 feet in concrete thick. That toxic. So Fuji and Kodak for many years, especially Kodak had worked with scientists to find some way to make this into a biochemical that could degrade and decay. Couldn't find it. Finally a scientist said, hey, who used to work with others said, hey, this has 70% look like structure of vitamin E. Let's call a vitamin E and sell it as vitamin E. So that's what they do. When you go into a health food store and you buy a vitamin D, five units of every hundred will be from soy or from corn. Genetically modified. Corn or soy. That also has to be treated with a solvent. Let's say you wanted to produce an all-natural vitamin. You go to a laboratory and say, I want an all-natural vitamin D or vitamin E. Can you do it for me? And they say, oh yeah, sure, we can do that. Absolutely. They want the business. They're going to say yes. So all-natural means they have to find a natural solvent. And what's the natural solvent used by laboratories? Kerosene. Who in here would soak their food for 30 minutes in kerosene, rinse it off for one minute and eat it? How many people are going to realize that kerosene is going to eat its way deep into the tissue of that food? Realize it does deep into the tissue. Etches it away. So they use a kerosene to do that. So you've got the kerosene mixed with soy and corn. Now wait a minute. Are they growing this corn or soy? Because fat is only like 8% to 12% in a soybean. In corn, it's about 2%. How much corn is it going to make to get this vitamin E out of it? And out of that 2% corn, how much vitamin E is in it? 100 units? So if you got pure vitamin E from corn, you would be paying about $1,000 for one capsule. So what they do is they tell you all natural. They make it that way. It's the way I told you. But where do they get their soy and their corn? They go to Kellogg's. They go to some food manufacturer and take their waste. And they process it out of their waste. And it's been through every chemical process you can imagine when it comes from them. So it's full of deadly poisons. No vitamin, even natural, is without poisonous effect. Don't be duped into thinking that they're natural because they say natural. They're all highly toxic. The vitamin E, when it's natural, they will put five units of that that's still chemicalized from the soy or corn, GMO soy and corn. And then they'll put 95 units from Kodak and Fuji.

Now think about that. They have enough in their vaults for 30 more years to sell vitamin E on the market. In their vaults. And they're making hundreds of millions of dollars every year by selling you vitamin E. Think about that. What's vitamin D? Vitamin D in your milk and stuff like that. You know what that vitamin D is? Hydrogenated vegetable oils subjected to radioactive material. We've got people in congress to think because you take an oil and you subject it to radiation, it's the same as the sun making vitamin D on your skin with oil. These people are stupid. Or they're making profit. And they're both. I spent three months lobbying in congress and let me tell you, they're all idiots except for Ron Paul. Ron Paul is the only one that has any sense. He is one of the five senators who met with me directly and personally. And he wrote a raw milk bill for me. Right away he says, I'll make the bill, let's write it. And we wrote it together. And he's just again submitted another raw milk bill. So we could have it go across state lines. It's the only one that has any intelligence, even the Kennedys. They're all trapped and locked in the system. And it's a bad system, very bad system. They're not working for us, they're working for industry. So don't be fooled, all of those things are chemicals. The only food that you're ever going to get that is full of vitamins, enzymes and nutrients is raw food that is not GMO-ed and is not made with pesticides and herbicides and all the other chemical fertilizers. You know that they tried to outlaw in America using manure as fertilizer last year because of the E. coli? That's why they're bringing up all this E. coli crap to go outlaw using manure. So what's left? Dow and Monsanto's chemicals and General Electric and Gulf and Western. You're not going to be able to use natural products on your food anymore and you're just going to poison yourself more and more everyday. So the only way to get out of it is what I've done. I've made a contract. I've created an organization called Right to Choose Healthy Food. And I've contracted with farmers all over the United States that they only make food the way we want it. It's a club oriented, Right to Choose Healthy Food makes the contracts for their land and or their animals. And we own the animals. All the club members own the animals. So there's no commerce involved and government has authority only over commerce. Unless they can scare people into thinking that our raw food is creating disease. And they're working hard on that with this E. coli nonsense that they're spreading. But right now we're safe.

I just filed suit on the FDA three weeks ago for fraud, kidnapping, racketeering, arrest without warrant, making fraudulent documents, and two other things. Seven counts I have on them. So I'm waiting for their answer. And they've got another, what, three days to send their answer in. But anyway, it's kept them at bay. It's kept them off of us so far. But if they keep this E. coli nonsense, big epidemics and everything, they're going to get all these people around you thinking that you're creating disease. And they're going to go in, and they're going to seize your land, and they're going to seize your animals and slaughter them. And your neighbors are going to look at it and say, well, they had to. They were going to kill us. They were going to cause us disease, just the way Nazi Germany did. All the children are protecting everybody else by turning state's evidence on their parents because they have peculiar behavior that doesn't fit a certain form. So people have to go out and get involved in farms right now. Get some land and do it, even if you're off in the woods somewhere. And you can do it clandestinely. You need land to protect yourself. I've helped just about everybody on the diet in the United States, which is probably about 30,000 people that I know about. And all of them have access to these farms. You need to support farmers who will organically grow your food, and you get it directly from them. And the government has no issue in it because there's no commerce. They have to get the law, and that's what I'm trying to do is change the law. And I'm fighting them very hard on changing that law and getting away with it. I've stopped them through the 80s and 90s and the 2010s, and now we're into the teens. So it looks like they're really pushing very hard now, harder than I've ever seen them push before. So we've just got to be careful. So anyway, let's get way back to the human body. So the food moves through the sigmoid colon. Now the sigmoid colon is where the body will absorb a lot of the matter that the E. coli has broken down and needs to absorb it. So a lot of people will get dry fecal matter if they're on a low-fat diet. Even if you've been on a very low-fat diet for many, many years and you go to a high-fat diet, you're still going to have dry fecal matter for a long time because your cells have been starving for fat for decades.

So that isn't true constipation. True constipation is when you've got a block in the intestines and nothing's moving through. So to remedy that dryness in there, and fecal matter may come out so large that it rips your rectum if it's held up there for very long, the way to remedy that is to feed the E. coli and other colon bacteria directly. It gives them some fresh fat. So what I tell people to do is take 3 tablespoons each of butter, raw, no-salt butter, dairy cream, and coconut cream, and just a quarter of a teaspoon of honey. Put that in a 4-ounce jelly jar and you shake it. Then you immerse it in a bowl of hot water. You do this before you go to sleep at night or whenever your sleep period is, long sleep period. You put that in a bowl of hot water that makes your hand uncomfortable but does not burn it. You take a bulb syringe and you absorb that into the syringe. Then you insert it in your rectum and you get down on four legs and you bark like a dog. You stick that in there and then it's good. You stay on your knees. I'm not going to get on this table. I don't trust this table. But I'll do it here. Just get down on your knees. You can go into the back end or you can go through your legs and do it. But once you get it in your colon, go down like this. Your hands on your face on the floor and roll your belly like a belly dance. And it will move the creams and the fats into your descending colon. Then you lie on your right side. Get down again, folks. You lie on your right side, you lift your left leg up and you roll your belly like a belly dancer again. I'm good at doing that. I don't know why. I was a kid. It moves the fats over into the transverse colon and down into the ascending colon. The E. coli and the colon bacteria say, Oh my God, we've never had anything fresh in our whole lives. And they haven't. Because they get all of what's ever left. They get the dredges. And if you're on a raw diet and eating the perfect things all your life, the dredges are still just as good as anything else. But when you're eating a cooked, processed diet with lots of chemicals in it, you're destroying and damaging. And any good fats are going to be absorbed in the small intestines and the colon won't get any. So when you feed it, let me tell you, Oh, there's a calmness that comes over the body. Your brain works better. Everything works better. Plus, you won't have very hard movements that come out like granite and rip your rectum.

Now, I had so-called constipation ever since I can remember, probably two years old. And I used to only go to the restroom once every five to seven days. Literally, once every five to seven days. So when it came out, it would be as big as my fist. However, the size I was at that time, it would always be as big as my fist. So every time I had a bowel movement, it ripped my rectum and I bled. Of course, I didn't communicate that to my parents because I thought everybody had... That's what everybody did. I didn't know that blood was something that was awful or contaminated. I didn't have any taboos because I was autistic. I didn't miss... I didn't mislearn a lot of garbage that I could have mislearned. But I had this tear every time. I thought my brothers ached and they were just stronger than I was because I was called a wimp. And I thought, oh, they're just stronger than I am. They can handle all this pain. I didn't know that nobody had the pain that I had except for old people. And I was a child, an infant. So every time I had a bowel movement, this... And then when I went onto a raw diet, all of a sudden I had movements every day. Sometimes two, sometimes three. But the first out would be big and it would rip my rectum. By the time I was 20 years old, my rectum was an inch to an inch and a half thick all the way around the scar tissue. So there was no elasticity to it. Always bleed. Always bleed every time I had a movement. Then at 58 years old, I conjured a way to make a parasite. I'd try to eat parasites. I'd try to get parasites. Because I know they're the best janitors. And everybody who has parasites, if they let them... If they go on a raw diet with raw meat and raw dairy, they get well faster. So much faster. So I tried to get parasites galore. Eating them and everything. I figured out a way. I knew that tapeworms will help an intestinal tract tremendously. The only people to get tapeworms are third world people who are fed, processed, denatured cereals and milk powder. And that's mainly African countries. When you go give a donation to one of these companies that are going to go feed these children in Africa, you have to say, what do they feed them and where do they get the food? Who started these companies? And you will find that they started by trust from Kellogg's, General Foods, Purina. What do these companies do? They get all these donations and buy throwaway foods, damaged cereal containers, toxic substances that were so toxic it couldn't be sold in America, couldn't pass inspection.

They put these into the care packages for these third world countries and they give them the worst foods that they can give them. They just eat away, they're all carbohydrate and no other nutrients. So you have to be careful when you donate, very careful. There's one company that gives animals, farm animals, that's the place you should donate to. They're getting real food. Donate animals to the farmers, to the people to become farmers. Those are the people to donate to. Any of these others, it's a scam. And what they're doing, of course they go in and take over their countries because they get very sick and they're poverty stricken. I mean with the whole AIDS epidemic that was created in UCLA in 1961 and 62, if you didn't know that, AIDS was created in a laboratory at UCLA, so-called, according to the records, to study cancer in laboratory animals. Went right to the war department, military war department, to be used as bacterial warfare, to experiment with it. And what did they do? They put it in, they decided that they had to find an undesirable group. And the undesirable group they decided on was homosexuals. So they studied the homosexuals for a few years and found out in the 1960s and 70s and 80s, 1960s and early 70s, that homosexuals were doing a lot of drugs, causing a lot of liver damage, and causing a lot of hepatitis. Now hepatitis is a cleansing, it's not a disease. It is the cure for the disease of a toxic liver. So all the hepatitis, and I'll get into that later. So they decided, well we'll put it in the hepatitis B vaccine, because 90% of the people who are getting hepatitis B vaccines are homosexuals. 10% of the heterosexuals who are getting the hepatitis B vaccine, in those four cities where they put those particularly contaminated doses, 10% were heterosexuals. That was in New York City, Houston, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. Documented in the book, BioAttack Alert. It's in my bibliography in We Want to Live. So you can read all about it. The man who published that, he was a very intelligent attorney, got a senator from either Minnesota or Wisconsin behind him. They went to the War Department and started subpoenaing all these records, and they were dead three months later. Suicide. Many of them were suicided. Very ugly thing what they did was the British government and the United States government manufactured 125 million doses of smallpox vaccine with the chemical that causes AIDS in the smallpox vaccine.

So they donated it to African countries. So what was the result of that? AIDS galore. At least 75 million Africans got AIDS from having their smallpox vaccine. Everybody who got AIDS either had the smallpox vaccine or they got blood from somebody who had the smallpox vaccine. Also Leonard Horowitz talks about it. Ebola was the same kind of biological warfare created disease. He documents how he got that information. So what they did was the countries got the disease and then our Surgeon General went over there and representatives of the Surgeon General said we can treat AIDS. We'll help you out but you will owe us all this money. So with that AIDS fiasco the World Bank now runs 27 African countries through the World Bank. The World Bank for the United States government and the British government. That's how ugly, ugly, ugly some of these people are on this planet. And they are trying to control everything in the world. So you have to be careful about taking any kind of medication, get any injection because you don't have a clue what's happening. The scariest part is that I'm going to give you is that four years ago there was a meeting of all of the executives from all the board members to the CEOs of every Fortune 500 company by the CIA. And the CIA said, we're giving you all a license to kill. You all work for the CIA. If any of your employees get out of hand, anybody interferes with your companies, you have a license to kill. Think about that. You have a license to kill. That means if you don't like your boss and you do what I did, they can come and do what they did to me, injecting me with those chemicals. Which is OK, because I was interfering with the pharmaceutical industry. You may say, this is all conspiracy theories. But conspiracy theories are true. Think about it. Think about vaccines. Vaccines alone should give you a clue that there's a conspiracy. Why? Because nothing in it is safe. Everything's a poison, and yet they are drilling mothers and parents that they're poor parents if they don't vaccinate their children with poisons. It is a law in 13 states that there's no escape. And Dr. Sherry Tinpenny, an MD, who's against vaccines said, if you live in one of those states and you want to have a family, leave the state. Don't ever live in those states, because you have to poison your children.

Now, let's take a look at when that came about. In the 1960s, they were talking about overpopulation in government. Not overpopulation in government, but overpopulation of the population, government study. So they appointed Henry Kissinger to lead it. If you read his report, and you can look at it, overpopulation came out in 1964, 63 I think it was. It's called Report 200 something. And in it he said, the way that we can lower population is by putting contaminants in medication, especially injected, especially vaccines. It's right there. That report was acted on a year later by Congress saying, it is okay to do this. We can experiment on our own population in the United States. Canada agreed, their government officials agreed to do it with the American government. So there's your conspiracy. Don't throw it out. And the conspiracy goes all over the place now. They want to rule the world and control everything. So, you need to support your farmers, you need to get your own land, you need to start farms. If you want to be healthy, you will not be healthy in any other way. Like I said, do you have a question? One time I answered all questions that were asked. It was in New York City, and we didn't get out until 1.30 in the morning. Because when you ask me a specific question, I give you in-depth information on it that I know. And I've got volumes to give, so that won't work. So let's get back to the human body. I was experimenting with getting parasites. And I wanted to get a tapeworm to correct my intestinal problem. So I got maca root, and I thought, OK, it's a high-carbohydrate, it's a root, it's been dried, all I have to do is ferment it like milk, and I will probably create a tapeworm. Sure enough, I took the lid off it, I let it ferment for almost three weeks. Not thinking, I took the lid off of it, and then went to inhale to see how high it was fermented. It was so fermented that the alcohol burned my sinuses and gave me a headache. That's how high in alcohol it was. I said, this will work. So, instead of drinking half a cup, being frugal, half a cup at a time, I drank three cups at a time. So I was broken out in hives all over the place. I was rubbing with cold cucumbers and cold tomato slices, getting in a bath, a cold bath or a warm bath, with tomato juice blended in it and vinegar to settle all this poison that was coming out of my skin. The poison was coming out of my intestines, not from the fermented maca. And I was due to get on a plane for Vietnam two days later, really dumb.

So I get on the plane and I'm going into the toilet every hour with my cold slices of cucumber and tomato. Finally got to Vietnam, 16 hours later, got to the hotel, jumped in a bath with vinegar and tomatoes. There was a market right across the street so I took the tomatoes and crushed them up in the bathtub and got some coconut vinegar and poured it in there and soothed that.  This went on for days and all of a sudden I sat on the toilet, take a poop, and there was a little noodle floating around doing its movement. And I thought, got a tapeworm, I got the tapeworm. You know a tapeworm isn't one long worm, it's made up of these little noodles and it's a whole colony. And they only eat high carbohydrate stuff in animals that are not supposed to be eating carbohydrate. So it keeps you from poisoning yourself with carbohydrate and completely dissolving your intestinal tract with sugars. So that's why these third world kids that get this bad sugar and this milk powder and I don't know if any of you have studied the work by Dr. Francis Pottenger who did the work with cats with raw food and cooked foods and found that powdered milk created the worst diseases of any. And that's what they give to these third world kids as a care package. And in Asia, everywhere I go, all hospitals tell mothers to feed their babies powdered milk. That's the staple there, powdered milk, by the big boxes. And no baby is healthy there. I had one baby, I was trying to get a license, a government permit, to go visit one of the tribes in the Philippines. They wouldn't let me go. They said, oh, they're cannibals. Cannibals are down there, a couple of hundred miles, a thousand miles below. They're not here in the Philippines. Of course, I didn't argue with them. And they said, you can't do it. I said, listen, I won't take any pictures, I won't do anything. I just want to go there and just study how they eat and how they live. Just record it, it won't interfere. And they wouldn't let me do it. So I tried and tried to go to different levels. I got really frustrated. What they did was they also banned me from renting a car. So I couldn't go to various places.

Q: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: Anyway, I'm going off on a tangent. Let's get back to... I had the worm, the very long colony of worms, tapeworm, and I felt better. When I had the bowel movements, there was no dryness in the first coming out. I had a little bit of loose bowel. And after about, I guess it was six or seven days, I got this craving to eat an onion like an apple. Who eats onions like an apple? So I got an onion, ate a half of it, and then I couldn't take another bite. It was repulsive after that. But up until that, you know, for that whole half, it was delicious, just like an apple. Within about five hours, I had diarrhea. Out shot the tapeworm. So I thought, oh shit, worked all this time to get a parasite. All these years in here, I lose it because it came out with the onion odor. So if you ever need to get rid of a tape or a parasite, intestinal parasite, because it's too much for you, which it shouldn't be, just eat an onion by itself, if you can. So I pulled the tapeworm out of the toilet, and it was in this Vietnam hotel room. It's like $11 a day, wood floors, wood walls, wood everything. Everything was gorgeous, $11 a day. So I spread this tapeworm all along the floor, and they shrink and shrivel very quickly. So by the time I got finished, it was about 47 feet, so it was probably 50, 55 feet tapeworm. And it was probably a blob about like this. And I was upset. I was okay, you know, I felt better, still no, you know, hard fecal matter. And then after about 10 days later, it started getting hard again. But at the same time, I saw another little noodle floating in there. I said, ah, I didn't get rid of all of it, didn't evacuate all of it. I still have the tapeworm. So about six weeks later, I had a bowel movement, diarrhea, and now it came the tapeworm about the same size. I spread it along the floor again, but this was in Thailand at that point. And I spread it across the floor, measured it, it was about that long. But I have never had bleeding since. Never had bleeding again. I have a bowel movement now. Even if it's a little bit larger in the front, it's not like granite. And that's the way it was, it was like granite coming out of my body, just like rock. Scratchy. And never since. That's pretty incredible. A parasite helped. You have to understand the nature of parasites, we'll go over that later.

So, let's talk about the endocrine glands. Now, endocrine gland is a gland that produces hormones and puts them directly into the blood. Now, the pharmaceutical in the last 30 years is making an increasingly greater profit on this whole hormone nonsense. And you're lacking, you know, what better way to get somebody, especially a woman, to take a medication. Tell her she's going to lose her hair and it's going to cause her to gain weight. Thyroid medication. Oh, it's your thyroid. You know, take this thyroid medication and you'll lose the weight. Your hair's falling out. Oh, take thyroid medication and your hair will fall out. Oh, take it so you don't gain weight and so you don't lose your hair. That's the crap they give people. Men fall for it too. They don't want to be fat, they don't want to be bald. So that all these people are taking all of this nonsense about what hormones can do. So let's go over what hormones do. Human hormones, okay, and other animal hormones. Mammal, mammalian hormones. Start with pituitary. Now we know that it deals with growth. Any other thing that they talk about that pituitary does is nonsense. It regulates growth. Now when is that pituitary hormone active? When a small animal does not get its normal diet, its supply of protein. So for a human, that would be if they weren't getting meat or weren't getting milk, then the pituitary would secrete its hormone and allow for growth until that food was available. So it's for emergency purposes. Let's say there was a volcano or an earthquake or a fire, destroyed all the food around, drove the animals away. Except for the humans, what would the human eat? The human would be eating dirt and leaves until it could find some animals to eat. And during that factor, if the young ones didn't have a hormone to continue growth, they would become extinct. So all animals have a pituitary for growth in emergency situations. We have the pineal gland right at the seat of that. Most people say that that's the seat of consciousness, but I don't know anybody wise enough to prove it to me. So I don't know about that. Then we go down to the thyroid. Now this is a very interesting gland, the thyroid. What is so important that you have five backups for one gland?

You've got left and right, so you've got two thyroids, and you've got two parathyroids on each of those. You've got five backups for the thyroid gland. What in the body is so important? Your heartbeat and your lungs. Without breathing you don't live, without your heart beating you don't live. You can cut off your arms, you can do anything to the body, and if that heart and lung are there and functioning well, you're going to live. Thyroid handles the lungs and heart. Now, why is that so important? Well, it's very easy in a mobile body, that is pliable even though you've got ribs, to knock the wind out of somebody. My brother used to do it to me all the time. You know, you'd just serve a bam, right in the stomach, right in the diaphragm, lose my wind, pass out, because I stopped breathing. If you check the hormone level of an individual who's gone through that, like on a football field, that's where I did my analysis, I'd see somebody get hit by about six guys, go take their blood. Find the thyroxine levels sky high. Why? What happens? They've been knocked out of them, passes out because his lungs stopped, his heart stops. All of a sudden, why does he become conscious 30 seconds, 45 seconds, 2 minutes later? Why all of a sudden does his heart start beating again? Because the thyroxine level started again. Again, for emergency purposes. Say you were climbing up a tree to get some fruit or some animal, or got hit by an animal that attacked you, say a wild boar. Hunting a wild boar, you lost your balance and it smacked you in the lungs or the back. And you lost your wind. And your heart stopped beating and your lungs stopped. The thyroid is there to kick start it. Both the lungs and the heart. Again, emergency purposes. And we have the thymus. Well, the tonsils I should talk about. The tonsils do secrete right into the blood a little bit. But they protect the brain. The proof of protecting the brain and the nervous system in the tonsils. What would prove that? What happened in the 1950s? Tonsillitis. Tonsillitis didn't exist before late 1940s and also the 1950s. Still exists today. What happened in the mid-1940s? Canned foods. Canned foods with, we've got all kinds of metal in tin. We've got aluminum. We've got mercury. We've got cadmium. We've got lead. We have all of these in different amounts. And of course at different times the FDA will come out and say, Oh, that's too poisonous. 

Now you have to take out that metal or you have to reduce it to this limit. And it's never a safe limit. So you've got all these poisons in this tin. Now going into this food that's been highly processed with other preservative chemicals in it, that's highly acidic and is pulling the metals out of the cans. Getting into the throat and the tonsils, when you eat, absorb the poisons that are in that food to protect your brain. So all of that metal starts deteriorating the tonsils. Where else did it go? What else happened in the 50's? Polio. Metal went down into the spinal cord. Started deteriorating spinal tissue. Poliomyelitis is a virus of the spinal cord to break down damaged spinal tissue. And I'll get into what viruses are later. So we had two things that were created from the canned food industry. Now how did we get canned foods in? We created World War II. Conspiracy, without a doubt. If you look at the records. King and Queen of England owned 70% of all of the food processing in the world. Through trust they owned general foods. They owned Purina. They owned almost all of food production in the world except for the small little people. They incited World War II. They even financed through the Catholic Church and the Rockefellers. And there were two other families that were involved in creating World War II for monetary profit.

Q: Rothschild.

A: There were two other Swiss families, Swiss involved families, who were more influential in that war than the Rothschilds. Rothschilds were into medication heavily. These people were into food with the King and Queen of England family. So they created a war. They financed Hitler through different means to create a war to bring in rationing. And in the United States, all the commercials were, support your loved ones, your husband or your boyfriend overseas by eating canned foods, the same thing they are eating, rationed food. Why would they say anything that stupid if it weren't a conspiracy to sell a product? To control the population. You get the population sick and they are easy to control. Very simple. So, let's get back to the, so the thyroid, I mean the tonsils and the spinal damage epidemic was caused by that. Now what followed in the 1960s? And all of a sudden the tonsillitis went way down, but they are still ripping out tonsils today, just in case. But what happened? Plastics. Enrooted in the, what was that movie, The Graduate. In that one conversation they are talking about plastics. Plastics is a new thing. Well the king and queen of England knew that it was going to be linked, you know a lot of diseases were going to be linked to them, so they created a plastic that went inside cans. Now they didn't tell anybody about it, this was a secret process that went on in canned foods. After that, they would selectively take things like canned tuna, and they would plasticize the inside. Because canned tuna was one of the biggest contaminants of metal. It would pull the acidity of it, the way they processed them, would pull the metals out of the can and cause massive contamination. So any of those foods, tomato sauce or anything like that, those cans were treated with a plastic. Now everybody knows it. And what happened? There's a scientist that came out three years ago and said, wait a minute, they mimic female hormones. Men eat it, they turn into women. Women eat it, they turn into men. It's imbalancing all the systems. They were turning into frogs, they were experimenting with different animals. It was crossing the barriers so you couldn't distinguish males from females and they were becoming extinct. They could no longer reproduce from that plastic. And the BPA in it, the bisphenol phosphate, a deadly toxin.

Still in all of your packaged foods. They even plasticize cartons now. Do you think the EPA and the USDA, the HHS are doing anything about this? No. They're just saying, be careful to the industry, be careful, be better. And not enforcing anything and not doing anything about it. They're making money, they're getting kickbacks on it. I don't think anything can justify that kind of behavior. Or their lives and families are being threatened. And which I know has happened in one case with Dennis Kucinich. That's a whole story, I'm not going to go into that now. All poisoning is industrial, all disease is from industrial. We have the thymus. Now a lot of doctors say the thymus has control over the lungs and the heart. When you've got a lung and a heart problem, you find high thyroxine. You don't find thymus hormone secretions. When you have intestinal stomach problems, you find thymus secretions. So the thymus is there to protect digestion. This is right here, just below the lungs, of course, and the bronchioles. And it has nothing to do with the lungs and the bronchioles. Or the heart. It has to do with digestion. Now take a look at the thymus. It's the most white cell-bodied gland in the body. And what happens if you eat a cooked food? Leukocytosis. White blood cells leave your bloodstream and enter the digestive tract. Leukocytosis. Why does that happen? Because of all the poisons that are formed from cooking your food. White blood cells have to go in there and stop the damage. And you may lose a third to a half of those white blood cells in your digestive tract. Your bone marrow is where your body breeds red and white blood cells. Do you know how long it takes to build a colony of white blood cells and red blood cells? Do you know how many you produce in a day? Maybe six tablespoons. A day of each. In all the bone marrow of your body. And you're losing, you know, let's say 25% of that in the digestive tract. Why would you waste your nutrients, the strength of your body, your cleansing cells for your blood, red blood cells? Doing that doesn't make any sense. But that's what happens. So the thymus is full of these white blood cells or white fatty tissue that helps bind with poison. That, let's say you ate something that was highly toxic like a poison mushroom. And your thymus were in good shape. The thymus would secrete some of that fatty fluid into the stomach and surround that poison. And it would keep from damaging you. 

Now everybody's eating poisons all day long, every day. So what's the result? Massive amount of white blood cell loss. The body says, I can't handle it, we've got a poison, we've got to let the intestines be poisoned. Yet that's the crux of your nutrients. If you don't digest food, you don't get well. We know people can't thrive on medication. They can't even thrive on McDonald's. Does everybody see that supersized me? A guy lives on McDonald's and he gains 30 pounds, he gets very sick, he gets paranoid, he gets anxiety, he gets depressed by eating McDonald's. That's highly processed food. It has long shelf lives. They're poisons. So anyway, the thymus is there to help protect. If you're constantly eating poisons, the thymus isn't going to be able to help you. Again, that's an emergency situation. All of these glands are emergencies. Then we go down, we have the adrenal glands that sit on top of the kidneys. And everybody knows that's for fight or flight. The mother who sees her child going to get run over by the car lifts the front of the car up. And they found that the adrenaline, all it took was a pinprick of adrenaline, that much adrenaline, in the bloodstream to allow her to lift the car. So now all these, they're selling adrenaline now. You can take adrenaline. You're an athlete, you can shoot up adrenaline. It's natural. But it's the chemical adrenaline that they're making. So it's not really adrenaline. So then we have the gonads, and of course we know that's only one for emergency. That's for pure pleasure. Fine. It's for procreation, so what? You can survive, you can keep your race going. That's an emergency, right? So you take a look at all the glands. All the glands are mainly for emergency purposes. But the pharmaceutical industry is making a fortune telling you, oh, you've got to have this level. You've got to have this much thyroxine. T3, T4, T6. This is the level you should have. All of that measurement nonsense is about them making money. Your cholesterol level, forget it. Each person should have a different cholesterol level. Like I said, I've got that Hall of Champion basketball player who just turned 90. Al plays young kids. 672 cholesterol level averages. Never goes under 602. Never goes over 680 either. It stays right around 672. Think about that. They're saying that cholesterol should never be over 140, 170.

And then they make this distinction. Oh, well, we know cholesterol is important, so we've got the LDL and the HDL now. They always want to pull some chemistry bullshit on you to make you think they're smarter than you. And then you'll say, oh, really, I don't know anything about that, so I better take this medication. It is simple as that. Terrorist marketing. Think about that. So all those endocrine gland secretions, don't look at them in a test. Eat the right foods. You'll have the energy and take care of yourself. Now, I talked about the bone marrow. That's where red and white blood cells divide, multiplying, and they mature in the bone marrow. Once they're mature, that can take 40, 60 days per cell to enter the bloodstream. That's a long process. That's a very debilitating process. White blood cells just don't appear. Red blood cells just don't appear. They are bred. They grow. And you can destroy a massive amount of cells with an antibiotic. Not only bacteria, but whole cells in your body will be destroyed. Five days of an antibiotic will destroy 1% of the bacterial colonies in the body. And it doesn't discriminate. It will wipe out all of them. And you believe that bacteria is causing your problem. Oh, E. coli. Oh, Salmonella. Just look at Salmonella. There are 2,300 varieties of Salmonella. 1,300 to 1,600 lived on the outside of your body. You take a sample of your mucous in your nose, you are going to find about 600 varieties. On your rectum, you are going to find about 300 varieties. So you have more bacteria in your nose, Salmonella, than you do in your butt. Before we took baths every day, before we took baths every day, guess what lived on your skin? About 1,200 varieties of Salmonella ate the dead skin. Otherwise, you would pee like a snake. You would go through layers. But that Salmonella is on the skin to eat away. Now people take baths every day, they put chemicals on their skin every day, they kill everything. And they kill all the bacteria layers and layers and layers down. And they destroy the skin's ability to do what? Discard toxins to perspire properly. 90% of toxins are supposed to leave through the skin in perspiration, in evaporation. 90%! 10% go out the feces and urine. But nothing in the human body is supposed to be toxic. When an animal has defecation, creatures all over the planet eat that defecation. We eat the poop of parasites and bacteria and fungus in the intestinal tract.

If you move it out, there are other creatures there to eat it. What is it? It's food that we didn't completely digest. And it's there for other creatures to digest. Look at a dog. Dog says, oh, that's a good meal. Gobbles up the food. And you think, oh, [unintelligible]. Oh, my God! Awful! My dog is going to get diseased and have bad breath. That dog is going to be enriched with food that they don't normally get. And let me tell you, feeding dogs kibble and garbage is garbage. You're not feeding that dog. Why do you think dogs and domesticated animals end up with the vets? Animals in the wild don't get diseased unless they're poisoned. They don't get diseased. Take, for example, I have a friend who had five dogs. Head of MGM publicity, he was my publicity agent when I was an actor. And he had five dogs and one little pug. And I knew that pug since he got him at like six weeks old. And I had gone off on my bicycle, you know, touring and all that, and came back. And ran into him in 1980. And this little pug, which he got in about 1966, was blind, completely blind with cataracts, had multiple MS, multiple sclerosis, could not move. It was completely deaf, could barely breathe. He used to have to take it outside and rub its back in just so it could pee or poop. And he had to treat the dog... The dog was an invalid. And I said, Dory, all you have to do is let me feed that dog. Let me have the dog for two weeks. So he let me have the dog for two weeks. I mean, I had to go through hours talking him into it. And it wasn't just, yeah, okay. Because he loved his dogs and thought, I'm not going to let my dog die with you. I want to be there when my dog dies. And he loved his dogs. So I took this pug and I fed him with raw meat, raw eggs, and raw butter and honey. In six weeks, that dog was jumping up and down off the couch, going out the doggie door, could see to an extent, could hear to an extent. It completely reversed the dog's condition at 14 and a half years old and was ready to die. When animals get sick on eating, this was the science diet. He fed all of his dogs the science diet. And his big English Mastiff, who was 240 pounds, was getting kidney stones and having to have them removed every six to eight weeks on the science diet. And the vet kept saying, oh no, it's not the science diet. The science diet is perfect. Well, after five years of eating the science diet, don't you think it would have been okay for the dog not to have stones?

People get stones on my diet, but they don't get it from the diet. They get it from the old toxic minerals that have collected in their bodies and they magnetize together when the body starts cleaning. You can observe that when you look at the stone and its makeup and breakdown. It's not from a fresh food. They're cauterized minerals. If you're eating raw foods, you're not going to be putting cauterized minerals in the body. They come out of the body from when you ate cooked foods. So this science diet, you could say, well, it was his previous eating, but after six years on a dog eating science diet, it should have cleared. Because dogs replace cells much faster. A dog matures in two years. It takes us 21 years to do what they do in two. So five years for a dog is like, you know, about 40 years of life. And it takes the human body 40 years to replace every cell in the body five times. And according to the work of Pottenger and Howell with animals, it took five generations of animals to go from disease to optimal health. Five generations. Well, for us, that's almost 40 years. Seven and a half years to replace every cell in the body up to the bones, and then five times that, you're looking at 38 years. So 40 years to clean the whole body, to a point where everything that animal, everything that we ate, has been removed out of the system, and there's no giving it to the next generation cell. There's a lot of times when a mother will have had a vaccine, and she's got the chemicals flowing in the body, and then she has a baby, and during gestation, some of that gets moved into the baby. So that's what happens in generations. It takes many generations to go to the point of getting rid of all that, if you're on a perfect diet. For a dog and a cat, that should be five years. So after five years on the science diet, this dog, this English Mastiff, was still having kidney stones, every eight weeks getting a surgery, or eight to ten weeks getting surgery. This poor pug, at 14 and a half, was blind and crippled. And deaf. On the science diet. You have to keep in mind, these people have nothing but intellectual bullshit chemistry to convince you, you don't know anything. The vet knows better, the doctor knows better, the professor knows better. None of them know garbage.

They're gone, they go through, like I said earlier, they go through this training in a college without any kind of apprenticeship. When a doctor has this apprenticeship, where is it? It's an emergency ward. What are you going to learn there? Panic. Everything's panic. Everybody's coming in in a really drastic state. So everything's extreme. So they learn to think the worst of everything. So when they give you a prognosis, it's a dire one. Really bad. And then you get paranoid. Oh, I better listen to what he says. And he says, take this chemistry, this chemistry, this chemistry, and this chemical. And what are you? You've been terrorized to being a laboratory animal, taking chemistry instead of food. Okay, so we have the nervous system. We have three fluid systems in the body. We have the blood. And what does the blood contain? Red and white blood cells and fluid. It feeds the red and white blood cells. Now what do the red and white blood cells do? They do three things. The red cells do one thing. The red cells carry oxygen to the body the body so the body can have energy. Oxidizing fats alters the fat into an energy substance, chemical and electromagnetic energy. We don't burn anything. You may have some carbon that remains but we don't burn anything. You burn your energy, you burn your fats, you don't burn anything, you alter it. It's like we don't burn our food, we digest it. We eat it, we digest it. But some people say you burn your food, didn't you? No. Burning has nothing to do with anything. That's to get you to accept that cooking is good, that putting fire to things is good. Again, it's a psychological conspiracy. Truly, it is. And the King and Queen of England are the biggest ones to do that. They control what books go into your schools, what people learn. And it's all academia that backs it up. People who are not wise. So I need to take a sip of this. I'm getting a little dry now. I suck. I suck. Why do I suck? Same reason a baby sucks. When they suck, they draw all this saliva into it. What's the saliva full of? Bacteria. Pre-digest. So sucking is good. I say suck all your fluid. Don't drink it. Suck it. Always digest it better. The blood stream, the red cells carry oxygen so that the body has energy. Cells will have energy. Now listen to that. Oxidizes fat. Fat is what your body utilizes as fuel. When your body uses a carbohydrate, that carbohydrate has first been altered into an acetate or an acetone, a fatty substance.

That's a very complex process and the fat that is made into an acetone or an acetate by a carbohydrate or a protein is very weak. Fat, pure fat made from fat substances has two and a half times more energy, produces two and a half times more energy than a carbohydrate or a protein. Think about that. You ever seen a skinny weight lifter? Ever seen a skinny wrestler? Your energy, the most energy comes from fat. Strength and energy and stamina. Fat is the most important. So, the red blood cells deliver oxygen. The white blood cells take carbon dioxide out of the body and release it into the lungs. What are white blood cells? White blood cells are 60-80% fat. They're white with fat. White blood cells. What else do they do? Any dead red blood cells, any dead white blood cells, the white blood cells eat. They're called phagocytes because they eat decaying organic red blood cells or white blood cells to keep the blood clean. So, if they eat it, they consume it, their waste goes into the kidneys and discards out the body. Or there's bacteria that additionally are in the blood. But the blood is relatively, the blood serum is relatively sterile. Not a lot of bacterial activity like there is in everything else in the body. Bacterial nature of red blood cells and white blood cells is very high, but the serum is low. It is really not sterile, but the medical profession loves to use the word sterile and get you to believe that part of your body is truly sterile and it is not. Because they say sterile is safe and clean. So, not a good concept. So that is the whole process. The red and white blood cells are to maintain an energy level for the body. Purely that. Then we have the neurological fluid. It runs the nervous system and brain, transmits light and conducts electricity for communication. Now, when you say conducts electricity, transmits light, what does it take to do that? Metallic minerals. This is where metals become beneficial to the body, but in trace amounts, except during development and growth. So, what do we have? If you are eating cooked foods, what happens to the nutrients in cooked foods? You fractionate everything. There are no couplings, unless they're toxic couplings. You've taken mercury in a substance, theobromine, caffeine. You've taken all those chemicals and you've separated them and made them into free radicals. Free radicals is a substance that cannot be controlled, that has no controls. When you eat food, all the controls are there. You don't need any more controls. It is already in a perfect form, developed for millions and millions of years. 

So, we take it in our systems and the pancreas is the architect of the body and it says, oh, we've got this amount of nutrients coming in with this food. We have to redesign it to make it into this human body and utilize it for whatever we need. So, the pancreas is responsible for that. Now, the pancreas doesn't have anything to do with sugars, except in emergency situations. We are not fruit eaters. We are not frugivores. We are not grain eaters. We are not nut eaters. We don't digest those foods properly. We are animal tissue eaters. So, what happens? If you eat those foods, you don't digest properly. It complicates the system. I've been going an hour and forty-five minutes. I'll pick this up. I'll leave you in a cliffhanger. Okay, so let's take twelve minutes. So, you'll be back at twenty-six, twenty-seven after this.

[break]

A: Anyway, the red blood cells, excuse me, the nervous system has metals in it, but in small trace amounts, they're beneficial. In large amounts, they are not. Then we have the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is a web network just like the blood and the neurological system, only more complex. It has nodes, which can be anywhere from the size of a tiny seed to the size of a pea. The lymph glands can be from the size of a bean up to the size of a golf ball. What they do, the lymph system is responsible for cleaning every part of the body, all the waste out of the body, sometimes even the blood stream, but every other part of the system completely and wholly, even the skin. The lymph system is responsible for cleaning waste from there and discarding it. Now when the lymph system dumps its waste, it dumps it into the connective tissue, between the skin and the muscles and even in the muscle tissue. So what happens is, people will get a lot of waste products under there if the skin is not working. Remember I talked about the skin not working, people not discarding their fluids, they'll build it up. Now in men, this should be very tight over the muscle, shouldn't be much there. In women, it should be about double this. If it's any more than that, your waste are not dumping from your connective tissue and you're going to move toward lupus or MS eventually or you're just going to get larger and larger and larger and larger as you get older. Your lymph system has to dump the waste. We'll just take you as an example. Okay, relax your arm. You see this waste? It's three times what it should be in a woman. Three times what it should be. She needs to take hot baths. All of you need to take hot baths and get rid of it. Why is it clogged? Because the lymphatic system which is 60-80% fat is given vegetable oils. Vegetable oils causes all the hardening of the arteries and heart and MS and everything else in the body, not animal fats. Just remember and think about this always, whatever you hear coming from the medical profession, from the media, from the medical profession, from the health department, from the medical profession, it's all from the pharmaceutical industry in conjunction with the medical profession, that everything they say, you figure out what the opposite is and you'll be doing right. You do just the opposite of what they say.

Q: Vegetable oils are referring to cooked vegetable oils, not raw vegetable oils.

A: No, even raw. You have to understand, in a vegetarian animal, in a herbivore, they have the anaerobic bacteria to break down vegetable oils and keep them thin at their body temperature. Their body temperature is 101 to 105 degrees. Ours is 98.6 and lower. So, vegetable oils, if they're part of the cell, start crystallizing, dehydrating and crystallizing, causing hardening of the tissue. In an herbivore, it won't happen. They'll stay fluid. So, in us, it hardens, even if not cooked. But then, you take all the fats out there, hydrogenated, margarine, all those trans fatty acids, plastic. That's how you make plastic. You hydrogenate oils, whether mineral oils, you know, crude oil or vegetable oil. You make them into a trans fatty acid, a plastic. So, everybody's full of plastic fats in their lymphatic system and they don't move. You cannot get them out of the body without getting the body up to a temperature of 103 to 110 degrees. So, I tell people, you want to get well, you take a bath every day, 40 minutes. Two days a week, 90 minutes. If you're retired, take a 90 minute bath every day, 7 days a week. You need to melt that stuff out of the body or you're not going to clean the body. You're just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger or you're going to create what's called the death circle in the iris, and that means your lymph system isn't working, your body isn't functioning, and therefore all the waste is going to collect, even if you start pressing and all that stuff, even though you don't gain weight, it's going to contaminate the whole body and you die. You could die of MS, you could die of lupus, you could die of heart attack, you could die of any kind of disease. Any kind of disease is created by the collection of these things. The collection of these poisons that you're supposed to be discarding. Now the lymphatic system, what it is connected with is the lacteal system in the intestines. Now the lacteal system is the web network coming off of the intestines, both small and large, that absorbs all of the digested matter in the intestines, which is the fecal, urine, and sweat waste of bacteria. It is all milky, it's called the lacteal system because it looks like milk, lactate. And then when the lymph system takes it from the lacteal system, it further breaks it down with different types of bacteria into a translucent milky substance.

And then the lymph system is supposed to feed every cell in the body. But it isn't happening because the lymph system is blocked everywhere in most people, even in the skin. So what happens is the lymph system stops feeding the body in most people. Other animals that are wild, the lymph system feeds the body and cleanses it, cleanses that waste. What we have done is we've taken our blood stream and used that to feed cells in the body. We put all this lymph into the blood to feed cells. And the blood is there to create energy. So if it's doing another job that it's not supposed to do, how much energy is it going to take from you? 50%? 80%? Look, you know, 150 years ago, nobody needed coffee to go unless they were intellectually living in London or Paris or someplace like that and were eating the junk foods of the time. They weren't highly processed with chemicals except for formaldehyde. They put formaldehyde in milk and a lot of foods as a preservative. And people were poisoning themselves with formaldehyde. So they needed coffee, they needed cigarettes to give them the energy. But out on the farms, they couldn't afford sugar, they couldn't afford coffee. The food's off their farm, they eat the animals, they have strength. And I mean, when I was a kid on my grandparents' farm in the 40s and 50s, they used to take bales of hay that were 30 to 60 pounds and throw them up into a 12-foot loft. Now you go on a farm, everybody's so freaking weak, they've got a forklift doing it because they can't even lift a 30-pound bale of hay without getting a backache. You have to take a look at where we are. So when the bloodstream is feeding the body when it's only supposed to be delivering oxygen and removing carbon dioxide, look at what we're giving up. The amount of energy and strength that we are giving up. Trading to eat plastic fat, margarine, oh it looks like butter. It doesn't taste like butter in any remote sense, especially if it's raw unsalted butter. So you've got to melt that out of the body. I press people now, I emphasize it, hot baths are necessary for you to recover. Normally like I said it takes 40 years to clean everything out of the body in reverse. Well let me tell you, I have seen people move 2 to 3 times, even 5 times faster by doing the baths every day. Especially if you're doing it in a hot tub where the temperature is constant.

Q: What's the temperature?

A: I suggest people do it between 103 and 108 degrees. 105 is good.

Q: That's a hot one.

A: No, if you go into a gym they usually put 108, 109. Now I have one elderly man who came to me at about 68 years old. He came in his 60's and he was a couch potato. He had retired, very wealthy, but couldn't do anything but eat and sleep and watch TV. No energy. Came to me when he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, failed thyroid, and he was given like 8 medications. He was standing in the line at the drug store, standing in the pharmaceutical line to pick up his prescriptions. He got this very bad feeling, so he went home and he just wanted to think about it. He wasn't going to just go from the doctor's office and buy the medication. A young architect friend of his, he was like 33 years old, called him and he said, God, isn't this diet great? He said, what are you talking about, diet? He said, well, you sent me that book, We Want to Live for Christmas. He said, I didn't send you any. He said, yeah, you sent me an architect book and that book. He said, I made a mistake. I was only supposed to send you the architect book. You weren't supposed to get that diet book. What's it all about? He said, well, I've been on it for three months. And man, my whole life has changed. My sexuality is back, everything. When you lose your sexuality at 32 years old, you've got some problems. So he's got everything back. He functions, he digests, everything's easy now. He doesn't have all the problems he had. He said, well, send me the book. He says, no, you sent this to me. Send me your own. I've got it all marked up for me. So he went out and bought the book. And it changed his life. So he came to me for a consult. And I said, you need to do the hot baths, you've got the death circle. And it's 50% developed. And I don't like to scare people, but when they need to be frightened, I will. Just tell them the fact. I won't say, oh, you're going to die tomorrow. I said, you've got a death circle, that means your lymph system isn't working. You can't clean the body, you're going to die sooner than later. That's what I told him. So he started doing the baths. And he lives in Bangkok. So he got a hot tub. And I told him a hot tub was the best. And I said, follow the directions in the book for lymphatic baths. So he calls three months later. And he said, I still have no energy. I'm taking the hot baths every day.

And I said, how long? And he said, 90 minutes. And I said, wait a minute. Two days a week, 90 minutes. 40, 45 minutes the other days. So I've been doing it 90 minutes a day. And I said, and what temperature? He said, 110. And I said, 110? I say to be safe in the book, 101. He says, no, it's 110. So I pulled out the book. There was a typo. It's 110. And I said, stop the baths. Take a break. Take a six-week, seven-week break. Don't do any baths. His body had moved so much. It's 110 degrees, 90 minutes a day. Completely cleaned his system. He had so much energy. He now works 16 hours a day. He's 76 years old, 77 years old this year. And he works 14 to 18 hours a day. He can work right alongside of me all night, all day long. I only sleep three and a half, four hours. He still sleeps six to seven. And we're just charged. Because he got his system moving. And he did it in three months of doing a 90-minute bath a day at 110 degrees. Most people couldn't take that. That's too hot. But he was able to take it. And it makes a huge difference. I mean, a huge difference for everybody. I had a woman who was crippled. It came to me in Chicago a few days ago. And when she came to me three years ago, this knee was this big. This elbow was huge. Plus a hardball-sized growth there that was completely mineralization. Extra bone. And she was pretty crippled. Her hands were like this, swollen. Some of the joints were huge. And her feet were locked. She was in a wheelchair. And even, you know, her movement in her head was very sore and painful. And this is only three years on the diet. I stressed to her. I said, listen, you've got to do the baths. Because her husband would have to take her in and out of the bath because she couldn't get in and out herself. So I stressed to him. It had to be done. Guess what? She's walking and standing for seven minutes at a time. The doctors and the physical therapists say, if we didn't see her, we wouldn't believe it, you know. So the baths are so important to move everything quickly. So I can't stress it enough. If you can't clean the waste out of the body, I don't care how many detoxification diets you do, whatever it is, eating lots of fruit, how is it going to get out of the body if you can't move it?

Q: We put so much stuff in the water, is there something we can put in?

A: Yeah, in the recipe book. I mean in We want to live back there where it says, put milk, sea salt, and vinegar, you know, in the water. And it tells you the quantities to put. I also put like two tablespoons of coconut cream, and it floats on the top when I get out. It just like coats me with a nice little layer of fat cream. So it's very nice. So I can't stress that enough. The amount of movement and getting people to do it this year has been astounding. So I figure it would take that woman six or seven years. In three years, she's walking seven minutes. I mean walking. She went back to playing cards at her friends, and she hadn't played cards with them in three years. Back to playing cards, and they don't believe it. And they call her and say, I'm eating the raw meat diet, I'm feeling better. Eating all this raw dairy. And they say, oh that's bad, don't you know? Cholesterol's bad. Raw meat's bad. Raw dairy is really bad. And here are people getting well. So it's nonsense. So the lymphatic system cleans everything. Absolutely everything. And if it doesn't move, you're not going to get well. Period. Take forever. It's like standing still. You hear those guys that say a trampoline, you get on those mini trampolines, and you get the lymphatic system moving?

Q: Yeah.

A: How the hell is that going to happen if it's hard? You can get on there and get your blood flowing, because your blood's fluid. But if your lymphatic system is plastic-hardened, it's like, OK, I'm going to get a cold stick of butter to move by jumping up and down on a trampoline. It's not going to move, is it? It's not fluid. You can jump all day, and as long as that butter is cold, it's not going to move. This is another way I can give you an example of how the lymphatic system works with the heat. Got a cold stick of butter in the center of a two-cup jar. Sealed. You've got 105 to 108 degrees temperature outside that glass. Now, when that glass heats up and the air around the stick of butter gets warm, how long is that going to take? Forty minutes. Before that butter will even start to melt. Because it's cold, and remember, we have an air conditioner. We can, for example, you're in hot water, and you stay still. All of a sudden you don't feel the hot water, but then you move around, and all of a sudden that hot water gets hot again. That's because you've cooled the water, and that's space. So the butter is going to be cooling that air space from the inside out, and the heat from the outside, which is only 108 degrees, is going to be slightly, barely heating that on the inside. So it's going to take 40 minutes minimum for that to start moving, for that lymph to start becoming liquid to move. Then if you want to get deep to the glands, that's just under the skin, the surface area. When you want to get to the glands and nodes and the major circulatory of the lymphatic system, you're going to have to stay in there for 90 minutes. Now a lot of people get in there and say, I can't take this, I can't take this. The brain hates to be hot, the brain hates to be cold. So what you can do is get one of those cold ice packs, you know, that you put on like a Yarmulke, you know, and put it up there. And what you do is you sit in the hot tub and you've got the cold on your head. And the brain doesn't like to be cold, so the body says, I want to stay in here. I want to stay in. If it gets too cold, then put a pad on top or something so it doesn't get too cold. And you want the brain to heat up a little bit once in a while, so you take it off. And when you start feeling overheated and you feel like getting out, it isn't time yet, put the ice pack back on top of your head. That will keep you in the water for as long as it takes. And everybody who does all of those things gets better so much faster.

This year has been astounding with the progress, what I thought some people forever to accomplish. It's really working. So I can't stress that enough. Now there's a few organs that we haven't talked about. We talked about the liver producing the bile. Now the liver doesn't dump its bile directly in, it sends it to the gallbladder. The gallbladder does not produce anything. It's a reservoir for bile. We have enough bile in the gallbladder to digest about 30 pounds of fat. Who the hell needs to digest 30 pounds of fat in 24 hours or 48 hours? When we used to hunt, we'd have a kill, we'd eat all the fat. American Indians ate all the fat first because every creature on the planet is going to come and get that fat. So you have to eat it first. And if you ate all that fat without having a lot of reserved bile, what would happen? You'd have diarrhea and vomit. All that fat would be just passing through you. So you have to have the bile. So that's why we have the reservoir of a gallbladder to store all that fat. If your gallbladder is removed, you're going to have to be a person without ice cream, even if it's raw ice cream, you're not going to have a problem. You're going to have diarrhea, you're going to have nausea, you're going to have problems. The liver produces enough bile every hour to digest about two tablespoons of fat. If you have a good liver. If you don't have a good liver, most people don't, maybe you produce two teaspoons of bile, I mean enough to digest two teaspoons of fat, or one teaspoon of fat every hour. So you have to do it methodically if you have no gallbladder. You can't eat a lot of fat at one time. It will not be good for you. Then we have the spleen. We talked about the pancreas a little bit. Now the pancreas and the pharmaceutical industry talks about, well you've got to have insulin to handle those blood sugars. There are many other hormones and activities cellularly that can handle insulin-like production, insulin-like substances. So you have to rely upon the pancreas. 85% of the people who come to me who are diagnosed as diabetics are not even diabetics. They went for a test, a blood sugar glucose tolerance test, failed it once or twice, two days in a row, because the pancreas just was in a slump at the time, was detoxifying.

So they put them on insulin for the rest of their lives. It was just a temporary thing and they weren't having that many symptoms except for a lot of urination and tiredness. If you have the problem of getting out of bed because you absolutely have no energy and you can't think straight, you've got diabetes. Those are the true signs of diabetes and the only signs of diabetes. A blood sugar level has nothing to do with the pancreas. It has to do with the way you eat. But the pharmaceutical industry hooks everybody in. Oh, you need insulin if your sugar level goes above 120. Oh, it gets up to 130. Take five more units. Keep shooting up with their insulin. So what happens on every diabetic, they may make from $1,300 to $1,800 a month off of every diabetic. That's a ton of money when you figure we already have 58 million diabetics in this country, so-called diagnosed diabetics who take insulin. Think about that. That's a lot of money every year. They don't want to let it go. That pancreas... Everybody know who Lucy is? Lucy was the oldest Homo sapien remains that we found in archaeological diggings. Her pancreas was 2 1⁄2 times smaller than ours, proportionally. Of course, she was a little person about this big, even though she was like 30-some years old. But her pancreas, you know, was about 2 1⁄2 times smaller than ours based on her size to our size, comparatively. And she only ate raw meats. That's all she ate. Like the Eskimos, that's all they do is eat raw meat. Raw meat, raw meat, raw meat. And all the tribes on the planet who ate raw meat and raw dairy are the happiest, healthiest, strongest tribes on Earth. Now it's changed. They had 11 years of drought in the Maasai tribe, so now they're accepting care packages. And guess what the care packages are? Garbage, cereal, and powdered milk. They're going to be extinct in another 10, 20 years. Keeps up. So the spleen, which is right next to the pancreas, the spleen does not produce anything. It holds red blood cells. Now why would we need two pints, two and a half pints more of red blood cells? Because what happens if you get cold? You need to have a lot of extra red blood cells in the blood to warm the system, or else you'll freeze to death even at mildly cold temperatures. What happens if you get hot? The spleen will draw out red blood cells and thin the blood. The kidney works with the spleen.

Every time you get cold, what happens? You pee a lot because the body wants to discard the fluids. To prevent from becoming anaemic, the kidney produces the ammonia to separate the red and white blood cells. The ammonia is like a detractor. The red and white blood cells cannot enter the kidney when the ammonia is there. It's like a repellent. The red and white blood cells don't get anaemic every time we take a pee. That's a good thing. Then we have the bladder. What is the bladder? Also with the spleen, let's say you're in an accident and you lose 2 cups of blood, 3 cups of blood, 4 cups of blood. As soon as the body has clotted, the tear or the cut, the spleen will dump the red blood cells back into the bloodstream. Let's say you were a caveman and you fell out of a tree and a brand cut your jugular vein and you lost 2 pints of blood. Basically you'd be dinner for the nearest animal that was around. As soon as the blood clot happens and it stops, the spleen dumps the 3 cups of red blood cells back into the bloodstream and you're no longer anaemic. You'll be a little weaker and you have 90 days to rebuild all the blood cells to replace those in the spleen, and you're no longer anaemic and you're not likely to be dinner for some cat or some animal. So the body is designed brilliantly, and when the doctors tell you your body is diseased because of the faults of the body, it is completely wrong. Completely wrong. The body is absolutely miraculous. I have my, everybody knows that you can grow back limbs and stuff. I have my photographs of it, I can break it out and show you, maybe I'll do it the next break to get presented. But I've got this woman who was in her 50s, cut off her finger, including the bone, about this much of the finger. She grew it back. How? I told her to put lime juice on it first, honey, coconut cream, and raw meat over that as a bandage, and it grew back. I've got the photographs to prove it. I've had people who were burned, third, fourth degree burns. I was in a motorcycle accident, took all the skin off of my leg, my shoulder, my arm, took off part of the bones here, took off part of this bone. This is the only scar I have left because I didn't keep up the treatment of coconut cream, honey, and meat on it. I wanted to see how it would heal without all of that. I took part of the elbow off, took part of the ankle bone off, because I had a 350-pound Harley motorcycle carrying me along the pavement. I was wearing shorts and sandals and a T-shirt.

I took lime juice, put it on there. I've got asphalt all over in the stuff. I know that when you use lime juice, lime juice surrounds foreign properties. And your body won't have to use white blood cells to remove them from the system. So you don't have the infection, the pussy infection. You don't lose all those white blood cells. So then I took, after I screamed a lot while I was putting all the lime juice on, then I put honey on. I screamed a lot with that. I'd bite into a towel and scream. And then put coconut cream on top of that to keep enough moisture in there so there would be no scabs underneath the meat. And then meat as my skin, act as my skin. Very thin slabs of meat. And then I put a piece of plastic over that so the meat would not dry out. And I wrapped it with ace bandages all over my legs and everywhere. And in 12 days my skin was completely replaced.

Q: How often did you change the bandage?

A: About every three days. I let it stink terribly before I did it all. Really foul. And of course I also got in the bath several times a day to relieve the pain and to make sure I was moving toxins out of the body quickly. But I wouldn't change the bandage. Because I had enough of the stuff in there and put the plastic on and coat it where it wasn't getting much moisture underneath there.

Q: Was it beef?

A: Yeah, beef. I used beef. So it healed. I mean the skin completely sealed and healed in 12 days. I did go to the hospital because I shattered the knee and it looked like it was dislocated. I ripped the tendons from this one up here and this one down here. Or was it the other way? This one down here and this one up here, one or the other. And they were in a ball and the knee was really swollen. And the pain was in Thailand and the pain was really bad and it wasn't getting any better. I took a taxi back to the hotel and a Thai nurse went with me and she just did everything I said. I speak enough Thai to get by. After I was at the hotel for two hours, I decided I've got to go have somebody reset the knee because it's out of place. I'm having too much pain. It was like 10.30 at night so there were no chiropractors open. So I went to the hospital. I said call a taxi. They called the emergency. They got a life squad vehicle there, a paramedic. They had four attendants and one driver. They came out with this wooden gurney that folds up into a chair, very modern and all that. $18 it cost. Here, $3,000, $6,000 to take a trip like that. So I get to the hospital and I said to the intern, I said, I had a motorcycle accident. I didn't have any bandages on at that point. I just had open wounds. And we're talking muscle showing, bone showing, bone shaved off. And he's looking at me and he said, okay, we've got to get you into the emergency room and surgery right away. I said, no, no, no, no, no. I'm here to have you put my leg back in place because it is an excruciating pain. He looked at the knee and he said, I'm not touching you. He said, you have to have x-rays. You're going to have to have a special surgeon here. So he got on the phone and called the osteosurgeon, got him out of bed into the hospital emergency. The nurses wanted to come over and clean the wounds and everything. I wouldn't let them touch a thing. And they're looking at the asphalt in it. I did have butter and honey at that point, so it wasn't bleeding much. It was seeping a little bit of blood. But all this open wound and no bleeding and they couldn't believe it. So the osteosurgeon gets there and I said, listen, I know I look a mess. Don't worry about that. I just need you to reset my knee because it's dislocated.

And he took one look at it and said, I'm not touching it without x-rays. And I said, okay. You get two x-rays. One at this angle, it has to be high enough. When you get high enough on the leg, down to the ankle. And the other one the other way with as much space on the other side. And I set the dial on the x-ray to the lowest. So I let them take two x-rays. The femur joint here where it goes over to the tibia, the tibia here. It had broken off the top of the tibia. So I had all these fragments from the tibia up in the femur joint. And the tibia was split in two all the way down to the ankle. And the bone was open like this. So they wanted to cut everything from here down to the ankle. Open up all the muscles and everything. Pin the bone together with six to ten pins. Scrape out the knee joint. And put me back together. Well, I've seen other Thais who've gone through that. And other people who've gone through that kind of leg surgery. One leg's two inches shorter than the other. So they cleaned all that cartilage out of the joint. And all their, you know, a third of their muscle's gone in their calf and their thigh. You know, they're like this for the rest of their lives. I said, no, no, no, I'm on a special diet. And he goes, literally. I said, you think I'm spastic? And I said, listen. I said, if I can't walk. But the knee was in place. It was those fragments that were... He said, if you don't get those fragments out, you're never going to walk again. I said, you mean I'll never dance? He said, no, you'll never walk again. So I was playing with him. And he didn't like that either. Because he didn't think I was in a funny situation. And I was in enough pain, but I was starting to ease it the longer I was there. So I didn't get out until one o'clock in the morning. And when I saw that there was no, that the femur and tibia were properly together, that there were fragments in there, I said, I'm going home. So I went home. I went back to the hotel. And then my girlfriend came and stayed with me. And she made my foods every day and took care of me. And the nurse, I hired her to stay with me. So both of them stayed with me for 24 hours a day for two weeks. And then when all that skin healed after 12 days, I let the nurse go. Because I knew she would be better with wounds, especially the way I handled it. And getting me in and out of the bath wasn't easy. Because this leg was in excruciating pain.

I got the owner of the hotel to shut off the chlorination into the pool for five days. So I would get into the pool. I would go down in a wheelchair and then get on my crutches, get into the pool. And then I would stay in the deeper end and just move my legs back and forth, walk around the deep end so that my leg would have movement, get exercise. So it wouldn't atrophy. And then after six days, she said, no, no, no. Because the pool started getting full of algae, really green. So then I went across the street to the ocean. So then I did it in the ocean for the next six weeks. So then I was running in six weeks without crutches. So you do not have to go to a doctor. The limbs will grow back. Things will grow back. You just have to treat it properly if you know how to do it. So let's see, did I leave out any part of the body? No, that's pretty much it. You know, the bones, we have bones so that we can not be worms on the floor. We can do flips and back flips and lift things and stuff like that. It gives us leverage so we can be very mobile. So it's basically the human body. Now we're going to get into foods. I always like to start with the most important factor and that is fat. The lymph system and the neurological systems are 60-80% fat. Your brain is 60-80% fat. You're all fat heads. If you're not a fat head, I feel sorry for you. So fat, what does it do? It gives us the greatest energy that we can have, the stamina. It binds with toxins. It dissolves toxins. The body, the lymphatic system makes solvents with it. Cells make solvents with it that are called virus. It also lubricates the body. So you've got fats that do three things. And there are 60 varieties of cholesterols. 20 do each thing. You need a massive amount of cholesterols to handle our polluted society. That basketball player, he needs 672. Almost all the time in his blood. When I was very sickly, I was 370 to 390. Now I'm down to 205. Sometimes it will even go down to 197. Still high for the medical profession. But I'm in great health. I had another Olympic gymnast who was getting sick all the time. Every six weeks she would get cold or a flu. And she had 324 cholesterol levels constantly. And they told her that if she cut down the cholesterol, she would do better. Because she was always coming in 3rd and 4th place. And she had the talent to do better.

So they told her it was the cholesterol level. And every time she lowered the cholesterol, she got a cold or a flu every six weeks. So that tennis champion, Paul Cohen, who was McEnroe's coach for 10 years, and the whole time he was a champion, said to her coach, go to Aajonus Vonderplanitz, he's got a great diet for her. He'll take care of her and she'll be okay. Can I get a cholesterol level? Let him explain it to you about the cholesterol level. So the coach and she came to me and the parents. And I put her on a high fat diet. Her cholesterol is going to go sky high. And I said, every time you put her on a low cholesterol diet, she gets sick. She needs the right kind of fats with a high cholesterol level to be a better athlete. She came in with a silver medal that year. It works, you just have to pay attention. So fats are very, very important for everything in the body, especially for our toxic, toxic world. Then we have protein. Now I've experimented with many proteins on lots of different diets. Nuts, grains, you have it. Before I got into looking at the bacteria, what they consume, I experimented personally. If I had gone the other way and laboratorially looked at what those bacteria digested best, I could have saved myself years of experimentation, of being a raw food fruitarian and a vegan and all that other stuff. But the way I did was a process of experimentation, trial and error, with not only myself, hundreds of people. And always found that nuts did not create and increase... grains, beans, cooked, raw, germinated, sprouted, no matter what. None of them increased cellular production and promoted healing in times of wound or recovery from a detoxification. So, I found that meat, raw meat, always does, and in every circumstance. Only one that doesn't is this meat right here, eggs. Something about the protein is not mature enough, so it doesn't create an increase of cells. However, it will cause cells that are already alive to recover five times faster than meat.

So, when I have somebody who has Crohn's disease or an intestinal problem or a serious illness like emphysema, I put them only on eggs. In my recipe book, I tell about the woman whose doctor called me at 9.30 in the morning, my time, she lived on the East Coast, so it was like 1.30 in the morning her time. And she says, I have an emphysema patient who was diagnosed seven years ago. She'd been on machines and bedridden for most of the last two years, and she's going to die this weekend. What can I do? Well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she said, well, the law is that we have to treat with the recommended or the approved medical therapies, and if they fail for ten years, at that point we can give alternative advice. And I thought, oh my God, that's the law? And yes, and if we alter that, we can lose our license. And I have the family to support. I said, okay, well, that's your conscience. The only thing I can suggest for you at this point is get her ten to fifteen dozen raw eggs, put them at her bed table, and tell her to eat as many as she can eat, and there's no limit. And all of a sudden I got a call. That was on a Thursday night. So, of course, she probably didn't get it by Monday. She probably got it by Friday night to her. And this was an MD who cared, and she did. She did. She got her the eggs. The reason I know that is because I got a call on Monday morning from this raspy-voiced woman who said, it worked. I'm out of bed. What else can I do? And I said, well, who the hell are you? And she said, well, my doctor called you, told you I had emphysema. I was going to die this weekend, and I was on the machines and the bedridden. And I'm out of the bed. And I said, well, how many eggs did you eat? She said, 66. 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday. I woke Monday morning, and I got out and just took the machines off and got out of bed. Because I had the energy. Eggs are the most easily digested food that we can consume. Why? Because it's all liquid. We don't have to have hydrochloric acid. We don't have to have any digestive enzymes. All we have to have is the bacteria. You start with sucking it in the mouth, like I showed. Not everybody was here. I'll show you again. And you suck the egg white first. It feeds the liver. The liver makes the bile to digest the egg yolk. And you've got all of the B vitamins. You've got every vitamin. You've got every protein. You've got every fat in an egg where you won't have it.

If you ate a whole animal, you ate the glands, you're getting everything. In an egg, you get absolutely everything but the hormones that help you generate cells. They help you rebuild cells but not regenerate them. But the egg has absolutely everything in it. So that's why it worked for the woman with emphysema. That's why I can take a Crohn's patient and they will eat 30 to 50 eggs a day and make that almost their entire diet. They can reverse Crohn's that they would live with for a lifetime if they're on a medical regime without changing diet and taking medication in six months. Six to nine months. And before, when I used to handle it another way, do the meats. You know, meats take 19, 20 hours to digest. 19, 20 hours, that's a lot of time. That's a lot of energy for everything to work. And if you're putting eggs in and it digests in 27 minutes, that's fast. Milk takes 6 to 10 hours to digest. That's the second quickest thing. 27 minutes. You're going to get well fast. You may not heal as quickly because you're not replacing cells, regenerating cells. That's when you start eating meat, when you get into the healing stage of it. But to get all the cells that are already diseased and alive and unwell, well, you eat the eggs, a lot of them. And you'll get well quickly. That's why whenever you have a cold or a flu, eat lots of eggs, milkshakes, produce mucus. You digest the eggs quicker, you produce the mucus for the poisons to get into the mucus, you discard the mucus. It's your poisons, you want mucus. People are saying, oh, you don't want mucus? Oh, here, take this antihistamine to stop the mucus, stop the flow of the drainage. Most of that, the brain detoxifies out of your sinuses. Your brain isn't going to be able to detoxify some of those substances unless you're draining mucus out of your sinuses. The brain does most of its detoxification in the mouth. Which creates dental disease. Heavy metals come from the brain. Remember, I said the brain holds most of your metallic metals and free radicals. Detoxes out the gums. Heavy metals, you've got thimerosal, you've got thimerosal liquid mercury. You've got all these other heavy metals, lead, cadmium, that come down and make plaque on your teeth, on your dentine. Then the body tries to counter that by taking calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium and putting plaque on top of that to neutralize it.

The alkaline are supposed to neutralize the acidic. To neutralize one molecule of mercury, it takes 12 molecules of calcium, 10 molecules of magnesium, about 40 molecules of phosphorus, and about anywhere from 5 to 12 molecules of potassium to harness one and neutralize one molecule of mercury. That's a lot of nutrients, that's a lot of milk, that's a lot of cheese, that's a lot of meat, a lot of vegetable juice, to harness one. And they're giving us every injection. Before it was 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury in every vaccine. Now it's 56 quadrillion. They didn't eliminate it, they just lowered it. Now they call thimerosal a different name. It's no longer an antiseptic, it's a preservative. And they have a different name for it. It's not called thimerosal when they use it that way. But it's the same thing, liquid mercury. So that dumps out the gums, causes holes in your dentine and disintegrates the dentine. Then you have bacteria that goes in to eat the dissolved and damaged dentine in tubules, tubule cells. The janitors didn't cause the decay, they're in there cleaning up the mess. But the dentistry, doctors, oh, it's bacteria, brush your teeth. The mouthwash industry, oh, you know, you go around, oh, I bet this mouthwash [unintelligible] 24 hours, it destroys all the bacteria in your mouth. You've just destroyed your ability to start digestion in your mouth. Saliva comes out, it mixes with all that Listerine that's in the mouth or whatever you're using, the mouthwashes you're using, and then you're putting poison with your food instead of bacteria, harming digestion. The less you digest, the less you can be well. The more disease you're going to produce with the more chemical, industrial chemicals in the body. So, be aware, be very aware about that. Okay, so the fats are so important. Now, a lot of people have a lot of guilt about fat. You should be very happy. Let me tell you why. I think it's wonderful. Look at his skin, look at his whole complexion. It's better than most people's. He's thin over there, see how dry his skin is. He's lacking fat. People who are thin will be much drier or who are of a standard weight are much drier in their bodies and unhealthier. 

An example of that is, I had a, I think it was a late 40's year old man come to me for a private consult. And I photographed his eyes and was reading his irises, analyzing his irises. And I said, are you from this planet? And he said, no, he thought I was joking, I wasn't joking. I said, so why? And I said, well, your glands and organs and all of your insides look like you're 30 years old. And here I look at your skin, you look like you've been in a motorcycle gang. You know, wind blown eyes and skin. You look like you've done drugs and alcohol because your skin is very pockmarked and thick. And the bulbs on your nose are very red. And I, but, insides are clean. How can this be? You're only about 15 pounds, 12, 15 pounds, maybe 18 pounds overweight. He laughed. He said, three months ago before one of you died, I was 300 pounds. And I've been that way since I was a teenager. Even bad fats protect you. So when I see people who've been fat all their lives, I say, you are very lucky you've been fat in our society. Because those poisons will do damage, terribly. Instead of the poisons going into the fat, they go into the cells. And they damage the RNA, the DNA, the genes, everything. And then people really get sick. The sickest people and the people who take longest to get well are my skinny bird people. And they are very sickly. I mean people who are skin and bones, like Twiggy. And those people don't have any fat to buffer the information that goes up into the brain. Everything is a button. Hysterical. There's nothing to buffer the information that goes to the brain. People know who Twiggy is here? I took Twiggy out on one date to see Butterflies Are Free. This is a favor to Dory, my publicity agent. And I was sickly at the time. That was like 1972. I was getting better though because I was able to walk and move. I wear a brace to hold my back up so I wouldn't pinch so much. And there was a new Adco cinema. It was the first multiple plex. There were only three movies in this movie complex. Three at that time was the first. There weren't even any theaters that had two movie theaters. They just had three auditoriums. They were supposed to open with Butterflies Are Free. I took her. We were limoed up by MGM. We went inside and they hadn't finished building the thing. So they finished the main auditorium where the Butterflies Are Free. The other two theaters weren't finished yet. And in the back hallways there was lots of building materials. Of course you didn't see that because they made sure all that was out of sight.

Well, I got headaches from all the flashing cameras and stuff like that. I wasn't anybody. I was just somebody who was working as an actor and making it okay. But she was a star. And all the flashing was giving me headaches and backaches. So I said, let's go out, have the limo pick us up through the alleyway, and we'll take the back exit. So we go out and all this building material is there. And I thought, is that door going to be open? Are we going to have access to getting out? And I'm thinking aloud and Twiggy starts freaking out. We're locked in here. We're going to die in there. Nobody's going to find us in there. She went on and on for like 10 minutes. And her manager, Justin, and I had to... He actually slapped her. I shook her to get her out of it. Not all skinny women are that way, and not all skinny men aren't, but predominantly they are. They have a lot of buttons. They don't have buffering of their information. I don't date skinny women. If they're not fat, I won't take them out. Literally. It's too much work. So don't be afraid of fat. If you have fat, you're going to be fat and happy. Isn't that the old phrase? A hundred years ago, look at Marilyn Monroe. This was not a skinny, skinny woman. I remember the limo driver. He looks in the mirror at Twiggy and he said, You've got a pretty face, honey, but you ain't no Marilyn Monroe. She thought that was funny, but he meant it seriously. She was voluptuous. She wasn't skin and bones. She had a layer of stuff on her everywhere. That's the way people were admired. Look at the Venus, the portrait of Venus. All of them were voluptuous. They had fat on them. They could get through a winter without dying. They could have children and birth after birth and still make it through a winter. Skinny people were dying left and right. You didn't marry a woman who was skinny because you knew she was going to die in childbirth. Something like that. Skinny women mostly became prostitutes. A lot of them became prostitutes because nobody would marry them. Or they became nannies or somebody who didn't get married. So think about that. Fats are very important. Don't have bad judgments about fat. I know you're looking at me and saying, Aajonus, you're skinny. Let me tell you, when I was sick and getting well, I was just like this gentleman. 

When I started eating raw fat and everything, I was exactly his size and I stayed that way until I accidentally ate a poison mushroom. And then I went down and I had to gain it back. In several years, I stayed there again at a big size. But how much fat do you think I have on my body? What percentage of body fat?

Q: Eight.

A: Pardon?

Q: Eight percent.

A: So most people think, athlete size. I have 18% body fat. Where is it? You don't see it here, right? Because it's in the muscle tissue. It's where it belongs, in the muscle tissue. Why so much and I'm not fat looking? Because when you have raw fat molecules, they are tiny. When you cook a fat, you swell it 5 to 50 times its normal size. Take a flatback, you know, pork rind. Little thin thing like a bacon, you boil it in an oil, and what happens? It gets big and thick and crispy. That's what happens to fat molecules. They expand tremendously. You see those women who are huge and ripply like this, they can't digest those fats. And they swell up even more in their bodies. And the bodies retain a lot of water along with it. But when you eat the raw fats, they are infinitesimally small. I have women who have been on this diet from 12 to 25 years. And they were fat when they had the cancer and got over the cancer and everything. And after 12 years, none of them can get fat again. None of them can get fat. They can eat butter all day long. They can eat cream all day long. And they can't get fat. After 12 years, they have no cellulite anymore. Think about that. Never again will you have to look fat, although you are fat. You're still 22 to 24 percent body fat, but they don't look it. Like me, I look like 8 percent, I'm 18 percent. Big difference. Fat, fat, fat, fat, fat. Don't be afraid of fat. I'm going to talk about fat as regards food later. Proteins, only way we can regenerate those cells is raw meat of any kind. Carbohydrates, everybody talks about carbohydrates to tell the athletes, eat carbohydrates for energy to beat the athletes. It's a very low utilized energy. So what happens to these athletes who are fat deficient? What was the tennis player?

Q: Martina.

A: Pardon?

Q: Martina Navratilova.

A: I don't know, she's got some weight on her. Billy Jean King, McEnroe, very skinny while they were on the circuit. Tempers, especially McEnroe, what a temper he had. Now Billy Jean King, you see her, she's fat and happy. McEnroe is fat and more pleasurable. He's not irritable all the time. And they all burned out, they all dried up and burned out in their late 30s. They could no longer play their sport. Yet in the Andes, we have people who eat fats. And at 90 years old, they're still running the 100 mile once a year race. And they kick a ball. Up in the Andes, we're talking about where there's low oxygen. And they follow these paths and they have nine per group. And you'll have anybody from 20 years old to 90 years old. And they kick a ball. And once they kick it, the front runner goes behind the other eight. And then the front one kicks the ball. And then he falls behind. They do that for 100 miles. Why don't they burn out? They're eating raw eggs, raw oysters, and raw meat. They don't deteriorate. Carbohydrates are not for the human body. Only in emergencies when there's no other food should we even attempt to eat it. We can get some carbohydrate from vegetable juices. Now, if we eat vegetables, it's not a good thing. What happens when we have vegetables? Overalkalinizes the intestines. What do we have? We have putrefactive bacteria. You put alkalinizing fluids in there, what happens? It neutralizes their activity. You don't digest your meats and animal tissue, your milk, your eggs, your meat. You won't digest anything properly. It'll pass through you without digesting and absorbing very much nutrients. Vegetables are very bad, especially whole, because they constantly secrete alkaline juices as it passes all the way through. Now in an herbivore, let's take a look at an herbivore. Herbivore has two and a half times more digestive tract than we do. They have two to four stomachs. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fats and the proteins. We'll digest 1-2% of a vegetable, and that's it. Except for the vitamins and enzymes. We can absorb 70-80% of the vegetable juices, the vitamins, the enzymes, and the minerals. If we break the cellulose molecule and get the fluids out of it, we can get the blood of the vegetable out of it.

So, the only way that we can get a supplement is to have vegetable juice, a concentrated vegetable juice. And how do we do that? We juice it and separate the pulp. Pulp goes out one side, we take the juice out the other, and some people will still, there's still a lot of fiber in that, and it will still interfere with some people's digestion. So they may have to put it through a cheese cloth or a cloth like a t-shirt, like that, that's organic, and run it through that and get more of the pulp out of it. So they have pure juice, you can just take it and wring it like that, make sure you get as much out of it as you can. If you have green bowel movements when you're eating, when you're drinking juices, strain it. You're getting too much alkaline pulp into your system, and it's not digesting. So what we do is we juice vegetables to get our vitamins, enzymes, and mineral supplements. Now you can take a whole bottle of a multivitamin, and 99% of it is not real, and is unabsorbable, although it will create a toxic reaction like any chemical will, and give you a false high. When you take a vegetable juice, all of those enzymes and vitamins and minerals are utilizable in the human body, but not the protein and the fats. Remember I talked about the fats causing hardening of the system in our systems because our bodies are too low in temperature, and we don't produce the enzymes to digest the proper bio to digest vegetable oil. So we can get some carbohydrates from it. There's just some carbohydrates, unless it's something like celery. There's not enough carbohydrates in celery to digest celery. And that will have significance when I talk about timing of eating. Right now we'll just stick with foods. So there is one thing that I put in a separate category, and that is starch. Usually starches, always starches are high in carbohydrates, but I'm not looking at the carbohydrate factor here. I'm looking at the starch factor. And the starch factor is that starches can bind with poisons in the body and neutralize them from doing damage in the system. A lot of people who have a lot of excess adrenaline or irritable and anxious or produce a lot of testosterone, not only adrenaline, but testosterone, estrogen, can cause themselves to be irritable and anxious.

If they don't exercise enough to burn it off, they need some kind of nutrient to help bind with it, and that's a starch. Now, grains don't work in my experiments. Beans don't work. Nuts will work if they're handled in a particular way and if they're certain soft nuts, like walnuts and pecans. You can take those nuts and blend them until they are a flour. Then add egg, a raw egg, some butter, two or three tablespoons of butter, and a tablespoon of honey. Then you have a very wonderful sweet nut butter. Now that you can eat to help bind with excessive hormones, too much adrenaline, too much anxiety, and that will help a lot. If it doesn't work, if the exercise and the nut butter doesn't work, then you may have to go to a cooked starch. The best one I've found and the least toxic is whole grain rice. I'm not talking about Uncle Ben's. I'm talking about a whole grain brown rice. All those that are not browned are like this. I don't know why they call that brown rice. Brown rice is wild rice. That's real brown rice, black rice. Don't use wild rice. It's very difficult to digest. But your rice, that's why the Asians use it, do a lot better than countries who use corn. It sustains their systems better. It binds with a lot of excessive hormones. But it still won't bind with those if you need them. Corn will. Beans will. So, rice is always better if you're going to do it. And do not fry it, steam it, or boil it. Slowly. And always eat it with an equal amount of butter. Raw, no salt butter. I need to suck an egg, so I'm going to teach everybody how to suck an egg again. Those who weren't here. Now this one's hard to tell. You've got a fatter end and a narrower end. You want to break the integrity of the fatter end. There's a membrane in there that needs to collapse so you can get all the egg out of it, otherwise you won't. You don't put a hole in that fat end, you just break the integrity of the shell. I use an eye tooth. You can see there, it's fractured. I don't know if you can see that from that distance. It's fractured. Okay, no hole. If you accidentally make a hole there, you're going to have to hold your finger over it. And then to the thinner end, right down on the eye tooth. These are good eggs because I can't break a hole in it easily. So if it doesn't break, if you have a long fingernail like those ladies do, then you can just put your fingernail in it.

Now the egg white has all the protein in it and digests quicker than the egg yolk. If you combine the two and you have a digestion problem, you can get some stomach cramps. It also digests much slower if they're combined. So just down the egg, it won't digest as quickly and it won't work as quickly. So what I do is I hold it down like this and suck slowly the egg white. And the egg white only tastes like slightly salty, slimy water. Really tasteless. Now it was slimy when I took it out of the egg. By the time I swallowed it, I'd mixed so much saliva with it, the bacteria already thinned that egg yolk, I mean the egg white. So it was no longer slimy. It was liquid. I got all the bacteria into that egg white. It's already digested. It's probably already 10% digested. Sometimes the egg white will bond to the egg yolk, so just shake it a little bit. The egg white isn't coming out easily. But always suck gently so you don't suck the egg yolk and pop the egg yolk. And when you get down lower into the egg white, it's already thinner. So you don't have to saliva it as much. Then you get down to the egg yolk, and I just turn it upside down. See the membrane collapsed and took that part of the egg shell with it. Because that's where it was attached. So there is no yolk or white in there anywhere. Completely free, and I don't have to clean the glass. She's going to put these in her garden. Wonderful. Okay, so starch is a little bit of importance for some people, but it's not necessary. Okay, now we're going to get into timing. Well, let's get more into, talk about different forms of fat. Cream digests very, very slowly. It also causes water retention. When you have extra cream in, you know, like I have patients who will take cream and just suck it down and drink straight cream. Even very thick, straight cream. It's very difficult to digest. It takes all 60 varieties of cholesterol to digest raw cream. However, it's the only fat that will completely sedate and replenish the nervous system quickly. Fish fats can do it. I mean, the fats in fish can do it. We're not talking fish oils. That is a bad interpretation. There's no such thing as really fish oils. It's fish fat. Oils only come from vegetation and fruit and things like that. So, it is fish fat. Of course, they hook you on buying fish oils. They're all processed with kerosene. Again, if you want kerosene with your fish, pour some kerosene on your fish. And eat it that way.

So, the fish fats digest very easily. But, depending upon what fish it is, it can be very heavy and difficult to digest. A lot of fish fats are very complex. Like the salmon. There's another... Sturgeon, and there's one that they call the diarrhea fish. Almost always causes diarrhea if you have over like four ounces.

Q: Butterfish or oilfish or escalar.

A: Escalar. Escalar. It's a poop fish, they call it. It'll make you poop every time you eat it. If you eat more than, let's say, a quarter of a pound. Those fish fats are difficult to digest. But not as difficult as raw cream. But you still need raw cream. Usually, if you don't have a good layer of fat on your milk, like you have a quart, there should be that much fat on it, minimum. If it isn't, add some cream to it. Now that's not going to be difficult to digest cream. When you're drinking cream straight, and you're having more than, let's say, four tablespoons at a time, you could have more difficulty in digesting. You might have bloating and swelling. Especially in women. The butter is the most beneficial of all the fats. It only takes 40 varieties, 30 to 40 varieties of bile to digest butter. Raw, no-salt butter. It feeds everything in the body, including the brain, but not fully. Cream does that. But everything uses butter. And butter is quickly digested, because it takes less cholesterol and less time, and then the bacteria to digest that and eat that. If you, you know, inject the cream into your bowel, it's a different situation. Those E. coli and the colon bacteria can handle cream better, but they're making it for the brain and nervous system. But when you put the cream, a lot of cream, into the small intestine, it is difficult to digest there. So keep that to a lower part and make butter your major part of your fat. Get to your bones, your cartilage, your skin, everything better. If you've got some people who are very overweight, eating a pound of butter every two days and their skin is still really dry, that's how dry they are inside. So, skin eats, your skin can absorb and digest nutrients. Put butter right on your skin. Put the primal facial body care cream that I have in the recipe book on your skin. Put bone marrow on your skin. It'll make a huge difference. I had one woman who was a cosmetologist. She has to look good, she thinks, for clients to come to her. They have their hair and cosmetic stuff. She was on diet for about probably ten years but still had dry skin. And she looked her age. Even though she was on the diet, she looked her age because she wouldn't eat enough butter. And putting the primal facial body care cream on her skin was helpful. That's where you're mixing coconut cream, dairy cream and butter in a mixture and putting it on your skin. There's more to the recipe than that. Now I put bone marrow as well in with those other fats.

But for her, I said, okay, I'd like to experiment with something. How about you put bone marrow? Because bone marrow is the only substance that has stem cells in it besides sperm and ovum. So the only way you can get cells that can become other cells.

Q: We're closing in three minutes.

A: It's pretty cold, but do you mind finishing it out there? Is it too cold? Everybody okay with that? We don't have a choice. I thought we were here until seven.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That apartment, can we all go to that apartment? Let's all go to that apartment.

[audio cut]

A: So we were talking about fats, we were talking about butter being the most important nutrient for the human body, but also for other animals, dogs and cats if you have them. And the oils are different. Any pressed oil, whether it's coconut, olive, nut oils, no matter what it is, 90% solvent reactive. That means that it will promote detoxification. And that can be pretty unruly when you do it with oils. Oils in nature make up a small percentage of the body. Your body is only 7%, 6% oil. Yet you have a tremendous amount of fats if you're on a good fat diet. And most of those are water soluble fats, not oils. So, a... It's okay?

Q: I'm getting instructions so I don't know.

A: Well, maybe you want to turn it on the table.

Q: Thank you.

A: Turn on the table.

Q: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: I'm being attacked. Irradiated.

[laughter]

A: So they mostly turn into a solvent. Take coconut. A coconut is 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate. Now, in that fat of the coconut, only 7-8% is oil. The other 92%, 92-93% of that fat is water soluble fat. Most fats in the human body are water soluble. And those are much more important than the oil soluble. And that's why it's 92-93% water soluble. It carries more of the enzymes and vitamins that mixes with the whole body's chemistry easier. What else is that kind of ratio? Meat is the same way. You broil the meat, you get an oil out of it, but yet you've got a lot more fatty substances in there that are water soluble.

Q: [does something that makes noise] I'm so sorry.

[laughter]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: So oils are very, very important. If you put oil on your skin, what happens? It doesn't breathe right. You can't breathe through your skin. And your skin can breathe, your skin can eat. When you put oils on it, it smothers it. It causes rashes in a lot of people. So oil is something that you can use to promote detoxification, but not robust, strong health and strengthen your cells. It will help cleanse. A tablespoon of oil a day is fine. If in my recipe book you use a sauce with, let's say, four ounces of olive oil, then don't have oil again for four or five days. Keep it reduced because it will throw you into a detox that can be very uncomfortable. Maybe not right away, but when it hits, it can really hit hard. Anybody, any Italians here? How many Italians are temperamental?

Q: Oh, I haven't met any like that. 

[laughter]

Q: Nobody in my family.

A: That olive oil is very acidic. The Greeks have the same kind of temperament also. Highly acidic. It irritates the system. And there's nobody that needs more olive oil than the Greeks and the Italians, the Romans. So, they do have a high tolerance to abuse. And it's not a good thing to do very often. So, regulate how much oil you consume. Also, oils that say cold-pressed can still heat up to 170, 171 degrees and call it cold-pressed. I make sure that if it's olive oil, it says stone-pressed. If it doesn't say that and you still want to eat it, I suggest you go to the manufacturer and say, what is your method and what's the highest heat that the oil is subjected to on the machine. I had one producer tell me, oh, it never goes over, you know, 92 degrees, I think it was. And I tasted the oil, it burned my throat a little bit, I can tell, it's not so. So I went to his manufacturing plant, took a heat gun and put it right where the oil comes out of the machine, 171 degrees. He put it over here at the beginning where the olives were coming through, not to the point where they were coming out into the bottle or the tank. So you have to watch these people, you know, you really have to. That's why I have a product list, for those that I know that have gone up and investigated and proved, you know, the substance. So your oils may not be trustworthy as far as oil temperatures. And an oil never should go over 96 degrees Fahrenheit. I don't know what that is centigrade, I forgot. So, 96 degrees Fahrenheit, it will start altering it into slight lipid peroxides. And that will start causing the liver and pancreatic damage. So, oils use sparingly. Avocado. Avocado is 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate, like the coconut. Only the oils dry out. The oils have a tendency to dry. So, they are much more like a vegetable oil than a coconut smooth oil. If you take avocado and rub it on your skin, it will dry. That green stuff will dry. It will harden. It will leave a little bit of oil on your skin, which will lubricate the skin a bit. But it won't be like coconut. Coconut will oil and lubricate the skin, but not still feed it with a substance that makes the cells stronger and healthier in general. It takes butter. It takes animal fats to do that.

Q: What about fermented oil?

A: If it's fermented, let's say, cod liver oil, that's fine. However, it's highly acidic already, cod liver oil. It smells terribly, but it still may be good. I've done experiments with the green pastures. I helped green pastures formulate it over a two-year period. But they have flavored kind that has distilled process oils to flavor it because the plain cod liver oil is nasty tasting and smelly. But that's the way it should be, with good cod liver oils, that way. But my experience with the people who are on the diet, 90% to 100% doesn't change anything. It doesn't have any more effect. The super X oil, I mean butter, doesn't have any effect on acidity either. It's people who eat a lot of cooked foods that need that kind of supplementation. For the people who do the diet at 90%. I didn't test it with people below 90%. I don't know the mark point where the butter and the X butter, the X-Factor butter and the cold-pressed cod liver oil, the fermented cod liver oil, will have a change. I would estimate, theorize, probably about 60%. If you ate 60% of the diet and 40% cooked foods, probably the X-Factor butter and the fermented cod liver oil may have a beneficial effect. But otherwise it's a big waste of money. Again, they're isolating an oil factor and not the whole gamut of water-soluble fats. They're most of the fats. Other fats, like in that stinky fruit that they eat in Asia, the durian. Durian's very high in fat too, but it's also high in carbs. It can be used and made into a great sport substance. So if you're heavy into athletics, that would be a fine fat to consume. If you aren't going to do the sports after you eat it, you might find yourself hyper and anxious. Avocado will often be made into a detoxifier or a fuel. Okay, we're going to get into eating schedule. This is what I found is how the body functions. The body will make, for the first six hours of the day, anything it eats, it will try to make glycogen with a certain percentage of it. Glycogen is the sugar product that runs the brain and the nervous system. And if you eat high carbohydrate, there is a high advanced glycation end by-product. Advanced glycation end by-product. That's A-G-E, AGE, and it will age you. Columbia University found that a healthy body stored at a rate of 70%. An unhealthy body stored at a rate of 70 to 90%. That is a by-product that causes deterioration of tissue. It causes skin to sag. It causes aging.

It's interesting that they called it advanced glycation end product, AGE. And it will cause the muscles to sag. Because it's highly sugarish and acidic, so it melts the tissue and damages the cells. Ages them rapidly. If you're eating, if your body makes the glycogen from a pyruvate, a protein sugar, and fats, there's almost no advanced glycation end product. There's absolutely no storage of advanced glycation end products, even in the little bit that might form. So you need to eat low carbs for the first six hours. However, if you go out and binge on carbs after six hours, your body's still going to make high carbohydrate glycogen. And that high carbohydrate glycogen not only has the advanced glycation end product, it makes a very sticky fluid of the blood, the lymphatic fluid, and the neurological fluids. So when synapse fire, they have a tendency to stick on the axion and ganglia. So your thoughts don't make it, you don't follow through with your thoughts. You can get sidetracked easily. Also causes the blood to move slowly. They stick and it gets thick and sticky on the walls. So not a good thing to do. So you don't want to eat any high carbohydrate food for at least 6 hours after you've awakened in your day. What I recommend is eating cheese first. When you wake in the morning, you're going to have lots of poisons in your digestive tract. Your body's going to throw most of it off into the lymphatic system, if your lymphatic system works. And then it's going to dump it into the connective tissue and skin to be discharged sometime during the day. However, most people can't do it with exercise, even though they perspire. Because those fats are waxy and plastic and will not melt at body temperature of exercising. When people exercise, even though they perspire a lot, the body temperature never goes over 100.2. No matter how much you exercise. And most bodies will not go over 99.6, even in sweaty exercise. So, you're not going to get that lymphatic waste to move. The stomach lining manufactures hydrochloric acid. Now, hydrochloric acid will digest and dissolve bone and hair, yet it doesn't dissolve its own tissue.

So, the stomach is a repository for very dangerous toxins that get in the system. You get a vaccine, most of the formaldehyde, mercury, and ether, and aluminum will go to the stomach lining. I've done many autopsies, many, 12 autopsies on stomach, to me that's a lot, because it's very expensive. Autopsies on stomach linings. And the rate of thimerosal from vaccines in the whole soup of the ether, the formaldehyde, the aluminum, and the mercury is proportionate to what's in a vaccine. In all 12 that I did. Which is evidence that it's highly toxic. So, think about that. 95-96% of the people that I've done iridology with, that stomach lining, the area of the pupil that relates to the stomach, and stomach lining is loaded with formaldehyde, mercury, ether, and aluminum. And it drips into the food every time you eat. Every time. Because the body has to get rid of it. So what happens is, it poisons the food, it will damage the intestinal tract, and the worst is, you recycle the poisons. Then it goes out to the nervous system, damages the nervous system, and little by little, damages the whole body. Another reason I firmly believe that vaccines are a complete conspiracy to degrade the health of the human being and animals, dogs and cats, as well as make money. I don't think it's necessarily a conspiracy with the dogs and cats, making them weak and sick, except to make a lot of money on medication and having dogs go to the vet a lot, dogs and cats. Now the, I'm getting dry again. So the stomach lining will dump poisons. Now the way that we can arrest that, I'm mixing the schedule with a little bit of the food information, so I think you'll get it easier. Cheese and dairy can never go, raw dairy can never go bad. It only turns into cheese, harder and harder cheese. Sometimes you can let the milk ferment without pouring off the whey and become too alcoholic. And what happens there is it causes ankle swelling, calf swelling and feet swelling and toe swelling.

So if you have that reaction from having too much kefir, you're having too much kefir. Or you're having too much yogurt, or you're having too much fermented milk. Or any fermented food can cause massive swelling because the alcohol is produced. Now cheese is a byproduct of raw milk when you get it unsalted. And what that cheese does if you don't digest it, in raw cheese, in its natural form without salt, will not digest in the human body. It will pass through the body, vacuum up poisons all throughout the intestines. Also as blood, neurological and lymphatic fluids pass through the whole digestive tract, the cheese can pull those poisons out of those fluid systems, hold onto it like a sponge and then you pass it out in the feces.

Q: Salted cheese or non-salted?

A: Non-salted. Salted cheese will re-digest. Pasteurized cheese will re-digest. So you'll just be recycling your poisons. So it has to be no salt, raw cheese, absolutely. It doesn't matter if it's hard or soft cheese. It will work. When you dehydrate dairy, you've removed its enzymes. It will not digest without severe help. However, I found that the human body will take it through and absorb the poisons out of it, even though it probably could borrow, like it does in cooked food, borrow enzymes throughout the system, but it doesn't. In 20 cases that I've checked the feces with people who eat lots of cheese and different kinds of cheese, I found that in raw fooders, mainly raw fooders, who eat like 80% raw, I don't do any tests on anybody under 80, or very few tests, that those people who eat 80% raw primal diet, when they eat that raw, no-salt cheese, it binds to the poison, they do not digest it. If it's salted raw cheese, they digest it and reabsorb the poisons. If you eat honey with the cheese, directly with the cheese, into the cheese, the honey gets into the cheese, you will digest it. And what I've seen over the years is that it is a mineral supplement. So it helps rebuild bones, it helps reverse osteoporosis, it helps reverse gum and teeth problems, and very quickly. So let's say you've got an abscessed tooth and you're enjoying the tomato, like I suggest, in the remedy section of We Want to Live. If you're eating cheese and honey a little bit all day long, together you're going to re-mineralize the system, you're going to find that the tooth pain dissipates very quickly. You may come back the next day and you still do it again, you just haven't eaten during the night to keep the mineral level up. So any form of raw dairy is good, it takes on different reactions, like the cream will feed the brain and nervous system where no other fat can. The butter will feed every part of the body and digest very quickly. The cheese, unsalted, will pull poisons out of the body. The cheese with honey will give you an incredible mineral supplement. Now all of your mineral supplements are rock. We don't digest rock, plants digest rock. Water is a solvent, it rains, the solvent water dissolves rock, plants eat.

We do not digest rock. Any mineral supplement is rock, even if it's liquid. Even if it is colloidal. Colloidal means that it is small enough to be absorbed intracellularly. But those metals, those minerals that you absorb like that, will be highly toxic. Colloidal silver is very toxic. What is colloidal silver? It has mercury in it, it has thallium, it has aluminum, it has all kinds of toxic minerals. People who take colloidal silver, I don't get it. I see those people who take a lot of it, they're gray, they have gray skin. I have had people who become invalid by taking it. It acts as an antibiotic, yes, like an antibiotic does. It poisons the body, the body stops any kind of detoxification, any symptom that you have, to deal with that poison. That isn't a way to do it, that's like saying, oh, you've got a toothache? Bam, step on your toe, now you've got a toe ache and you've forgotten about the toothache. It's not a way to do it. I hope I didn't offend you by using you as an experiment. I just thought about that and I frightened her. So, it's not a good idea to use any kind of a supplement or a chemical to try to force the body to do something. There's always a natural way and I've outlined them in my books, in my newsletters. Does everybody know I have a newsletter? I've been very tardy on it. The name of my newsletter, you go to wewant2live.com, everything's spelled out except the T-O, it's a numeral two. So, wewant2live.com and you can subscribe to the newsletter. You'll get all the back issues all the way to 2006. So, there's a lot of information there about tricks to do when you have problems. Those that aren't in the remedy book and the recipe book. So, when you have cheese, first thing in the morning to draw the poisons out and have a big slice. Like, let's say if you're this guy, you would have two tablespoons. This young lady, I would have a tablespoon. And then that will go through and pick up the poisons. Then next, you want to make the brain work properly. Remember I said, it looks for protein sugar first, pyruvate, to run the brain and the nervous system. So, egg white, you've got all that rich, easily digestible protein. You put your mind in first gear within five, ten minutes of eating a raw egg. Suck the egg white out, like I said, just at first.

I mean, if you don't want that, just down it. Rocky style, but you will get a better reaction for those who have a lot of mental fog and problems. You will get a better reaction by eating the egg white first. So, it goes in there and feeds the brain and nervous system. Is there anybody who wants to come and sit on the rug?

Q: How much time between the cheese?

A: Ten minutes.

Q: Ten minutes between the cheese?

A: Always ten minutes. Anytime you're going to eat anything, you eat cheese ten minutes before you eat it. What happens in the stage of the stomach, when I've done autopsies, the stomach, when you start eating, and then if you eat the cheese and stop eating, the body will dump for ten minutes the poisons from the stomach, and then stop. It will put a mucous layer over that food, and then it will wait for other food to come, or no food, and it will seal it off. So it seals it off with the poisons, then you can start eating, and you have twenty-five minutes to eat whatever you're going to eat before the stomach will start dumping. If you eat beyond that twenty-five minutes, the stomach will start dumping the poisons into the food again and mixing it up. So if you get to the twenty-five minute point, you stop eating. The body will build a layer over it, and it will be sealed off. If you still need to eat afterwards, eat a little bit of cheese again, and then go back to, wait the ten minutes, and then go back to eating, finishing your meal. If you're a person that takes a very long time to eat your meals, digest. So you have the cheese, you have the egg, to make sure the brain functions well, the whole body functions well. If you're normally very weak and tired, then have two eggs. Wait five, ten minutes between the eggs, have another egg. Then wait ten minutes, have a teaspoon of cheese, which is two sugar cube sized amounts of cheese, and then have a vegetable juice. I talked about the vegetable juice a little bit. If you have celery, it's a negative, so you can eat carrot juice with celery juice, because the absence of the carbohydrate in the celery juice will balance the high carbohydrate in the carrot juice, so it doesn't make glycogen to fuel the brain. Also, if you're very weak or thin, or very low in energy, put an egg in it, in the vegetable juice. Break the yolk, put maybe a half to a teaspoon of dairy cream in that. Whip it, don't blend it with the egg and the juice. And then you always put the egg and the cream in right before you're going to put the egg and the cream in the juice. And then you sip it, or you suck it the way I do. Remember, sucking always adds bacteria right away. You begin digesting in the mouth.

Q: So you said don't whip it, or do whip it?

A: No, I said whip it, don't blend it. Whip it, don't blend it. Okay, because it will oxidize it. The juice, not the egg and the cream. Because you've already blended it, you've already made it into a substance. And did I go through? I guess I didn't go through making a vegetable juice, or did I? I recommend right around, it's different from in my recipe book because I've learned a lot since then. So I recommend somewhere around 25-30% each of carrot, celery, and cucumber. Then about 5-10 or even 15% cilantro to help get poison metals out of the body quicker. Then maybe a little parsley or not, or let's say you have some digestive problems, not digesting your protein well, not building up your HCL very well, your hydrochloric acid in your stomach, have 5% beet juice. That helps generate hydrochloric acid in the stomach. You can go through an herbal book and find a remedy for herbs that might fit you, but juice them. Don't eat them dry and raw, that's like expecting a miracle. We are not vegetarians, we are not herbivores. If you put dry vegetation in your system, you're not even going to digest a fraction of a percent of it. You're going to find it in your fecal matter. I've never found even 1% digested. 100% of the herbs that I've seen people take dry come out the rectum in all the laboratory tests that I've done. Why? We don't digest the 1-2% of raw vegetables, much less dehydrated and dry. Now an herbivore can, they eat dry grasses all the time, but we have no system anything like theirs. So it's not a good idea. A lot of people will steep it or make it into a tea, but when you're getting powdered, anything like that, it is not going to digest. Algae, what do they call the, not the chlorella, but the others.

Q: Spirulina.

A: Spirulina, all of those, found that 99% passes out in the feces. A waste. Chlorella, you may digest up to 20% of it, and that's good, just don't eat so much. Keep it to a quarter of a teaspoon if you're going to eat it, and put it in something that will slow it down, so it doesn't go through the body so quickly. Like chlorella and cottage cheese, or chlorella and cheese. It's a good combination, it'll slow it. So about, say you have your vegetable juice, and you're going to juice everything but the cucumber. Now, cucumber I've changed, in the recipe book I talked about juicing the cucumber. However, I found that a lot of people, because they weren't cleaning their lymph systems, their skin was getting very damaged, they were moving toward symptoms of lupus, which is disintegrated connective tissue, because of the high acidity, and MS. And that wasn't many people, but that was probably about 6-7% of the people on the primal diet, long term. If they'd done the hot baths, that wasn't their problem. But if they weren't doing the hot baths, they needed to replace the collagen in the skin from the damage. The cucumber pulp has collagen precursors, everything necessary to make collagen. Collagen is what the pharmaceutical industry, the cosmetic industry sells to people, oh your skin will be rich and smooth, your connective tissue, your skin won't sag, your muscles will be replaced, and all of that. And that's why they put cucumbers in masks and stuff like that, because it absorbs into the skin. You can do that by making sure that you have cucumber pulp in your juice. So you juice everything but the cucumber, you peel it even if it's organic because you're not going to digest it, you slice it, put it in a jar for blending, pour everything you've just juiced, the celery, the carrot, the parsley and cilantro and beet, whatever it is you've juiced, your mint, whatever it is, you pour that into the jar with the cucumber slices, and then you blend it, and then you've got a pulpy juice, and that pulpy juice will help your skin, your connective tissue, so you'll be younger. I mean, so many people notice the difference. Also, those people who have a tendency to have that hardening of the fecal matter in the sigmoid colon, it lessens the dryness. Although it's not feeding fat to the bacteria in the colon, it's still helping to make things softer. 

It may even interfere with the fat digestion, a little bit of absorption, but it still frees people up to moving more freely, and it replaces the collagen in the skin and makes the skin and connective tissue and muscles, everything much better and smoother.  So, if you have a juice, you put an egg in it and some cream, sip it, suck it, over a period of time. If you gulp fluids, a lot of that H2O is going to go to the kidney. Then what H2O is going to go with the nutrients into the cell? Cells are going to dehydrate. And you can't replace it by drinking water. There's no ionic connection between water, that is strictly water, and the water in a food. Water food has all of the enzymes, vitamins, proteins, you name it. It's all there in that water. And all food is very water. Meat is 55% water minimum. Milk is 86% water minimum. Fruits are 92% water minimum. So there is water in everything. Water that really can feed the cells because the water is transporting nutrients with it. And it's all mixed together. It isn't like drinking Coca-Cola and any kind of soda, that's all chemical. And you may get a little buzz from it but you won't get vitalized by it. So, count on your water being from your food. If you cook your food, what happens? Water evaporates, water fractionates, ions are set free and become free radical, or they completely evaporate and leave the fluid all together. So it's chemical. That is not a fluid system. It is not a nutrient system. So you get your water from your food, all raw foods. You may need a little water, two to four ounces a day. Some people who are athletes may need a whole cup a day. But keep the water, straight water level down. You only need a little bit of solvent, reactive water in the body.

Q: Then why do they keep saying drink five, seven glasses of water a day?

A: Like I said, keep your questions for the end because I'm going to answer that later. We'll strictly talk about water. About 25-35 minutes after you finish your juice, have cheese again. Now at this point, you've had enough cheese to collect a lot of the poisons. However, you're going to be secreting poisons constantly. A little bit, so you need to vacuum those. So I suggest that you have a sugar cube size amount of cheese at least every hour of the day. No matter what you're eating, no matter what's going on. And always about half a teaspoon to a teaspoon before anything you eat or drink. I'm not talking about a sip of milk or a sport drink. I'm talking about having a milkshake, a fruit meal, a meat meal, a vegetable juice. Always have cheese ten minutes before. So have anywhere from half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of cheese. Wait five minutes, ten minutes. Have a meat meal. This is all in the morning. So you've had your cheese, egg, maybe another egg. Then ten minutes after that you have cheese and your vegetable juice and an egg in it with a little cream. If you don't want it, you don't have to have the egg and the cream in it. If you're thin and you've got a problem with high in sugar, low sugar levels, have an egg in it. If you're diabetic, have an egg in it. So you're looking at about thirty-five minutes into the day at this point. Then you wait about thirty-five minutes before you have your meat meal. So you're looking at an hour and ten minutes into your day when you start eating the meat. And it depends upon your size, but everybody should be having about a cup of meat twice daily. That's minimum. A fellow his size, I would say a cup and a half twice daily. That's a half a pound twice daily. At least by weight, seven ounces twice daily. So that's fourteen weight ounces of meat. Always with your meat meal, eat butter. Not cream. Cream will often coat the meat. You won't digest it well, and a lot of that meat will pass through your body without digesting. And you'll see little pearly sheen over your stool. That means you haven't digested the cream. Butter is always better to eat with your meat. You always need to eat butter with your meat so you don't turn the meat into a fuel. You need to use that meat to rebuild and heal the body.

So, have butter with it. If you take one of my sauces out of the recipe book that has cream in it, it also has onion and other things that help digest the cream. But don't have straight cream with your meat. And that's okay. But don't have it too often. Have more butter with your meat. You can have olive oil and those other things. But, like I said, if it's a lot of the ingredients of that sauce, only eat it once every four to five days. Don't have it every other day. In my recipe book, there are 82 sauces for meat that can be made three to five different ways each. That's over 400 sauces. One for every day of the year. So, you should not get bored with it. There's a lot in there. I have all kinds of sauces from all over the world for different palates. So some of them you're going to detest. Find the ones that you like. Make a big batch of them. So you just scoop it out into your food. Now, the trick to maintaining any diet, especially this one, because you can't get the foods anywhere and everywhere, so if you get caught outside and you can't get the foods, what are you going to do? You're going to eat junk. You're going to eat garbage. You're going to eat cooked foods. You're going to eat processed foods. You're going to poison your body. If you're going to do that, make sure it's a choice for taste and not out of inconvenience. If you're going to poison yourself, you better enjoy it. So what I suggest is, the first hour of your day, you make all the foods for the whole day. You make everything. You take it with you. If your car breaks down, you've got your food with you. No matter what happens, you will have food. The food you need and the food which nourishes you best. I do it. All of my food was prepared this morning, all the way through to the night, till the next morning. Easy. Easy to do that way. And if you have these sauces, you're chopping your meat or whatever, just a few pieces in like that. It takes like, if you look at the DVD, the recipe DVD, you see how quickly you make sauces, meat sauces. Two minutes, five minutes maximum, and you can make big batches. And so quick. I mean, think about it. Who prepares seven meals a day in an hour? With no heat, no electricity, except for a little blending. You're not exhausting yourself, stirring over a hot flame, you know, boiling stuff, making it poison, and dealing with all the heat of a hot day. You know, think about that, all the wasted energy. This diet is so easy, and it's so nourishing.

So, after your meat meal, with the butter, then, or a sauce with butter in it, then let 35 minutes pass, and have cheese and honey together. Best time you have your mineral supplement. When you have lots of fat and protein in the system, the body can utilize those minerals in concentration the best. To heal tissues, teeth, bones, no matter what it is. Depending upon your size, anywhere from 1 to 2 tablespoons of cheese, with 1 sixth honey. So, if you have 1 tablespoon of cheese, it should be a half a teaspoon of honey. Some people need a little bit more honey. So, if you're not digesting your cheese as well, you add maybe a teaspoon of honey to a tablespoon of cheese. That's 1 to 3, or 1 to 4 actually. So, it'll be 1 fourth honey to 3 fourths cheese. I usually have about a tablespoon and a half of cheese with a teaspoon of honey. That's my ratio, and I find that works for me best. Then let 2 to 3, 4, even 5 hours pass. Have cheese, a little piece of cheese at least every hour. If you want to feed your brain and nervous system and get well faster, have cheese every hour, 10 minutes after that an egg. 12, 14 eggs a day. You will get well faster, as long as the eggs are good eggs. Good eggs means chickens are not fed a lot of soy, and they're not vegetarianly fed chickens. Chickens are scavengers, they eat meat. My Amish farmers and all the other farmers who I have producing eggs for us, feed their chickens meat scraps, rotten meat scraps. I tell them after they butcher the animal, they put all the scraps out on a pallet, and let the chickens dive into it. The flies will come, lay their eggs, and the maggots will crawl. The chickens eat the maggots. And it's that the chickens, have you ever seen chickens that have no pecks in their back, even from a rooster getting them? And completely full, feathered, and happy, and will rub up against you like a cat up against your leg, and they have no pecking order, no pecking tone. That's the way these chickens behave, because they're being fed their natural diet. They are scavengers, they are vultures. They eat meat, they eat insects, they eat worms. That's what they eat. And when you feed them grains and stuff like that, that isn't what a chicken eats. It's not natural. The meat of the chicken is tough. All bird meat that are eating their natural diets is tough meat. Except for maybe quail. So, even in the wild, quail is tender. It's the only bird I've had that's tender in the wild. And I've eaten just about every bird. Ostrich, you name it, I've eaten. And every natural bird is tough meat.

So you might have to really work on chewing it off the bones or cutting it off the bones and chopping or putting it in a food processor. Now, if you don't like chewing your meat, you don't like the taste of it, cut it up into cubes, put it in a food processor and grind it. It takes 10 seconds to grind the meat. It takes 20 seconds to make it into a pate in a food processor. So you have to go, put a sauce on it, easy, until you get used to raw meat. Most people who go on this diet have no trouble. They go right to the raw meat and it's easy. But there are some people who are very squeamish and have a lot of difficulty. If you're one of those individuals, grind your meat, put a sauce on it, then you wolf it. Easy. So for that next 2 to 5 hours, you have cheese and egg every hour. If you're very, very toxic, if you have black eyes, if you have a lot of black spots in your eyes and your eyes are normally light, then you need to have more cheese more frequently. So I have some construction workers that I have to eat it every 20 minutes. Now how does a construction worker eat cheese every 20 minutes? They have a pouch for their hammer and everything else, their screwdriver, and they've got a pouch for their jar of cheese. Flap it up like that. I have many who are doing it because there are so many poisons in construction that young kids are becoming impotent and having all kinds of problems, and that cheese will help absorb those poisons. And it works. So just cut yourself up a lot of little pieces of cheese and carry it around in a jar. And just take one and have it around the house if you're around the house. I was in a courtroom. I was suing the city of Los Angeles and the police department, and I told the judge, because there's no eating and drinking in the courtroom, and I said, I was diagnosed diabetic. I have to eat. So I had my cheese and my eggs and my milk right on the counters. I'm suing these guys for 22 days in a courtroom. I'm eating raw eggs in front of everybody. I'm doing this whole eating bit, you know. And I don't care what people think. It's me that's important, my health. And I'm not doing something that's destructive to anybody, except maybe psychologically. because they've been brainwashed into believing the exact opposite of what is truth. So eggs and cheese, cheese more often. I have some people who say cheese, egg, cheese, cheese, cheese, egg, cheese, cheese, egg, cheese, egg, like that. Or you go cheese, egg, cheese, cheese, egg, cheese, cheese, egg on the clock.

You will get well better, I've seen it. Just as important or just as effective as the hot baths in removing poisons from the intestinal tract and not contaminating your food with the poisons that are being dumped into the digestive tract, because they're already part of the intestinal wall. 

Q: It was just with regard to when you talked about the cheese and you have to eat within twenty-five minutes or the toxins gets dumped again, is that twenty-five minutes starting from when you finish the cheese, or?

A: No. You finish the cheese, ten minutes passes, then you start eating. Twenty-five minutes from the point when you start eating that food. Not from the cheese.

Q: Okay, so from the egg.

A: Yes, from the egg. Well, no. Okay. If you're having the cheese, okay, ten minutes pass, sealed over. Egg, sealed after you're eating the egg and it's over, ten minutes after that it's going to seal that off again.

Q: Okay.

A: So then you eat cheese again, wait ten minutes, seals that off, and then you have your vegetable juice.

Q: And you have twenty-five minutes to have that.

A: Then you have, yeah, twenty-five minutes to drink the vegetable juice. Then when you get to meat, it's the same way. You have your cheese, ten minutes later, then you have twenty-five minutes from that. So it's thirty-five minutes after the cheese.

Q: Right.

A: Okay? That's a good question.

Q: Yes.

A: I never thought people would misunderstand that, because I say ten minutes later, then you have twenty-five minutes to eat from that point.

Q: Right. Right. Right.

A: So after that, two to four hours, depending upon what you do, if you need to calm your body, have a milkshake. Milkshake would be, let's say, two to five eggs, depending upon your size and what you want to achieve, anywhere from three to six ounces of milk, one to four tablespoons of dairy cream, one to two tablespoons of honey, and you could grate a little ginger root, fresh ginger root in it, if you want to stimulate digestion. Now if you put a fruit in that milkshake, it becomes a smoothie, it is not the same. In other words, you're putting high carbohydrate in there, and you could cause your body to build a lot of glycogen, especially if you're having a milkshake two hours after your meal or three hours after your meal. You're still within that six hours, so not a good idea. Milkshake will be more soothing. If you put, whenever you put fruit with anything, it will be detoxifying. Now I never talked about fruit, I just talked about high carbohydrate, and there's a lot of natives out there, like in Asia, that don't eat ripe fruit. Most of the kids do now, because now they're all sugar addicted, but most of your adults will eat unripe fruit, even mangoes, green tart mangoes, rather than sweet fruit, and that keeps the carbohydrate down. Carbohydrate is a good thing to keep at a low level unless you're an alcoholic, because it will cause overproduction of alcohol in the digestive tract, then you'll go into more detoxification, forced detoxification. People really don't need a fruit meal, but I say one fruit meal a day is good to help detoxification, because if you don't detoxify, you're not going to get that much stronger. If you build cells that are already contaminated, what is their offspring going to be like? They're going to be weak, toxic offspring. So the cleaner you can get your cells, and when they reproduce cleaner and cleaner, their offspring are going to be stronger and healthier. So I always suggest that people eat one fruit a day, unless it causes a lot of complications. So have a fruit meal always with fat. Coconut cream is your best cleansing fat without being too radical. These people who do these liver cleanses with olive oil and lemon juice, hello, that's really tough on the body. Tough on the digestive tract, will damage the intestinal flora, it could damage the gallbladder and the liver, it can cause problems.

So it's better not to do that kind of an intense detoxification, do mild ones, you're having a tablespoon of oil a day, you're going to create a slow detoxification, and it's always much better. When you're on the primal diet, you don't have to push, your body's taking care of it all the time, except for the baths, you need to push the baths and push that cheese, it's the only thing I would say you're forced to try real hard. So you can either have a milkshake within that two to five hours, or you have your fruit meal. If you have your fruit meal, I suggest you stretch it out to fourth or fifth hour beyond the meat meal, that way you won't make the high carbohydrate, and you have it with let's say two to four tablespoons of coconut cream, big guy even five tablespoons of coconut cream, and then one tablespoon of dairy cream or a little butter. Now taking the dairy cream or the dairy fat with the fruit meal and the coconut cream will help protect the animal cells especially the nerve cells. So it's a good idea. If you're having pineapple, have a little bit of cream, dairy cream, and a little bit of butter. Now to clean the lymph system, as I talked about earlier, to help get that to dissolve, pineapple is the best, but only in a few cases have I ever suggested more than pineapple every other day. Every other day is plenty. Pineapple has a tendency to make people overemotional, and that gets very taxing living with people who are very emotional. So it's better to have it every other day. You have your coconut cream, you have your dairy cream, and a tiny bit of butter with it. It only takes about a half, quarter of a teaspoon of butter, or even a half a teaspoon of butter. Just a bean-sized amount of butter is all it takes. You can dice that pineapple and mix it with the creams, eat the butter first, and then spoon that nice cream mixture with the pineapple chunks, or blend it all together. Up to you. And have it both ways so it doesn't get monotonous. On the opposite day, pick a fruit from the book. If you have digestive problems, you can have custard, which is papaya. That's the fruit you would have with eggs and butter and honey. If you have heavy metals throughout the body, you can have berries. Dark berries, blueberries, blackberries and poison berries help get rid of lead, mercury, the darker, grayer metals. Strawberries and mainly raspberries help get rid of lighter metals like zinc and iodine and iron, even though iron is a heavy metal. The light berries help get rid of those metals.

So you have that with, let's say, 2 to 3 tablespoons or 4 tablespoons of coconut cream and a little bit of dairy cream. With the berries, you'll need a little bit of butter. That's with citrus if you're having it at that time, especially pineapple. So you have your fruit for one, you know, a day for your week, one a day each day, the whole meal. And then, let's say, let 2 to 5 hours pass again, if you feel like another vegetable juice, have another vegetable juice. Feeling like another vegetable juice, if you feel blah, nothing interests you, everything is moving slowly through the digestive tract, you're lacking enzymes. You can either have, let's say, a tablespoon or two of papaya, or a piece of pineapple, or another vegetable juice, or all three of those. And depending upon your need, you know, your height and weight, first vegetable juice can be anywhere from 8 to 24 ounces if you're a very big person. If you're small, keep it to 8 ounces. If it's hot, steamy, and you're losing a lot of fluid, then have up to 12 ounces, go from 8 to 12 ounces, once or twice a day, or even three times a day, depends upon you. Now, when I started off, I started having four vegetable juices daily. That was a lot, but I was very acidic, very poisoned by the pharmaceutical industry with their chemotherapy and all the other medications. So I needed four a day. Now I need one a day, or one every other day. So it's changed, but you know, I've had 30-some years, 13 years of eating raw, so it's a little bit different. If I have too much vegetable juice, I'll just go to sleep and have no energy. And I like it. I only sleep three and a half, four hours a day, and I'm always working, always with an alert mind. And just think, I was an idiot as a kid. I had no short-term memory. You could say something to me, and not only did I not understand language, I couldn't even repeat the sound that you made. I had to work and work until I was eight years old to try to have a memory for anything. I could see something and absolutely don't know what I did a few minutes before it was that bad. So vegetable juices, do as you need them. And they are your most intense vitamin, enzymes, and mineral supplement, except for the cheese of course with the minerals. The minerals in the vegetable juice will help digest you. The minerals in the cheese will help rebuild your body. 

So then, if you have another vegetable juice, wait an hour, an hour and a half, two hours maximum, and have your second and last meat meal, at least a cup, cup and a half to cup and a half. Sometimes, if you're a body builder or you're a wrestler and you need a lot of energy, or do something with sports, you could have a pound twice a day, depends on what you want to do and develop.cThen, have the butter with your meat meal, again, thirty-five minutes after that you have cheese and honey together, and in the evening you can do your cheese and egg, cheese and egg every hour, or even more often cheese, egg, cheese, cheese, egg, or cheese, egg, cheese, cheese, egg, anything like that, or just sit on milk for the rest of the evening, and before you go to sleep, if you want to really relax, you can either have a warm glass of milk or a milkshake, and just drink half of it, I wouldn't have as many eggs as you had earlier, but you know, maybe one to two eggs, split in half. Have half of them before you go to sleep, cheese of course, two minutes after that have half of it, go to sleep, and wake during the night and have the other half of the little cheese. Why do I say wake in the night? Because if you go five hours without eating at any time, the blood protein level goes to nil. The red blood cells have to have protein all the time, 24 hours, every moment, if they don't have it, they become cannibalistic and eat each other. Red blood cells can't eat white cells, so they eat other red blood cells. So in an eight to ten hour period of sleeping without eating, you can consume two to four tablespoons of red blood cells, so you wake after eight to ten hours and you feel like you haven't slept. Why? You've got anemia. And the spleen isn't going to kick in for an hour, an hour and a half, because everybody's not well, so it's not going to replace that lost red blood cells, and caffeine and nicotine and the overmining from chocolate are no remedy for anemia. Eating protein is good for anemia. So you wake in the night, if you don't wake normally, you set an alarm. If you're a hyperactive person that has a lot of energy and you wake after five hours and you eat and you can't go back to sleep, the next night you set your alarm for three hours, you eat after three hours, you go back to sleep for five hours. I don't know anybody but myself that has rested after three hours.

So everybody's going to be tired, you're going to go back to sleep, it's that easy. And there's the diet. Pretty simple, I mean it means you think it's a lot, but it isn't. You take a cube of cheese and you chop it up, or you have cottage cheese, and you just take a small amount, so easy to cut up. Takes three minutes, you got it in a jar, that's finished. If you have your sauces already prepared, there's no sauce making there, there's no time lost there. You take your meat, cut it up into cubes, you can put it in the grinder, in a food processor, if you like it ground, in seven minutes, seven minutes, and then you clean, three minutes, to clean a food processor. Your juicing, that takes a little time, and you can juice for three to four days at a time, some people juice up to five days, and the instructions on how to do that are both in the DVD recipe and the recipe book, my recipe book. So it teaches you how to make and preserve the vegetable juice, so you don't have to make it every day. Making a milkshake. What does it take to take a couple of eggs, or several eggs, knock them into a glass, let's say five eggs you put in there, it takes you one minute, fifteen seconds, to break five eggs into a jar. Then you pour five ounces of milk in there. You put two tablespoons of honey. I do, by estimate, look, I pour the honey in and I go like this, and like that, it's done. Ten seconds, a minute at most, if you're slow with your honey. Then, you know, you're going to put maybe grate a little ginger in it, that'll take the longest, probably take three minutes, you're going to grate some ginger into your shake. And then you just blend it together, or a little cream, a couple tablespoons of cream, another minute. You're talking ten minutes for a vegetable, I mean a milkshake. These are fast foods, folks. You can't go into a fast food place and get waited on in ten minutes anymore. You have to wait in line. And, you know, if you have it with you, there's no waiting, there's no burn-up time. And then, let's say you're making, what else, you make two meat meals. It takes ten minutes each for each meat meal. You've got your milkshake that takes five minutes, let's say. And chopping your cheese up, let's say, that takes five minutes. Would it take you forty?

That's what it takes me, forty minutes to, sometimes even less, forty minutes to prepare all my foods for the whole day. And I take my milk out the night before, the milk that I'm going to eat during the day, to get the bacteria going in it. I don't like sour milk. For me, it digests better, it's great, I love it. Sometimes it's a little bitter, and that's because the lactobacillus bulgaricus is working faster than the acidophilus and calcoaceticus, and digesting the fat first, without a relationship with the acidophilus, which is just milk sugar. So it becomes a little bitter, and slightly foul. But I don't mind digesting the fat first, it's fine with me, like Germans who eat that nasty smelling cheese, and I mean that stuff is gross, and you wonder why they don't have bad breath for the next twenty-four hours. But it doesn't. Body has the bacteria that breaks down the odor, fat, the odor of the body. Bacteria breaks it down to cause the odors, and other bacteria eat that. So you get all these bacteria working together, it's an incredible symbiotic relationship between bacteria. We are 99.99% bacteria. Think about that. They do everything for us. So that's the diet, and I want to talk about water a little bit more. Like I said, water will dilute your digestive juices, it will thin the mucous lining, so your digestive juices can go in and start eating away at your intestinal tract. A lot of Crohn's disease and IBS is created from drinking water. It dilutes everything. Now you say, well, why do we have to drink eight glasses of water a day? We don't. That's what the Coca-Cola hired doctors to say. In 1961, Coca-Cola executives had a big meeting. Anybody see Trading Places? What they did was, these two guys ran this big stockbroker firm, took their top guy who was that Saturday Night Live guy, Bill Murray, not Bill Murray, but one of the other ones. They took him, this top guy, and they took this black guy off the street and they were going to teach him how to do this. One bet the other a dollar that they couldn't do it. They couldn't make him as good as the other guy, and they couldn't turn this other high-producing stockbroker into a street bum, and that was the bet. They would reverse places, Trading Places. Coca-Cola, in 1961, had a meeting with their executives and said, we're going to sell water. That was it.

We're going to sell water, and we're going to charge as much, eventually we will charge as much, for water as we do for Coca-Cola. A lot of the people in the room said, you're not going to get anybody to drink, to buy water. I mean, they can get it out of their tap. Well, the first thing they said, well, we pollute the water first. Nobody wanted to drink that water, so they have to buy water. Once we get to that point, we've got a whole market for water. We hire doctors to begin with, though, to tell everybody that they need to drink a lot of water. That for health, they need to drink eight glasses of water a day. Boom, 1962, that was the marketing. Coca-Cola hired all these doctors to tell the media that everybody needs to drink eight glasses of water a day, and the rest is history. Water is a solvent. It will dissolve and neutralize and may play havoc with your body, except in small amounts. Now, if I drink water, I consume probably a liter in two months. That's probably a tablespoon a day, a tablespoon a day in two months. That's all I need to drink, and I do it medicinally, whether I do it or not. Sometimes I'll go two weeks without drinking water, or even a month without drinking water, and then I'll have maybe a half a cup in a day, only an ounce or a tablespoon at a time into space throughout the day. Just when I feel like I'm having some kind of breakout and my body needs more solvent to help dissolve the toxicity. So, water is not a good thing. Salt is terrible. Salt is the worst thing next to cooking. Salt is an explosive. When you reduce sodium to only sodium molecules, they're the smallest mineral there is. When they clump together as pure sodium, they're an explosive. More volatile than nitroglycerin. My father worked on that project for about 35 years. It was given to General Electric two billion dollars later. Cannot make it, still cannot control it. A three billion dollar degree and a half temperature change can ignite it. A football size of pure sodium can take out New York City and all of the buildings. It's worth about 12 megaton hydrogen bombs. In your body, I don't care if you're having a sodium potassium combination, sodium iodide, no matter what it is, your body will separate the sodium from the other ions with it because it is rock. It is not in food. It will isolate.

Then you'll have all these explosions going off in your blood, in your digestive tract, damaging all kinds of things. If you want to really see the reality of that, because I know it's hard for a lot of people to believe, there was a group of three guys who were going to ridicule me about the salt business, and they took three frog legs skinned. I mean, they're dead frogs, right? You've got dead frog legs. Do you think there's any neurological reaction? You can poke it. Nothing happens. They took salt, and they poured salt on both sides. You see, and it shows only two minutes of it. And you see these legs going like this. And it went on for almost 20 minutes, but they only showed two minutes. And then I said, okay. And they put it on. They were ridiculing me. They didn't think it was going to happen. And then they took a frog leg and I said, what do you think pepper would do? And they said, well, it's hot and abrasive. It would burn it, probably have lots of jumping. I said, pepper is not an explosive. It may burn tissue, but the tissue would have to be alive. Tissue doesn't have to be alive to be exploding. It just needs moisture. So they poured, they took one frog leg that hadn't, you know, another frog leg that hadn't been treated with the salt. And they poured, you know, just kept putting the pepper on and the pepper on, made one jerk and that was the end of it. Poured the pepper on. Understand salt is an explosive. When your cells eat, they'll eat a combination of 93 to 117 nutrients. Vitamin A, D, all the B vitamins, all the D factors, all the minerals, all the protein, everything in these smorgasbords. You put salt in there and it starts exploding these apart. So when a cell goes to open up and draw in that smorgasbord, maybe it gets 20, 50 nutrients. All of them are malnourished. Every cell in your body is malnourished when you eat salt. Not a good thing. So, careful. Don't eat salt. Period. Worst thing you can do. Unless, like I said, I only gave it for one remedy in the book. If you truly have adrenal exhaustion, you need to help a little explosive to get things going. And I say only three grains a week. Three tiny little bitty grains dissolved in vegetable juice or water or something. And best in vegetable juice because you've got other nutrients that will help react with it.

So, that is the only remedy that I've ever given with salt. And that's only for a short time. Very short time. Salt is a deadly poison. King and Queen of England knows this. They're the ones who started the salt business. And they went to India and saw the Indians as very, very progressive people. Good business people. They were trading with China and everything. So, the King and Queen of England, the Windsor family, went and started buying up all these companies and infiltrating everything. And they made the market in India in salt. Most of the salt that was sold in the world, and very few people got it, was made in India. And it was illegal to make your own salt in India. It was a death sentence if you got caught. A death sentence to go out and take sea water and make your own salt. To dry it and make your own salt. Death sentence from the King and Queen of England. This was way before Parliament came into being. So, they put a monopoly on it. Of course, when Gandhi came around, he blew that. In 1947, he did a demonstration on the beach and people were killed, beaten to death. It got so bad that he had 10,000 to 30,000 people, depending upon the day, out there on that beach. And they were killing hundreds of people every day. And it was getting so embarrassing on the world news for England that the King and Queen of England said, okay, we give you your freedom and you can make salt. But that was salt. The King and Queen of England were some of the richest people in the world, early in the 1100s, long, long time ago. They were also responsible for the Black Plague. A lot of people say, well, what about the Black Plague? I mean, that was a microbe, wasn't it? Wasn't that a microbe from the rats? The rats caused the Black Plague. Okay, let's think back. What happened in 1310? The Windsor family, King and Queen of England, decided to sell coal, get people using coal to cook foods with and heat their homes. What is the byproduct of coal? Mercury. Why do you think we have so much mercury in our environment? Because we burn coal to produce energy. Mercury is highly toxic. So, what happens after 60 years of people burning coal in their homes without proper ventilation? Mercury poisoning in their lungs, thallium poisoning in their lungs, aluminum poisoning in their lungs from using coal. 

It's the Black Plague. It was the Black Lung. The Black Plague was called the Black Lung. Oh, but Mr. Blaine is on the rats. People out there are idiots. They don't know what's going on. The King and Queen of England knew. That's when they started making sure that everybody built chimneys and that's when that is, besides Rome, that was the first declared building restriction, building code. You had to have a chimney so you could burn coal to support the King and Queen of England instead of burning wood. Nobody on the farms is still burned with wood in the heat of their house with wood or cooked the rocks outside and brought the rocks in to heat the house so they'd have no carbon monoxides in the house. They didn't get black lungs, it was only city environments where they used coal to cook with and heat their houses. You have to understand all of this crap that they blame on swines, the monkey flu, the monkey AIDS, you know, all of this nonsense, the bird flu, it's ridiculous. They want you to distrust you in nature. They want you to hate and be afraid of nature. It is chemical poisoning, industrial pollution that you need to fear. If you get chemicals on your body, you take coconut cream, you take something that's natural and get it off so you feed your hands properly and your body properly. You don't get something on your hands that's food like a little meat bacteria and then go put some kind of Clorox on your hands or some kind of petroleum substance that eats into your hands and poisons your body. That's what we have in society right now. They want you to poison yourself and everything with chemicals because of bacteria. That you're 99.99%? Doesn't make any sense. Don't fall for it anymore. Q&A. Any questions I didn't answer?

Q: Cold water or milk? Does it matter if it's warm or cold?

A: Of course. If you drink cold milk, it has a tendency to absorb into the stomach lining without digestion. So you can get some casein, some lactate in the blood without digestion. That can cause a slight bit of allergy. Most people won't notice it, but it might cause a little itchy anus, a little yeast infections. For women, it creates a lot of vaginal infections, a vaginal yeast because their body will throw off that undigested lactate down there and then the yeast has to break it down in the tissues because it gets caught up in the tissue and then you've got a yeast infection.

Q: So the best way to have it is just room temperature?

A: Yeah. Now if you want to drink cold milk, what you do to cool the body because the brain is the one that doesn't like to get cold or hot, remember that. So if you're hot, all you have to do is cool the brain. You put the cold milk in your mouth and you let it stay in your mouth until everything gets cold and the milk gets warm. Then you swallow it. You do that five times and your brain is going to be cold. If you drink that cold water, that cold is going to make your digestive tract cold. You're going to be absorbing nutrients that aren't properly digested and then you're not going to cool that brain. So you can drink all day this cold stuff and it's barely going to help. It's the brain you need to cool so you hold the coldness in your mouth. Mouth dryness is not dehydration, it's delipidation. You put a little honey on your lips to keep them from getting dry. You put a little butter on your tongue and let that, allow that to absorb into your mouth. Why do you think people are so wrinkled in the face? And that's the thing that wrinkles the first in life. Because more poisons dump into the mouth out of the brain, those metal poisons, than anywhere else in the body. So your body absorbs all the fats out of the face to deal with these poisons that are dumping out the gums, the tongue, and the salivary glands. So everything you start drying up and wrinkling. You put butter or butter honey mixture in your mouth, you put honey on your lips, you're not thirsty. Yet, you're dry mouthed and you thought you were thirsty. And you didn't even need to drink anything to get rid of it. Now I drink two quarts of milk a day, and I won't drink any water, like I said, for a long time or maybe a tablespoon a day of that. And I sip it. I suck it, as you see. I suck it all day long, in between things. There's also a sport formula for those people who exercise or are exposed to a lot of perspiration, a lot of heat. And that is, it could be a combination of alternative things. But it's three cups of some type of puree or whey. You could use a cup of whey, a cup of tomato puree, a cup of cucumber puree. You could use a cup of watermelon puree. Watermelon causes more perspiration than any other food on this planet. You eat a watermelon and you will secrete very, very well, perspire very well, especially in a hot bath. You could use milk instead of the whey and have it with tomato or watermelon or, you know, any combination.

Take those four substances or five substances and you can rotate them and change them. The other ingredients to a sport formula is tablespoon of vinegar, tablespoon of lime juice, tablespoon of lemon juice, two tablespoons of dairy cream, two tablespoons of coconut cream is optional. It will help clean a little bit, especially in your sports persons to get the lactic acid out of the system quicker. Whey is more helpful for that too rather than milk, whole milk, to get rid of lactic acid byproducts from metabolism. Then have two to four eggs in it, two tablespoons of honey, and you can have two to four ounces of naturally sparkling mineral water. Blend all that together and sip it. It tastes absolutely phenomenal, especially with the vinegar in those, lemon and tomato, I mean lemon and lime juice and honey, everything in there, and most people just want to, when it's hot, don't do it. You sip it a little at a time. The more you drink, the faster you drink... You're going to separate, you're going to urinate it out, and all the nutrients have no H2O to carry to the cells with the nutrients. That will cause dehydration. When I used to drink two gallons of water, I would go nuts if I didn't have it. The more water I drank, the more I had to drink. If I drink, let's say, two ounces of water a day, I'll want more water the next day. If I don't drink water and I just drink the sport formula and milk and have no water whatsoever, I never miss water. Water causes more dehydration and more and dilutes everything and makes you more hungry for water, but that's not the water you can assimilate and take to the cells. It has to be bound in nutrients in food. OK?

Q: I have a two-part question just about dogs. Do you ever prescribe like a certain diet for a dog or certain ratios? And then also, if it's mandatory to vaccine them in your area, do you have a protocol to help them deal with that better?

A: Well, you've given me two illegal questions. You said, would I prescribe? I'm not a licensed veterinarian, so I cannot prescribe. I can suggest. I would not ever vaccinate my animals even if it were. So for me, I would go to the point of taking an old vaccination certificate with the copy machines we have today, the scanners. You could forge your own. I would forge mine. I would not poison my animals. I would not poison my children. I just would not do it. I would forge first or I would find a veterinarian who was advertised or advertises as natural and there are some out there that even promote raw diets for their animals. That one I would go to in secrecy, perfect silence, out of the, off of the phone, out of their office and say, listen, catch them when they're coming out of the door and say, listen, I really don't want to vaccinate my animals. Would you just jab them with water and maybe have dipped it into the vaccine and pulled it out and really have just a trace amount of the vaccine in it and inject them with glucose water or just water or whatever. Would you do that and then sign the, you know, if he thinks that, if he can trust you, if he doesn't think that you're a government agent trying to pull one over on him, he might do it. Otherwise I would forge it.

Q: She looks like a [unintelligible].

A: Well, I don't care. I'm telling you what I would do.

Q: And then how would you suggest a diet for a dog?

A: Dogs are scavengers. The rottener the meat the better. Dogs and cats melt. They have to have bones. If they don't have bones they'll chew your furniture apart, they'll scrape everything, they'll chew on things, your shoes no matter what. You give them raw bone steak, they're going to be happy. They have hydrochloric acid 15 times the amount of ours in the stomach. We produce the same amount of hydrochloric acid. We do this throughout the small intestines. Their small intestines are very short, one-tenth of what ours is. So they pour hydrochloric acid into the stomach, it dissolves bones. If they have only meat, that'll only use up a third, a fifth of the hydrochloric acid. They need bones to dissolve it. They're going to be nervous, they're going to be bone deficient, they're going to get weak bones, they're going to get breakable bones, and they're going to be very moody. 

Q: So it's mainly just the meat and the bones?

A: Meat and bones, if you've got a sick animal, feed them butter and honey too. Give them a little fruit once in a while. Dogs eat anything out in the wild.

Q: They love milk.

A: Yes, they love milk, but milk is better for cats. Milk is okay, but it's better if they get more bones. Milk is probably a little bit better for maybe six weeks, to give a lot of milk to a dog. But they're going to get diarrhea from it. They've got too much hydrochloric acid.

Q: Is there a certain ratio to their weight that you should feed them in meat?

A: It depends upon the hyperactivity of the animal. An animal that's in a house, not living outdoors, in a rough climate, half a pound, three-quarters of a pound a day, if they're 80 pounds. If it's an English Mastiff, 260 pounds, a pound and a quarter a day is all they need. Because they're not doing anything. And the more meat they eat, the more they want to play. And if you have a 240 pound mad English Mass that says, hi mom, you're going to be on the floor with brain damage.

Q: What about oysters?

A: Oysters are great. Thank you for reminding me about oysters. About six years ago I'd been dealing with a British woman who had a lot of psychological problems. And getting her to eat the high meat was going to be impossible. And I needed to get the poison metals out of her digestion tract to get her to a normal psychological state. Because she wouldn't eat the high meat. She would do it once in a while. She wouldn't do it regularly. She had a fear about it. And there was no changing her mind. So I thought, well, oysters, even though they can live in polluted waters, build all of their toxins into the shell and they are clean. Clams, urchin, all the other shell food animals don't have that ability, but the oyster does. So I thought, okay, I'll get her to eat six oysters a day, three in the morning with half a cup of red meat, three in the evening with half a cup of red meat. Do that six days a week and then on the seventh day, no oysters and whatever else other meat she wanted to eat. She did that religiously for a year. That was something she could do and she did do. In that one year, she removed as much metal as most people will remove in three to five years. So since that six years, I've had over 200 people do it and it's worked in every situation to remove more metals. 

Q: For how many months did you say? How many months did she eat it?

A: She did it for a whole year, for 12 months.

Q: A whole year?

A: She's still doing it, not as much and as often, but I have lots of people that are doing it.

Q: You mentioned that the cod liver oil, pure cod liver oil, is kind of a chemical supplement, right?

A: Well, it's not a chemical supplement. If you get the fermented one, it's like eating butter.

Q: Okay. Now, because I count on it as a vitamin D source at this latitude because there is no vitamin D available in the winter here.

A: Yes, there is.

Q: From what?

A: As long as there's light, you have the radiation from the sun. And here in the northern hemisphere, you know, we still get sunlight. As long as you have sunlight, you're getting vitamin D. As long as you're eating the proper fats, cream won't do it. Cream cannot be converted into vitamin D. So don't put cream on your skin and expect to get vitamin D. Use either whole milk to put on your skin or butter. And you will convert that. That fat on your skin will be converted into a vitamin D. 

Q: So not from the sun. You're not going to get it from the sun in the winter.

A: Yes, you're going to get it from the sun in the winter. Yes, you are.

Q: Because what they are saying is...

A: It just won't be as intense. Yeah, OK. You can go out for an hour in the sun in the summer and get enough, you know, in one hour get enough vitamin D for two weeks. In the winter you may have to go out for an hour once a week, once every three days to get your vitamin D. But milk, cows produce lots of vitamin D. And it's in the milk. It's in the butter, unless you cook it. And then you cook it, you've destroyed your vitamin D. Again, people want to sell you garbage. What is vitamin D in the markets? Hydrogenated vegetable oil exposed to radioactive material. Cod liver oil? Sure, that's vitamin D. But is it fermented? And it will work. It will give you extra.

Q: It's only fermented.

A: Yes, only the fermented and non-flavored. OK. OK. You had a question, yes? You had a question, yes?

Q: I'm actually allergic to oysters and I know that because I throw them back up.

A: That's because your digestion is bad. Give this diet a year and you're going to be able to do it. Also, the oysters may help give you some nutrients to dump poisons from the stomach quickly. Remember I said the stomach is where we have the most concentrated volatile toxins. So your body may be able to digest that oyster immediately and cause the vomiting of those substances because you don't have cheese to pass it through. You can experiment. Eat two tablespoons of cheese, then eat your oyster. Eat another tablespoon of cheese. If you vomit it, it's likely you're allergic and you're detoxing too fast. If you're detoxing to an extent where those three tablespoons will take out the poisons, then you're safe. You just have to use the cheese with it. But vomiting, like I said in my books, vomiting is the best way to get rid of toxins. Cheer when you vomit. Let me give you an example. About five years ago, I had a woman who had cancer of the breast. She was only about 40 years old, 37, 40. I think I was 38 to 40 at that time. She wouldn't gain enough weight. She was very skinny. I wanted her to gain 25 to 30 pounds overweight to handle the poisons. Because when cancer cells start dissolving, they have a fluid in them that's like a virus. It dissolves all the dead cells around. Now cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to discard dead cells. Your lymph system isn't dissolving the dead cells. So what happens, they collect. The cancer cell is a favorable janitor. It has this serum in it that is highly accurate, that's a solvent. Just like a cell builds a solvent virus to dissolve tissue because tissue is too toxic. I didn't do that yet, so I should go into that as soon as I finish this. So the cancer cell, when the body is ready and able to, can remove the waste product and be highly caustic. Start to dissolve, they'll die. That serum will be released and kill all the dead cells that are around that one cancer cell. And you can have 50 to 200 dead cells around the cancer cell. And you have circulation in there to help move the poisons out, blood and lymph. If your lymph is working very well, you're not going to have a big problem with dissolving that tumor. If you've got a benign tumor, what happens is you can't get rid of it. There's no circulation into it, there's no cancer cells to dissolve it, so your body has to go in and work away at it a little at a time, a tiny bit at a time. A malignant tumor, you could dissolve in 2 to 5 days. It may take only a year, but a benign tumor could take 35 to 50 years or never dissolve.

Q: How effective is vitamin B17 against cancer?

A: It didn't work for Steve McQueen, it didn't work for quite a few movie stars. Larry Moss, who worked on that, worked in animals, but it just doesn't seem to work. It worked with the mice, but it doesn't seem to work with people the same way. Laetrile. I found people eating apricot seeds for all the laetrile and die anyway, not help a bit. Remember, nuts are very difficult to digest. So to get the laetrile out of a nut, digested properly, is going to be a feat in itself. Somebody has already cancer, their whole system is broken down in many, many ways. So they're not likely to recover easily. Anyway, this woman had breast cancer. And I like people to get very fat when they have cancer. And I mean at least 30 pounds overweight is what I prefer. Because there's going to be a point where they start vomiting for days or weeks, these poisons, and that's going to be a reversal of the cancer. Even a doctor came out five years ago and he said that, and I've been saying that for 25 years, most cancer reverses immediately after a very nasty flu because that's the poisons releasing, detoxifying out of the system. Coughing it up, vomiting it up, diarrhea, all of that. It's the release of those poisons. So when they go into that, they better have a lot of weight or else they'll die. So this woman only went 15 pounds overweight. She went into her cell after about three years on the diet, maintained life pretty normally, worked. She didn't go into any kind of a chronic state until that time when she started doing her vomiting. And then she became bedridden after a few weeks. She was vomiting anywhere from two to ten times daily. Her stomach was wrenching. And after six weeks of vomiting, that's the longest I'd ever seen anybody go, I told her, I said, I need you to give me four ounces of her vomit. So I took that four ounces of vomit, sent it to a laboratory, $2,300 to check it for everything. The laboratory, not the technician, but the actual head of the laboratory called me and said, have to make this call, somebody's poisoning your patient. And I said, which one? And she said, number, da, da, da. He said, number, da, da, da. That was that cancer patient I sent in for the breast cancer vomit. And I said, what do you mean somebody's poisoning her? And he said, well, she has 3,000 times the lethal dose of thallium in that vomit, in that four ounces of vomit. And I said, nobody's trying to poison her. 

Thallium is a rat poison also, like sodium fluoride. And a lot of old maids or, you know, wives, women who wanted to get rid of their husbands poisoned them with thallium gradually. So the police department, all police departments inform all laboratories, and it's part of the policy. It's a state and federal rule, county rule, that if you have a high rate of thallium in any or sodium chloride in anybody's laboratory test, it has to be reported to the police and to the doctor. They have to be called separately and made aware of it so it doesn't go to a nurse and get sidetracked. So I said, nobody's poisoning her. She and her husband had only been married five years. They were crazy in love. He had nothing to gain with her death, you know, so it had nothing to do with that. What the problem was, she was a metallurgist. She made silver jewelry over a Bunsen burner, never wore a mask and never wore gloves. Put some silver, thallium, mercury, aluminum, cadmium, all the things that create cancer. So she had inhaled it all of those years. And what glands are responsible for cleaning the lungs? The lymph glands around the breast and the armpits. She got breast cancer. Vomiting, got rid of 3,000 times a lethal dose of a poison. One vomit. Can't get that out of diarrhea. I've had many diarrhea checked, even her diarrhea checked, and it wasn't a tenth that. It wasn't a hundredth that. So vomit, and I've had other vomits that I've checked too, highly intense. Remember, like I said, the stomach is where the body will put the most caustic, deadly poisons. And when they come up, great. If you're eating cheese frequently, you may not have to vomit it, you just pass it through. But if it gets more intense than the cheese can handle, then you're going to vomit. If you vomit, you cheer. You have a party. Because you've gotten well much quicker by doing that. Now, let's talk about bacteria, parasites, fungus, and virus. Now, I talked about them being janitors very early on today. They're all janitorial. I talked about the salmonella, how it's janitorial for the surface of the body. You don't find salmonella internally very often. And what it does is because the tissue that's in the body is eating cooked tissue, cooked skin from a chicken, something like that. And it goes to break down the skin that you're eating.

So, there you'll have salmonella because that salmonella digests the skin. It's a natural part of skin. It's not a bad thing, but you don't blame the janitors for cleaning up the mess. What created the mess? The processed, cooked or processed food caused the mess and the contamination. Now, the parasites are your best detoxifiers. They can eat 100 times their weight in 24 hours and their waste is only 1-5%. So, let's say you have 100 pounds of waste in your house and you have a janitor who can come and clean 100% of it and only leave a 1-5 pound bag of something you have to carry out. That's pretty efficient. I want that guy. I want that janitor. That's great. I always carry out a 1-5 pound bag of garbage. Bacteria can eat up to 50 times their weight in 24 hours. That's half of what a parasite can do, but still only 1-5% of its waste. I want that janitor too. Fungus has a little bit more problem there. Fungus has a tendency to be very dry, their waste products, and their waste products can be anywhere from 5-10%. It causes more itching, dryness of skin, and those toxins lead to the vaginal cavity, skin, mucus membranes, wherever, eyes, itchy eyes, wherever that discharges, the waste from fungus discharges. But fungus can still eat 50 times their weight in 24 hours. Some can even do more, up to 100. But there is more waste product. So those are our natural, normal, and happy janitors. When the tissue is so toxic, that those three janitors cannot eat that organic tissue, cellular waste and tissue, without dying from pollution, then how are you going to get rid of it in the body? Can't. So what the body does, the cells do, they make solvents out of oils, some fats, and they will make a solvent to dissolve that tissue. So it's like you're having, let's say, somebody ran over your cat on the garage floor. You've got bone tissue, you've got all kinds of tissue in that concrete. You've got blood, you've got hair, and it's stuck in that cement. Got deep down into it. So you scrape off what you can. How are you going to clean up the rest of it? You take a solvent, muriatic acid or something, and you put it in there. You dilute it. Why? Water is a solvent. It makes it even more powerful. So you put the water, and you scrape that up, and you brush it up. It mixes with the fluids. You do it a few times, and then you've got what? Two-gallon, two-and-a-half-gallon bucket of poison. Where's it going to go? You're going to dump it into the street, into the rest of the water system. 

It's going to go out to the lake, to the ocean, go into the well water. That's what's happening. In the human body, it's the same thing. Viruses are not alive no matter what you hear. That's a fallacy. Whenever you have a virus, and you say, show me a virus. If they're looking for one in that tissue, they will show you tissue particles with solvent-type solutions, and that's it. There's nothing alive in it. Sure, you have RNA and DNA and genes from animal tissue, animal cells that were dissolved, but there's nothing alive in it. 30 years ago, doctors didn't prescribe antibiotics for a virus. It was senseless. There was nothing alive to kill. But the pharmaceutical industry 28, 29 years ago decided, hey, if we can get people to believe that viruses are alive, they'll take antibiotics. We'll make a bunch of money. So all the new doctors that are training, they teach them viruses are alive. They never put them in a laboratory to prove it, to prove anything. So they come out and they're spouting out their misinformation. Oh, here, take this antibiotic for this virus. And what do you have? A bunch of robots telling other robots to take something poisonous. And it's insane. It's ridiculous. And what do you have? What happens when you have spinal meningitis that is viral or bacterial? Or even cerebral meningitis? A doctor will tell you that a bacterial meningitis, whether it's cerebral or spinal, is not that dangerous. Why? Because the bacteria is consuming the waste product, so there's hardly any swelling. In a viral condition, where there's no consumption of the waste to reduce it, there is a fluid increase. So there's a massive amount of swelling in the spinal cord and brain, paralysis, or death. So you have to understand the physics of things, and the biochemistry, so you don't get sucked into their chemical nonsense. It makes you think you're stupid, and they're the ones who are stupid. They accept everything they're told from the pharmaceutical industry. Don't accept it. Don't be a sucker into it. Those are all janitors. Even the virus is a janitor, but that's in very toxic tissue, industrially toxic tissue. It would kill the bacteria, the parasites, and the fungus if they ate that tissue. So you have to deal with the flu. The flu is predominantly viral. The cold is predominantly bacterial. If the mucus is pretty clear and gray, it is a virus. If it's yellow or off-yellowish, it's bacterial. If it's green, it's fungal. Unless you consumed something like formaldehyde, and then the green can be viral. But that's a chemical green rather than a fungal green. And I can tell when I look at it. If the green is iridescent, it's a chemical. If it's dull green, then it's a fungal. Okay, more questions.

Q: What would you think of drinking raw maple sap, perhaps instead of vegetable juice, or just in general?

A: Okay, maple sap is the fat of a tree. What did I say about vegetable oils? It will harden your system.

Q: I understand it was mostly water and 4% sugar and hardly any oil or fat in it at all.

A: Okay, you're talking about a cooked, processed product.

Q: No, just when they collect the juice or the sap from the trees into the buckets.

A: Okay, if you do that, you're eating mostly fat. Vegetable oil fat from a tree. It's a resin. It will harden in your system.

Q: Well, I've looked up the analysis of it. I've looked up the nutrient analysis of raw maple sap.

A: You can take a nutrient analysis of a rock. But can you digest rock? You can take a nutrient analysis of anything. You can melt anything, dissolve anything in a chemistry lab and say, oh, it's made up of minerals, so many minerals, so many carbs, so many proteins, so many fats. That doesn't mean you can digest it. We are not made to eat that kind of, that concentration of vegetable oils. We have our vegetables, which we can juice. You get into herbs, and I say, keep those herbal formulas down to 5%. Herb things that you may juice, herbal things you may juice. Because the oil gets to be too much, and it can be heavily detoxifying. You get into maple syrup, and you're asking for a lot of, you're asking for MS, you're asking for bone deterioration, arthritis, rheumatism, intestinal problems, all kinds of myriads of reactions. Hardening of the heart. That is for animals that eat trees. Pigs can eat some tree, but not very much. Because they'll have the same reaction. Elephants are tree eaters. They can handle maple syrup, no problem. Giraffes can eat maple syrup, no problem. But they're built for that. They're built to eat bark and trees. Eat a tree. Show me you can eat a tree. You know, you have hard enough time with celery, or a leaf, and you take bark into your system, or the heart of a hard tree, you're not going to digest a fraction, not even a .0001% of that tree. Can't do it. But when you bleed the tree of its fat, or concentrated vegetable, you're really asking for trouble. So they highly process it, and then dilute it. When you buy maple syrup, if you get maple syrup out of a tree, within five hours of it being out of the tree, it thickens and really gets hard. So they mix it with chemicals, they process it and heat it. Garbage. Toxic. Yes?

Q: What is the best kind of milk? Is it sheep, or is it goat, or is it camels, or a cow?

A: Well, I found sheep is, with the linoleic acid, the high rate of linoleic acid. We call it lanolin. But if somebody is very overweight, and has no energy, goat's milk is better. Because it has adrenal precursors. Everybody ever see a calm goat? No. They're always skinny. You'll never see a fat goat, unless it's fed real garbage in a feeding lot. And they're hyperactive. They'll eat nails. They'll eat everything. They will eat anything and digest anything. They can eat bark. That's another animal. Goats can eat bark. But they're hyperactive. If you've got a sugar problem, diabetes, overweight, goat's milk is better. If you're skinny, normal weight, always cow's milk is better. Sheep's milk is the best, of course. But I never had that over an extended period of time. I've had it for maybe a two or three week period of time. I've never had the enjoyment of being able to experiment with it for a long period.

Q: One more question, sorry. So can you tell us what happens if we start to do like 70% or 80% and have a little of this and get back? You know, I feel like it can create a lot of acidity.

A: Well, it all depends on what you're eating that's off the raw menu. Just remember what I say to everybody. If you only ate one raw food in your life, you would be doing your body a benefit. You'd be providing enzymes and life. Enzymes aren't alive. It's a protein substance that helps digestion. But a lot of raw foodists are going around saying, live enzymes. You've got live and active bacteria. You've got live and active vitamins. You've got enzymes. You've got minerals. You've got all that kind of stuff. And if you eat that one food, you're going to be happier and healthier. Every time you eat something cooked and processed, depending upon how it's processed, the point at which it's processed, how many chemicals are in it, depends upon how much damage you're going to do to yourself. So let's say you eat 70% raw meat and raw dairy, and then you go have a half a cup of steamed or boiled rice every day with raw butter. And let's say you have a cup of coffee. That's more of a natural, without being raised with chemicals, stuff like that. So that's 30% of your diet not so good. That's not going to be as harmful. If you go in and buy a cereal that's made with GMO products, that's had all kinds of 60 varieties of chemicals in it, including aspartame and all those other toxins, you're going to do some severe damage. It's going to take a lot more raw nutrients to handle that toxicity. So you make your choice how healthy you want to be and how much you want to damage yourself. I have no judgment about it. I've had people come to me before my books came out, and I used to have to lecture them to a whole group like this to receive cancer patients and patients because they had to know the diet before they could do the whole thing. So right before I started doing that, I had patients who would come in to see me who had cancer and had no knowledge about the diet whatsoever, and I would tell them a little bit during the whole, you know, do it individually, like 10 hours per person. And I was charging $700 to $1,000 a person. And I had people say to me, Oh my gosh, you know I can't have donuts anymore? I can't have cake anymore? I said, well, it's either that or take a big risk with cancer. I'd rather die of cancer than do that. I have no judgment about that. If that's the way you want to die and go, hey, it's okay with me. I went through my stuff, and I got through my stuff. If you need to venture that way and come back or die that way, that's all your choice. It's your life. So I make no judgment about it. I'm just here to show you how I got out of it and how I've helped other people extricate themselves from disease and pain and suffering so you didn't have to go that way. But it is a change. It's a huge change. But it's a favorable change if you can do it. Yes?

Q: I just have a question about, since we're in Canada and we have winters where we don't have fresh tomatoes and cucumbers and things, what do you suggest for winter and producing?

A: The Eskimos don't eat any fruit at any time. You don't need it.

Q: So just meat and dairy?

A: You just eat meat and dairy and honey. Honey is your enzyme. Honey, the bees collect the nectar. They swallow it. They pre-digest it, make an insulin-like substance that converts 90% of the carbohydrate into the honey, into enzymes for digesting and utilizing protein and fats. Pretty incredible. Then they get back to the hive and they vomit. That's what honey is. You're not going to be squeamish when you leave here, are you? We eat shit, we eat vomit, we eat urine, we eat sweat. That's our diet. That really is our diet. But that honey vomit is pretty good, isn't it? Pretty incredible. That one tastes good. So, you know, as long as you're getting some honey, you don't need that other stuff. Vegetable juice, you might still try to get some out of something. You could eat pears, a little bit of pears. Some winter, fall and winter fruit. A little bit, you know. That will keep you enzymatically charged. But honey, in a place like this where you can't get much of anything, then, of course, your honey is the best source.

Q: See, the Japanese, they eat the sashimi with salmon and wasabi. Is that a good combination?

A: Now, this wasabi that they sell in the Japanese restaurant sushi bars is green from a D-76 color, so-called food coloring. It is a poison. It's not real color. It's not its real color. It's horseradish. Take a horseradish and make a mince of it. Make your own horseradish and take that to the sushi bar with you. And make sure you go to a true Asian-run sushi bar. Americans and other Caucasians who run these sushi bars put MSG and a lot of other crap on it because they're so afraid somebody will get bacteria. Asians have been eating this forever. They don't worry about the bacteria. They just make sure they take care of it cleanly. So be careful. Oh, and I want to talk about one more thing. Frozen foods. There's only one thing that can be frozen and be okay, and that's fruit. Meat and fats frozen will cause serious problems. When I did laboratory tests with animals, I fed one group the same meat, unfrozen, and the other, frozen, same side of beef. In six weeks, the one who ate it frozen, and they only got water, just a little bit of water, both groups. That's all they ate. And all the fecal matter was cleaned, so nobody got any fecal matter. Nobody got to eat anybody else's fecal matter. So it was all cleaned and kept clean. It went down to a mesh wire, you know, like you see in gutters, where you've got wire going, steel going this way and cross-membered so it falls through, but strong enough so they don't fall through and they don't hurt themselves. So they didn't eat anything but the frozen or non-frozen meat and a little good well water. The ones who had the frozen meat within six weeks, every one of them had a skin disorder, all the way from mange to psoriasis, skin peeling off, leaking and bleeding. The group that ate it unfrozen, no problems. They weren't itching, they weren't scratching, they were calm, they were fine. So then I took the group with the skin disorders and I said, okay, I'm going to do this with butter. I know that butter will clear up, you know, enough butter for long enough will clear up any skin condition, will heal any skin condition. So I fed half of that group frozen butter and the other half non-frozen butter, the same butter from the same farmer. The group that got the non-frozen butter healed five times faster than those that got it with the frozen butter.

Think about that. Anybody tells you that freezing doesn't do anything to the food, they're wrong. It creates disease. But look at the process. When you see a thing frozen, what happens? When it falls out, it immediately melts and goes into decay, whether it's animal tissue, fruit, vegetable, no matter what. Any other questions?

Q: Coconut water.

A: There's no such thing as coconut butter.

Q: Water.

A: Coconut water? Well, coconut water is better than just plain water. However, Asians will only drink about a cup a day, especially women, because it causes bloating. Why it causes bloating, I do not know. I've tried to figure out that for eight years. Still can't figure it out. If I have more than two cups a day, it will cause me bloating. Yes?

Q: I see a lot of people in sandals, ladies in sandals, and the big toe, big bunion, or arthritis. It's like an epidemic now.

A: Yeah. That's all from toxicity, dead cells not being able to remove. You can put pineapple or vinegar, alternate. You don't want to put pineapple on skin every day, because it will start breaking it down and dissolving it. So you want to dissolve it slowly. So you can put vinegar on one day, put pineapple on the next, or vice versa, then three days of butter, then another day of vinegar, then pineapple, then three days of butter. Or you can do vinegar every day, by itself, no pineapple. And you'll just peel those things off a little at a time.

Q: So I don't need my bone, it looks like...

A: Oh, you're talking about the actual bone?

Q: Yeah.

A: That will also help it dissolve. The pineapple will go in to the skin. But like I said, you still can't irritate the skin.

Q: So your diet will take care of that in time, and will it go down?

A: Yeah, so it's going to take time. It's not going to be overnight. It could take six, seven, eight months. Depending upon the size of the bone.

Q: Is that arthritis?

A: Pardon?

Q: Is that arthritis? A deposit or could it be anything? And why is it just on the bone?

A: Arthritis is when your body is using bacteria to digest food in your joints. Like I said, with Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is where the intestines get very thin. You eat, your gut opens, undigested food gets into your gut. Where does the body take it? The body sends it to the joints. The next most resilient place. You've got hard cartilage there. Resilient cartilage. And it starts building acids and bacteria to digest that food that belongs to the intestines, not in the joints. That's 85-90% of arthritis and rheumatism is caused by leaky gut. And that process. Arthritis and rheumatism doesn't come from just deteriorating bones because they have deteriorating bones. You're digesting food in there which is eating away at the bone, the cartilage. Did that answer your question fully? Okay. Question?

Q: What would you suggest to marathon runners that take those gel packs when they've been, like the sugar gel packs, like after 20 kilometers of the run? What would be a healthy thing that you could take?

A: My marathon runners have a little cream, well they have the sport drink is what they have. I used to have them have cream, orange, you know the whole orange blended, not with the rind though. But most of the orange, not the seeds or the rind. With cream and sparkling mineral water. And they would sip that a little bit at a time. But when I came up with the sport drink, much, much better. I had the number one high school male and female tennis champions that have been on the diet since they were 8 and 9 years old. The male, since he was 8, and he had asthma. Asthma so bad he went around like this, a little skinny little boy. Last year was the number one tennis champion in high school. And the number one female, she went into college last year, I mean this year. Or just this past year, the year before she was the number one female champion on the diet. They're out there with one quart, one liter of that sport drink. Their competition are drinking gallons of water in that 5 hour competition. So of course they're getting weak, they're diluting their system with water. And they just take them out, take them out. Marathon runners, the one from New York, when he first got on the diet, in two and a half, no three months, he reduced his time by 40 minutes. And they pray to reduce a minute a year, two minutes a year. 40 minutes in three months. The one from Vegas reduced it 20 minutes in two months. And they still are going wild.

Q: What about ultra marathon runners?

A: Pardon?

Q: What about ultra marathon runners?

A: 100 mile runs? I don't have anybody in that order. I don't know anybody stupid enough to do that. Because what they do is, I know I had an actor friend who did with them every year. And he took two bottles of aspirin to make it through. He had to be confined to his home for two weeks after because what does aspirin do? It doesn't allow for clotting. So his skin turned into toilet paper for two to three weeks after. If you went and touched him like this, you'd tear the skin right off of his arm. So he had to eat lots of cheese and then remineralize himself for the next three weeks. And he would age quicker, all kinds of problems. So I don't suggest anybody do an ultras. Unless they've been on a good raw diet. And they're from the Andes where they do that once a year. And they don't need aspirin. And they can be 90 years old. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Eyes putting egg white in. Take an egg. And you get a little egg white on there. Pull your lower lid down. Look way up. Rub it along the white of the eye. Pull both eyes a little. And then do a ringmaster thing where you spin the eye around and get the egg white all over. Egg white is almost the same consistency as tears only there's more protein. Also you can use raw no salt butter. I've had people use both and correct their vision. Yes?

Q: If you're going to drink water or whatever, is mineral water better to drink than regular water?

A: What's regular water?

Q: Well, whatever, tap water or whatever.

A: Tap water is full of poisons. In L.A. we have 197 chemicals in that water. I wouldn't even bathe in it without something else in it.

Q: I have a system at my house that takes most of the stuff out, but is it still better to drink mineral water than tap water?

A: Let me tell you, there's nothing that can take that stuff out of the water. You can have a three tiered huge house system and you'll only get half of those chemicals out.

Q: So mineral water is better?

A: There are many industrial poisons in all that water. The water I drink is always bottled in glass, naturally sparkling, or still water. Gerolsteiner is my favorite. Apollinaris is my next favorite.

Q: I use Pedras.

A: Pardon? What is it? Pellegrino?

Q: It's from the Azores. It's a naturally sparkling mineral water.

A: No, I don't know that one. I haven't seen it sold in the States. Of course, I've already gone to Gerolsteiner, so I definitely should be able to get new ones that may have come around. As long as it says naturally sparkling, that means that they have to take the gas from the well. In the wells, the artesian wells, you have the water table and you have the gas table. They pipe them and shoot them into the bottles at the same time. It's not like Coca-Cola or Sodapop where they're taking an unnatural chemically formed gas and putting it into a chemical mixture. This is the gas, the natural carbon dioxide from the well going into the same well water that it cohabited with but was not mixed into. Even if it says carbonated water added, it's always added. There's no natural carbonation that exists inside the water. It's in the same well, you shoot them in together. So no matter if it says carbonation added, as long as the words are naturally carbonated. If it says natural carbonated water, you know it's a chemical carbon.

Q: So what should it say?

A: Naturally carbonated. Question?

Q: To heal any particular glandular or organ weakness, would it be of benefit to eat the corresponding raw animal organ?

A: Absolutely. The Indians did it all the time. People come to me with diabetes, I say get a pancreas. Eat the pancreas of an animal. Absolutely. Works much faster. Almost twice as fast.

Q: So for adrenal exhaustion?

A: For adrenal exhaustion, you eat adrenal glands. Yes?

Q: If you sunburn easily, will over time you overcome that?

A: If you go on this diet in 10 days, you won't burn the same. Only 10 days. If you're eating a lot of butter. Like the moisturizing lubrication formula which is on page 146 of the recipe book. That thing that tastes like lemon meringue. You eat one of those every day for 10 days, you are not going to burn. You will burn, but you won't burn and peel usually. Now when you get a burn, I have several remedies in the book, but I found a new remedy that works almost better. Just put straight milk. Straight milk on a burn. And it's miraculous. Almost as miraculous as the primal facial body care cream or the coconut cream.

Q: And is there any damaging effect to being burned by the sun?

A: Not if you're on a good diet. It's healthful.

Q: What about seeds? Pumpkin seeds, buckwheat seeds, sunflower seeds?

A: Like I said, seeds have phytic acid in it. We don't digest them properly. Phytic acid we cannot break down. Herbivores can. Goats, cows, horses. They break down phytic acid. They've got enzymes to counter that. We take the phytic acid... What happens is it destroys our ability to utilize certain minerals. Those minerals are important for utilizing certain proteins. Proteins are important for utilizing and digesting fats. It's a whole chain reaction.

Q: What if you sprout them?

A: Sprout them? Think about this. A lot of your vegetarians and vegans will say, Oh, sprout them. It neutralizes the phytic acid. Yes, it does. But what does it create? It creates three enzymes that mimic exactly phytic acid. So you've got three times the phytic acid reaction. What happens if you feed a bird? Let's say you've got a bird in a cage. And you feed it only sprouts. What happens? Be dead in five days. And a bird's got a gizzard intending to be able to digest all seeds. But when they eat sprouts, they're not an herbivore. It takes an herbivore to eat sprouts. Or a pig can eat sprouts to an extent. If you mix them with milk or sour milk product. But if you fed only sprouts to a pig or any animal, it would kill them. So not a good idea. Alright, we're going to have to call it quits. One more, she didn't ask any questions. So yes, go ahead.

Q: I've been on the diet since you were here speaking in Toronto.

A: Two years ago?

Q: Yeah, back in Toronto. And I'm a singer. And the only problem I'm having is that I think the dairy is taking my singing voice out. I think it's coating the inside of my body, including the vocal cords. And I've lost my singing voice to what I just did.

A: I have hundreds of singers.

Q: What are they doing I'm not doing?

A: You still look pretty dry to me. Pretty thin. You don't have enough fat so you're drying it out. You've got to use more butter. Put butter in your mouth like every half an hour. Even if it's just a quarter of a teaspoon. Just let it absorb into your throat and mouth.

Q: Really? You've got singers that are doing this now?

A: I have probably 150 singers. Some famous. I'm not allowed to give their names. There are models, there are movie stars in this diet. The only one who lets it be known or did let it, he doesn't talk about it anymore, was Mel Gibson. Martin Sheen goes in and out. His wife is on it, stopped brain cancer with it. She does the diet. The other brothers and sisters went on and off the diet. Charlie doesn't want anything to do with it. He likes his drugs and his crazy life.

Q: Demi Moore?

A: Demi Moore is a fruitarian.

Q: Is she?

A: She's very skinny. I think she's getting into the dairy now. She and Crutcher. So they were both raw food fruitarians. They had vegans for about 8 years, 6 years. And I think that she's just now going off of it. And getting a little healthier. You saw her in Charlie's Angels, how skinny she was. I mean, that was frightening. After being on the raw food fruitarian diet for 5 years.

Q: Just one quick question. Because of my arthritis, I've got cirrhotic arthritis. I'm very lactose intolerant.

A: No, you're not.

Q: It's raw.

A: You're lactose intolerant with cauterized lactate from pasteurized dairy. You won't have that with raw. Some people, when they eat the raw, they'll start getting rid of the stored lactate from the cauterized lactate. So it won't be an allergy to the fresh dairy, raw dairy. It'll be an allergy of discarding that stuff that's been made part of your body that was from the pasteurized. If you have that problem, like I say in the book, have 2 to 6 ounces a day, but only 2 ounces at a time. And you have that for 3 months, and then you'll have it. Be rid of it. That toxin will be out of the body.

Q: I haven't drank milk in 10 years, so regular milk, just raw milk.

A: I've had people that were never able to drink it their whole life, and they get the raw milk, and they say, oh my god, you know, this is a whole new experience. Okay, just one more, and then I'll tell you.

Q: I was just going to ask, I understand that our physiology is more to eat the raw meat and the animal products, but why is it that some vegans short-term can heal diseases or improve symptoms? How does that work?

A: They stop eating all the poisonous, chemically processed food, and they go into raw foods where there's usually less contamination. There's more life in the food, so they can get well, but it's temporary. Right. I've only known eight vegetarians out of 2,300 who could do it long-term. That's not a good ratio.

Q: Are you saying it's not good to be a vegan?

A: It's terrible for most people.

Q: My daughter's a vegan.

A: Like I said, I've only known eight people, and they were all athletically oriented. They had high testosterone, progesterone, even if they were men, they had high progesterone too, and the women had high testosterone, but there was only one woman in the group. Seven men, one woman. And they all had high thyroid, adrenal, and testosterone and estrogen. High amounts.

Q: She's tired all the time, my daughter. She's tired 24 hours a day.

A: She's certainly not a vegan.

Q: She just...

A: She won't handle it. Okay, folks, thank you all for coming. Thank you very much. Now we're going to start. We're going to take a 10-minute, 15-minute break, or 12-minute break, and then we're going to start doing mini consults. How many are here for mini consults? Oh, one, two...

[break]

A: Now we're going to have to have silence. Oh, we also need somebody. Did you have a recorder? Okay. Record this, definitely. If you don't have a recorder, have somebody write for you. Absolutely. Even if you're not staying for the minis, you can stay and listen. You're going to learn more. Okay, so when you sit here, I want you to let your hands go completely limp, even your thumbs limp, okay? The left ovary is quite a bit of scar tissue, probably 70% to 30% alive and working. Your adrenal gland left is very good. The left side of the pancreas is about 50% alive, that's plenty. We only use 10% of the pancreas on this diet. The left thyroid is okay, a little protein deficient. Parathyroid is the same. Tonsil area is very, very poor. Poor circulation into small intestines. A lot of metal poisoning all over. A ton of lymphatic waste under your skin. You'll see lymphatic congestion, but a lot of lymphatic waste under the skin. The right ovary is in pretty good shape. The right adrenal gland is a little protein deficient, but good. The right side of the pancreas, very scarred, only about 15% alive. So your whole pancreas all together is probably no more than 30% alive. You'll be diabetic when you hit 10, so you still have a ways to go, but don't test it. The right thyroid is fair. Parathyroid is very good. Tonsil area is very poor. Again, lymphatic waste all over the body. You do have some lymphatic congestion all throughout the intestinal tract. The liver is somewhat protein deficient. Were you a vegan? Vegetarian? For how long?

Q: Two years.

A: Really ate your body up. And the only way you're going to get protein back in that quantity is to eat tall meat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: For how long? Pardon?

Q: Five, six years.

A: Five, six years and you still have this problem?

Q: Last year I didn't have very much.

A: Well, you need to eat meat every day. About a pound every day. You've got a lot of weakness here. Just eat up the tissue. Hot baths, you definitely need that. You've got lots of metals in the brain on both quadrants. Lots of metals in your adrenal gland. And ovary. Extra bile. So I'm going to suggest a vegetable juice of 30% carrot, 25% celery, 25% cucumber puree, 10% cilantro, 5% zucchini, and 5% beet. Red beet. Want you to put in an egg or two and every time you have a vegetable juice, never more than 6 ounces of vegetable juice at a time. Maybe only two times a day. Meat wise, you need all the meats. A little bit more red meat. Your white blood cells seem to be okay, but your red blood cells are very weak. So it shows a lot of anemia. However, there are some indications that if you eat only red meat, you're going to be irritable. So you eat raw egg with it or eat some kind of fish or chicken. Just some kind of red meat, a little bit with it. Eggs are usually pretty good to neutralize that over acidity. And you need a pound a day, definitely. So that's a cup and a quarter now. Twice daily. Fruit wise, dark berries, blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries mostly. I would suggest a half a cup or a tiny bit more with two and a half tablespoons of coconut cream. You can do up to three. And a whole tablespoon of dairy cream. If you don't do the coconut cream then you do two and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. The coconut cream will help clean the metals out sooner and quicker. Pineapple, half a cup on the opposite days. With three tablespoons of coconut cream, one and a half tablespoons of dairy cream and just a quarter of a teaspoon of bean-sized amount of butter. Now, you have a tendency to be very, very critical. You've got some artist nature there. You get bored easily. If you expect other people to entertain you, you're going to be frightfully disappointed in everybody. That's for your own creativity. Don't even judge one art form that you did one day to another. That was you the day before and that was an exciting trip. Today is a new you. And if you look at it that way, you'll never be disappointed when you have a critical. And you need about a quart and a half, six cups of milk a day and about three tablespoons of butter minimum.

[audio cut]

A: The ovary is okay. You've got some scar tissue and [unintelligible] loss. It's probably about two-thirds of the size it should be. The left adrenal side of the pancreas is about 63%. That's very good. Left thyroid is very good. Parathyroid is excellent. Tonsil area is poor. This ovary is almost non-existent. Very watery, very sallow. The right adrenal band is in okay shape, a little protein deficient. Right side of the pancreas is about, it's very shrunken on that side, probably half the size that it should be, or that's normal if you may not need it. And it's about 30% alive on that side. Right thyroid is very good. Tonsil area, I mean the parathyroid is excellent. Tonsil area is good. And small intestines, very poor circulation, and some gallbladder. Liver has some damage, heavy metal there. Almost feels like you've got a couple tumors in there, like warts. So it doesn't mean, you know, any kind of growth on the skin is a tumor. Whether it's a mole, a wart, no matter what, it doesn't mean cancer. I prefer cancerous ones because they can dissolve and get rid of them. It can take forever to get rid of, or never to get rid of a benign tumor. And you've got it on the lower side, these bumps on the lower side of your liver over here. To start moving out or irritating, you're going to feel pain there. Put a hot water bottle. Anytime you have pain, use a hot water bottle. Never use cold anything, ice to anything. You will block the circulation to the area and prevent healing and detoxification of the damaged tissue. You've got great healing ability, you've got a balance of good and red and white blood cells. The major problem is your lymph system isn't dumping. You've got them to get out of here, your waste products, and you're not dumping your lymphatic system, which means you're moving toward an early death, even though you have a lot of health throughout the body. I'm going to suggest a pineapple every other day to help that lymphatic congestion down, about a half a cup, about three and a half to four tablespoons of coconut cream, about three quarters of a tablespoon of dairy cream, and a half a teaspoon of butter. You've got some metal in the brain, but it's not as high as normal, and your fat seems to have arrested most of the poisons. You do have a lot of heavy metals in your ears, so that will usually mean some ear detoxification. Food-wise, I'm going to suggest, besides the pineapple, custard to help your intestines. So that's papaya, eggs, butter, and honey. You put a little grated ginger in there to stimulate digestion. So you need those hot baths if you can get in.

For you, I would suggest, and for anybody else who doesn't have time to do a bath, spend your first hour and a half in the bathtub sleeping. Your first hour and a half of your day sleeping in the bathtub. You won't drown, never hurt anybody drowning unless they had a heart attack in a bathtub. And I sleep in a hot tub that's 10 feet in diameter, and I have nothing holding me up. I float, and I don't die. I have lots of people who fall asleep in there. Nobody ever dies. If they start to go under, of course, you wake up and say, oh, okay. Don't be afraid you're going to die. Don't not go into the bathtub because you think you're going to drown in the bathtub. Nobody drowns in a bathtub unless they mean to, or they have a heart attack. And that's going to be your biggest saver. So meat wise, you can eat red or white or combination. And I would say combination would always be more balanced. Eat about three tablespoons of butter a day altogether. And you can do a tablespoon with each meat meal and then a tablespoon, some you have a little bit, have a pineapple every other day. But you can mix with a little honey and butter. You can have a teaspoon here and there throughout the day. But you really need to heat your body. What you can do is go into a hot tub and get a hot tub. And so you have constant temperature. Stay in there. Use the ice when you need to use it. And then when you go to bed, put towels down underneath you and put hot water bottles, like five hot water bottles with you. One around the calves, one here between the thighs, two under the arms, and then one on each side of the mat. Choose one side. Don't put them on both sides. Each night, use one side of the other one of the neck. And then you have five hot water bottles there and you'll be perspiring more of your waste out of the system. Most of this waste is water. And the byproduct of the lymphatic, it's not much fat. You need to perspire it out, but it's being blocked by the waxy fat, the plastic fat. And you need lots of minerals to also help relieve that, so be sure and eat cheese and honey together three times a day. It's not two times after your meat meal. Pick another time. Middle of the night would be good. If you could stay in bed for an hour and a half or a hot tub and then you go to bed, have some cheese and honey and then you go to bed. Still wake up sometime in the night and have a little bit of milk or something. And I suggest you consume at least five cups of milk a day for the minerals. So you just stop perspiring with that. You just need to move that out. So I've taken care of the fruit, the vegetable juice. Were you vegan at all? Doesn't feel like it. Were you?

Q: I've done short periods of it but not...

A: You didn't eat the system away so if you did a little bit of that... The only reason I'm suspect of this is the ovaries. Vegetable juice I recommend about 25% carrot, 30% celery, maybe 35% celery would perspire a little better. Then now that spring and summer, spring's here and summer's coming, I'd like you to do with your vegetable juice, not all vegetable juice, I'd like you to take watermelon rind, everything from the seeds down to the green. Don't have the green. Have all the white rind and the pink. That will help you perspire a lot more. Might make you a little horny, but that's because it has natural citrulline in it and it causes men to get erect and women to get erect, so it causes more virility. But don't be alarmed by that. Just relax through it. It'll give you more energy. Use it however you will. 

[laughter]

A: But you have to get rid of that water waste and the watermelon will help. So you're going to use it up. I'd still like you to use 25% carrots, then about 30% watermelon bottom and rind, and then about 30% cucumber puree, and about 5% beet, red beet, and 5% parsley. When watermelon's gone, then you substitute with celery. 

Q: And how much meat?

A: Yeah, about a pound. Remember, I said everybody a pound unless I tell you differently.

[audio cut]

A: The left ovary is almost non-existent. The left adrenal gland is okay, a little protein deficient. The left side of the pancreas is about 46% alive, and that's pretty good. You only need 10 if you're doing this diet. The left thyroid is very good, parathyroid is okay. Tonsil area is very, very poor. The right ovary is only scar tissue, so you had that one removed too? 

Q: No, just the left.

A: Pardon?

Q: Just the left.

A: Just the left? Well, this is pretty much scar tissue. You sure? Oh, no, there's some, but it's very little, maybe about 5%, I mean, a fifth, 20% is there. The rest is scar tissue, a lot of protein deficiency. So, if you can get some ovaries of a bovine, I suggest that you eat them, help recover that. And eat it with either heart or liver, and it will magnify the reproduction of that ovary. There's not any here to regrow this one, they completely took it all. But this one should rebound pretty well. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape, a little protein deficiency, maybe 20%. The right side of the pancreas is about 40% alive, so that's still good. The right thyroid is excellent, parathyroid is okay, tonsil area very, very poor. Poor circulation in the small intestines, both sides. A lot of chemical solvents. Were you a swimmer or a cleaner?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Were you combining ammonia and chlorine or anything like that? Mixing anything? Did your mother? No. Do you live near a factory? Did you live near a factory? Diesel plant, anything? Well, maybe it is just vaccines. You just never dumped any of your vaccine formaldehyde. Anyway, you have it all over the left side of your torso. To try to get rid of that, now you see how this is sucked in and flat, whereas this is more folded around it? That's what's done to that side of your body internally. To help get rid of that, I suggest a third of a mango, not too ripe, slightly on the green side, a small kiwi, you peel it, a tablespoon of honey, three tablespoons of lime juice, one tablespoon of lemon juice, and two teaspoons of vinegar, raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar, two tablespoons of dairy cream, two tablespoons of coconut cream. You blend that all together. That'll be about three quarters of a cup, six ounces. I'd like you to pour that into two and a half ounces of sparkling mineral water. Use a larger glass. And I want you to sip that over about a 15-minute period. Don't guzzle it. And that'll help remove some of the solvent reactive stuff. And do that every other day. On the other days, I suggest you use pineapple. About no more than a half a cup of pineapple, with two and a half tablespoons of coconut cream and one and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. No butter with yours. So those are your fruit meals for the week. Meat-wise, you have signs of anemia. So I'm going to suggest that you eat about 70% red meat and 30% white. I forgot to mention this. When I mention red and white meat, it's not a color, it's a class. Red meats are four-legged animals. White meat is two legs or no legs. Now, every four days, I'd like you to have three ounces of carrot juice by itself, with, I mean, away from other vegetable juices. Three ounces of carrot juice with two tablespoons of coconut cream, one tablespoon of dairy cream, one-half tablespoons of honey, and a tablespoon of lemon juice. I want you to mix that together. You have a lot of bile throughout your system. It's going to turn you orange, bright orange sometimes. It's not the carrot juice, it's the bile that's causing that. Vegetable juice, I'm going to recommend 25% carrot, 25% celery, 25% cucumber puree, 5% parsley, 5% cilantro, and 5% zucchini. Need at least four cups of milk a day sipped all throughout the day. And I'm not going to repeat the cheese. Everybody's got that about the cheese, still something everybody should do at least once an hour. Every other day I would like you to do a lubrication formula, moisturizing lubrication formula, that's on page 146 of the recipe book. And you'll have that, like three, four tablespoons of that with each meat meal. And then I would like you to have whatever is left of that, half of that, before you go to sleep, a little cheese instead of the milkshake. And then during the night, a little bit of cheese with the other half, and the remainder, which would probably be two ounces or less, in the middle of the night. Okay?

Q: Thank you.

A: You're very welcome.

[audio cut]

A: And what happened?

Q: It was a Dupuytren syndrome.

A: It was what?

Q: Dupuytren syndrome. It was shortening my tendons.

A: Your tendons were getting short.

Q: What is the reason for that?

A: It's usually a chemical that's been injected into your body. Did you work in the military, though? They experiment with military people, and mostly military have this.

Q: Okay.

A: They inject something, and as they inject something, it's an experimental drug. And over a long period of time, it's caused the cramping and shortening of the tendons, and usually in the hands, and it's usually in these three fingers. You need to put your hand, you need to get a hot water bottle, and go to sleep with your hands on it. You need to keep the heat going in with it. You take bone marrow, you know, soft bone marrow, the middle of the bone. You take that and you rub that in, and you rub it in, and you rub it in, and you put your hands on the hot water bottle every night you can to stop that. That one's pretty advanced.

Q: Where do I get bone marrow?

A: Healthy butchers.

Q: Healthy butchers. Thanks for the business.

A: Okay, you have lots of bile all over the body. Left testis is okay, some scar tissue there. Left adrenal gland is somewhat scarred but okay. The left side of the pancreas... What kind of work do you do?

Q: Sitting in the office.

A: Pardon?

Q: Sitting in the office.

A: I know, but any kind of hand exercise? I just want to make sure this isn't muscle stuff.

Q: I do exercise.

A: What do you do?

Q: Just push-ups, squats, regular.

A: Okay.

Q: No, no.

A: I just wanted to know if you were lifting weights and causing this, or if this was all scar tissue.

Q: Is it?

A: So I'm asking you, if you use weights and you're using that thumb in a way that creates a lot of muscle there, okay, then this is scar tissue. So your pancreas is about 43% alive. That's plenty. Okay. Lung thyroid is poor. Parathyroid is very good. Tonsil I can't tell.

Q: I don't have that.

A: Okay. Then you don't have it. It's very, very poor.

Q: So how do I replace, you said that it's protecting your brain, right?

A: Yeah. Well, you still have some pretty large lymph glands here.

Q: So they are protecting that, right?

A: When my glands were taken out, these got that big. See how big they are?

Q: Yeah.

A: And when I was three years old, they never gone down to keep my brain.

Q: So this is still protecting my brain, right?

A: Yeah, absolutely.

Q: Instead of the tonsils.

A: Instead of the tonsils, yeah. Doesn't do quite as well because it's not way up in the throat. The left, I mean the right, relax. The right testicle is about 30% protein deficient. So you need a hard liver with some white meats to build that. The right side of the, I mean the right adrenal gland is okay. The right side of the pancreas is about 50% alive. That's good. Right thyroid is there. Parathyroid is pretty good. Tonsil area very poor. Very poor circulation in the small intestines. You were a smoker?

Q: Occasional, yes.

A: Did your parents smoke?

Q: My mom.

A: Yeah. You have smoke tar all over your body.

Q: My father smoked 40 years ago.

A: So you smoked too?

Q: Yes. 

A: A long time. I mean you were smoking your parents' discards. And you're not handling that, you didn't handle that well with smoke tar. Like she'd handle it like a fat. Now there's a good fat to handle, but it's still protective. It can still harden in the system. Yours is already hardened in your system. So you need to melt that. In a hot bath you need to get 108, 110 degrees to melt that tobacco fat. So you need 110, you need to have a cold water bottle on your head so you can stay in a long time. Dietarily I'm going to suggest not too much red meat, maybe 30% red meat, mostly white meat. You have a tendency to get more irritable with more red meat, especially if you eat red meat a lot.

Q: I eat it a lot.

Q: And you do get irritable.

[laughter]

A: You get anxious, you get pushy, all of that stuff. You got to run your life. And that means taking care of that. So don't eat so much red meat. And never eat it alone. You have raw eggs with it or some kind of other white meat. I'm going to suggest about a pound and a half a day, two and a half tablespoons of butter with each meat meal. About every other day I'd like you to have a lubrication formula. It's called a moisturizing lubrication formula. It's butter, eggs, lemon juice and honey. Let me give you your ratio. I'd like to have five and a half tablespoons of butter, three eggs, a tablespoon of lemon juice and one and a quarter tablespoons of honey. Blend that all together. Now when you make that, you have to leave all the ingredients out overnight. Because if it's cold, it's not going to mix properly. If, after you blend it together, the butter is still clumpy in it, then you immerse that with a lid on it, and the blender blades on it in a bowl of hot water. Three minutes in the re-blender, it will be even. And then I'd like you to have your cheese in the morning, and then have an egg, and immediately follow that with three tablespoons of that lubrication formula. Then for your meat meal, have four tablespoons. Then somewhere around noon, three tablespoons. For your evening meat meal, four tablespoons. Then, during the night, you drink the rest of the re-blender juice. You do that every other night. On the other, every other day, on the opposite day, you just have to put three tablespoons of butter. Three to four tablespoons of butter. And that's all with the meat meal. Vegetable juice, I'm going to recommend 25% carrot, 25% celery, 25% cucumber puree, 15% cilantro, and 10% zucchini. And remember that cucumber is pureed, you peel it and slice it to blend it with all the vegetable juices. I'd like you to have three eggs in 16 ounces of vegetable juice, and a tablespoon of dairy cream. So, when you taste the vegetables...

Q: Sweet or sour? Sweet or sour.

A: Either.

Q: Which is better?

A: Doesn't matter. Sour cream always digests better. If you want to slow down some of the vegetable juice and make it longer lasting, then don't eat the sour. Sour will digest faster. If you feel like you need to be calm longer, you don't use the sour. Because the sour will go quickly and digest rapidly. So, with 16 ounces of vegetable juice, have two eggs in it. And a tablespoon of vegetable juice... I mean a tablespoon of cream. And you break the yolk and you whip it. Don't blend it. Fruit-wise, I'm going to suggest... I'd like you to have a cup of pineapple with one medium-sized kiwi. Peel that kiwi. And I'd like you to have four and a half tablespoons of coconut cream. Two and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. And a half a teaspoon of butter.

Q: We'd like a coconut cream. Can we get a coconut cream?

Q: You can sell this at your store now.

A: Well, what I did, it tells you on the... If you get that DVD recipe, I show you how to do it. I didn't have time to do it because it takes about a full eight to ten hours to juice sixteen to twenty coconuts to last you six weeks. Okay? I put up a three by five card at a high school gymnasium. And said, I need somebody who likes to break things eight dollars an hour. I got fifty calls. Everybody likes to get paid for breaking things. So I picked an African American end who was very skinny and hyperactive. End's good with their hands. So he was good, good with breaking the coconuts, prying it out, chopping it, putting it in his food processor and grinding it. Then warming it in a bowl, you know, a big gallon jar. And then putting it through my juicer, my Green Star juicer, Elite juicer. And then, you know, I paid sixty bucks for the day. About two dollars for a coconut, some mature, hard coconut. And so it cost me a hundred dollars for a whole six weeks worth of vegetables. And he even jarred it, put it in the jars for me, you know.

Q: [unintelligible] always pasteurized.

A: It's always pasteurized. Always pasteurized, treated, processed.

Q: So it doesn't work to buy it in the store.

Q: No, there is a guy who does this. That's all he does is work with coconuts. I forget, but yeah, he makes the little squares that you find in the health food stores. So his name is on them, you can call him.

Q: Does he make the cream?

Q: Yeah.

A: Does he make the cream?

Q: Yes, he does and it's fantastic.

A: Wow, good.

Q: He specializes in that.

Q: Okay, great.

Q: Well, you know those little squares, the coconut squares you find in health food stores?

Q: I've never found them.

Q: His name and phone number is on the square.

Q: I've never found them.

Q: But you know, ask Eva in Baltimore. She knows. She knows the guy.

Q: Oh, I'll give you his phone number.

Q: Okay, thank you.

Q: Great. Sorry.

A: Okay. Hot baths, like I say, 90 minutes minimum a day. If you slept the whole night in a hot tub, it would really free up a lot of that stuff. Because you have a tremendous, you not only have your own lymphatic system blocked and you've got the death circle going already, you've got intracellular lymphatic congestion. So even the cells are jammed with plastic fats. You need a lot of time in a hot tub. And I suggest you drink, I suggest you drink one and a half, sport drinks daily, one and a half quarts of milk daily and gain 20 pounds.

Q: Can I get [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah, absolutely. Kefir grains don't work as well. Remember, kefir grains is from the remnant of a cow. They have a different bacteria than we do. They break it down differently for each cell. If you were very sick, I would say eat all the keeper you want. But since you're a little bit on the healthier side, then that, it's better if you put your spit into the kefir. It's your own bacteria. Break it down the way you need to do it. So put a teaspoon per quarter, a tablespoon per quart of your saliva. And, you know, put a piece of coconut or something in there and just get your mouth full of it and then put it into the milk to make your own kefir.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: You'll make it with your own bacteria, not with the kefir grains. They won't compete with your own intestinal bacteria. You already have an intestinal bacteria problem. If you propagate a cow's bacteria in your colon, you're not going to get it as well as quickly.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay?

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

[audio cut]

Q: Renata.

A: Renata. You are cold.

Q: Always. Warm heart though.

[laughter]

A: Huge mineral deficiency. You need some honey and butter four times a day. So have a tablespoon of honey, I mean a tablespoon of butter with three quarters of a teaspoon of honey. Mash them together, put them together in your mouth. So two times you'll have it after your meat meal, and then one time in the middle of the night, and one time in the middle of the day. Okay? Left ovary is in pretty good shape. A little scar tissue there. Left adrenal gland is a little protein deficient, but it's okay. The left side of the pancreas is really swollen. Very edemic. Also, you know, the liver and the pancreas are mostly protein and so is the heart. So this is not a fat swelling, this is a water swelling, an edema. It's causing scarring. Are you drinking a lot of water?

Q: No, I don't drink water.

A: Did you drink a lot of alcohol at one time?

Q: No.

A: I don't know what's causing the hardness. What do you do for a living?

Q: Office, job, traveling.

A: So you're in airplanes or in a car?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Could be the benzene. Why it's going to your pancreas, I don't know. Anyway, I'd like you to put a hot water bottle at your pancreas, over here. Every night that you can remember, every night. I carry my hot water bottle with me in my suitcase in the front slot. In case I get an ache or a pain at any time, put the hot water bottle on it. It resolves it quickly. Even use it all night, just to help resolve that pancreatic tissue before it becomes all scar tissue. Because I only feel about 10% of it alive over here. That's diabetic type. Then the left thyroid is very good. Parathyroid is fair. Tonsil area is fair. The right ovary is a little protein deficient, but it's okay. The right adrenal gland is pretty good. The right side of the pancreas is also heavily scarred. But you still have about 23% of it alive over here. So about 15-16% of the pancreas is alive. Get to 10, you're diabetic. Right thyroid is okay. Parathyroid, very good. Tonsil, fair. Very poor circulation in the intestines. Lymphatic congestion, absolutely everywhere. You need the hot baths. So the two of you can live in the hot tub. You'll be working for the two of you. It'll change your lives. And you need to spend a lot of time in the hot tub. Both of you. Long nights in the hot tub. And sleep. It's so nice to sleep in there. If you have city water, make sure you've got some filters on there. At least a sand filter. No chemicals in that water. And you could use a large HEPA paper filter. Let that go through the water first. Because there are poisons in the paper. And then let it go through a charcoal, coconut shell charcoal filter. And then your sand filter. And that water will stay crystal clear. But let algae grow. And the algae will help pull metals out of most of your body. As it pulls out a system. And every summer you can scrape out the algae and give it to your garden.

Q: We have that three stage system with a separate tank under the sink.

A: Right. Osmosis.

Q: Reverse osmosis.

A: That's not the same thing I'm talking about. You'll need a big one for the hot tub. Okay, so lymphatic congestion is a major problem. And you also have a lot of anemia. So I'm going to suggest that you eat about 80-85% red meat. 15-20% of white meat. And butter, pretty important. Add little amounts all the time. Have cheese and honey frequently. Cheese, even in between without the honey frequently. Vegetable juice I'm going to suggest... About 20% celery. I mean 20% carrot. 30% celery. If the celery makes you tired, you have to put an egg in your vegetable juice. Have you had celery juice recently? Okay. Does it make you tired? So, sometimes because when you have this much water retention, you have a lot of excess sodium in the body. And it will cause you to get tired and start detoxing. If that happens, just put some eggs in there. So about 30-35% celery. About 30% cucumber puree. Okay. 10% cilantro. And 10% beet juice. I want you to have an egg in your vegetable juice. One egg. And a half a teaspoon of cream. Break the egg, yolk and then whip it around. I want to suggest you only have one meat a day. I might give you about 18 eggs a day. You need quickly digestible protein and fats. And you're only going to get that from eggs. Do that 3-6 months. Until you feel a lot better. And then eat the two meat meals. The right, left side of your spine is pretty good. There's a lot of swelling there, water swelling. The left side is breaking down and hardening. So that will also help your back from solidifying. The heat, the hot baths, hot tubs. Food wise, I'm going to suggest pears with the coconut cream. Like 2 and a half tablespoons of coconut cream with a pear. And about a quarter of a teaspoon of honey. And 1 tablespoon of dairy cream and 2 and a half tablespoons of coconut cream. Do that two days a week. One day a week I like to have a solvent extractor. Which is about a third of a mango, a small mango. And a medium sized kiwi, peel it. Make it 3 quarters of a tablespoon of honey. 2 tablespoons of coconut cream, 1 tablespoon of dairy cream, 1 tablespoon of honey. A tablespoon of lemon juice, a tablespoon of lime juice. Blend all that together. Pour that into 2 and a half ounces of sparkling mineral water. And sit that over a 10-12 minute period. Two days a week is okay, but let 4 days pass between. So you have it 3 days passed, 4th day out again. 3 days passed, 4th day. 

The other few days of the week, I'm going to suggest a combination of a third of a cup of dark berries, blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries, dark mulberries, and a third of a cup of raspberries or strawberries or both. 2 and a half tablespoons of coconut cream, 1 tablespoon of dairy cream. Make that 1 and a half tablespoon of dairy cream. That will protect your nerves a little bit more.

Q: I've done it with lime.

A: Now you have that same artistic quality that she did, and you're going to have a tendency to be very critical. So it's for your creative mind. You get very bored. The two of you have similarities there, but I really couldn't read it from your hand because of the buckle finger, because it shows up in that finger. And it's your very creative mind. Be creative. I don't care if it's writing. I don't care what it is. I can't tell what it is that you're good and artistic at, but it could be movement. So get into a movement class, a dance class, or whatever it is, and let that diversification be your joy. Don't expect people to entertain you. I think you should have three and a half cups of milk a day minimum. Kefir, if you want. Just remember, like I said earlier, if you get swelling in the ankles and feet, it could be you're having too much kefir.

Q: I've had it all my life, basically.

A: No, it'll be more than that.

Q: My ankles are pretty bad. Hot climate makes it so much worse.

A: She needs water. She's not perspiring. Her poisons are not perspiring.

Q: Could it be her heart?

A: No, no. Her heart's fine. She needs to soak in a hot tub hours a day to get rid of her waxy fat.

Q: He takes hot tub. I never take hot tub.

Q: She's boiling all the time in the hot tub. I cannot go to the bathroom for ten minutes.

[laughter]

A: Good for you. This is on a long time level.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: This is terrible. It's 168 degrees. It will damage your sinuses, your ears, your throat, your lungs, everything. You need to keep it down to no more than 110 degrees. Okay?

Q: Thank you.

Q: [unintelligible] cancer in your reading?

A: Only in the eyes, irises.

Q: Okay. So this is more organ?

A: That's more the whole perspective of the whole in general. When I get into the eyes, I know where all the toxins are. I know which kind of toxins they are. I know to the extent of your lymphatic damage. I know a lot more. But this was a good start.

Q: When you said metal for me, I remember I forgot. I used to travel all the time for work. I rode a plane all the time. Could that be part of the...

A: Absolutely, it did be.

Q: So what do you recommend? What do you recommend? Do you travel with a mask or something?

A: I wear a mask. I wear two masks. I've got a silk one that I moisten. And I put a cotton one over that. And it looks like I'm something out of... I have them specially made. It looks like I'm something out of Darth Vader. Because it doesn't cover my mouth. And it goes up like this. And across my nose like this. I sleep inhaling through my nose and breathing out my mouth. Even when I sleep on a plane. Because I always sleep every flight. As soon as we take off, I'm asleep. As soon as we land, I'm awake. And it's like that. So no matter how long the trip is, I can sleep through the whole thing. 

Q: And you wear a mask to the whole airport?

A: The whole time. Yep. Because the benzene... In Australia, the Flight Attendants Union and the Pilots Union sued the airlines. Every one of them. Because of the benzene that's all throughout the cabin. And they're the only ones who have that exhaust out the end of the tailpipe. No other country does it. Why don't they do it? They don't want you to be well. The same people own all these big Fortune 500 companies. So, only in that country, when they lost a freaking fortune, and they were going to get fined every year, even more, the same amount, unless they change the planes. All the planes in Australia are different than anywhere else in the world. For that reason. So, you inhale that benzene during the whole flight. Only when I go to Australia and fly in an Australian plane, or a plane that does its maiden flying in Australia, do I not wear a mask.

Q: Yeah, I've seen there be like insect spray in planes.

A: And they do that too. If you're in a tropical area, while you're not in the plane, before they let people on the ground, they're spraying insect spray, all in the air, to kill the mosquitos.

Q: Also, the chairs, the cloth in the chairs, and then I think when...

A: Formaldehyde.

Q: Yeah, and is the benzene coming from the engines?

A: Yes.

Q: The same, before it leaves?

A: Yeah.

Q: Or while it's flying?

A: No, it's the whole time. The whole time. Except in the planes in Australia that are properly vented.

Q: I've been a vegan for eight years. As far as I have [unintelligible], what's my first best?

A: You need to alter your system from being over-alkalinized into acidic. So the best thing for you to do is eat eggs and eggs and eggs and eggs for about three months.

Q: Yeah.

A: So if you had 20 eggs a day, maybe half a cup of meat twice daily, you know, that would work.

Q: Because that feels hard. Like, is there something I could do to ease up to that? To do that many eggs, I don't know if I could do that.

A: Well, just work up to it. See how many you can do.

Q: Yeah. You start popping and then they go down.

A: Oh, once you start that?

Q: And when your energy comes up, you'll be in love with it.

A: Yes.

Q: You won't regret it at all.

Q: Yeah.

Q: I've had chemo twice in the last five years. Is that part of the metals, do you think?

A: Poisons, yeah.

Q: Eggs.

A: Eggs and cheese, cheese, cheese. Especially the chemo.

Q: My mom said leave the eggs out of the fridge.

A: Oh, yes. Don't refrigerate eggs. Thank you. I wish you had said that earlier. But I say that in my books. Don't refrigerate eggs.

Q: Oh, what?

Q: Leave the eggs out of the fridge.

A: Don't refrigerate eggs.

Q: Oh, yeah.

Q: You have to buy it from a farmer because every single egg in every single store is in the fridge. So you have to go to the farmer.

A: No, if you find out, they don't put it in a refrigerator until it's on the truck to go to the store. Yeah. If you find out when they deliver the eggs, that's the day to go get them, because they'll sit out before they even go into the cooler at your store. And always get pastured eggs. Not organic, but pastured eggs.

Q: What do you mean?

A: They've run out... They've run out in the field or at least on the ground somewhere.

Q: But they can be fed grain, though, even though they're free.

A: I don't mind. It's okay. They're all going to be fed grain. You're not going to find an egg in anywhere that isn't fed grain. Unless you go to one of my farmers.
