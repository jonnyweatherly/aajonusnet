A: And then when I was about three months old, I was crawling and he pushed me on to a rusty rake. And my mother panicked, because she's a nurse. So she took me to the doctor. They gave me a tetanus shot. I was sick, vomiting, diarrhea, turning blue, yellow, all kinds of colors, and of course they were giving me antibiotics on top of that. So my brother saw how sick I got from that and tested it three months later to see if it would happen again, and sure enough, my mother, because she had seen one person have a lockjaw in her whole medical career, and she's freaked. So any time any of us got on to a rusty anything, it was a tetanus shot whether we needed it or not. Now they say tetanus shots are good for five years. Back then they were good for a year, but my mother would pump us with it every time we got on something rusty. So I was six months old when I got my second one, and then I think it was my fourth one, I thought it was my third, but it was my fourth because I was 18 months old when I got the one that turned me autistic. I was unable to communicate after that. I was unable to decipher that a hieroglyph or a design could represent communication or a pattern of sound that meant communication, my brain just couldn't handle it. So by the time I was about eight years old, I learned to parrot very well, because I had heard sounds and that's what I had, because that mercury, everybody knows that you've got liquid mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, detergent in every vaccine. Even if they say it's now mercury free, you have to understand that for thimerosal, which is liquid mercury, they have 12 different names for it. They have it as an antiseptic, as a preservative, as an antibiotic, as an antiseptic when you take mercurochrome, methylate, it's liquid mercury. You're putting liquid mercury on your body, poisoning your system with liquid mercury. It's a neurotoxin, the worst neurotoxin on the planet. So anyway, that went into my system and created this problem. So I was unable to communicate when I turned eight years old, I had learned, I'd heard the sounds enough, I had a short-term memory that was like that. So I had to hear things repeatedly and repeatedly, so they would come through my mind without thinking. That's the way most people learn anyway. So by the time I was eight, I had learned enough phrases, and the phrases that were common in my household were, shut up, sit down, you're stupid. So when I went to school, that's what I told other kids, shut up, sit down, you're stupid, and I told the teachers that too, so I was always getting beat, slammed, and, you know, I grew up in a Catholic mother and Jewish father, and there was so much guilt there, I used to have to go see the accountant before I could go see the rabbi or the priest. The inability to communicate was pretty difficult, and I was raised with nuns, and they didn't take to telling them, shut up, sit down, stuff like that, so they were using rulers, and when they got really angry, because I wouldn't listen, because I didn't understand, they took, you know, the metal side, and that little metal strip, and they'd hit me with that and cause bleeding, or take a comb with the, you know, the jagged edges, and do that, and I'd bleed in spots, so it was pretty rough all the way through, and other kids would beat the shit out of me because I was saying the same thing to them.

So I was in the sixth grade, finally, you know, this one guy got me so mad that I just got beyond my fear and beat the hell out of him. So I realized that if I beat somebody up, I'd be okay for the rest of the year, so each year at the beginning of the year, school year, I'd pick the biggest guy in the school, I didn't care how old he was, and I'd beat the shit out of him, and I mean I'd beat him badly, because being an animal, which I was, because I was autistic, that's all I had to go on was my instincts and intuition, I knew the deadly place, so immediately, you know, I'd just say, you're stupid, you know, sit down, shut up, you know, get somebody really pissed off at me easily, I would just sucker punch with the elbow and throat, and that was it. They were already stunned, and I would just keep pounding on them until they wouldn't move, and then everybody left me alone. So I went all the way through high school doing that, for the rest of grade school and high school doing that. The way I got through school was I picked the smartest, most sensitive girl to sit next to, and then I would copy her hieroglyphs, because that's all it was to me. Many times the translation, because it had to be a quick look, you know, so I had a photographic memory, but no short-term memory when I heard sounds, so language was out, and I could not correlate how a design was a communication, too, but I could still, I was a great artist, I could photographically, but some of the time, you know, I'd have a T, and then the next time it would be something, not even a letter, but that's what I'd put down, so they were very confused. Because I didn't look autistic, my parents didn't allow me to be autistic, look autistic, whenever I'd go into my stare, my mother would slap me on the back, my father would slap me on the back of the head and say, don't do it, you look like an idiot. You know, my father was an inventor, he invented the first Bering computer when he was in college at Purdue, my mother was a very bright woman, even a philosopher, and she had a degree and was a nurse. So they were not going to, they were in total denial about me being autistic, they were not going to let me appear to be autistic. So then, you know, this was in the 50s, and when I was in, you know, about 8 years old, 54, 55, I learned to emulate movie stuff, take on the pose. So that's how I started, you know, without getting beat up a lot of the time, where I emulate Jimmy Dean, you know, pose, cool guy, that sort of thing. So that got me through a little bit until I wanted to fight, until I got the gumption to fight. And that took me through. So nobody knew I was autistic, nobody understood, they just thought I was a wise guy. So then I got into Catholic high school, run by a Franciscan priest, a Franciscan priest. They are unruly, they cuss, they hit with their fists, really mean stuff. My first, my freshman year at Roger Bacon High School, I had 45 days of detention, two weeks of sanding crew, and two days of Saturday shoveling coal.

That was a very bad boy, so I was not allowed back the next year, which is great for me because then I got into a public school for the first time, and then we had people who were intelligent, you know, who weren't fixated on, you know, getting rid of the awful evil in somebody, you know, dealing with a person at that point, so it was different going to a public school. Of course, it was a preppy type school because we lived in an affluent neighborhood, no blacks, no Mexicans, there wasn't any color, it was all white. So I got through school by cheating there too, the only times that I got accused of cheating frequently was in math, because like all autistic children, there's some kind of specialty that they have, some kind of an unusual talent, and mine was math, math, look at a problem, give you the answer without formulating it, and they thought I was cheating all the time. They put me, I mean, they put me through the mill cheating and cheating, and I don't know what they're talking about, they're only accusing me of doing something that's normal, everybody's always accusing me of being bad. So they put me in a room with the test, I put all the answers down and there was no formula, that was easy. So then they realized that there was something unusual, then they were better to me than that. And then they never accused me of cheating after that on anything, so it was great. And then when I graduated from high school with C's and D's, except in art, off the chart high, and logic and math, of course, was high. But everything else was C's and D's. Comprehension was zero. Absolutely zero. But I cheated, so they didn't know that comprehension was zero. So my mother got this wild idea when I graduated, and I was married, I got married when I was 16 years old, because the second smartest girl in the school, who was a senior, I was a junior, well I was a sophomore, she was a junior when we met. She liked me. Why would this intelligent girl like an idiot? I don't know, but she did. And we just loved each other. We didn't have to communicate, we didn't have to talk, we just liked being in the same space together. So I ended up getting married when I was 16, having a baby at 17. So in that space, when I graduated, my son was born, my mother took me to a new school that opened, the Cincinnati Computer Institute of Technology, and I learned, you know, I was supposed to learn computer, you know, record wiring equipment and computer programming. So she took the brother who was bad to me, I've got three brothers, one five years old, one 18 months old, and one three years younger than I. So she took my brother Doug, the one 18 months older than I, to this computer institute to take tests to see if we could do anything with that, because she knew that we were both not apt to do anything else, if we could even do that.

So my brother failed all the tests miserably, but they didn't give any comprehension tests. It was math, it was design. So I was just flipping out everything. So they realized what we had. So they took me and I could write a program in like two hours. It would take people six months a year to write, but I could do it flawlessly. Not a clue how I did it, just like the math problem, I hadn't a clue how I got the answers. But most people, you know, they hear something, they know it, they hear it once, and they can flip it out. They had no control over it, I had no control over it either. So most people do not have control over their talents, unless you're a trained athlete, or something like a [unintelligible]. So they planted me in different corporations as a systems analyst. They always had somebody with me who could communicate and could write and everything like that. So here I was, this 17, 18 year old kid making a fortune, being an idiot. So I decided that my uncle, who was matriculating for his doctorate in psychology, thought that he could help me. So I moved out to California, and he put me through the LSD experiments in 1966 and 67. And I was immune to LSD, even 750 micrograms. It didn't even take me off any of that. So that was a dud, and I was part of the... I wasn't in the placebo group. I was actually in the group that got the LSD. So they tried other things. They put me through all kinds of therapies. None of it worked. They didn't understand there was a chemical problem from the mercury and the aluminum, the formaldehyde, all that stuff in vaccines that I had gotten, tetanus shot. So nothing resolved there. When I transferred, those people helped me. I stayed with Time DC Trucking Company as an assistant analyst, and then went on to the Carte Blanche Corporation, still making a fortune. So I had a small two-bedroom house in Beverly Hills, and it was easy and comfortable. And when I was about eight years old, because I had fibromyalgia, I was so sick all the time, sickly all the time. I kept colds from three to five months. I would be bedridden for three months out of the year. I couldn't get out of bed without being sore and achy, and the colder it was, the worse it was. My father came from a farm without central heating. So when he went to bed at night, he turned it off. So in Cincinnati, Ohio, it's cold. Not as bad as Chicago, but it's cold. So I'd wake up, and they'd have to belt me to get me out of bed, and I was all achy and sore. So what I did was, and I had no energy. So at eight years old, I started going into the kitchen at night, the middle of the night, barely asleep, and get their coffee, the cold coffee that they had left, and mix a little with some water at the bottom, so they think maybe they've evaporated. And I put it in a jar, put it under my bed, and then I started smoking also for the nicotine high. And there was some medication that one of my brothers took to help him with some energy, so I stole some of that and cut it into pieces and took a little piece every time. So that's the way I did it. And lots of Coca-Cola and stuff like that to caffeine me into some kind of energy level.

Otherwise, I would fall asleep in every class. Every time I ate, I didn't digest well, I'd fall asleep in the next class. I'd get into trouble for that. So by the time I was 19 years old, I was consuming Benzedrine, easy to get at a trucking company. All the truckers took bennies, speed to keep them awake, so I could get it by the jarfuls. And smoking, I was up to two and a half packs a day. Lucky Strike Non-Filter. To go to sleep at night, I was drinking a fifth of gin or bourbon.

Q: How old were you at the time?

A: 19. And I mean, it was increasing, from 16 up. Because I get married at 16, I don't come home. I was on my own. I could do what I wanted. And I started work in a department store in one of their hamburger stands in there. So I was frying hamburgers and toasting buns and putting salads together and stuff like that. It was easy work, but I had to work. I went to school in the mornings, worked in the afternoon. I took care of the baby in the afternoon and worked in the evening. And then I went to a restaurant in a bigger place, more money. And again, I was autistic, so I'm just parroting sounds. I've learned better things to say. I learned enough lines to tell a woman. Of course, things like [unintelligible] you're wonderful, and stuff like that. All these things that I learned from watching love stories. So those sounds, I just picked up over and over again. I stayed in the theater and listened and listened and listened until I got those sounds down. Of course, my wife was hoodwinked. She didn't know I was an autistic idiot until we started living together. It was like, who is this guy? Of course, the relationship didn't last, and I was 19 years old. When I moved out here, a month after the divorce was final, out to California. That's when all that started, and I was smoking and drinking a lot. At 19, I started vomiting blood, a lot of blood. I went to the, my uncle took me to the hospital and found that I had quite a large ulcer in my stomach. All that alcohol that I was using, smoking and all that. You know, it just robs your body of mucus, so there's no protection in there. And my own acids ate into my stomach wall, digesting it. And also, could have been some kind of toxin that was stored in that part of the stomach lining, but also made it difficult and easy to eat into the wall. So they put me on Maalox. So I was consuming sometimes five bottles of Maalox a week. They would say, just drink some whole milk, just not the cream. It was Maalox, you know, it's just chalk. So I could have been, you know, [unintelligible]. Chalk that. So I was drinking all this Maalox. So what happened, it turned tumorous. I started getting blockage and digestion. And, you know, they took x-rays. They said, oh, you've got a tumor right next to the ulcer. We're going to have to operate. I don't know what they're talking about, but from my background and my family, doctor says you do something, you do it. So I went to the doctor. They cut me from here to here and went into the vagotomy pyloroplasty, which means they severed all the vagus nerve to my stomach, the vagotomy. So I was in the category of octogenarian who doesn't secrete hydrochloric acid, never digests properly again. So they said that I was in danger of death from parasitical and bacterial invasion, that I could never eat raw food again, nothing raw, not an apple, not a banana, anything. At least have to be steamed to kill any bacteria.

And they said if I did eat anything raw, I would probably be dead within a week. So this is a story that I was fed. Of course, I didn't understand what the hell they were saying. I knew it was serious. And my uncle, he was the one who showed me pictures, raw food and cooked food with the process, how I had to treat food. So within about six, eight weeks after the surgery, the incision became tumorous. It was up to an inch and a half wide, three quarters of an inch high. The whole thing was a tumor, all the way into my stomach. So then I had cancer. Full-blown metastasized cancer. So he said, we're going to have to irradiate that. I just followed what they say. So I had ten weeks of intense radiation therapy. And you know how clay is malleable? You fire it at anywhere from cone two to cone ten and it's solid? Well, that's what they did to my spine. See, this was my movement. Excruciating pain. It solidified my spine. So I was basically crawling on the floor, because moving was very painful. Anything, even crawling on the floor was painful. But it wasn't bad because I didn't have to move... Except most of this and most of this is irradiated. We hear different angles like this. So as far as the cauterisation, it was about up to here all the way down to here. It was excruciating. I couldn't sit. I tried to sit for about five minutes sometimes, because it's like you get cramped. And you've got to go back up. And then you try again. Sometimes five minutes just to sit. So I had all the furniture moved out of the living room. And then closed off the bedrooms. Took all the carpets out. Just covered carpets, because it was all wood flooring in my house. So I crawled on the floor. And that's the way I got around the house. That way for most of a year and a half. And the radiation not only cauterised my spine, it gave me blood and bone cancer. So they said, OK, we have to do chemotherapy. So I went into intense chemotherapy. Put it in here. And this just rotted. Tried gangrene. Just scraped it out. Did it here. The same thing. They put it in here to skip the chemotherapy. And they were using AZT. The year after they stopped giving me, they didn't stop. I refused it. The year after I was treated with AZT, they outlawed it as too dangerous. It's too poisonous for the human body. But then they brought it out in 82 for whom? AIDS patients. They had something like $300 million worth of AZT, and they needed to use it. So they used it on AIDS patients without any kind of testing. Instead, it works on AIDS patients. What happened to most of the AIDS patients who got AZT? 99.9% of them died. Again, they were undesirable because most of them were homosexuals. So after that, I had no hair. When it came back, the patch was all gray. I had blisters all over my body. I still had to drag myself on the floor. I couldn't get up on pots or pans or jars because it was too painful. So I was defecating and urinating all over myself. They wanted to put me in a hospice, but I was autistic.

There was no way I was going to go live with a bunch of sick people who were dying, preparing to die. And I'd be ridiculed because I didn't know how to talk or behave. So I stayed in my home. Two volunteers at the hospice agreed to come into my home two, three times a week. They'd shop first, bring me food, bring my cereals, which I loved, Rice Krispies, Sugar Crisp, I loved. And I would put four tablespoons of sugar on top of that. And then my powdered donuts, which I absolutely loved, and RC Cola and Sprite. And after the radiation therapy, not only did the bone cancer cauterize my spine, but all the bone in my teeth dissolved. So my teeth dangled in my gums. So when I'd get down on my teeth, I bled. So I was getting up to two transfusions a week. I couldn't even digest my own blood because I had no hydrochloric acid. I had so many poisons in my body. So I still had to get transfusions even though I was drinking my own blood because I refused to spit it out. They told me to spit it out. Probably if I had consumed my blood, I would have been dead. So at this point, I'm just a mess. I have to eat and drink everything. So the donuts and the RC Cola and the cereals all went together in a blender. And they would prepare this stuff for me for the week. I put it in my refrigerator using big old fat straws to suck it through. And I had to be careful there because if the straw pushed on my teeth, I'd bleed profusely and I'd be drinking my blood with my delicious mixtures. But at that point, I couldn't taste anything. Everything tasted like cardboard or postage stamps after chemo and radiation. So it didn't matter what they were feeding me, but that's what I ate normally. That's what they supplied me. But one of the volunteers was an 18-year-old African-American boy, 6'1", something like that. And he was a musician, a singer for the going thing, a group that was sponsored by the Fifth Dimension. And he got a bell in the voice. And here was this kid volunteering. And he got me into carrot juice and raw milk. And he had to coach me to it. He had to really coach me about probably three visits to get me to even taste the carrot juice. And milk tasted really, pasteurized milk tasted really bad. It was like it would bring this metal taste into my mouth so I wouldn't even drink pasteurized milk. And I loved milk before that. I drank a half a gallon of milk a day, even a gallon sometimes, with lots of cereal. And so he got me to drink these things. And then 10 days later, the autism ticked off. So I called my uncle. And usually I had phrases to say. And I said, this is Aajonus, Richard. I said, this is Aajonus. And I had a conversation. He thought it was a comedian friend of his, calling, imitating my voice, because that comedian friend imitated somewhere about 23 people's voices. But most of them were famous. And he thought we had a half an hour conversation, that he's going along with it. And I said, it was really me.

And I told him something that happened only he and I would know. So he was quite stunned. And he said, you mean I can really talk to you on an honest level? And I said, yeah. And I mean, there were words that I had heard that I didn't know what they mean. And I said, you know, I mean, I have a lot of meanings of words wrong. And I had very little vocabulary at that point. So he said, you're a diehard Republican asshole, like your father. He said, you need to know that there are other kinds of realities other than the cowboy home that you came from. So he said, I want you to get the book, Siddhartha, and read it. And then you'll see how varied life's experiences can be. So I called Steve, the volunteer, the one who got me into the carrot juice and raw milk. And I was bankrupt by that point. I had over probably $130,000 at 20 years old. And that was very good for a 20-year-old. And by the time all the doctors were paid, I was broke and getting evicted. So of course, they talked in the banks and held them off for a while. So I ended up crawling around on the floor, defecating, urinating all over myself for a whole week at a time. And a few times where I would be in a little bit of pain where I could move, I was going to get food falling on the floor to the refrigerator. And the refrigerator was probably, my living room was probably this long and probably two-thirds the width. And then from there, I was posted in the center, and I would crawl that way to the kitchen. The kitchen was bigger than that space over there. About that big. So I'd have to crawl there. It would take me 30 minutes to crawl from there to there. I'd get exhausted, fall asleep for 20 minutes, wait, get another 10 feet, do that. And that's where I would eat because if I left it out, the food out of the refrigerator, the food spoils fast, even if it's battery acid, Coca-Cola. It starts molding, and I would be vomiting and more diarrhea. So I couldn't do that. And I wasn't going to sleep on the kitchen floor. It was too cold. It was tile, so the wood floor was bad. And I would go to different spots in the living room because I would defecate and urinate. It was so bad, I could just stay in those areas. And they'd come every week and clean it two or three times a week, giving that food. So I called Steve, and I said, hey, Steve, this is Aajonus. I told him, and he didn't quite believe it at first. He said, OK. So he got me a wheelchair, so we went to a bookstore. And I said, I'm broke. I'd like to buy some books on nutrition because you turned me on to the carrot juice and milk. So in my instincts, I'm more an animal than a thinking human. And I know it was the carrot juice and the milk that brought me around. I thought it was mainly the care of juice because of the high sugar content at that time. But after I'd studied years of milk, I realized that milk cream aided my brain, not only the carrot juice. It was a combination.

Q: Was it pasteurized milk?

A: Pardon?

Q: Was it pasteurized milk?

A: Raw milk, yeah. He brought me raw milk, raw carrot juice. And we had Altadena at the time in California. So they didn't start attacking him heavily until, well, they did a campaign in 68 that we tried to wipe it out. They got so much opposition because Altadena was buying all of the United States. You could go to Alaska and get the raw milk. I found them on a little island in Georgia. So you could get that Altadena milk anywhere. So they were big and powerful. And those county health departments, state health departments were closing down. So he got attacked a few times. So the raw milk was available, raw cream, raw butter. But I didn't get into those right away. I got into the milk and carrot juice. And they tasted good. Oh, they didn't taste anything like the pasteurized, and nothing like cooked carrots. And I hated cooked vegetables. I'd projectile vomit. I was forced to sit at the dinner table one to two hours every night because I would actually projectile vomit from cooked vegetables. Broccoli, I could hit that pole right there. Asparagus, collard greens, broccoli.

Q: Brussels sprouts.

A: Brussels sprouts, I could hit that wall. Peas, I could hit your feet. And I mean, there was no control over it. And they would beat me and torture me, put me outside in the cold. So what I had to do was I had to learn to take a teaspoon. I'd cut my senses off, mash up the vegetables, take about a half a teaspoon of milk because they only allowed me a cup of milk at dinner. So I'd wash it down. That wasn't the hard part. The hard part was keeping it down three to five minutes every time I swallowed to keep myself from vomiting. So that was the kind of experience that I had. So I was used to eating things that I didn't like. And so when I was eating other foods, I got into carrot juice. And I'd only had cooked carrots. So when I was offered carrot juice and I smelled it, it doesn't smell like cooked. But I was refusing. It took him three days to get me to try the carrot juice. Then I didn't want to drink anything else, because the first thing, it tasted good. And then the milk, oh, he'd worked hard on the milk, too. And the milk tasted good. So I had no problems in drinking. So we went to a Bodhi tree bookstore in a wheelchair. I was in pain, but the pain had subsided by almost 50% from just 10, 11 days of drinking the carrot juice and raw milk, the raw carrot juice and raw milk. So we got Siddhartha, and I got $110 worth of books. And I had to borrow the money from Steve to do it immediately. So I gave it to him. So back then, in 1969, books were cheap. You'd get a softback book for $0.25. A real expensive, thick book cost you, hardback costs $1.95. So I got a lot of books for $110. One of them, Siddhartha, so I read that, about this guy who grows up in an affluent family, becomes a wayward whoremonger, even murderer, and comes back and becomes a mystical teacher in his elderly years. So it showed the range of what people can go through and what they can be. So it completely changed me as a person, opened my whole world up. So I gradually got better. I studied nutrition, lots of nutrition. There were lots of books about mind over matter. So I got one of those, one or two of them, or one that mentioned it. And after six months getting better, I thought, time for mind over matter. I'm going to instantly heal myself, and that's it. I'm going to go back to my donuts and RC Cola, and I'm going to prove that I've evolved. So in about 10 days, I was back in autism. Freaked out. It's like you haven't had the light on for 19 years, and all of a sudden, the light's flipped on, and you get to enjoy it for a few months, and then it's flipped off again. It freaked me out. So I went right back to the carrot juice and milk. Sure enough, within about 10 days, autism went off again. So I experimented with that three times in the next two years, and I said, well, I may have been autistic, but I'm not stupid. If every time I stop eating these raw foods, I become autistic. And every time I eat them, I become non-autistic. There's a link there that I'm not going to deny. 

And spirituality can go sink a ship if it can do it. It can move a mountain if it can do it. It wasn't going to change me from eating raw foods from then on. So I got healthier every year. I got a nutritionist that tutored me for two and a half years. He was a 75% raw fooder. He was an Italian who had a diet, I mean, a weight problem. So he would get upset when I would start sucking cream and butter down too much. But that's the only way I'd... Oh, and another thing that I got was psoriasis and bursitis from chemotherapy. The psoriasis, like I said, open sores everywhere. And then going all over the floor with open sores everywhere, all over my body. So butter helped that so much, and the raw cream helped calm my anxiety. I was in anxiety my whole life. So the cream helped settle that when I added it to the milk. And my nutrition, my tumor got upset, you know, that I was eating so much fat. I wasn't anywhere fat like he was. I mean, I was fat, but I wasn't as fat as he was. He got on my case, so I finally had to leave him. I said, I'm not going to learn what I need to learn to reverse my problems that were mainly, that were all medically induced as far as I was concerned. 90% of it. So I got a Ligi Italian touring bicycle. Put four saddlebags on it with books on biochemistry, physiology, and anatomy. None on nutrition anymore because they were all full of crap. Because everyone was saying, this is good, this is good. And then the next book said, no, that's bad. This is good. By the time you read everything, nothing's good. So don't eat anything. Become a breatharian. That's impossible. Unless you just want to become the ether. When you come down here to be ether, that's for the other side. You're breatharian when you're on the other side. So I hopped on this bicycle and traveled for three years all over the North American continent living out of a sleeping bag or a hammock. And I traveled across the United States on my bicycle five times, all the way down to the Yucatan, all the way up to Alaska. And I lived with four Indian tribes in that three years, or in two and a half years of that three years. And every one of them told me that what I needed to eat was raw meat. Now, after my vagotomy, after the stomach surgery, if I ate cooked meat, I broke out in boils from my scalp all the way down to my knees. Very painful, very big pustulation, full of white blood cells surrounding the toxins. So I became a fruitarian, vegetarian, stopped the dairy, stopped raw eggs, and became a raw food fruitarian. So for six and a half years, I was a vegan, raw food fruitarian, graduating through that, up to it. And then the entire time that I lived outdoors, I was a fruitarian. Once in a while, I'd be so famished that I'd go to a health food store and get some raw cheese and eat it. And that was probably about every three months I did that. And I would gorge on a pound of it. And then it would be another three months before I did that again. But I was mostly a raw fruitarian. And I was deathly afraid of the meats. The tribes kept saying, raw meat is what you need. Each one of them, independently of each other, said, what you need to eat is raw meat. So after two and a half years, I was in Alaska. And it was in early September. And it was getting cold.

In September, it's already getting pretty cold. Snow's a few weeks away, maybe three weeks away. And I was so debilitated. During my bicycle trip, I had gotten down to 96 pounds. I'm 180 right now. So you can imagine what I was at 96 pounds. I was skin on bone. And that was it. So I was with the Eskimos. And they all ate raw meat, some berries. And the tribes that were way out the Inuit, the ones that I sought, didn't eat any cooked. Maybe in the winter, they did. And they never cooked before. They got these cauldrons. And the Germans bought them all these cauldrons. So now they travel with cauldrons and cook. But it's a very small amount of food intake. So it's still pretty healthy. But they tried to get me to eat raw meat. And they were having a festival that they had yearly in September. And I watched them dig out this hide, unwrap the hide. It was only about, probably at the deepest, 9, 10 inches under the ground. Pretty close to the surface of the ground. Maybe a couple of inches under. It was about that thick. Unwrapped it. There was this green, patinaed, black, white, moldy stuff. They unwrapped it. And it was disgusting. Stunk. I mean, it smelled like, you know, I'd gone past a slaughterhouse that they had closed in Georgia once. And they hadn't cleaned it when it was abandoned. And it reeked. And that's what it smelled like. 

Q: It wasn't frozen, was it?

A: Oh, no. This was buried and warmed. It was that part of the year. So it was fine. So, and I mean, it was moldy. Made of mostly mold. And I thought, you know, they have some kind of herbal stuff here, but what makes it stink so bad? What herb stinks that bad? So they told me, the kids are jumping around. They smell it. It's like cotton candy. And the adults are happy. They're smelling it. Everybody, and I'm trying to vomit. Trying to keep from vomiting. And it didn't stink badly enough. They got a bird call from downwind. And they heard it a few times, so they wrapped it back up and buried it. I said, what's going on? They said, oh, it wasn't ripe enough yet. It doesn't stink a half a mile downwind. So it's not ready. So they buried it for another five days. They dug it up. If I got within five feet of it, I got a headache. And it automatically started gagging. And they are just going, wow, the kids are eating. I mean, we're talking about children like that, eating a whole handful of this rank meat. And the adults eating large sections like this. Each person had a roll. Kids had a small roll, and adults had bigger rolls. And they were all having such a good time. It was a lot of chaos. My own doing, because I wasn't participating. I was just trying to keep from vomiting and getting a headache. So they kept offering me some and offering me some. So I had some cotton balls. They put some musk oil, real bulls balls fluid. And then put it up my nostrils. And then ate about a ping-pong ball-sized amount. And as long as I didn't smell it, I was OK. It was very tender. It was melting. So I ate that. Went back to my sleeping bag a few hours later. And by that time, I was so thin. I probably maintained 96 back up to 113, because I started eating 8 to 10 avocados a day and 7 pounds of nuts a day. But I couldn't go over 118. And I stayed around there. But that was pretty weak and pretty thin. So I wasn't tolerating the cold very well. So I went back. And when I'd get out of my sleeping bag in the morning, I couldn't get out until the sun had beat on the sleeping bag for one and a half to two hours. And I would always wake up right before sunrise. Or before dawn. Or before it became light. And I would lie there for hours in agony, pain, joint pain, like I did when I was a kid. So the sun would beat on the sleeping bag. After an hour and a half, two hours, I'd crawl out of the sleeping bag and lay in the sun naked for about 10 minutes to 30 minutes. And then I'd be able to move with a mitigated pain enough to move to where I wouldn't fall over. So after having this ping-pong ball sized amount of this rotten stuff, I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in about 45 minutes after the sun hit the sleeping bag. Then only 5 to 10 minutes in the sun. So I went back to the elder and said, what were those herbs you gave me last night? They really helped. And he said, no, it's raw meat. It's caribou meat. 

And then we rolled it in some whale blubber, and then we buried it to let the ground molds and bacteria predigest. Because when we go through the winter, the cold, like freezing, destroys a lot of the nutrients in our body. So we have to build up for it before the winters come. So they do that every year. So I didn't believe them, because I thought meat dried and became beef jerky and then turned into dust, and from dust to humans, to humans to dust, like in the Bible and stuff like that. And all of my technical reading, gangrene is a fungus, a mold. But I didn't realize it. And that's what some of that was, gangrene. So I thought it was just rotting vegetation. You know how vegetation rots. It's moldy and stuff like that. I didn't believe him. I thought he was just trying to get me to eat raw meat again, like all the Indians did, try to kill this white boy. So I went to, I got on my bicycle and was going to just die. Going back to an old Indian burial ground in Southern California and fast myself to death. So I got back there. I was so weak and so cold, traveling from Alaska down through Canada. I started hopping freight trains and bungee cord my bicycle to the side and hang my hammock across the open door and just watch the scenery go by. It was pretty nice. And I got back to Southern California about a week later because, you know, you have to hop from one train to another. Sometimes the train will go in the wrong direction and I have to get back to that area and go down again. So you never know where you're going to stop. There's no, you know, on freight trains, there's no schedule that you can see. You have to get into the caboose or the engine room to know where you're going and what time you're supposed to be there. So I got back, I got down to the desert, built myself a little campsite and started fasting myself to death just drinking water, lots of water, so I wouldn't get headaches. Doing enemas, so cut the headaches down. And this den of coyotes lived up in the canyon and they would come down every night at midnight and scream and yell and howl and sound like a bunch of crazy happy people. And they would leave me every night at midnight and play this little game after about two weeks, not quite two weeks, got to the point where one would come out, jump around in front of me and the others would go through and wash around me. And that's the point where I could detect where they were. And then at that point when I was able to detect all 11 of them, and that's when I found out there were 11 of them, next night they hunted and caught a jackrabbit for me. And one held it, ripped it open here, laid it on my feet. One of the reasons I became a vegetarian was I loved animals, except for the human animals. All other animals, snakes, scorpions, everything. Tarantulas, I played with all of them. So here was the Easter bunny on my feet. And coyotes were giving me this offering, and it felt good and warm. 

So all of a sudden, this conversation that my uncle had with my cousins and brothers before they went rabbit hunting went through my head. And I was autistic at the time. And here, the exact words, I think they were exact words, were playing like a tape recorder, like a recording in my head. And my uncle had told my cousins and brothers that when you shoot a rabbit and you skin it and you cook it, you have to cook it until it's black on the outside and brown on the inside, but no pink. Because rabbits, wild rabbits, have a microorganism in them that will take over your body in two days, painfully, and you'll die a miserable death. Painful death. I thought, coyotes are going to help me die. Quickly. I said, two days of pain, I can handle that, no problem, from where I'd been with pain. So I said, OK. So I picked up the rabbit and started eating it. So I was vomiting. So I went back to the dinner table that I'd suffered killing, holding the vegetation down, psyched myself into that place, started eating the rabbit, holding it down. And after about 10, 12 bites, it became so delicious, I became rabid. So I just, like, keep it with the liver, because it was wild. So I ate about 3 and 1⁄2 pounds of this jackrabbit. A jackrabbit's about 7 and 1⁄2 pounds. Coyotes shared the rest. And I went back to my campsite to die. And I knew I was dying, because I felt good. First time in my life where I felt good, except in a near-death experience. And I had three near-death experiences, two on the operating table where they revived me, and one on drugs. And luckily, I passed out on a heater, so my body didn't cool. My blood stayed warm. And anyway, when I was leaving the body, there was no pain. So when I was walking back to my campsite after eating all of this rabbit, I felt light. Hardly any of the pain was just a memory that I see. It wasn't really there, so I knew I was dying. So I got back to my sleeping bag, went to sleep, expected to go through the tunnel of light, get to the other side, woke up the next morning, and I'm in my sleeping bag. So I said, oh, shit. I guess I'm going to have to die slowly in pain. But that's OK. I only have two days. And maybe only 36 hours now at that point. So I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in about 35, 40 minutes, 45 minutes maximum. The sun beating on it. I was able to get up and walk around. After about 10 minutes, the sun beating on me directly in my naked body. And I just kept drinking water and fasting, waiting for the stomach cramps to come along, waiting for death to come. Three days later, nothing. Four days later, nothing. And I had more energy and felt better than I had in my whole life. I didn't have to have all the sugar from all the fruit to give me all that high that it used to give me. You know that manic you get when you're on all that fruit?

Well, I had lots of fruit. I thought that was a good thing because I had come from such a bad place with no energy. I thought that was good energy. Then I realized I was taking my muscle tissue and bone and everything else away. Teeth were starting to rot like crazy. So after four days, nothing happening. I'm still feeling pretty good. I thought Indians were trying to tell me the truth all the time. We're all meat. So at that moment, a sidewinder rattles me. You might see Indians go up and put their moccasin foot on it or shoe on it, pick it up, and run around. Turn it around and snap its head off. Peel it back and eat it. Raw. In all of America's, Latin America's, the most medicinal food is the snake. That's why the snake's weaved around with the medical emblem. And it used to be known. Now they keep all that stuff. You miss every piece of information. 99% of it you get in the medical profession. Exactly the opposite of what they got. Exactly the opposite. So you can't eat snakes and all this stuff like that. So I went up barefoot, butt naked. Head on the side, foot on the sidewinder's head. Picked it up in front of the rattler. Spinning it around. I said, oh, shit. I'm not going to do it. I'm not going to do it. How did he do it? I'm trying to remember. How did they snap that head off? Did they do it like that? And I wasn't too much of a whip snapper. And so I was trying to figure it out. Spinning it around my shoulders and elbows and wrists and aching and aching and aching. I probably wasn't spinning it for more than three and a half minutes. At that point, I said, oh, shit. It's either going to bite me or I'm going to eat it. One or the other. And I snap the head off and take this one right off. Peeled it back, and all of a sudden, six cats show up from nowhere. And they eat this snake with me. It does not taste like chicken. Raw, it tastes like fish. Mild fish. And there are so many... You think fish have bones? These things have bones. Wrapped all the way around. Right in between. It's tough stuff. Depending on the age of the snake. This was a tough one. It was pretty big. So it took us a day and a half to eat it, the cats and I. And as soon as the snake was gone, the cats left me. Eat and leave. So I was there by myself. So I was catching scorpions, tarantulas, chipmunks, anything I could eat, eggs I could find. And I was living in a desert canyon, so not much there. So I got on my bicycle, went down, and visited all the farmers around. A lot of the farmers living in a 10-mile radius, 12-mile radius. And made deals with three of them to milk goats, to shovel manure, to do whatever, in exchange for milk, eggs, meat. And fruit was all over the place. They say there's a food shortage. When I was bicycling around, half of the fields of food were left to rot. Keep the price of food high. Half of all of the orchards and fields that I would buy were left to rot. Harvest. And they paid these people exorbitant amounts of money not to harvest their fruit or their crops. That is the truth of what's going on. There's no food shortage. There's an excess. It's all about keeping the price of food high.

So I made the deal, and within, you know, eating all of the eggs and meats and dairy, within about five months I had gained about 55 pounds. So I looked like Schwarzenegger. Like him, only with, you know, a little bit more fat. Not as tall as he, of course. And I felt great. Different meat, meat that I'd never experienced before. So I went back to Los Angeles, spread the word. Raw meat is the answer. And they said, are you crazy? You've got to get a brain fix. You'd be an idiot. So I've been there, done that.

Q: What year was that?

A: Huh?

Q: What year was that?

A: That was 1976. So September of 76 is when I ate the rabbit. And December of 76 is when I went back to Los Angeles. Actually, it was last week in November. Yeah. So, no, it was the first week in December. I kept eating raw meat because it was the only thing that made me feel balanced and healthy and alert and focused. Of course, I ate the dairy. And I ate the meat two, three times a week, four times maximum. You know, one meal. So that was three to four meals. Two to four meals a week most often. Averaged out to three.

Q: When did you start adding cheese and honey?

A: Pardon me?

Q: When did you start adding cheese and honey?

A: Oh, I'll get to that. So I was eating all of this and feeling good and kept doing it. And people kept saying, oh, you're going to get brain tits. You're going to get parasites. You're going to get tapeworms. You're going to get all this stuff. And I just said, so what? It doesn't matter. You know? I know this is good. You know, being autistic, everybody lied about everything. So my parents were the biggest liars of all. You know, parents are. They tell children lies every moment almost. And at least in my family. And all the other people around me were the same way. The parents kind of thought I lied. And being autistic, you know exactly what somebody's lying. Exactly what somebody's lying. Because you're moving into a system that still is psychic. You know their thoughts. You know the meaning behind them. Even though it's not in a language. So hearing all these people say these things to me, I knew it wasn't the truth. However, after hearing it for three years, I started worrying. Am I going to get a parasite? Am I going to get a dream flu? I was feeling so good I was getting paranoid and going backwards. When I was in between and just getting well, I couldn't stir me from the positive thoughts of raw meat. But as I got healthier and stronger, I started worrying. And then I ate a poison mushroom. Gave me blood and bone cancer or leukemia. Three times worse than I had it earlier from chemotherapy and radiation. So in pretty bad shape. After about a year and a half after that, trying to recover, so slow, so gradual, I started eating meat on a daily basis. Twice daily. Started making greater progress. Took me about six and a half years to get back to a normal state. But it was 11 years for me to get back to where I was before I ate the poisoned mushroom. It was the only deadly mushroom in the world that I had. Death cap. Amanita. I just misidentified it. I picked it out of a yard that had chemicals on it that shouldn't have even done that because it deformed it so it didn't look like it should. But it was delicious. I just suffered for 11 years for it. So I started eating meat on a daily basis, twice daily. And then I also started incorporating, after the poison mushroom, honey into the diet a lot more. Eating honey and butter together. When you're that sick from a poison mushroom and all the other things I've been through, everything, your body is so sensitive to everything. So I could tell, no matter what I ate, I could tell within hours what it was doing to me. So I logged all that stuff down and I started experimenting with other people because it affected them the same way. At least 85% of the time. So those are the remedies that are in the back of, you know, we want to live, a major part. Two-thirds of we want to live. So here I am today. 40 years dead. Walking dead person. I was supposed to die 40 years ago. And it doesn't look like I am. I'm going on my 62nd birthday. Pretty good, feel pretty good. Still get healthier every year.

Had some pretty bad accidents in the last four years. Broke some nasty bones. Didn't go for surgery. This tibia was split a year and nine months ago. And the tibia bone at the joint jammed and broke off into the femur. And they said I'd never walk again without surgery. I refused surgery and here I am. The leg doesn't, this knee doesn't go back all the way yet. But it's close. Another couple of years probably. So this body does very well. Getting healthier every year as far as I'm concerned. And I haven't had an exercise program since 1979. Except for the six weeks that I was trying to repair this leg. Well, for four weeks I walked in the ocean to exercise this leg. High so there would be very little weight on it. So I could get the leg breathing and working again while I heal. So I don't exercise. I carry my groceries once a week. Hours and hours I exercise my fingers. So eating raw meat is great. And it isn't that you have to exercise to be healthy. But if you have, if you're restless, you need to exercise. Absolutely exercise. Because there are people like Teva, she has 11 activity rings in her eyes. Jensen calls them stress rings. They're only stress rings when you don't exercise. That's what happens if you don't burn up those hormones that your body builds for physical activity. It's going to take it out emotionally. And then people are going to hate you all around you. You're not going to have good relationships. So depending upon how many activity rings you have, you have to do that much exercise. She has 11 and she needs to do 10-11 hours of exercise a day or heavy, heavy, intense exercise at one time, you know, for a couple of hours, three hours a day to dump it. Other people, they're just physically active. Let's say most people have four to five. So if they're active, just normal chores throughout the day, they're going to spend it. They won't go into that anxiety. If you are in anxiety, you need to exercise more. I have no activity rings. Or as they say, you have one activity ring, so there's none to show. So this is my exercise. Fingers is basically it. And I maintain all this without exercise. And you can build it and probably not lose it, because I've got examples of that. There was a 56 or 58-year-old man, I have to ask him if you want to see him. Came to be very sick and very skinny all of his life. Thinner than this gentleman back here. And that way all his life, always wanted to be bodybuilder, but was always sick, and exercised for a couple of weeks. And it would just make him so sick, so sore, he couldn't deal with the fibromyalgia that would cause, all the lactic acid that would build up and cause him sore muscles. So he went on the diet, he was on it for two years, felt so good, so great, put on about 20 pounds, and he's 6 foot skinny, and he's about 130 pounds, 6 foot, that's thin. You're what, about 150? Yeah, so you can imagine 130, what this person was.

So, he put on about 20 pounds, so he's up to about 150, 155, feeling pretty good, and he said, can I bodybuild on this diet? I said, sure, just eat a pound of meat twice daily, with a whole lubrication formula. Lubrication formula, like in the book, there's egg, butter, lemon juice, and a tiny bit of honey. And you have that with a meat meal. So you can burn the fat and not burn your meat. So you can add protein to the body. So after, I think it was two and a half, three and a half months, he put on four inches on his arms and six inches on his chest. In Gold's gym they accused him of using steroids. He says, no, I'm just eating butter, you know, eggs, meat, raw meat, and some honey. That's it, and eggs. So he went heavily into that. He just loved doing it. After a year he was putting on too much, too fast, too heavy, going too hard, because his body, because he was always aching, his body wasn't cleaning the uric acids out. So they were starting to collect the calcium. So he was getting stiff and sore, like before the diet. So he cut it out. It's been five years, no, four and a half years since he worked out. Well, since he started, so it's three and a half years since he stopped working out. He hasn't lost a bit of that muscle. He's still big. And he doesn't work out. He hasn't worked out in all those years, except with his girlfriend. And they have sex. So you don't have to exercise to maintain. Once you get there, you'll probably keep it without too much exercise. It depends upon how big you want to be. If you want to be huge, you might have to exercise a great deal to maintain it. Okay, we're going to go into the workshop area now. Is anybody here who wasn't going to stay for the workshop? Everybody's here for the workshop. Okay. We're going to start and talk about the... 

Q: All right, let's take a break.

A: I see I can go on ten hours. But you have to remind me, because I've gone on three, four hours. So somebody here has to remind me every hour and 45 minutes. Okay? Are you going to do that, Keenan?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay.

Q: People want to know when you're out there, so I can have you be lined up and there are about five to ten minutes in advance, and there is so much food. I've got all kinds of meat.

A: She's already started giving it to them now.

Q: Avocado pudding.

A: It'll take 15 minutes. That's good to have now.

[break]

A: Okay. This is what's in your bloodstream. This was about 40 seconds after rinsing it with distilled water quickly. So you see the phagocytes. You see all the red blood cell disks there, the blood platelets, all other kinds of nutrients in there, but it had a filter there, so some of it is... You can't see a lot of the fragments, the other particles that are in there, the other bacteria and so-called parasites that exist in the blood, and that's in the healthy natives' blood. This is the blood cell. It's fractionated. You can see the different parts. And you can see it has glands. It has organs. You know, everything is a macrocosm and a microcosm. They're all the same when you come into creature being, not talking vegetation. This is on the animal level. So everybody knows that the red blood cells have one job to do, transport oxygen to the body. That is their only job. The white blood cells are to eat anything and absorb toxins that may enter the blood or the digestive tract. You'll notice that you'll read many places, even Sally Fallon mentions it, that leukocytosis, when you eat a cooked meal, what happens? Anywhere from one third to half of your white blood cells rush into the intestines to deal with the toxicity. And it destroys a lot of those white blood cells. Where do white, red blood cells, where are they bred in your body? In the bone marrow. So if you look at the toll on the body from cooking, from having all that loss of white blood cells, and your bone marrow has to breed them, every time you eat something cooked, it's a problem. Now, when you eat a raw food with a cooked meal, it lowers almost to a very small percentage of white cells that will enter the intestinal tract. It will reduce the leukocytosis something where 80-90%. But still, you're losing white blood cells every time that happens. The body wouldn't be rushing white blood cells in there if cooking were toxic. Yet people will defend cooking, especially the food industry, all day long. So...

Q: Is that well known?

A: No, they don't let that information out. You don't see it very much. I mean, you'll read it. You look up leukocytosis, and it'll come up probably in a hundred writings. But how many millions of writings about blood and nutrition are out there? Leukocytosis is mentioned maybe in 40-50 books. Most of them are obscure books. I mention it in mine. Leukocytosis in the last half or the last third of the recipe book, the last 50 pages.

Q: Is that why when you hear about tribes, [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah. They played with the balance. They must have been curious about that. Intuitively and instinctively. If you have questions, it's better to write them down at the end because one time, I went on with questions and answers all throughout my workshop. I finished at midnight. Let me tell you, I will cover everything. If you were interrupted, it becomes a conversation and then the time goes quickly. If you have a question, write it down. If I don't answer by the time we finish in Q&A, ask it. So, the blood has a very specific thing to do. The white blood cells, their main job is to what? Grab carbon dioxide and remove it from the system. Carry it to the lungs or out the skin for excretion, secretion, evaporation. That is the main job of the blood. But what is the blood doing because the whole body is toxic? The blood becomes a detoxifying station, avenue, system, and a feeding system. And it's just meant to keep your energy level up. Oxygen, carbon dioxide removal. That is the specific job of the bloodstream and that's what happens in animals when we're all healthy. Healthy animals. My blood, red blood cells, are still, my whole circulatory red system, my bloodstream, is still dealing with detoxifying. Not as much as it used to, but it's still dealing with it. It takes 40 years, according to the work of Howell and Pottenger, to go from ill health to optimal health. He found that in cats that were diseased, well, Pottenger found in cats that were diseased, Howell found in rats that were diseased, it took five generations for them to become optimally healthy. For us, one generation of cells is seven to seven and a half years. So you figure it's going to take us 40 years on an optimal perfect diet to be completely well. Now, I consider that I got on an optimally well diet in December of 82 when I started eating raw meat on a daily basis twice. So from 82 to now, I've got 26 years. I've still got 14 years to go to be optimal, optimally healthy. And I feel, and I see in my body, I'm getting healthier every year where other people are deteriorating every year. Most people are getting ready to expire when they're 60. He's no longer ready to expire. He's getting younger. If you'd seen his body 10 years ago, completely different body. It was an old body. His skin was old, coming back to life. How old are you now, [unintelligible]?

Q: 61.

A: And you're 61 when? 

Q: May 21.

A: So I'm a month older than you. Here you can see the difference in this kind of a diet with all the raw meat and raw fats.

Q: I've only been on it for 7 to 8 years.

A: Pardon? 7 to 8 years?

Q: 7 to 8 years.

A: So he's doing very well. So I have 14 years to go. So consider that. You're not going to get well overnight. Rome wasn't built in a day. It took your body 21 years to get to a particular point. And it will take 40 years for you to undo and reconstruct. Because cells will transfer, just like mothers will transfer toxins to their babies and their children from their own bodies. You do that from cell to cell until 5 generations have gone by. Then after 5 generations, you're clean, optimally healthy, if you remain 100%. If you're introducing more toxins in all the time, it will take longer. If you're living in New York City, around all the diesel, somewhere else, it's going to take you longer than 40 years to handle that, unless you're eating a tremendous amount of fat, and you're eating the proper nutrients to be able to handle everything that is entering your body on a daily basis. So the blood has two jobs, transport oxygen, so we can have energy, so we can utilize fat as fuel, and anything else that's made into a fat. Remember that your body can convert proteins and carbohydrates into acetates, which are fats. But fats made, acetates that are made from, well, acetates are only from other substances other than fat. Acetone is usually always fat source and fat utilized. So those that are created from carbohydrate or protein, fats that are created from those two sources have a very low energy production. When the fat is a fat from the beginning, let's say from the animal to us, from the vegetable to the animal to the other animal, you have two and a half times more energy. You take a look at your bodybuilders, not much fat, not much strength. Look at your weightlifters, you'll never see a skinny weightlifter. You'll never see a ripped weightlifter. You'll never see a ripped wrestler. They need fat to have that power, endurance, and strength and padding. Take a look at those wrestlers. I mean, there's not a lot of them that can do it. It's probably one of the lowest number of athletes there is, but they are the most phenomenal. I can't stand to watch them, but it's a great show. These guys are flipping with these huge bodies, powerful bodies. They're slamming. They're gymnasts in combat. They should be breaking bones and everything, but they're not. They've got all of this fat in there to protect them and give them strength. They are particular bodies that have been able to handle cooked foods better than other people. Some of them eat a lot of raw stuff. Sylvester Stallone, when I knew him at the time before Rocky and after, I mean, tremendous amounts of raw eggs and raw chicken and raw milk. And I knew his wife well. She shopped for him. And all of those good raw things. Schwarzenegger, raw butter, raw eggs, raw meats, raw milk. Now he outlawed raw milk. 

Q: Not to himself.

A: Yeah, not to himself, that's for sure.

Q: Absolutely.

A: So he didn't really outlaw directly, but indirectly.

Q: He overturned it, didn't it?

A: Not yet. We're fighting it. It'll be in the courts a while but we've got a solid case. As long as Mark McAfee and Ron don't let a judge rule and they have a jury, we'll win. But then I've seen juries fixed too, so you just have to be careful. So anyway, the human body is a magnificent thing. So the blood is very simple. It's your source of energy, and the white blood cells remove the carbon dioxide. That is its sole job in a healthy body. Very simple. Look how much energy you could have if that's all the blood did. That's why those tribes that I saw. Can you imagine running 35 miles an hour and catching a horse on your bare feet?

Q: I'd love to see it.

A: Huh?

Q: I'd love to see it.

A: I got to see it twice. Amazing. But I was in a motorcycle on a hill. There's no way I could have seen it. Okay. Then we have the lymphatic system. And the lymphatic system is as complicated as the bloodstream. But what you have in a lymphatic system is you have these stations called lymphatic glands and nodes. And the nodes are ripped all the way through your body. They're this little pea-sized, sometimes smaller, little areas where your body collects toxicity. Breaks down, neutralizes the toxicity, sends it to the lymph glands to be broken down further if it has to be, and then pushed out into the connective tissue to be perspired through the skin. Sometimes it will dump it into the intestine. But the body tries not to do that because you'll be disturbing your digestive ability and your food. The nutrients are supposed to supply your body. So your body tries not to dump it into the intestines, but it's going to happen because you're so toxic. And it happens all the time, every day, at almost every minute. So this lymphatic system's job is to clean the body. It is also the main point of feeding every cell in your body. The lymphatic system is connected in the intestines to what is called the lacteal system. It's a web network. So when all of your food is digested, it looks like milk. No matter how it went into your body, it looks like milk. That's why it's called lacteal. And then it delivers it to the lymphatic system. The lymphatic system is supposed to feed the whole body and remove the waste. Now, because we're so toxic, a lot of the feeding of the body is done through the bloodstream. We don't have the energy we used to have. The more toxins and chemicals in it, the less energy we have. I have to take a look back 60 years ago when I was on my grandparents' farm. You had men down, up in a loft and down below, and throwing up 90, 60 and 90-pound bales of hay with their bare hands. You don't see farmers doing that anymore. They have forklifts. They can't even do it anymore. They can't even lift a 30-pound bale of hay. Why? Because we're so much more toxic. We put more of a load on the red bloodstream. Now the red bloodstream can be involved in just delivering oxygen. It's involved in detoxifying chemicals that get into the blood. We use white blood cells for that reason. More oxygen stays in the body. What happens? I mean, carbon dioxide stays in the body. What happens? Lactic acid builds up in the muscles, crystallizes with calcium and phosphorus, potassium and magnesium, which are there to neutralize them. And you have collections of clots, caking, plaque, in the muscles. And you're stiff because you're not cleaning the body up. It's too toxic. You're putting too much of a load on it. So the lymph system is very, very important. And it's just as wired, just as complicated as the bloodstream and the neurological system. The neurological system, you can turn this around and say it's just the same way. We have the same systems that go through. We have these three fluid networks that go all the way through the body. The neurological system is to deliver what? 

Information, so we can control body movement, so we can do something with this body. What does the neurological system use mostly? Metallic minerals to reflect light and conduct electricity. So where do all these metallic minerals come from? We have trace amounts in every food, just enough. What happens when you cook your food? You make free radicals. You break the ionic bonds with these minerals. Then they become free radical damaging heavy metal toxins. Where do most of them get stored? In the brain and nervous system. Why the brain and nervous system? Because we know in science that wherever there is fat, you'll find the greatest amount of toxins. Fat binds with the poison and keeps them from doing damage. The brain is 60% fat. The myelin sheath is 60% fat. So all those heavy metal toxins go to the brain and nervous system. And you wonder why people are whacked out. Why people aren't rational. Why people go to war. Why people fight instead of resolving issues rather than being compatible. Because your brains are not functional properly. It's like expecting a drunk to be sober. When you go off on a tantrum and do something illogical, irrational, you have to realize it's a chemical response. How do you stop that? You've got to pull that stuff out of the fluid system of the neurological system. Out of the blood. How can you do that best? Eating cheese. Pull it out and absorb it. Eating cheese every few minutes. Eating a little bit of cheese. Pull it out of the system. Don't have more sugar. Don't have more fruit. Don't have any candy. Then you'll just increase it. It'll get worse. Can't expect a drunk to be sober. It's not going to happen. You have to get the alcohol, just like in the alcoholic, you have to get the alcohol out of the blood and out of the brain. For them to become, him or her, to become rational.

Q: How long does that take? I mean, if I think of an alcoholic, most of the DTs, right? And they freak out. So how does that cheese...

A: If I take a, if I put a, take a alcoholic or, you know...

Q: I'm a sugar addict. I'm a sugar addict.

A: So I think, 20 minutes? Eating a little sugar cube sized amount of cheese every 2 minutes for 20 minutes? It's going to be right down. Not all the way down to level, but way down from where we were. So, all kinds of little tricks. And I'm going to give you the tools today. So you're not running to a doctor. So you're not fighting when you don't have to be fighting and quarreling. Your body needs to get rid of these hormones and these toxins. There are ways to do it, other than having to express it in violence and craziness. Like a lot of diabetics do. And you get all that... People are told to eat sugar, candy, if they've taken too much insulin. Hello? I mean, the doctors are idiots. They're not just stupid. They're idiots.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I'm getting into that. That's the next stage. Like I said before you came, anybody has a question, write it down. If I don't answer by the end, we'll have the Q&A period. So the neurological system uses a lot of metallic minerals. Anytime you get an injection with liquid mercury and aluminum, where do you think it's going to go? Anytime you eat a food with some kind of preservative. Just remember, all preservatives, all additives, all poison, antibiotics, they are all metallically based. To poison the system, where do you think that heavy metal's going? Or even the aluminum, the light metal's going? It's going to go to the brain and nervous system predominantly. In all of the organs and glands, brain, everywhere. The neurological system, like the lymphatic, and the blood, reaches everywhere in the body. It's like a root system, a web system, everywhere throughout the body. It's like a leaf, you see all those little branches all the way through, everywhere, out to the capillary. So that fluid system is our main system. We're what? 55% water. This body's 55% water. Of course, people who retain water are a lot more. She may be 60%, 63% water, because she retains a lot of water. Most of that is not fat, because like you see, it's not fat. It's tight water. So she has to learn a way so her body can detox water and not hold on to it. But the water may be diluting toxins in her body, and she can't release it until she removes some of those toxins. There's always, depending on the person, why they're oversized. If it were fat, I'd be happy for her, because fat, remember, binds with poison. It keeps it from doing damage. Hers is more water than fat, so that's not as helpful. Because when you have soluble, more soluble fats, I mean toxins in water, they do more damage. So fat is always preferred. So we have all of these three systems. They will do their job without doing anything else if we're not overloaded. All of those systems are overloaded. We're dumping toxins into the nervous system. Where are we going to build all those metals? Where are we going to put all those minerals. When they're cauterized, they'll harden like clay when it's fired. That's what most of the minerals get. When you reach 141 degrees, normal low pasteurizing temperature, you cauterize 50% of the calcium. That is under a microscope, under filters showing that, yes, that much has been cauterized to a point where it's unutilizable. What about the other that's partially cauterized? It still isn't completely functional. And all those things are little soft, little spongy things. Utilize easily. Once you reach a heat temperature, they become crystallized, hardened. Okay, that's a vitamin C. This is vitamin C in its soft form in food. Just filter it through a micron filter and just wash through. This is after it's gone through the process of being made into a supplement, dried and dehydrated and heated. It starts forming together.

Once it's filtered, it'll start melting together like a clay. And when they dry it, you get rocks, spikes like this. You can take a look at that. These are the same size. This was shot at the same ratio that this was shot. They don't look anything like each other. And they won't. They won't assimilate. You can't assimilate this hard substance. By the time this gets to the bowels, most of this is still the same size. It'll be etched out and broken out. Your body's trying to use some of it. But it can never be used properly. Because it is a different shape. It is a different substance. We don't have all of the particular enzymes and vitamins and substances to reform this into this. This took a lifetime of that orange. A lifetime of that orange. That whole orange, a whole season to grow that vitamin C. Then we put it in this form and it's an entirely different form. It would take the same cellular organisms to make it back into a good processing, assimilating substance to be true vitamin C. So what this does is go in and starts cutting up and ripping up things that it gets into the blood because it's like glass. B1 is the same thing. They're all the same. I just wanted to make sure that you could see two separate ones. Let me see if I can blow that up a little higher. There we go. So you can see the B vitamins here. These look large, but what it is is some are already melting together. This is taken about four minutes after filtering. So you can see the darker areas, it's already turning in the B vitamins and it's starting to fuse together like clay. And this is after it's made into a supplement. Same size ratio. These aren't quite as large as the vitamin C crystals. And rocks and stones as the vitamin C was, but still you can see it's the same process. You can't really assimilate that. It is not true B vitamin anymore. When your E. coli takes it, it breaks these things down into the finest, finest particles to feed the brain and the nervous system. That's E. coli's basic chore is to break down nutrients and release B vitamins into the body to feed the brain and nervous system. Everybody says, oh E. coli, it's bad, you know. You wipe your butt, you better go wash your hands before you touch anything. It's absolute horseshit. All animals go around licking each other's butts for the E. coli every day. Nobody gets sick. It's a myth. They're trying to frighten you into using chemicals to sterilize and poison everything, including yourselves. Why? Because you're going to run to the doctor. You're going to run to the store. Everything's chemical you go for. And you're not going to go for food. The food is your only help. I'll just leave the little stuff I have. It has to do with cuts and stuff like that later. Okay. Do you want to give her a little milk?

Q: I'm taking it first.

A: Okay. Because I have a little milk if you want to give it to her. Give her a little cup. Put some in.

Q: That would be great. Thank you.

A: My milk, it's got a little bit of, you can see, it's got some of my old kefir in the walls of the sides of the jar. So, it's in there.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh.

Q: The supplements and milk, you know, when they pasteurize and all that, they call it fortified.

A: Oh yeah. That's what they fortify it with. And you know what vitamin D is? They take hydrogenated vegetable oil, subject it to radioactive material. That's what vitamin D is. You know what vitamin E is? 99.9% of it. Fuji and Kodak's developing waste. 

Q: Vitamin A. 

Q: Vitamin E. I wonder if I'm getting sick off of vitamin E. I thought it was just one.

Q: Is it a particular E that's made that way?

A: No. If you get an alpha tocopherol, I mean a tocopherol or an alpha tocopherol, it will be that toxicity.

Q: Thank you very much.

A: Yeah. It moves fast. I never refrigerated this milk. So it moves fast.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome. So that is the byproduct of developing film. Now Fuji and Kodak spent hundreds of millions of dollars a year dealing with their waste for years. So they got scientist after scientist after scientist trying to figure out a way to neutralize that toxicity because it's one of the worst in the world. Trying to neutralize that toxicity so that they wouldn't have to store it in these 12 foot thick concrete graves in stainless steel barrels. 55 to 100 gallon barrels. That's a fortune. Every year collecting that. You know how much before digital came in? You know how much of that they were putting in the ground a year? Burying it in the ocean? Dumping it in the ocean? Where the barrels, even if they're stainless steel, will eventually rust and break open? Millions of barrels. Millions of barrels were in our oceans too. So Kodak and Fuji kept hiring different scientists to look into it. This one scientist said, oh, well, our chemical waste here has a 70% structure of tocopheryl, of vitamin E. So let's call it vitamin E and sell it as vitamin E. People have it in such little amounts it's not going to poison them too much to cause a serious reaction, unless they take a lot. Nobody thought there would be Diane Cannons. They were putting down two bottles a week. What happened to Diane Cannon? Her skin got paper thin, started dissolving from it. Her whole neurological system started evaporating and she went nuts. Have I seen the Diane Cannon story? I warned her, too, in 1979. I said, Diane, you can't be taking this stuff. She said, they wouldn't do that. Oh, yeah? Anytime you get a natural vitamin E that says it's from soy or corn, five units out of every hundred may be from corn or soy. But again, you've got a processing problem. It will alter. But the other 95% other units out of every 100 are from Fujis and Kodaks waste. And nobody questions it. Now, I had a hard time believing it because my nutritionist who taught me was the one who told me about that. And I said, you're going to have to show me the proof to improve it. So he took some developing fluid, put it through the process, and said, look at it. Now break open your vitamin E capsule and look at it. They were identical. Absolutely identical. But yet, vitamin E extracted from a food and filtered from a food without chemical process by just gravity and electrical currents. You can get them to separate. But it's a long process. These vitamin companies aren't going to do that process because you're going to pay $1,000 a capsule for pure, good vitamin E. Nobody's going to make any money doing that. Nobody has the money to afford that except millionaires. And they do make it for millionaires. Billionaires and millionaires can get vitamins made that way, and they do.

Q: So you're saying the food-grade vitamins that you go to the health food store and it says it's from food, you're saying it's from this chemical process?

A: Vitamin E. 

Q: The vitamin E?

A: Vitamin E, yes.

Q: So if the rest is from food, still I understand the chemical structure changes.

A: Right, right. But in vitamin E, if you were to get 100 units of vitamin E per capsule, that would take you a whole 5 ears of corn to get 100 units. How much money do you think they are going to make by only getting 100 units out of 5 ears of corn? How much processing is that to get 100 units of vitamin E?

Q: So they're blind on the bottles?

A: You have to understand that the manufacturer is not lying, he believes it. It is the chemical companies that say we can make that for you. Those are the liar. Your big pharmaceutical houses are liars, they know it on all levels. They know they're lying to the people all day long. For most of your supplemental companies, there are good people like you and me that want to have a good product, and they go to some laboratory, and they say, this is what we want you to make, and they say, okay, well, we can make that for you out of food. Where do they go buy that food? Purina, Kellogg, they get the corn waste, corn germ waste, and they process it. But what did Kellogg do to the corn germ in the first place? Process the chemical. But the lab won't put any more chemicals in it, so they're going to keep it organic. But was it organic in the first place? So you have to understand this whole chemical process. Only way you are going to get pure food is to eat food. You want to fast track a magic bullet, there are none. None. I don't care if David Wolfe is selling it, I don't care who's selling it. Any item that was food has to be broken down and manufactured into a powder. That is a complicated process that usually involves a natural substance like kerosene. Kerosene is natural. But would you soak your peaches in kerosene for 29 minutes before you eat them? That's what has to happen to get any of these substances. That's why they melt and turn into this. They're already melting on their own. Then when you put an active agent like a kerosene derivative in it or wood alcohol derivative, what do you have? You have a chemical annihilation and a transformation of the food that it was not what it was when it came off the plant. Or was the plant. It's a vegetable or something. Only way you're going to get proper nutrients is from food. Period. Anything that's in a package, can, jar, you don't know what the hell is in it. Somebody has put something in it to preserve it. Somebody has altered it in some way. I caught David Wolfe on three things. Three things. And I said, show me the information. And he sent it to me redacted. That means he had magic marker through it. But I'm a scientist. I know how to get rid of that. So I found out the laboratories. I found out the places where these things were made. And he said, well, 105, 103 degrees, 118 degrees. So instead of making the companies, and they can't do it. They can't make that product at 105 degrees. He raises the factor and said, oh, we can have food heated up to 118 degrees. All enzymes are destroyed or neutralized at 118 degrees. Except in milk, it's 122 degrees. Everybody is shifting everything so they can make their way into money.

Q: Well, the other day I questioned him about his powdered chocolate. He says it gets up to 128. But it doesn't matter because there's no enzymes in chocolate, so it's irrelevant. Do you agree with that?

A: Well, when you get up to 128 degrees, you destroy two-thirds of your vitamins. And you need vitamin A in chocolate to control the theobromine, theophylline, and caffeine. You've got three nerve irritants in cocoa. Why do you think these people are taking cocoa? To have energy.

Q: Yeah.

A: To have consistent energy. And they're really hyped up, those guys. That's what I mean. Well, they're hyped up on the fruit and those so-called superfoods. Those aren't superfoods. Those are just drugs. Those are drugs that over-activate the digestion, everything. It isn't a healthy, clean energy. Do you notice the different clean energy that... you have been eating the diet for about four years, right?

Q: Yes.

A: Do you notice the difference in quality of your energy?

Q: Yes.

A: Incredibly different. When I was a fruitarian, you know, I was going around with hyper-energy. I thought it was great because I had come from such a sick place. I thought that's the way you were supposed to feel, and I thought I felt better than anybody in the world. And I went around telling people, oh, meat-eaters are killers and murderers and stuff like that. They're die-hard evangelistic vegetarian fruitarians, you know? But I didn't understand the behavior. I had to experience something different, and I didn't experience it until I had the meat. It made my mind calm. It made everything calm. The cream took my anxiety away. It just, like, went through my body. I thought, whoa, this is living. I was still dealing with cancer and all those chemicals. So, you know, I was dealing with the pain and all of that together. But when I finally put it all together, 11 years after the poison mushroom, in the early 90s, when I got to that point where I was at a nice level, like I did right before I ate the poison mushroom. You know, I got to be at that point for two years before the poison mushroom. That perfect level. In fact, a few years before that, I even started exercising. You know, after working on the farm. I've never been able to exercise in my whole life. So I started running. I made it 10 feet the first day. Then 30 feet the next day. Then by the time a month went by, I was in a mile. And I had been barefoot. I started going barefoot, completely barefoot, in 1972. Same time I became raw. So I was running on gravel. I got up to 13 miles a day. Doing 250 handstand push-ups a day. Well, it was powerful, but boy, I had to work at it. Because I had no adrenaline for that. I had no hormones for physical activity. So I had to drive myself. And I drove myself a lot with this excitement. Well, I can do this, but every day I had to... Okay, let's help me do this. And I was sleeping a lot for the first six months of exercising. I go out and exercise, I come home and crash for two hours, two and a half hours. My body just wasn't used to it. So 1979, April, I said, you know, this exercise isn't for me. And that was the last time I'd been on an exercise program except for that four weeks of this leg.

Q: So that was the one year on the meat diet or the raw diet?

A: Yeah, it was on the meat diet. I was on a raw diet all the way up. I started eating the raw meat in 1976, September of 1976. And I started exercising a year later. And I exercised for about a year and a half until April of 79. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, it was the first time I felt I could have any energy to do anything athletic. So I was getting off on myself being able to do something athletic, to be able to run on gravel. And I was running sideways, backwards, and I was sprinting backwards. I was running around Hollywood high school where movie stars and all those people used to run in those days, in the 70s. And there was gravel around there. And I'd be running backwards, sprinting backwards, and these guys would be sprinting forwards. And I'd just keep going and going and going and going, and I didn't have to slow down. And when I stopped, my heartbeat was normal within three minutes. Three minutes, just like that, normal. And I always regulated my breath. I didn't do the [heavy breathing], because that exercises your lungs, and you're spending a lot of your nutrients on breathing in and out of the lungs. So I forced myself to breathe slowly. I didn't hold my breath, as you do in yoga exercises, and I did a lot of yoga exercises to control breathing when I wasn't exercising. When I was exercising, I would run and breathe about every five to ten seconds, in and out, slowly. So when I was finished exercising, you know, other than needing to sleep, I wasn't weak, I wasn't out of breath. I wasn't like [heavy breathing], like you see those guys doing, even if I sprinted.

Q: Why did you need to sleep so much?

A: Oh, my poor body wasn't used to removing lactic acid. And also I was building more tissue everywhere. Cleaning, you know, exercise causes mass cleansing too, because you perspire a lot of the toxins. Now I had put a skin layer here so I could show you how the skin works, but it disappeared. So let me try to pull it up. Just give me a second here. Let me try to find it. It's not giving it to me. It's frozen for some reason. I don't have it connected. I have to have my outer hard drive. That's why it disappeared. Anyway, you've got layers in the skin. You've got anywhere from 3 to 11 layers. In the brain, the meninge is anywhere from 8 to 11 layers. So it depends upon a lot of the tissue around your lymphatic glands will be thicker because you're dumping more poisons through it. Now there are some new guys out there that are saying, oh, your skin's too thick. It should be real thin. You have your [unintelligible]. And they're saying, take DSMO and all these other things to detoxify quickly. You're just detoxifying the outer sheath when you do that. I look in their eyes, and I see they've got a tremendous amount of toxin. Now the skin is too thin, what's going to happen in the next few years from this chelation therapy that they're doing? It's going to rip and tear and damage to the point where they won't have live skin. So I'm going to be scar tissue. I've seen it dozens of times. I happened to be privy to the first chelation therapy that was ever done. And that guy died of a heart attack because his heart tore eight months later. It just thins the system down. And I watched him go from a thick-skinned person to a very fine-skinned person. It was the end of it. So anybody, when they were doing it at this Raw Games, there was a table there saying, oh, detox, get that skin thin. And I looked at these guys that had done that. Only four years into it, and they're in trouble. They keep it up, and they're in trouble. They're already in trouble because their skin's not going to be able to get rid of that poison very easily. So don't be hopeless with that. They look good on the surface, but inside, they're not. They're not finished cleaning the inside. Oh, but they'll claim that they did. They cleaned the inside. I see in the eyes, and I'll take you through some irises to show you how you can tell if somebody's toxic or not. And I'll do that when we're on break. I'll pull some irises up there so you can see the next time we're on break. So the skin is the most viable point to dump toxins, and you do it with perspiration. You can evaporate without even knowing it, without even being wet. But the wetter you are, the better. Now, that lymphatic system is very jammed. Remember the lymphatic system? It's supposed to feed the body, every cell in the body except the red and white blood cells, directly feed them, and remove the waste products. The lymph system is so clogged that it isn't even feeding much of the body anymore. The red blood cells system is doing that.

What clogs that lymphatic system the most? Vegetable oil. What hardens cells the most? Vegetable oil. Hydrogenated vegetable oils are the very worst of those. Why? Because what happens if you hydrogenate a vegetable oil? It has the exact same molecular structure of plastic. In fact, that's how you make plastic. You take a fat, you hydrogenate it, you heat it while you're hydrogenating it, and you have plastic. Now, because most plastics are made with vegetable oils, that's why they got off of your case so much now. You're not being stressed to eat only margarine and those other oils because they found other uses for them. They're not just trying to sell them on you eating them, eating plastic. But all these plastic things, this carpet is all plastic. They may have so many uses now, they don't need you eating margarine. You know they have other uses for them. But that plastic is toxic. You got polymers in it, everything. And you notice how plastics mold. Remember that massage table you saw today? How much mold was in it? Your normal plastics in cars, toys, carpets, they've got dioxins introduced... Dioxins and poisons made to destroy the fungus, the molds that will destroy plastics. Plastics were kept to be used in your everyday products for almost nine years until they created enough poisons to stop mold from breaking down plastic. Once they did that. I mean, if you had a car and the seats were made of plastic, they would mold in a year, even six months. So they couldn't do that. They needed them to last 20, 30, 50 years. And if they broke down, they broke down from wear and tear, from use, not fungus, not molds. So they poisoned, they created dioxins, the worst poisons on the world, so that they can use plastic as a product. It's in plastic clothes, in synthetic clothes, rayon, polyester, anything that is not wool, that is not cotton, not silk. Even hemp, some of them were treated. Every time you lint, clothes, carpet, drapes, that lint, you see, get into the air when this light streams in, you see all this lint floating around? If it's plastic and you're breathing it, you're breathing plastic. What does your body have to do to break that down? And what happens when it breaks it down? What are the constituents of that plastic? Dioxins, heavy poisons, and polymers. Do you know how much cancer that's creating? Extraordinary amount. When I was visiting Asia, and I've been all over in Asia, in Vietnam, 90% of the women are running around in pajamas that are called dresses. They're running around. What women wear here in synthetic pajamas, they wear as normal clothes. And it's all synthetic. The men, you hardly ever see them wearing anything synthetic. But the women, 90% of them are wearing these plastic pajamas as their normal clothes, everyday clothes. The rate of lung cancer among females in Vietnam is unheard of anywhere in the world. So you don't hear that.

When I was there in the hospital, there were 12 hospitals, the amount of women that had lung cancer was extraordinary, and breast cancer. Because if it goes into the lungs, what lymph glands try to take care of the lungs? All these lymph glands in here. The ones that are in the brain, these lymph glands here. Your three major networks of lymph gland activity is here, here, and here. And women have more lymph glands than men because they have more space for them. So what happens? Lung, breast cancer. Highest in Vietnam women. Because of that plastic clothing. So you have to be very careful. Don't move around too much and get too much lint off of this carpet. If you've got a cotton blanket, put it under you at break time. I'm moving around on a cotton carpet here, so I'm just kicking up cotton. So it won't be so bad. You can break that down without having toxins introduced to it. So the lymph system, very, very congested. How do we get that melted and flowing? Well, first you have to understand how does it get clogged? We know that cauterized minerals from cooking, cake, collect like plaque. So that's part of it. But what about the fat that's in there? We have the hydrogenated vegetable oils. Now what happens when we eat vegetable oils? They harden and crystallize in the human body. In an herbivore, they have a body temperature of 101 to 105 degrees. So they keep vegetable oils fluid and liquid in their systems, constantly exchanging other fat and H2O molecules. Keep exchanging so it keeps it fluid. In our systems at 98.6 and lower, vegetable oils harden and crystallize and dehydrate. So that's what causes hardening of the arteries. We've been told all this time, cooked fats, animal fats, cause hardening of the arteries and cause heart disease. Not true. Take a look at the aboriginal tribes. You take a look at the, in both Australia and in New Guinea and Borneo, and you see they live on only meat, only animal products. No heart disease, no arteriosclerosis. Well then it can't be causing heart disease. But what about the people who eat lots of vegetable oils? They have the high rates of heart disease and arteriosclerosis. So vegetable oils is not for the human. An herbivore also has two and a half times more digestive tract than you do. Two to four stomachs except for the horse. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule and get the fat and the proteins. Food travels 48 hours through their system, 24 hours an hour. We have one stomach with two compartments. Acid, where we dump the acid, and where we dump the bile. We are not vegetarian animals. We were not meant to be vegetarian. We're not herbivores. Vegetable oils will harden in your system. You don't break them down properly. So, you got a hardening of your body? It's cauterized minerals from cooking, or supplements, and eating vegetables, cooking vegetables, and absorbing the vegetable oils that you didn't digest properly, or eating margarine, or some other kind of cooked oil.

Q: Isn't it coconut and olive oil as well?

A: No. Olive oil is a fruit. Coconut is a fruit. Vegetable oils or anything, seed oils, safflower oil, anything like that goes on. Even though a seed is a fruit, it's not really a fruit. It's a produce of a plant, and technically it's a fruit, but it isn't. 

Q: So, if you cook vegetables, say you do a vegetable soup, right? So, you cut up your vegetables, and you're saying that oil in those vegetables will crystallize in your system.

A: If your body makes those fats into the cells. You're producing millions of cells a day. Literally, somewhere around 10 million cells a day. They're going to eat fat, and if all you're feeding them is cooked vegetable oil, those cells are going to have a hard and short life. 

Q: If you do that, and let's say, I find when I eat my vegetable soup, I love to have butter with it. Like butter with bread or something. Does that mean that my body is trying to balance it out?

A: Absolutely. Good instincts. That's why you're larger. Most people's bodies aren't smart. I like people who are overweight because they're protected. I told a story two days ago. Was it yesterday? 

Q: Saturday.

A: No, Saturday. I had a guy who looked like he'd been a biker all of his life, and he had been. And thick skin, hardened, thick skin, damaged. And he came in for a consult. This was in Asheville, North Carolina. And he was bearded and all of them like that. Rough and gruff. Thick, hard, you know, skin like you see with shots of old American Indians that are old. And I shot his eyes. And I'm looking at his system, and I'm saying his liver looks like he's 30 years old. You know, his heart's in good shape. Everything's in good shape. But his skin. And I said, this doesn't make any sense. He was like 20, 25 pounds overweight, maximum. So I said, you know, I don't know. I don't believe in extraterrestrials only because I haven't met them. But they're probably out there. Are you one? I said, because I can see that you've done some pretty damaging drugs and alcohol in your life to have skin like that. But your liver doesn't have cirrhosis. It's a very tiny spot on it. And your pancreas is good about 3 quarters. It's like a 30-year-old. And his whole system was in pretty good shape internally. Even his digestive tract was pretty good. And I said, you're only a few pounds overweight. That's what I like people to be, about 25 pounds overweight, 20, 25 pounds overweight at any time. And he said, well, before I went in, you died three months ago. I was 300 pounds, four months ago. I was 300 pounds. So even though he had bad fat from bad sources, they protected him. He had so much of it to be 300 pounds. And he wasn't a tall person. He was about 5'8". So being 300 pounds in my size, it's double my size. So he was big. And you have to look at me, and yes, I'm fat. Don't show it. He thought I was about 10% body fat. Well, when I checked the reading a few months, it was about two months ago at a hospital in Thailand, I was 24% body fat. I haven't changed any since then. 24% body fat. But I don't look it, why, because when molecules are raw, they are tiny, very, very tiny. When you heat them, they start swelling. As you cook them, they get larger. They get anywhere from 10 to 50 times their normal size. So I have all this massive fat on me, but I don't look it. Most people who go on this diet will look bigger. Now, when I first started eating all the raw fat, I blew up. I mean, I wasn't trim like him. I had layers, you know, over that. But still, I had, you know, a controlled amount of fat, but it was probably 28%, 30%. But it was a lot larger, because I had so many old fat molecules that were huge. And if you want a comparison, you take, you know, pig straps, fat. And you see when they boil it and make it crisp, those little bitty thin things turn out to be this big and this fat. That's how bad. Pig fat swells the greatest of any fat, for some reason. That's why a lot of people use it as good lard, cooking lard, because it would fill them more, give them more substance. However, it wouldn't necessarily make them healthier, but it would still protect their bodies.

A lot of fat protects the body. So this guy was able to go 30 years, he said, abusing drugs and alcohol without severely damaging its internal organs and glands, because he had all this immense fat to absorb the poison. Those people who don't, it just rips them out and will kill them. This guy can just go and abuse himself every day and have the fats to protect himself. Not the greatest fat, and I doubt that he will have a great longevity, but still, his whole body was in better condition because he was a fatso. And when a lot of people walk out of my room, they've been fat all their life, they are so happy because they've been beat up by the media, fashion, everybody's been beating them up for being fat. And it's better than being skinny. A lot better than being skinny. To be protected. So let's go down the digestive track. We talked about it in herbivore, what's happening? You know, the long digestive tract, the two to four stomachs, the whole system being different, the digestive enzymes. When we eat, in our mouth, we have more bacteria than any other animal on the planet, including monkeys and apes. More than dogs and cats. We have somewhere around, I think it's one and a half times more bacteria than a carnivore. Why? When we have bacteria, except for meat. Meat breaks down bacteria. The kind of bacteria we have. The only alkalinizing enzyme that we have in the mouth is ptyalin, the same as the horse does, to digest carbohydrates. And that is such a small fraction of it. Of the enzymes in the mouth. Ptyalin is so small, it'll just take care of the sugars that are in meat. So our mouth, our bacteria level, is perfectly meant to digest animal products. Our teeth. I don't know where vegetarians say, oh, we have teeth of herbivores. Every horse, every cow, every sheep.They all have molars. Every tooth in their mouth is molars. We only have a few in the back. Everything is cutting and ripping. Cutting and ripping. Crushing a little bit to swallow. I don't know where these herbivores, I mean these vegetarians and vegans, get off saying that we have the teeth of an herbivore. We don't. Then you go down the throat into the stomach. Do we have cud that we regurgitate and chew and regurgitate and chew? We have hydrochloric acid. That's in carnivores only. So we have all this hydrochloric acid there. And that concentration, not as much as a canine or a feline, they have 15 times more than we have in the stomach. But they secrete very little in their small intestine. They have a very short small intestine, so they have to digest it fast. So they need that concentration of hydrochloric acid in their stomach. We have three times more space to digest it. And we produce hydrochloric acid all throughout the small intestines. And we constantly bombard it with bacteria. So what happens, the hydrochloric acid breaks it up, the bacteria feeds on it and eats it. The bacteria's waste are our nutrients. We're eating the feces and urine of bacteria. That's our food. If you got the proper picture, if everybody got the proper picture, people wouldn't think, oh, urine and feces, oh, how dirty. 

Now sperm and pussy juice, oh, how dirty that is. Everything's become dirty that's a fluid of the body. Why? Because the industries who sell toxins want you to buy their products. The medical industry, if you weren't afraid of your body and your fluids, you wouldn't be running to get antiseptics. You wouldn't be washing your hands every time. You might be licking everybody's butt like other animals do. To get those bacteria to be healthier, that E. coli is responsible for the final stage of digestion of fats and proteins and releases 90% of the B vitamins that are in any food for your brain and nervous system. E. coli is so important. And they try to smear E. coli like crazy. Salmonella. You have 6,200 known varieties of salmonella. 1,600 are in your nose. You used to have 2,300 on your skin. 2,300, 2,600 on your skin before you bathed. They would eat all the different dead cells. And each one would eat different things. Elephant eats trees. A giraffe will eat leaves. A deer will eat leaves and branches. But not trunks. Very little bark. So you have all these different salmonella that were feeding on the waste of your skin. So you weren't like a snake, peeling off layers at a time. All of these were meant to make life sustainable. Not to be afraid of them. So if you're not afraid of them, you're not going to run out and poison yourself. You're going to be able to handle your situation, whatever it is, with food. Whether it's applying it on your skin, whatever it is. Don't put anything on your skin that you wouldn't eat. Because your cells eat directly through the skin. I see people putting lotions, tons, lotion. It's motor oil, with lots of chemicals in it. Oh, but it's got vitamin E in it, it's got aloe vera in it. How much? 5%? What's the rest of it? It's all chemical. Most of it's petroleum, motor oil. Put it in your car, put it in your motor cycle. Not on your body. So you go down to the digestive tract, so you have the hydrochloric acid that dumps. Starts the breakdown of the protein, separating so the bacteria can get in there and eat. Free up the nutrients and feed you. Then you go down into the duodenum, the other side of the stomach. And then you've got the gallbladder that dumps the bile that the liver makes. Digests the fat. Then, all through the small intestines, you're getting a little bit of bile, and you're getting a little hydrochloric acid and lots of bacteria. Every time, you know, the intestines look like, you know, a bunch of villa. Like you go through a, you know, sea urchins and you see all these things going like this. And you see all the little particles going by. Well, as the food moves through, it moves these. It secretes all these enzymes with bacteria and acids, hydrochloric acid, in to help digest those particles. And the bacteria feed on and feed you. All through the small intestine. Then we get down into the bowel, and that's where your E. coli populates. And that's where your brain and nervous, where everything's reduced to the finest particle.

Because your nervous system has the finest veins, arteries going out everywhere. So you've got to be ultra-small. And E. coli is responsible for making those finite, small particles. And people who do enemas and colonics, they're not feeding their brains and nervous systems ever again. Every time they do a colonic or an enema, that's 60 days without E. coli. Or very small amounts, not enough to feed the system. So what happens, they start doing enemas every day, every two days. So they can flush some of those B vitamins that the E. coli are trying to digest into the system. So they become addicted to it. But every time they do it, the population of the E. coli gets less and less and less. They end up producing E. coli more. And then they're basket cases for the rest of their lives. Then they're on psychotropic drugs 10 to 28 a day. I've seen it many times. And how do I get them out of that? You guys see me on Ripley's Believe It or Not? I do.

Q: They don't have it on YouTube.

A: Pardon?

Q: They don't have that show on YouTube.

A: They don't have the show what?

Q: They have lots of YouTube Ripley's shows, but not the one that you are on.

A: Oh yeah, they've shown it more than any other episode. I just saw it six weeks ago when I landed in Philippines. Turn on the TV to see what the atmosphere was like politically. And there I was. That episode came on. I was speaking Tagalog. I spoke very good Tagalog. And I did the same thing when I landed in Paris. You know, in 1993, I turned on the TV and there I was on speaking French. And I didn't speak French that well. But anyway, in that show, it was aired the first time July 17, 2002. I had one patient. She had been on psychotropic drugs for 18 years. Up to seven a day. Seven different ones a day, taking up to 28 a day. 28 drugs a day. 28 pills a day of seven drugs. Took me, I guess, a year and a half of her being on the diet. Back and forth, up and down. On drugs, you're not going to be sane. You're not going to be coherent. You're going to be inebriated. Like I said, you can't expect a drunk to be sober. So finally, she called me, complaining one day. And she was a famous yoga teacher. Video takes and stuff. And I said, look. You're going to have to try. At least try this high meat. You're like a seesaw on a roller coaster. Hard on me, it's hard on you. You hang up on me. You yell at me and stuff like this. I don't need that. You need to take the next step. You need to not go off the diet. You need to eat this high meat. I'm already on this diet. It's already so gross. People don't want to be with me because I'm eating this raw meat. Bam. So I get a call about three hours later. Okay, how do I do this? I said, well, you need small meat. Cut up small pieces and put it in a jar. You air it every two to three days if it's in the refrigerator. If you want it to move fast, you open the refrigerator and you air it every two days. One half to two days. I don't have that kind of time. I'm really at my wit's end. Well, I have a patient who eats it every day for the same reason you need to eat it. And you can probably call him. But let me call him first and ask him if it's okay. So I called the fellow. And they got together and she got some. So about nine o'clock that night I get a call from her. I ate that high meat. I got it from James. And I'm really nervous. I really need to talk to you. You need to answer this phone. There was no way in hell I was going to answer that phone. Because I would have been babysitting her all through the night. So every 45 minutes to an hour I get a call. Answer this phone. I'm panicking. And each time she says that, each time she calls, her level is until 5 o'clock in the morning she's laughing and whistling. I'm going to stay on this phone until you answer. And she's whistling, you know, what was that song? Happy Working, you know, for her. And I answered the phone. And I said, well, hi there. And she says, well, why didn't you answer earlier? I said, because I had to wait until you got to this state before I was going to talk to you. Because now I'll talk to you, you'll go to sleep, and we'll both be able to sleep.

You know, fine. Then I won't have to sit on the phone with you. And she started eating it, you know, a couple of times a week. That's all it took for her, two days a week. Other people have to eat it every day and a lot of it a day. But some people only need it a little bit to feed that E. coli. That bacteria predigests the meat. Predigests it. So when it gets into your system, it can be assimilated like that. 10, 20 minutes, you're giggling and laughing. Because those nutrients are already ready for your brain and nervous system. They're already reduced to that minute size that E. coli breaks it down. To which it breaks it down. So, those two, that guy who had the high meat and she, went on Ripley's with me. Eating this high meat with worms and gangrene on it. And all these jars with all these glands that were molding and patinaed. Everything that looked like, you know, from the Eskimo tribe. And it was raunchy and rank and they had a food inspector there. And he's going, oh my god, you're going to eat this, you're going to get sick. I said, I got a vagotomy and I'm eating this stuff. Doesn't that say that you're wrong? They cut that out, they didn't put it in. What I said to him was respond. Because they didn't want me to convince people that easily. You just watch these few people go in and I'm great and healthy and everything's fine and I'm eating the high meat. But you don't get any particulars of, you know, I have a vagotomy. I have no hydrochloric acid to destroy the bacteria. So the bacteria is really not a problem. They don't say that, as I said. But you get the image. You see my refrigerator, they overdid it. They took my refrigerator outside where I have all the stuff and that's one they showed in my kitchen. Actually, they took all the stuff and put it in that refrigerator. So it looks like that's all I ate. I didn't mind. I said, you go ahead and do it. I want these people to have impact on their brain. But this is the most shown episode. They've shown it 52 times since July 17, 2002. In fact, my friend of mine who's a dentist in Mexico sent me an email three months ago. He said, I just saw you with a beard on there. You were eating all this high meat. He said, you look good. I said, that was way back from 2002. So it's being shown all over the world. In fact, there was a company that saw it out of Germany, flew over to redo it for their show. And they did. We redid it. And both times, the cameramen were puking all over. Because they were getting right down near the smell of the meat. So I had to get little cotton balls with some clove oil and stuff it up their nose to keep them from vomiting. Anyway, that high meat helps feed the brain and nervous system and helps calm the system. One out of probably, I've gotten 600 people to do it, and only one said he had no effect one way or the other. But he wasn't depressed anyway. It feeds the brain and nervous system. Supposed to keep questions.

Q: I know, I just want to ask you a question... You said, how much is it aired out for two or three days you do it?

A: Yeah, it says how to do it in the recipe book.

Q: Oh, OK. 

A: OK, it tells you how to do it there. OK, so we're down into the digestive tract. Now, as food moves into the sigmoid colon, it is now called feces. At that point, your body absorbs as much as it can. If you have regular constipation, it's because your body's holding the matter up in the sigmoid colon, trying to absorb as much as the E. coli has digested and eaten. It's a problem, though, if your rectum rips every time you have a bowel movement. So what you can do there, and I don't think it's in the book. I came up with this in the last two years. You use three tablespoons of butter, three tablespoons of coconut cream, and three tablespoons of dairy cream with just a quarter of a teaspoon of honey. Put that in a four-ounce jelly jar. Put it in a bowl of hot water, not hot enough to burn your hand, but hot enough to get that inside 105 degrees. And you take a bulb syringe, about a four-ounce bowl, eight-ounce if you don't have a four-ounce bulb syringe. You suck that, shake it up, and then you suck it up into the bulb syringe. Get it on all fours, bark like a dog. And this is right before you go to sleep at night. And you put that in your rectum, and you squeeze it up in there to your sigmoid colon, and you go down on your elbows. So you're like this, and you roll your stomach like a belly dancer. Or at least breathe heavily to get it to move into this whole descending colon area. So get up in the sigmoid colon. The E. coli will be so happy because you're going to feel all that fat. It helps them relax. That fat will be broken down into particles that can go to the brain and nervous system over the next two days. So you won't have constipation like that if you've got regular constipation. Do that every two to five days, depending upon your constipation level. You're going to feel better emotionally, mentally, physically, everything. And you won't have to deal with some of the constipation. Remember, constipation is the body holding the stuff up. Unless you've got a tumor blocking the passage. That's when it's a bad thing. But you work with your body's symptoms. Your body's constipated. You're not digesting. You don't have enough E. coli. Start eating high meat. Break it down so you can populate them. Get some bowels from a pig or a cow with the contents. I have Amish farmers who do it and wrap it like a sausage. And you get this membrane full of shit. And you comb like two ounces off at a time. You know, and eat until it's gone. Like, you know, a cup of it. In about five days. Two ounces a day. Ounce at a time, twice a day. And you eat that a little bit before you eat your meat meal. Now, I hate cooked vegetables. So I have a hard time with it. But most people love cooked vegetables. And that's what, you know, cow shit tastes like. Cooked vegetables. Because that's what they're eating. Vegetables. That's what it tastes like.

The smell is what you have to get beyond. You give a swimmer's nose clip and put it on. You will get well faster. You will be happier earlier in your life. You will. You can control that by what you eat. Just remember, every animal goes around licking each other's butts every day, all the time, on their own, for the E. coli. Think about that. Why do they do that? Why do mothers eat up all of the fecal matter of their offspring? Because that bacteria gets into their milk, and that baby's nervous system becomes very strong. Oh, but that's disgusting. Oh, why am I baby-eating shit? You know, you've got to get beyond all that stuff. When I was in Alaska, they were living in igloos. Three-month-old baby, they put that bare naked on an ice floor. How many of you would do that without freaking out? What if you saw your husband or your boyfriend putting your three-day-old baby on an ice floor? Freak out. Why can these babies do it? These are resilient people. We are resilient people.´We have magnificent bodies. No longer, from this day forward, ever be afraid of anything that happens to your body. Your body is always, always doing what is right to correct itself, no matter what it is, no matter if it's cancer or what it is. Just do what it takes to reverse what has caused your body to act that way. And I have all of those remedies in my books. Everything to do in almost every situation. If you don't know what it is, or I haven't named it, and the doctors have named it, if you've gone for analysis or diagnosis, just remember how the body is built, how simple it is, where the problem is. Is it blockage? Is it growth of tumor? Is it a sore or rash? Poisons coming out of the skin? All you do is just treat the skin to make sure it doesn't get as damaged when the poisons come through. That's all you can do. How many times I got injected with poisons in my forearms, and I still had crap coming out. And it happens this way when I get less butter. And I'm at the end of my trail and I'm out of butter. I haven't had any butter for a few days, and almost immediately I start breaking out. I need my butter to make sure those poisons, the AZT that was put in my system, won't damage the tissue as much when it comes out. Sure I put some lime juice on it, I can put some other things, coconut cream on it, to help mitigate the damage. So I don't scar, but sometimes I scar. And these were both tumors. This was a big tumor. And they, you know, put the lime juice, coconut cream, sperm or bone marrow on there, and they just fall off. You finish gathering those dead cells, they'll fall off. Remember, cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve dead cells. If the body can't dissolve dead cells, what's it going to do? It's going to collect them and disperse them, like in fibroids, all over the body. And then if the fibroid areas are used and you can't build any more fibroid, then it's going to build tumors. Then what's the next stage?

You need a solvent, or a parasite, or a bacteria, or a combination of bacteria, colonies of bacteria, to eat those dead cells to reduce them to something that can discard from the body. That is the stage. Every time that I've seen a case of cancer, the liver has broken down for about 18 months minimum. The liver has shut down. People are not eating properly to feed their liver. And the liver has gone into a state where it's very deficient, or it's resting or detoxifying. So what happens? The body has to start collecting those dead cells it can't dissolve. And you have tumors. Fibroids are tumors. Warts are tumors. Any lump you have on your skin that is not normal is a tumor. Doesn't mean it's cancerous, but it is a tumor. It's a collection of dead cells. Your body could not dissolve and get rid of that. Mole, wart, any lump in your body is a tumor, unless it's a lymph gland or a lymph node swollen. And here's the big thing, especially women need to keep in mind. When you find lumps in your breast, cheer, be very happy. Because that's your lymph gland. Those are your lymph glands, that or those. Depending upon if you have more than one lump. Is your lymph gland swollen, trying to break down dead cells and toxins that could lead to cancer. Now remember, your lymph glands clean the body. So if you have cancer cells in the body, where are you going to find cancer cells? Always in the lymph. The medical profession says when you have 50 cancer cells per million cells, you've got treatable cancer. 50 per one million? Isn't that kind of radical? Maybe if you had 200,000 per million, you might say you've got something, a case of cancer. You might start doing something about it. But certainly not treating it with medical profession treatment. You do it naturally. But your lymph glands are always going to have cancer cells in them. Expect it. So if they do a biopsy on you, don't go for those anyway. But if you do and they say, oh, you've got cancer cells. You've got cancer in the lymph. You do not have cancer of the lymph unless you have rock hard lumps. Rock hard. We're not talking about rubber hard. We're talking rock hard. That is the only time you have cancer. Out of the probably 99 of 100 lumpectomy that I've seen, do them do, were on women who didn't have lymphatic cancer. They just had swollen lymph glands. They weren't hard as rock. They weren't cancerous. The women were having lumped off and mastectomy, you know. Night and day. All the time. Cut their breasts off. Cut their lumps out of the body. What happens if you're removing your lymph glands? You're removing the things that are going to get rid of cancer. Dead cells. You've invited lung cancer, liver cancer, throat, esophageal cancer. You've invited a lot of cancer, you start removing your lumps. My mother got cancer 8 years ago. The breasts.

Q: This is one of the most popular things. They take them out up here.

A: That's right.

Q: It swells.

A: It swells. It gets toxic. There's nothing there. I have one woman who had a jacket. A hardened jacket this big. All over there. Put her on the diet. You know, she was going to die. Definitely, within weeks. Lots of people like to come to me at that stage. They'll go to the butchers all the way up until the end. And then the butcher says, You're gone. Nothing I can do for you. And they'll run to me. And they expect them to reverse it. Still reverse 95% of them. So, within three months, her jacket shrunk down by almost 60%. She took care of children for a living for some television stars. And she was able to go back to work. She only lived another year and a half. But she lived every day happily.v She did the diet 100% strict. Her children came to me and said, What a great life you gave her at the end. That last nine months before she went to you, she was miserable. She was sick. She couldn't work. She was vomiting all the time. In pain with that arm and breast and underarm all the time. And within three months on the diet, all of it had eased. So, she got to enjoy the last year and a half of her life. In fact, that TV star came to me for help after seeing what happened with his nanny. You know, she's an older lady. She's in her late seventies. So, even that was able to give her a better life at the end. You know, I wasn't able to reverse it at that late stage with all that medical damage done. So, don't freak out the lymph system. You're supposed to have lumps. You're supposed to have lumps everywhere. Ever since I had my tonsils removed, these glands, you can see them still bulging. They've been swollen all my life. Does that mean I have cancer? Am I supposed to worry about these big lymph glands? No. That's part of me from now on. I think in maybe the next 14 years, I'll clean so well they won't have to be swollen. I don't know. I don't know what's going to happen in my last 14 years on a perfect diet. But we will see. Have I been going on for an hour and 45 minutes yet?

Q: It's almost 4 o'clock. So, about 20 more minutes.

A: Okay. Well, good. Is everybody holding up okay? Okay. So, let's take a look at the glands. Now we have the pituitary gland in the brain. Now, something I want you to understand, you go to a doctor and he'll say, 'Oh, you've got low hormonal activity, you've got low growth hormones, you've got low pituitary glands and enzymes, you've got low thyroid, you've got low adrenaline.' First of all, you're not supposed to have any glandular hormones in your blood when you're natural and level and healthy. Your endocrine glands are there for emergencies only. Adrenaline is for fight-and-flight. Pituitary, all of them, your pituitary is very active until you're 21, growth hormones. Then after that, it shouldn't be in your blood unless you're toxic because you have enough cells that have their own growth hormones. If your cells are healthy, each cell is going to have its own growth hormone. So when it divides, it grows. It will keep reproducing. We are on such toxic diets in such toxic environments, we're relying upon the pituitary to supplement for our damaged, unhealthy cells that can't create their own growth hormones. Well, animals in the wild, the native tribes who eat all raw, they don't get old like we do. They don't deteriorate like we do. Why? Because their cells... And I showed you the picture of the glands within the cell. Those are functional as long as that cell is healthy. Every cell produces what it needs to create its environment around it, to create its offspring, to bring up its new relatives, twins. Every cell... Cells divide. They don't have babies, they don't lay eggs. Cells divide and become two. Everything is a twin. Twin, twin, twin. They all have their own nutrients, they all have their own endocrine glands to make sure that life is viable and healthy as possible, optimal. If we feed it right, and it's all about us feeding it, and that's including what we breathe and everything else we do, that is feeding the body, are we doing it good, or are we not doing it good? Are we taking shortcuts that are going to affect our health and we'll have less health and energy? I guarantee you, people wouldn't be thinking the way they are and wouldn't be eating chips and all the crap that they're eating now if you didn't have central air conditioning and heat. People had to deal in homes like this, screens on it. When I lived outdoors, you thought about how you could keep your body warm, how you can keep it cool, what foods you can eat to do that, what foods you can eat to keep insects from biting the shit out of you, from mosquitoes sucking your blood and all of that. I go around Thailand practically naked with shorts on all the time. Mosquitoes are eating everybody else but me. Why? Because I learn. I stay away from high sweet fruit. If I eat the center of a watermelon, I'm going to get bitten by mosquitoes that night. Just like that happens. If I stay away from sweet fruit, especially the center of a watermelon, I don't get bitten. If I have, let's say, a little too much pineapple, I may get one or two bites that night. But still, not like everybody else, I'm getting bit all over. 

I saw a baby. A three-year-old child, a baby child, huge sores from mosquito bites. Very poor. They lived in this, you know, the trashy swamps outside of a city or in a city in the Philippines. Full of mosquitoes. And this baby was getting torn up. A mosquito doesn't put anything infectious inside of you. That's another myth. Mosquitoes do not give you malaria. They do not give you any disease. Look at it. The female mosquito, female mosquito is the only one who bites. The male mosquito, it's like the black widow. Black widow is huge, ten times the size of the male. The male is very small. Now, what is the job of mosquitoes? Mosquitoes pollinate. They are small bees. They are small. They pollinate just little tiny flowers the bees and the hummingbirds and the wasps and all those other insects cannot pollinate. So that little male mosquito looks like a tsetse fly. It's like a fruit fly, that's how small they are. A mosquito female looks very different. She's got a long proboscis. And at the end of the proboscis are teeth like the alien. So when she puts her proboscis into your skin, deep into there, she bites cells. You don't need to pull the blood. She sucks that blood in, goes back to the pond or the place where her larva are, and she plants it in a bubble for the larva. The larva eats the blood. She does not. If she infected that larva, if she infected that blood, what would happen? The larva would die. So this whole bullshit about mosquitoes infecting you is absolute horseshit, another myth. Why? Because if you go to a jungle where they want to tear down all the trees and all the environments want to protect it, you think, oh, mosquitoes. You get rid of jungles, you get rid of mosquitoes, you get rid of all... The whole consciousness of what they're doing to manipulate your mind so they can do what they want to do. Absolutely tremendous. And it is a conspiracy. Make no doubt about it. It is a conspiracy. So mosquitoes are not going to give you malaria. If mosquitoes gave people malaria, there wouldn't be anybody alive in South America or Australia, except in the deserts. And most places... Nobody would be alive in Mississippi or Louisiana or Georgia, southern Georgia, parts of Florida. Nobody would be alive. It's absolute nonsense. So don't worry about those things. Don't be afraid of nature. Be afraid of industry and its chemicals. And your own habits of cooking. The more you cook, the less health you're going to have because you're not feeding your body nutrients. Okay. So, look at each endocrine gland as an emergency. We have the pineal gland. Some people say it's a seat of consciousness. It regulates conscious states, they say. Alpha states and all that. Again, it's an endocrine gland. It's only supposed to function in an emergency. You shouldn't have to stimulate that gland for normal, healthy, logical thought processes. 

The pituitary and the parathyroid... I mean, the thyroid and the parathyroid. You've got a thyroid gland, two sides to it. Two parathyroids on either side of them are very tiny. Now, why would you have a thyroid and a backup of four tiny parathyroids here? Because this thyroid protects these glands, your neck, your brain, along with your tonsils protecting your brain. That's why you need a backup. Pretty important part to breathe. So this area needs heavy protection. The next gland, again... It doesn't regulate your hair loss. It doesn't regulate whether you're fat or skinny. It's the pharmaceutical industry sucking you in to taking thyroid pills. Thyroid protects the function of swallowing, producing mucus, all of the things that go into the functioning of this area. Your thymus. Your thymus is to back up the same way your lungs and your heart. Right here. What is it doing now? Our body is starting to produce white blood cells in there. Because our bone marrow is where we're supposed to divide the red and white blood cells. When they mature, it enters the bloodstream. They enter the bloodstream. What is happening now? We're so overloaded. Now the body is sending our immature blood cells to the spleen. That's the spleen's job, getting into the spleen when we get to that. So we have all of these glands that are working, doing things they shouldn't, because we've complicated the body with so much toxicity and so much work that it shouldn't be doing. So then we come to the gonads for reproduction, mainly for reproduction, and they will stimulate testosterone. Estrogen will be a replacement for physical energy. Women and men who have high testosterone and estrogen in the blood have a high physical energy level. Same with adrenaline. The adrenal glands are shaped like kidneys sitting on top of it. They're shaped like a little finger, about two joints of a little finger, sitting on top of the kidneys. Again, that's for fight or flight, adrenal. So all these are specific to a certain amount. So don't get sucked in because your level's low. If you have low energy and your hair's falling out, it's because you have some toxicity in your body. Or you're not feeding your body properly, you're not burning your fats properly, utilizing, oxidizing your fats properly to have energy. Don't go for the quick fix. The quick fix all that does is poison your blood, poison your intestinal tract, raises your adrenal level. And you think, oh, it's working. It's nothing to do with that pill directly. It's the adrenaline, the poisoning that's happening in your body. When you eat cocaine, do you know how much adrenaline dumps into your bloodstream? Eight times the amount it's supposed to in fight or flight. Same thing doesn't do with heroin. Heroin does just the opposite. Keeps it the same and lowers hormonal levels. But most of your drugs out there and your supplements will cause increased adrenaline, testosterone and other hormone levels. Why? Why would the body use hormones to elevate its hormonal level? Because hormones like the brain are 60% fat, 5% carbs, 35% protein. What harnesses toxins? Fat.

So your body produces all this hormone to deal with this toxicity. And people get higher, more energy, and think they're healthier. Take cocaine. You're going to do just as well with that. You're going to deteriorate the body with that high energy. Take speed, take Benzedrine, take any of those uppers. That's the same thing as taking a supplement. Some of them are going to be worse than others, of course. Cocaine is destructive to every tissue in the body. Yes, absolutely. Crack cocaine is even worse. Methyl, whatever they're smoking now, that stuff is... I mean, who can smoke that stuff? You use four to five types of detergents. You use kerosene, you use ammonia. Everything you put into that soup to make that crystal to smoke is completely an abrasive chemical. And people smoke that stuff. I had one patient come to me after ten years of using it. She was a 27-year-old woman. Her entire vaginal area was completely dry, hard. Produced no mucus, not a drop of it. Her mouth was shriveled in the same way. And she was smoking it seven times a day for about nine years. 27 years old, and I thought she was 40. A very unhealthy 40. I mean, we're not talking about any moisture in the vaginal area at all. Inside, not a drop or a speck of mucus. Completely hard. And she was moving into cancer fast. Nothing I could do for her. I mean, there was something I could do for her. There was no way that I could reverse that with her cooperation. Too much of a drug addict. It did help her, but she just kept taking the drugs and died. When you're that far along, and your tissues have no moisture, going to dry out hard like that, like leather. Like a belt, you know, with wrinkles. Really gross. You know, she was close to that point. Very close to that point. And she wasn't a drug taker. She was a supplement taker for many, many years. And that caused a lot of drying and hardening in the body. And you can see in her tissue, the place where that drying was. She was, what I saw, you know, a year ago. She was so much more dry and thick-skinned that you can see her skin is thinning quicker. Not too quickly, though. I hope you don't take any of that superfood stuff. It'll cost you. So anyway, some people can move, but she's not a drug addict. That's the only thing that she was. So anyway, you have lots of glandular activity that's for emergencies, and it's not normal. Your hair's falling out. There's some kind of toxin being built into the hair, damaging the follicle. Now, when I had chemotherapy, my hair fell out. Came back in gray and patchy here and there. Then when it came all back in, except here, never recovered here. In fact, it is recovering a little bit in the last five years. I had more hair gone before. Now I've got a little bit more hair. It's taken all these years to get rid of that much of the AZT, because AZT is very destructive. And I was all gray when as much of it came back in as came back in. And then eventually as I detoxed, my hair went back. Now, this area here has been gray for about six years. But it was this big, and it keeps reducing down here. Sometimes I'll have a patch for the last six months to a year on the back of either side. After that detoxes, my hair color comes back. So, the body can heal itself as long as you're treating the problem, giving the nutrients to heal itself.

Q: Are you saying that graying hair then is caused from toxicity?

A: Always toxicity.

Q: So, a lot of Asians you'll see don't have any gray hair.

A: And they're just not discarding it anyway, out the follicles of course, or building it into their hair. They don't eat enough. We, in our society, we eat a tremendous amount of fats and meats. They eat very little, 5-10% of their diet only.

Q: And sometimes they have a lot of gray hair?

A: Well, if you get a lot of heavy metals into the follicle, your body will use the para-aminobenzoic acid to deal with the toxin. Para-aminobenzoic acid in the follicle regulates pigmentation. So, it uses up the para-aminobenzoic acid, which is a B vitamin, to deal with that toxicity. It neutralizes the proteins to deal with heavy metal, whatever it is. Aluminum causes a lot of gray. Mercury causes a lot of gray. And whenever I take a gray area, as opposed to a colored area, and had it tested, the mercury was off the chart. And aluminum and mercury were off the chart. And AZT is loaded with both. Okay, so let's take a look at your... We've gone over the glandular system. Let's take a look at the organs. First one we come to, we have the stomach is really an organ. We talked about the hydrochloric acid dumping in. I know I'm going to go through this real quick. The hydrochloric acid dumping in to digest. The stomach is an organ. It creates hydrochloric acid in the stomach lining. We have the liver. The liver makes 60 varieties of cholesterol. Cholesterol is your best friend. A third of them lubricate the body and protect it. A third fuel you with the highest amount of energy, that is fat. You have two and a half times more calories than you do with fat and protein, I mean with the carbohydrate and protein. And the other is to detoxify the body as soaps, as cleansers, including virus. So, you need all of those. You need every cholesterol you can get. And if you want to know the real truth about cholesterol from a scientific viewpoint, get The Cholesterol Myth, the book called The Cholesterol Myth. This is a scientist who spends his whole life just studying cholesterol. Cholesterol is not your problem. It's the quality of fats that you feed the body and what kinds of cholesterols it makes. But still, cholesterol is never the problem.

Q: Even the two different kinds, though?

A: Just remember, you're going to have a waste product. The waste product is the bad guys. You're always going to have a high rate of... If you go on this diet where you're supplying all this good, rich, good fat, guess what your body's going to be throwing on? Guess what your cholesterol level's going to go sky-high? And it should. You want it to go sky-high. The higher it goes, the faster you're going to get rid of a lot of cholesterol waste, a lot of old, toxic fat that's doing you no good.

Q: Will it come back down over time or not?

A: It takes years. It takes years. The last time I was taken, five years ago at the University, Washington University Medical School in St. Louis, they were doing a study on raw fooders. And they came across me and found a primal diet raw fooder. And so they paid my way and everything, paid for the testing and all of that. I got them to do three other primals who'd been on it for at least 18 years. They were just looking at raw fooders for at least... They'd been raw fooders for five years. And, you know, they went through all the tests and couldn't find any... They found my congested artery here, which had been congested since I was a teenager, but it's less congested than it was a long time ago. I never wanted to focus on breaking that up until I felt my heart was free of the vaccine, the tetanus shot, because those heart attacks... Traumatic, blacking out, never going to wake up. Although I woke up every time. So, I'm just now, in the last few months, started eating vinegar... A few months before I went on this last three-month trip, I started taking vinegar and coconut cream. They'll break down plaque. So, that's all they could find there was just this one artery that had plaque in it. And I eat butter galore and everything you shouldn't eat. And the man who was running it was a famous cardiologist for sports teams, you know, NFL, all of them. So, he's a big man in the world. And he said, you're amazing. So he said, can we do some more tests with you? I said, as long as you're not x-raying me, as long as you're not injecting me, my glucose tolerance test is the only thing I'm going to do for you, eat sugar. And I was a diabetic, type 1 diabetic. I was going to be diabetic for my life, start eating, drinking raw milk. In a week I was off of insulin. Haven't taken it since. They found that when they did the glucose tolerance, I just like... from all that sugar, I hadn't had sugar since 1972, I think. January of 1972. And I'm just going like this. I'm saying, I hope this shit gets out of my body quickly. And they're coming and taking my blood every 30 minutes to check the insulin level and the reaction, the kind of insulin and everything. The doctor comes back and says, I've never seen you before. You've got the healthiest pancreas I've ever seen. And I was type 1 diabetic. My body, you know, usually the body will... the sugar level will soar up to 360 something, 324, that high, from as much as they're giving. And then, every half an hour, it will start lowering, and it stops about 104. Mine worked so hard to get rid of it, it went down to 52. So there's glucose, toxic glucose. They said they'd never seen a pancreas work that well. I said, well, that's kind of nice. Can we do some work outs? So they took me up to the floor where they have... you know, it's probably five times the size of this room. They've got a track to run around. You know, all this cardiac equipment, EKG stuff, you know, they wire you up. And, you know, you get to run. And, you know, they had me doing all kinds of weight stuff, weight pressing. And they put all these, you know, electrodes on me. And, you know, I hadn't exercised, you know, since 1979.

So here I am pushing these things and, you know, all these weights and doing the running. And I was doing better than people that worked out four and five times a week. My heart rate stayed lower. I was able to, you know, I knew the breathing thing. Don't breathe fast, breathe slow, no matter what. You breathe slow in and out while you're exercising. So everything was far beyond anything they expected. And, you know, I [unintelligible]. So I'm pushing, they're putting little bitty weights on me at a time because, you know, I'm worried about me pulling a muscle or, you know, straining a tendon or a ligament or something. So, you know, first they put me on the leg thing, you know, pump my back, you know, pressing weights. And, you know, they start off with 40. It went to 50 and then to 60, you know. Got up to 230 before I started straining. And he said, you know, as soon as he saw the slightest strain, stopped it. But I was still way ahead of anybody else. And these people have been exercising four or five days a week. So, he said, this is extraordinary. Absolutely extraordinary. And they published only the stuff about the fruitarians and nothing about me. But I have all the lab work. And the only thing that they didn't like was my cholesterol was off the chart. 267, something like that. I said, I want that cholesterol. I want as much as I can. I have a Hall of Fame basketball player that if his cholesterol doesn't stay at 675, he can't play. He's now in his 70s and he can outdo the young people on the court. And his cholesterol is still 670. Well, 550 to 670. And I had, when she was still a gymnast, an Olympic gymnast. She kept going into colds and flus every three to five weeks. She couldn't work out. She had to stop training for two weeks at a time. She'd have to start all over every time. So they're going to kick her off the team. And Paul Cohen, do you know who he is? Famous tennis player called Paul Cohen, back in the 50s, 40s and 50s. Famous tennis player and Olympic competitor. He became McEnroe's coach for 10 years. Taught him how to throw a racket, have a temper. That was Paul Cohen. Temperamental. I know that McEnroe got his temperament from him. And now Paul's on the diet. Been on the diet for almost 12 years now. He said, I've only known this diet when I was an athlete and when I was training people. He says, phenomenal. It's the best thing in the world. And he's a complete athlete again, and he's 74. And he's young and vital and strong. Phenomenal. And anyway, he told this coach, he said, you got to send that girl to Aajonus Vonderplanitz. We'll take care of her. So he put her on a raw diet, kept her cholesterol level at 325. She's got a couple of medals. Can't say who she is because I promised her that. So all these athletes and movie stars, they don't want to be known. The only one that will do it is Mel Gibson. He went on David Letterman and said, I eat raw meat. Eat all raw foods and raw meat. David Letterman says, you feed your kids that way? He says, you bet I do. He was the only one. Pardon? Mel Gibson said that.

Every tabloid went after him for a year, endangering his children and all this stuff. Because he fed them raw meat. No wonder nobody wants anybody to know that they eat raw meat for that kind of a slurred attack. But Mel Gibson could give a shit. He is so powerful and so rich he doesn't care. So, anyway, we're going to take a break after I finish the glands. So, that liver is very important to make bile, to create your different cholesterols, to do all those things that are necessary to help the body be healthy. We have a little gallbladder here, right above the liver. Now, the gallbladder doesn't produce anything. Doctors will tell you all kinds of stories, mythology about what the gallbladder does. The gallbladder is a pouch for bile. Why do we need a pouch for bile? Well, when we used to hunt, just like the gorillas, they'll go and eat an antelope and eat 14 to 28 pounds of meat in two days. Nobody tells us, everybody says the gorillas are vegetarians. Oh, yeah? Not if you were with, you know, John Goodall. John Goodell, who did the movie called The Beginning, won an Academy Award in 1971 or 72. And it was watching the birth of all animals all over the world. He lived with a gorilla and followed gorillas in Africa and found them eating meat, but they would consume massive amounts at a time, and they would need it. So if you're eating massive amounts of fat and you don't have bile to digest it, what's going to happen? You have diarrhea. So we've got a pouch for all this excess bile for when we used to, hunters and gatherers, need a tremendous amount of fat because all tribes eat the fat first because it goes off quickly. You preserve the meat for a long time. You pee on it to preserve it. You do all kinds of things to preserve it, but fat you cannot preserve until I met this one Thai girl who is Scott's girlfriend, who is Manisa's twin, and she taught me how to preserve fat. She had a whole cooler of it without cold packs in it with preserved fat. And the way she did it was, she took the fat of the animal, cleaned it with some coconut water, basted it in the sun for 20 minutes on both sides. And you put it out in the sun. And it makes like a plastic sealing on it. And we sat there, she had said something that was months old from ducks, from chickens, from all kinds of different animals. And we sat there for an hour eating this old fat that tasted almost as delicious as it was fresh. But for some reason, in the older days, you know, they didn't preserve the fat that way. They would consume a mass amount at one time and you had to have all that bio to digest it. If you ate ice cream, if you ate more than a cup of ice cream without a gallbladder, you'd likely have diarrhea because you can't digest it without that much bile. The liver can only manufacture so much bile in a 24-hour period. And that's about, you know, half a cup to three-quarters of a cup of fat a day. You go beyond that, you're going to have diarrhea. We have the pancreas. Very important gland, organ, it's both. Now, the pancreas has a simple job. You digest food, some of it gets transported to the pancreas. The pancreas decides how to realign the nutrients for each body. Very particular gland and organ, pancreas.

With the medical profession, all it does is handle sugar, insulin. Absolute malarkey. It handles the restructuring of nutrients for your particular system. And then when you're loading it with sugar, that's its job. It creates all this insulin. Insulin was a very minute, minute part of the pancreas when you're on a healthy system. Hardly any insulin necessary. When I was diabetic, I wasn't producing any insulin. And as long as I drank raw milk and was on raw food, I never had a problem until I went to whole fruit. Then when I ate whole fruit, I had diabetes. I was passing out. I'd stand up and black out and just hit the floor, you know. But I was a fruitarian. But I dealt with it. I learned that you can't move fast, you have to move slow. I'm not kidding. If I got up from lying down or sitting down, I moved like this. People thought I was doing yoga. That's cruel. But I was preventing myself from blacking out. And I blacked out as a fruitarian for about three years... I blacked out two or three times a day. If I ate a lot of fruit, like one time I ate a 27-pound watermelon and I looked pregnant. I didn't sleep that night. I was pissing every 10-20 minutes. And the next day I blacked out probably 10-15 times.

Q: Do you have [unintelligible]?

A: Oh, I did. Well, my bicycle spokes had broken and I was stuck in the swamps of Louisiana. And I took the back roads so I wouldn't be around a lot of traffic. So there's nobody on these roads. So I couldn't get help and I was stuck with no food anywhere. And I wasn't a meat-eater at that time. I might have eaten an alligator. But I wasn't. I was a fruitarian. So by the time eight hours, nine hours went by, a fruitarian can't go long without food. I saw this guy loading watermelons at dusk. And he was loading his watermelons along to his pickup. And I went over there and said, Can I help you load those for a watermelon? He said, Sure. So I had a 20-pound, 7-pound watermelon. I ate it in 40 minutes. I could do that. 40 minutes. And man, I blacked out 12-15 times the next day. Diabetic. Your pancreas is a marvelous instrument. And just like every other part of the body, it's going to function and do its job very well. And that is to realign food and enzymes to be produced and structured in a certain way. Then we have the spleen. Now, sometimes some people are finding, some scientists are finding immature blood cells in there. And they're saying, oh, the body's sending them to the spleen. And a lot of doctors believe that that's where the body sends red blood cells to mature. No. Normally, the red blood cells will mature where they are born in the bone marrow. It's just that the body gets so confused with all the toxicity now going into the bone marrow, because the brain's full, the other glands, the nervous system is full. Where's the other place where there's a lot of fat? Your bone marrow is 60% fat, like the brain and the nervous system. So the body starts shoving poisons into the bone marrow. It's got to throw some of the immature cells out. So it throws them in the bloodstream, and then the spleen pulls them out of the bloodstream. Because they're not going to do any work, they can't carry oxygen. They're immature. They don't work. So the spleen is a vessel to hold red blood cells, mainly for two reasons. One emergency reason, two other reasons. When your blood gets very thick, you get very hot. You get too hot, the spleen pulls red blood cells out, thins your blood, and cools it out. Get cold, the spleen will throw cups, a cup and a half of blood into your red bloodstream, and it gets thick and you stay warm, if you have the fats. For the red blood cells to use the oxygen on to utilize the fat. But it will still, even if you don't have that ability, you will still be warmer. And the other thing is, say you fell out of a tree or a palm, and cut yourself and you lost a cup of blood. The spleen holds, you know, two to three pints of blood, depending upon the size of the person. So, what would happen if you lost a cup, two cups of blood at one time? You'd be anemic. You could freeze overnight. You could be fodder for some cat, you know, some lying tiger, or some dinosaur. So, that is your reserve of red blood cells, so you're not anemic. It'll give you time to replace those red blood cells. The body is a miraculous thing. Now the kidneys, what are the kidneys for? For people who drink too much water.

The kidneys have one function. Keep you warm or cold. They pull, like the spleen. The spleen does it because we're not healthy, but the kidneys do it normally. They will regulate body temperature. You notice that when you get cold, you want to piss all the time? You want to get the liquid out of your blood, the water out of your blood, so you're not cold. All of a sudden when you get hot, you're not peeing as much because your body wants to hold the fluid like a radiator. Cool the body. Sweating is getting rid of poisons. That's a sign that you're poisonous. People who are not toxic do not perspire. These tribes do not perspire. Not one drop.

Q: Not even under strain, you know?

A: Not even under strain. Seeing them haul boats out of the ocean one after another in the heat of the day, haul huge... I mean, we're talking about swordfish that's this long, weighs a couple hundred pounds, 260 pounds, and, you know, 150 pound tuna. And they're just carrying these things for hours from the boats to the dock. Not a bit of sweat. Not a bit of sweat. Because they don't have the toxins, you're not getting rid of them. And they don't drink water. If they drink anything, they're drinking coconut water, and that's rare. One may take a sip of it in a day, pass around, you know, coconut, and the person has a sip, and that's it for the day. Remember, all of your food is water. Meat is 55% water. Milk is 86% water. Fruit is 90-92% water. You're getting all of this water ionically bound. Properly, all of your electrolytes. It's going to get into the cells properly. When you drink water, there's no ionic bond. I don't care if you're drinking Gatorade or what it is. All you're doing is throwing H2O that's nutrient-deficient into your cells. You're going to dehydrate them. Water dehydrates the system. You say, well, how can that be? Well, take a look at the Aborigines. 130, 120, 140 degree deserts. They don't drink water. They wouldn't dare drink water. Only the civilized ones drink water. But those that are out in the bush, living in the bush, they don't drink water. They take roots out of the ground. They grate them. They wring it. They drink a half a cup of vegetable juice a day. Or they'll break off a plant and let the vegetable juice drip into their mouth. That's all the water they need. Because they know if they have water, it's going to dehydrate them more. And then they're going to be dry. And then they're dead in the desert. These people live in the desert. They know you cannot drink water. Impossible. They survive. If you have a house, you can go into air conditioning or a fan. You can get out of the sun. Different. Because those aborigines who live in the sun all day long and weather at night, can't drink water. Can't do it. Water is a bad thing. What the kidneys do, the kidneys only filter out red blood cells. To get the red blood cells to separate from the blood serum, they manufacture an ammonia, an organic ammonia. Horses produce the most. They have a harder time, the horse has a harder time separating red blood cells from the blood serum. That's why the horse produces so much ammonia, so strong. Cows do too, but not quite as much as horses do. We produce quite a bit in our toxic reality. The tribes I noticed have a very low ammonia raw. Tribes have a much lower ammonia. So they can piss around in their homes and notice how it feeds, gives nitrogen to the plants and utilize it very well. So all of the nutrients that are in your blood are in urine, except for many red blood cells. Very few red blood cells get into the urine. So you can drink your urine if you eat a good diet and you're not detoxifying at a particular time.

And there's some people who have protein deficiencies, a lot of acne problems or joint problems, arthritis and rheumatism, who would be good to drink their urine once, twice a day, because you're not digesting the proteins properly. A lot of your vegetarians, communities like in India, drink their urine on a daily basis, all of it or most of it. Why? Because you can't get them to recycle their protein that way. So they can survive as vegetarians, not long-lived, but at least they can survive with pretty good strength and health without having much meat in
 their diet. The astronauts, what did they drink? Filtered urine. Every one of them. What did they drink? Filtered urine. Filtered through what? Who knows? They were probably drinking pure, just something to neutralize some of the ammonia, so the astronauts didn't have to taste it. Swaggart. Swaggart was the first flight. It was one of my relatives and my cousin in that flight. So I got that experience. My father was part of the jet engine, rocket division of General Electric, so I got privity to some of that stuff. So, they were drinking their urine. If you get a hankering, as they say in the South, to have some urine, drink it. Just don't drink your first in the morning. That's the one they'll tell you to drink. Everybody tells you to drink your first one in the morning. During the night, you detoxify your nervous system. Do not drink that first urine unless you're absolutely healthy. Then it would be a good one to drink. Drink the one that falls six to ten hours after a meat meal. And anyone after that. But not after a long sleep. You want to recycle those proteins. So you're going to get a lot more protein when the urine falls six, nine hours and more after a meal. Okay? All right, that takes care of all those body... Everybody knows about the muscles and the connect... Well, I didn't mean the connective tissue. You need to take a break. Some people do.

Q: I just need to stretch. I'm not tired. I just need to move.

A: Stretch, yeah. Need some vinegar.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, they can do that. I have people who will go in the back and just do yoga during the whole process. And then at the break they'll run around wherever it is. Really fast. Ten minutes.

[break]

A: Okay. We have connective tissue. We have muscles. We have bone. We have skin. We talked about the skin. Toxins pass through it. But I'm going to take a little time to talk about it. I want to do just a little at a time. When your lymph system dumps its toxins, its waste that it's neutralized and hopefully dissolved to a point that it'd be secreted through the skin, it dumps it underneath the skin in the connective tissue. It has to be perspired out of the body. If it doesn't get out of there, if you don't remove it, it could cause lupus or MS. Lupus is a dissolution of connective tissue. It dissolves and disintegrates. MS is where you harden. The area hardens. And the nerves die. And then it backs up. It keeps drying up all the way back up into the brain. And then you've got problems. So, a lot of people will say, brush the skin vigorously. If you've ever looked at skin brushed under a microscope, you see that you've absolutely abrased it. It's bleeding. It's seeping. Who the hell wants to do that to the skin? There's another way to do it. Get into a hot bath. A hot bath about 102 to 105 degrees. You stay in there for a while. If you've got municipal water, you need at least three things. You need vinegar, you need milk, and you need sea salt. And I give the ratios in the recipe book. But it's about two tablespoons of sea salt, about three to four tablespoons of raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar, and about a cup of milk, raw milk. It can be sour milk, fine, doesn't matter. Milk you don't want to drink, fine, doesn't matter. That will neutralize the toxins, the fluoride, the chlorine, all that stuff that's in the water. And then if you want to add something to nutrify the body a little bit, you can add an extra cup of milk, some coconut cream, two or three tablespoons of coconut cream, and that will nutrify the body while you're in there. Now, I use my fermented coconut as my soap. And I rub it, you know, slightly fermented, so it gets in there and takes it out. Now, I was with a tribe over there in the Philippines, and they took these soft rocks, smooth rocks out of the ocean, and they would brush themselves and get all the dead skin off, because they wouldn't bathe for weeks at a time. And, you know, I was doing some of their backs, and you'll see these, you know, round balls, little round, long things that look like scrolls, you know, that come off. That was their skin, and I'd rub their back. And they said, oh, we'll do it to you, so one guy's doing it to me. No dirt. No dirt. Because I put this coconut cream on, and I keep it from hardening and drying like that. And they don't necessarily do all that. So the coconut cream softens everything. And then I just use that before I get into the bath or before I rinse off in the shower. And I'll take a cotton cloth or a silk cloth. It doesn't take anything abrasive to do that. And you just don't have to do it. You can do it vigorously, but don't press hard. It's not necessary. Unless you like that feeling, that's fine. The cloth is not going to hurt you as a brush would. And let me tell you, I don't have a picture of it. I lost that particular file in a crash.

But if you saw a skin that was brushed, I mean, you can see the scratches. And then you've got oozing some yellow, some white, red, all that, all this. It's so microscopic, you can't see it, but it's there. There's one guy, he does it over there, he's bragging about it. He just brushed his skin over here. He's got good color. But if you look at it under the microscope, that good color is mostly scab. Ultrascopic scab, which is in that good color. And it's not really health. And he oils it. He oils the skin so you can't feel it. And he stays, you know, healthy and moist-looking. It's salt. It's salt. Geez, I'm starting to drip saliva from salt. Was it really salt in that cheese?

Q: Yeah.

A: Why did she have salted cheese?

Q: We got poisoned.

A: What?

Q: What did she salt with?

Q: I don't know.

A: Oh, really? From whom?

Q: I don't know.

Q: [unintelligible] currently is putting salt in their cheese? Starting in January, they're going to stop.

Q: What's this all about? What's wrong with it? I forgot.

A: Well, I'm going to get into that. So, the connective tissue needs to be cleaned. You need to get into a hot bath. Now, if your lymph glands are clogged, if you have a lymphatic rosary or a lymphatic ring in the iridology, that means your lymphatic system is very jammed with toxic vegetable oils, margarine, and stuff like that. Like I said, in an herbivore, their body temperature is 101-105 degrees. They keep that fluid. We have to heat our bodies up to that temperature to get it to fluid to perspire out of the body. So, you need to be, to get that lymphatic, that deep, that hot for a long time, you need to be in a tub that's at least 102-105 degrees for 50 minutes. Before it gets that deep. Now, imagine a cold stick of butter in the center of a jar, glass jar, and your outside heat being 105 degrees. How long does it take the heat to get in there to slightly melt the outside of that cold stick of butter that's still generating its coldness outwardly while the heat's working? So, it's just a fine layer that's going to get moved, melted. So, you stay in there an hour to an hour and a half. So, you can have 10 minutes of the dissolving or you can have 30 minutes, 30 or 40 minutes of dissolving if you stay in there an hour and a half to get that to melt. Then, the lymphatic system is going to dump it into the connective tissue. The next two days, you take shorter baths, 35, 40 minute hot baths, perspire that out of the system before you do another long lymphatic bath. Everybody I've ever seen has lymphatic congestion. It's just a product of our fast food. They're all using hydrogenated vegetable oils for everything. Everybody's eaten any kind of a potato chip, french fry, donut, pizza, anything. They've got those hardened fats in their lymphatic system and probably in their connective tissue. So, the thing is to try to do two lymphatic baths a week, never closer than three days apart, two days to three days of the short baths. Keep that detoxifying going. Now, when you take the long bath, you want something in the system that will start when the lymphatic system starts moving, it doesn't harden again when your body cools. So, what I figured and experimented with, if you have pineapple and coconut cream, a tiny bit of honey, a tiny bit of butter, or a tiny bit of dairy cream in there, whenever you have coconut cream, you have to have an animal fat. The animal fat will bind with the toxins and keep them from doing a lot of damaging things to the body as the coconut cream breaks down, dissolves things. So, it's just added protection. Most people, they don't need it, but why take a chance? Like, let's say you use 4 tablespoons of coconut cream with a half a cup of pineapple. Let's say you use 3 quarters to a tablespoon of dairy cream and a pea-sized amount of butter. No big deal. Blend that all together, whip the fats into like a whipped cream and have diced pineapple, whatever you want. Put it together, as soon as you get into the bath or right before you get into it.

When you get out of the long bath, you don't have to do it after the 35-40 minute bath, but the hour to an hour and a half bath, you get out of the bath very slowly, you keep the bathroom warm or wherever you are, and you sit and you dry yourself off. Of course, you're going to be hot and you're going to keep perspiring. When you feel like you've finished most of the perspiring, you put on, I don't care how hot it is, you put on winter clothes. Put on cotton long underwear to absorb more perspiration. Then you put clothes on over that and then you take a slow walk. 30-40 minutes, 45 minutes if you can. What that will do is that will start the circulatory systems moving faster. Remember, everything's thinner now, everything's hot. So things are going to move faster. You don't have to run, you don't have to jog, anything like that. Most of you are going to be so wasted that you're not going to want to run. You're just going to go, OK, I'll take a walk. And that's what it will be like. And that's fine, that's all we need. Just to make sure that by that time, that pineapple and that coconut cream is going to be already in the lymphatic fluid and moving through. So when your body cools, guess what? It's not going to harden. It won't harden.

Q: Isn't there an alternative to pineapple? Pineapple is a little acidic.

Q: You eat that or you put it in the bath?

A: You eat it. You eat that. You drink it or eat it. Right before the bath or as soon as you get in the bath.

Q: Is that in your book?

A: Yes, that's in the recipe book. Under Lymphatic Congestion. No, wait a minute. It's in We Want to Live. The new, the rewritten version, 2005 version, it's in that one. In the original We Want to Live, it's not there. 

Q: How do you tell it, the old one and the new one.

A: And it says on there, revised, rewritten, revised in 2005. That's 52 and a half more pages than the original version. And that has the lymphatic baths information. The first publishing does not. Okay, then. So, the first publishing, there were 11,000 copies. We sold that out 2005, I think it was. So then, earlier 2005. And then I did the rewrite. And then there was four or five months with no books. They were selling for $135 a copy. What scam is that? So then, you know, I put the revised version out. And there's been two printings of that since that one. I wish I were getting more of that money. I wish I was getting it all. So, anyway. That lymphatic baths information is who we want to live under Lymphatic congestion, lymphatic baths. And look under, you know, therapies, methodologies, and back near the end of the book, and we'll talk about how to do baths, what to put in them, like I already said, what to put in them.

Q: Yeah, that pineapple one, though, is that in there?

A: That's to drink.

Q: But that's not in there.

A: That's in that one. If you got the revised version, it is. Okay. So, cleaning out that lymphatic system and getting it flowing is very important to remedying a lot of diseases, especially skin diseases and rashes, getting those under control. And when you've got a rash, problems like that, you can rub cold tomato slices on or cucumber slices about every hour and that will calm those down until they ease. Coconut cream is also something you can use on in the night. You know, put it on and put some long johns over that, cotton long johns over that, so that you can conspire that stuff. Anytime you have a rash, those problems are moving through the skin and causing irritation to your skin, all skin layers. That's why it's bubbling up. Anytime you have any abrasion, anything coming out through the skin, it is a detox of something very toxic.

Q: Poison ivy?

A: Poison ivy is a detox of the oil from the leaf. The oil is very caustic. So when the body gets it on it, just, I mean, a few molecules can cause irritation. And you'll get a whole tiny, very thin drop of it at a time. And I mean, you're talking about a pin tip, not a pinhead, of oil. And your body will absorb that and then spread it through here and try to push it out through the skin all the way, and it'll keep moving it to push it out. It's not spreading in the way that some disease is growing in you. It's just thinning the oil out to be able to take it out through the skin so it doesn't damage one area. If it came out one area, your skin would just drop off. So the body tries to control it and move it to get it out, convert it, and get it out of the body. And old urine is the best way to break those things down. Like I said in the book. Old, stinky urine, you put that on, and it breaks those poison ivy, poison oak, poison sumac within 24 hours. 

Q: So what do you consider old?

A: If it stinks, it's old.

Q: Do you save urine or something for that? Like, is that what you're saying? To save your urine for those cases?

A: Well, I usually save my urine one a day just to watch the sediment and see what happens. Crystals are falling. Crystals form in a day, two days. If I'm throwing off a lot of heavy minerals. I just observe a lot of things just to see what's going on. I'm one of those scientific people. And then, you know, something happens. I got the urine right there because I live in a, you know, my backyard is covered with poison ivy. And the first year there, I was getting it, you know, every few days. So, I know that the Indians would eat the small leaves. So I said, okay, I'm going to do that for immunity. So I ate some small leaves. My neck went into a rash and got this big. My penis did the same thing. Literally, my penis got this big. And then all under here, the same thing. All over the lymph glands. So I'm walking around like this. You know, that was it. If I got it, you know, since then, that would be ten years in February since I did that. And when I've gotten poison oak only three times that time, it's been to a small area like that. And I put the urine on it. It works. But the Indians eat a little bit every year. I just ate it for a long time.

Q: It's not commercially viable, sorry.

A: Nope.

Q: Around here we get some mangoes.

A: Yeah?

Q: The same family. And like if I'm digging in the ground, the earth, around the mango tree, I get some of the roots. I get a little of it on my hand. And for a week I'll have it on my hand.

A: Oh, you just take your urine and coat your hands with it before you start digging. It actually feels good.

Q: It's almost erotic when I get it hot under the water.

A: Yeah, it is. [unintelligible] I never saw a penis that big. No, except on an elephant. It wasn't that long, but it was that long.

Q: Did you take a picture of it?

[laughter]

A: No. I tried. I couldn't get a good angle on it. I got the neck and this area and here. But I think I did get one. Let me look. OK, so detoxing out your skin is very important. Perspiring is very important. Another way you can perspire and get rid of a lot of that stuff. Remember, when you do this, you're going to have to have more liquid. More milk, more vegetable juice. Coconut water. Not just regular water. Tomatoes. Cucumbers are your best. Now, cucumbers don't have high carbohydrate, but they have a lot of collagen precursors. So they help you revitalize the skin.

Q: Use them internally or externally?

A: Internally. Drink it... But it's best not to juice too much of the cucumber. It's best to peel them and blend them with the vegetable juice. So you can get the collagen effect. Also, when you perspire, it will be more nutrient dense. So you won't have to lose quite as much fluid. You won't lose the nutrients. So, in the recipe book, when I give a formula for vegetable juice for detoxification, I've got very little cucumber in there, and it's always juice. After you've been on the diet for a year or two, you need to adjust that. You need less celery. You need cucumber puree rather than all that celery. So you can reduce the celery almost by 50%, sometimes 60%, 70%, depending upon the person. And if I'm doing a consult for you, I'll suggest the amounts for you. And I found that because we have so little fruit on the primal diet, usually one time a day, it's not enough collagen to restore the skin without heavy breakdown, because 90% of the poisons are leaving through the skin, breaking down the collagen in the skin. So I found some people, after they've been on the diet a while, their skin was breaking down and getting too dry. So then the cucumber is a fruit without being a high-carbohydrate fruit, and it is a great collagen precursor. That's why, you know, spas use it to put it on the skin, on the face, and stuff like that. Well, you just puree it. You don't juice it, you puree it with your other juices, and you drink that. And that cuts thirst down tremendously. I have tennis players, champion tennis players, doing a mix of one and a half, one to one and a half cups of tomato, two cups of the cucumber puree. Always peel your cucumbers, even if they say organic. Why? Because they can call them organic and put petroleum wax on them. Fifteen percent petroleum wax. 

Q: Does that go for other things, too? Other fruits, or tomatoes, or anything?

A: Well, that's the only one you puree. I mean tomatoes, but they don't wax tomatoes. Even if you grow your own, the cellulose in that skin, too much for us to digest, what you can do is peel it and run that, the peels through the juicer if you've grown them yourself, while you're juicing your parsley, your celery, and the carrot if you're juicing carrots. And that way you'll get some of those nutrients out of the peel of the cucumber, as long as you've grown it, you know.

Q: Why are we pureeing at all, as opposed to just juicing it?

A: Were you here?

Q: I was, but I still didn't get it.

A: The collagen precursors are in the pulp of the cucumber.

Q: Oh, if you want to be able to...

A: So you've got to have the pulp.

Q: The fiber.

A: Yeah, the fiber. But it's not a complex cellular. Like a vegetation, like a leaf stalk. It's a fruit. So you can break it down. Watermelon, you can do the same thing. Melons, you can do the same thing. However, there's a high sugar content in it. You're going to destabilize the mineral balance in your body. You're going to cause more thirst. You might have a sugar high and a sugar low. Cucumber, you don't have that.

Q: What about the rind of the melon?

A: Rind of the melon, if you want to be horny all the time. Rind of a watermelon is a natural viagra. It contains citrulline. So if you eat the rind, that's all I eat. The rind and about that much of the pink. And I core it out and throw the rest away. And let me tell you, I'm hard all night long if I do that. 

Q: It [unintelligible].

A: Yes it does, definitely does. You'll notice the rind tastes just like cucumber. Almost identical. But it has the added citrulline. So if I want a good night's sleep and not have all kinds of wet dreams, then I don't eat the watermelon. I eat the cucumber. But sometimes that's my exercise. Sex in my dreams. I dream of exercise. Then... So that pretty much... You know, juice, when you have parsley, it's full of vitamin E, it's full of chlorophyll, it helps alkalinize the blood. It's the main purpose of parsley. And when you detox, and when you're on a good diet, the body's going to detox just as much when you're not on a good diet, but you're probably going to do it a little bit more thoroughly. And your blood's going to have a tendency to get acidic. So your green juices are very necessary to balance that. One, two, three, four cups a day, depending upon your needs. If you're a irritable person, don't eat much red meat, and drink more juice. Eat more cucumbers. Celery is a very good substance to use for a couple of years on the diet. Could be two to six years, but you may need a lot of celery. Celery's a concentrated sodium. People have so much salt stored in their system, it helps remove it. Still leave enough sodium in there to keep your own electrolyte balance of the sodium. Sodium, in its food form, is the smallest molecular mineral we have. But in salt form, it's one of the largest, because it clumps together. When you eat salt, I don't care if it's Celtic salt, salt from the Dead Sea, I don't care where it's from. It's concentrated sodium that is not ionically bound. So what happens then, you have these large clumpings of sodium that get into the blood, and the way your body eats is that a cell, with one or two ions inside of it, it opens, it attracts ion bonds that carry nutrients in it, and it eats. Now normally a cell, if the body's healthy, eating the proper diet, raw diet, for that particular system, you will have 93 to 117 nutrients. That's a great smorgasbord, isn't it? I mean, 93 to 117 nutrients, all bound together perfectly, in a perfect form for your cells to eat, with one swallow. Pretty amazing. When you have salt in the system, you have these big clumps of sodium that cause a fractionation of these smorgasbords. So when a cell goes to open up to eat, you may be getting a fraction of the nutrients it normally is supposed to. You will not get a balanced, complete diet. Sometimes the sodium molecules are so big that when the cell goes to open up, and you've got these clumps here, it's too big to get into the cell. So what happens is, the magnetism is so great from this large sodium and cluster of other nutrients that is collected on its way, pulling the ions out of the stomach of the cell, rips the ions out of the stomach of the cell. The cell can never eat again. The cell will shrivel like a raisin, like a grape to a raisin, and die. Two little bitty grains of salt will kill two million red blood cells in that way, and starve ten million others of a complete diet. Salt is one of the most dangerous, toxic things in the world. And the British government started it. 

It went to India, and it found Indians living on the sea making their salt and using it. They said, oh, we can make a lot of money with this. So they outlawed India from making their own salt. People were not allowed to make their own salt. It's like in Colombia, they tried to say, nobody can collect rainwater. You have to pay for your rainwater. People own it. And the people rebelled a year ago, and that went through the government. And that was Pepsi Cola and Coca-Cola who were down there and did that. They made a deal with the government. They owned all water rights, including rain. Well, that government was ousted pretty quickly. Violently. So that's when the Queen and Queen of England, the hierarchy there, went to India and had this big salt thing and started distributing it all over the world. China didn't even make salt in that way. And we started shipping it over there. Got everybody into salt. Very few communities ever used salt. A few communities sometimes use it, but not very often. Now everybody uses it. It's on every table. Now they put sodium chloride in it, or iodine. All kinds of toxins. Potassium chloride. Saltpeter. You know, damage your sexual prowess by eating that stuff. That's what a lot of water softeners are. Potassium chloride. Sort of making all these different salts, not just sodium salts, to cause distractions in the body. Water does the same thing to salt. It dissolutes and fractionates it. When you look in an archaeological book under solvents, what's the first one that shows up? Water. When it rains, it dissolves rock. Plants eat it. What happens when it goes in the body? It dissolves and neutralizes and thins digestive acid. Digestive juices. It destroys bacteria. It actually drowns them. It interferes with the villi. It thins the mucus. All kinds of... and it leaches. Water is a solvent. Use it as a solvent. A little bit. Half a cup a day. No more than a cup and a half a day. No more than a tablespoon at a time. You sip it. Even milk. You don't see me chugging milk. You see me sucking milk. People say to me, What do you do with your throat like that? I say, because when a baby is sucking, suckling, all these enzymes are going in with the milk. Whatever you eat or drink. No matter what I drink, even if it's water. I get lots of bacteria in it. And I haven't had water. I had coconut water two days ago. I haven't had coconut water in two days. But I'll suck it in like that. I found that I used to drink three quarts of milk a day in the heat. Now I'm lucky if I drink one and a quarter a day. Why? Because I suck it in, I digest everything better. When I used to drink water, I'd drink two gallons of water a day. I'd be pissing all day. Now, I piss maybe three times a day and not much. I maybe urinate three cups in a day. Three and a half cups at most. But I'm not consuming that much. So I'm keeping it at this constant rate of going down. Plus I'm healthier than a lot of people. Even though I may not look it, inside I am.

After that 14 years, most all the toxins pass through my skin and they leave all kinds of bumps and abrasions that I have to deal with. That's what most people do. It may take your skin a few years to heal from as dry as you've got. If you put coconut cream on it every day, you will help facilitate that. Coconut cream is your best body moisturizer. 

Q: How do you recommend doing the coconut cream? Are you going to go into that?

A: No it's in the books. Both books.

Q: Well, I get overwhelmed by it. Because you've got to get this coconut, you have to chop it. [unintelligible], it's up to 118. You would recommend against that brand.

A: There's no raw coconut cream.

Q: I did talk to them and they said they do it less than 118.

A: It's got to be down to 96 degrees.

Q: So less milk better, more milk better?

A: Pardon?

Q: I wanted to go back just for a second to the milk thing. You said you were drinking less milk. What's the reason for that?

A: I'm just digesting it better. So I don't urinate as much, I don't pass as much fluid. I'm conserving the body's energy better. Probably if I were a sports person that would give me more energy for that. But I'm only sleeping like four and a half hours a day and I'm completely focused and knowing. And usually at these I'll have eggs and if I lose a word I'll pop an egg right away. What's in the moisture here with the milk I usually don't need an egg. If I'm in a dry desert place an egg will bring my mind back quicker than a milk will.

Q: We're going to have questions later.

A: Yeah, we're going to have a Q&A later. So water you want to keep minimal and specifically in small amounts at a time. And everybody does need some solvent. Water. You make sure it's good water. Not water in plastic because you can better believe that when they make the plastic bottles they have the molds in them that have a solvent and a powder. It keeps it from sticking to the machine. So it's constantly lubricating the machine and the plastic is formed and a lot of that gets inside the bottle. So what happens is when you put your food in there when they put water in it you're getting some of that in there. You're getting some plastic in there. You're getting some petroleum lubrication for the machine. You're getting some of the powder. If people were to, if companies were to take all of their bottles, the plastic bottles and clean them first you wouldn't be getting that. But if you're getting your milk in plastic like Mark McAfee with his organic pastures, well that plastic doesn't get it. We haven't tested it yet, Mark to make sure it's not getting in there. You're not going to be harmed by it because you're going, your potassium calcium, magnesium and phosphorus are going to bind with it.  But you're losing some calcium, phosphorus, magnesium and potassium out of the milk. So, it's better not to have plastic. Don't keep anything in a plastic container and don't freeze anything in plastic. People who make ice cubes in plastic get BPAs in it. People who heat things in plastic get BPAs in there whenever they're freezing. So, never freeze anything in plastic. If you want ice cubes, you get some Pyrex glass that won't break easily. You put some water in there, take it out and put some, you know, lukewarm water, let the whole section, and you break it up and there's your ice cube. And you can go online in a lot of places. Even... Rockford, New York, what's that clinic there? Famous clinic. They even put up on their website...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Do not heat or freeze anything in plastic. Because the BPAs will release... Who?

Q: Mayo Clinic.

A: Mayo Clinic. Rochester, New York. I mean, Rochester, Minnesota. Rochester, Minnesota. So... Minimal with water, salt, none.
Absolutely none, unless you can't get off the floor. Can't get off the floor, you've got what is called complete system breakdown. And salt will help boost a little bit. It's a punch way to do it. I call it adrenal fatigue because that's what other people call it. Adrenal exhaustion. Not only adrenal exhaustion. Like I say, your adrenals shouldn't be pumping anything unless it's fight or flight. But some people live on pumping their adrenals and run on adrenaline. Steroids pump adrenaline into the system fast. Testosterone, estrogen, all of that. All of those steroids will pump energy into a person. But that's a drug. So, salt in that situation, I say in my book, three to four grains a week only. But nobody, everybody here seems to be able to get off the floor. So, there's no problem here. You look like you might have to cry.

Q: I'm fine.

A: That's just because you're relaxed.

Q: I'm relaxed.

A: Yeah.

Q: What about seawater?

A: Like I say, any water. It doesn't matter what it is.

Q: Seawater has a flavor.

A: Yeah, it's got concentrated salt. What happens when you drink, what happens when people drink seawater? They go into stomach cramps, they go into charley horse, and they vomit and die. That's what happens when people drink seawater.

Q: What about swimming in it? Do you absorb it?

A: If you're eating a lot of fish or coconut oil, you won't. If your skin's very dry, you will. And it'll make your skin drier. You know that sting, that burn? That's the salt drying cells out and drying them so bad that they, you know, nerve cells, that they hurt. It feels like you're almost getting bit. Starting to burn, crack. So there, you don't have enough. So if you have that problem, you put some coconut oil on before you go into the ocean. And coconut oil will harden at ocean temperature. Confirm and protect you. That's another great thing about coconut oil. Because I can go out and spear fish all day long. And as long as the water didn't get up to 75 degrees, you know, and it stayed around 70 degrees, the coconut oil would stay as a barrier.

Q: The coconut oil you can buy in a jar and that's okay? Unlike the coconut cream?

A: There's only one coconut oil that I've convinced somebody to make under 96 degrees. And that's the Philippine fermented coconut oil that Wilderness Family Naturals makes. Now I've got another oil that's made in Koh Samui by Menezes. By Menezes Connection in Thailand. But it's almost twice as expensive. So the one from Wilderness Family Naturals is the Philippine fermented. They have several of them. It's the Philippine fermented is the one they agreed to. It took me six months to talk to them to lower it from 103 degrees down to 96. So that's a good oil. And you can use that. Now for massage it isn't good because again you choke off the oxygen absorption into your cells and skin. So it's better to use coconut cream. Coconut cream has your water-soluble fats and enzymes and vitamins. Not only your oil. And in coconut cream in all foods you've got a low oil level. 6-12% maximum of oil. Water-soluble fats could be 30% of the food. And in coconut it's almost 40%. No, it's 45%. 45% of your water-soluble fats. Most people don't know that there's water-soluble fats because nobody talks about it. But they are very important. The reason they talk about the oils is because they can separate them and say vitamin F. Important fatty acids. You buy this, you'll be better health. You'll be better health. Yeah, one part of, you know, 6% of your body, 8% of your body. What about the water-soluble fats. You can get them in meat. Coconut cream is the best place to get it. When I get a massage, what do I get a massage with? Coconut cream. If I want it to be cleansing and get in there and help break down toxins under my skin, I use the fermented. When I want to feed and nutrify my skin, I use fresh coconut cream. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You can use it a little bit, maybe a tablespoon a day.

Q: So can you say there's coconut oil, which is the wilderness, there's coconut cream that's fresh that you juice yourself, that's what you could use. Then there's coconut cream that you can buy and then apply to your skin, or you can make it.

A: Make it, that's the only way to do it.

Q: Always make coconut cream.

A: You know, unless you know, I hauled some machines over, imported three sets of machines from Thailand. Shell the coconut, grate the coconut, juice the coconut, grate it. There's a set of machines, and that can produce probably five gallons a minute. It's only $12,000. In Hawaii it was a little bit more, to get to Honolulu for some reason. $600 more to send it to Hawaii than it would to San Pedro, California. I don't know how it would work. Nobody's doing it here on the islands. A market, Maui is going to do it, or he hasn't yet. But I went to Hobart, which is an industrial kitchen or industrial food machine manufacturing, and just to have the juicer made. The juicer I had made was all stainless steel. There they do other kinds of steel. For me to have them made in stainless steel, it cost one third more. However, the juicer, it looks like a champion juicer, was this long and this high. So the whole area that churns and pushes it through, you've got a screen this big, folded over together. And the cream comes out here, the pulp out here, down here. And Hobart wanted $55,000 to make that machine. I get all three machines imported for $12,000. Incredible. So we've got a place in Chicago, and in Phoenix, and in Los Angeles, that makes it, ships it all over the people all over the United States. But it's like $12 to $20 a pint. But it, you know, it says how to do it in the book. You crack the shell all around, and you pry out the coconut meat. You don't have to peel it, unless you're going to make, you know, you want a real white cake with a pulp for your kids or birthday or something. You don't peel that brown kernel on there. You just grind it in a food processor to a grated state, and then you put it in a jar, and you put some coconut water in there and get it wet just a little bit, and then you let it sit in a sink of hot water, not hot enough to burn your hand, but hot, and let it sit in there for about 10 minutes. Make sure your room is 80 degrees. That sentence was left out of both books. You've got to let the room heat up to 80 degrees. Once it hits 78 degrees, the water-soluble and the oil-soluble fats will free up from the cellulose. So let's say you're juicing at 70 degrees early in the morning here. You juice your coconut pulp. You're only going to get maybe six ounces, maybe five ounces out of each coconut, cream. If you get it up to 80 degrees, you're going to get nine, ten ounces out of one coconut. Big difference. Huge difference. So all the places that are making it in America, the three places where it's made, now I imported the machines with very little, you know, I didn't take much at all. I didn't even barely pay for my telephone calls and all the time it took me to establish a relationship with the company. So I really, it's about people getting what they need because I'm not out to make money on these machines. So that's why it's still such a low price. I can charge you 30,000 bucks and take, you know, 28, you know, take 22,000 bucks and make a good profit, but I'm not. I'm taking about 600, 700 dollars per three setup. And that's it. And that barely pays for everything because I have to send money over there to them because I have an account there. So that costs me money. It's a lot of work. But for me, it's worth it for you to get coconut cream because coconut cream is one of the most important foods that you can have to detox slowly and well and protectively. 

Q: How long does it last for?

A: It depends on if you used any kind of fermented or slightly off coconut. It could go in hours or it could take a week.

Q: And that's in the refrigerator?

A: Yeah, it's in the refrigerator.

Q: Can you submerge the meat in 80 degree water if you're living in a cold climate?

A: I take my meat and put it in my hot car. It can be 100 degrees in the car. And by the time it gets to the smaller cooler that I have here with no cooling at all, in the jar, it stays hot, probably gets up to about 86, 87 degrees for hours. And I get to enjoy that and taste. I do that with cheese sometimes too. So yeah, you can put it in a jar, immerse it in hot water. I try to conserve energy, so I put it in my car. So I'm not using hot water. Electricity or gas to heat down up water. I try to use as much natural as possible. Yeah, I like to heat my meat. I like to heat my cheese.

Q: If you eat fresh coconut, then you just bash it open and it's warm out.

A: Too much cellulose.

Q: But you spit the [unintelligible].

A: Yeah, you can do that, absolutely. Absolutely. It's a lot of work, but good for the teeth.

Q: What's all the cellulose?

A: Pardon?

Q: What's all the cellulose?

A: You don't have the enzymes to break it down. Give it to a cow or a horse or a pig.

Q: It's a bad idea to swallow.

Q: Don't those tribes you visited eat coconuts, though? I mean, they don't juice it, right? Or what do they do with it?

A: They spit out a lot of pulp.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah.

Q: What about young coconuts with the softer meat? I mean, it's still got...

A: They eat that, but it's not as nutrifying, so they don't do it. They'll give it to the infants if they have a digestive problem. But it's usually not in their tribe. It's usually when they're traveling around, and they meet other tribes who are cooking their foods, and they'll give it as a medicine to babies. Even the elderly people who have stomach problems, digestive problems, they'll give them the young coconut. But they don't eat young coconut. Only mature coconut. When you're stable, you don't need all that stuff. And your digestion's good. But all of us could use some of that, you know, to help with enzyme activity, digestion. Okay, so coconut cream is a very incredible product, and definitely we should use it. And if somebody wants those machines, just let me know. Two couples who got them in America, and James Stewart, they paid them off in a year, by the amount of orders that they got. So it was that quick. You can pay your business off in a year. Pretty incredible. The sheller, it's got a wheel with a bunch of jagged teeth on it, and a pin that comes out. So at the eye, there's three eyes of the coconut. There's a little lip there, and you put that under the ring, and it goes like that. The Thais and the Filipinos have used that to do it. They can shell a coconut in three seconds. It takes me 10 to 15 seconds to shell a coconut. That's pretty fast. But what you have is you have a whole coconut with the water inside, complete and intact. You go over and snap it, let the water drop. Take it over to a grinder. It's about this big, and you put the halves through. You got it all around, and you take it over to the big juicer. It looks like a champion juicer stainless steel. You pour that into there, and it goes down into it quickly. Hour for five gallons. Incredible stuff.

Q: You also source the coconuts for those people?

A: Pardon?

Q: You also source the coconuts for those people?

A: They go to a source from Costa Rica. Costa Rica has a good source. Have you ever driven to Costa Rica? Hundreds of miles of coconuts. Forever. I mean, I rented an SUV, went to the northern end of the volcano, and came down all along the Pacific coast. And 70% of that entire coast were coconut orchards. And then I came to the mountains back, all the way back to Costa Rica. And it was July, freezing cold. The clouds were just sitting in the mountains. It was very cold. And down there you've got tropics. I said, wow, because the mountains are so high. Anyway, lots of coconuts there. Probably, you know, a source of extra is, because everybody, when you get a good supply of something, you keep raising the price of it. So it looks like you're going to go to Nicaragua and get some of those coconut. But there are many sources. I just have to go to a supply. And find something to go around. James sent a girl over to Thailand. Sourced a lot. The Thais were slow. Like Hawaiians, everything was 20, 30 minutes later. But here it's two weeks, two months, five months. And he happens to... They're not a good place to be reliable. You know, unreliable. Costa Rica is almost completely Americanized. It's more of a process. Everybody's more interested in money than sitting around fishing. And so... And the fishermen, you know, is out there fishing, fishing, fishing. And the businessman says, man, we catch a lot of fish. Get a few boats. You need to make a lot of money with that fish. And he said, and then you could, you know, get a fleet of boats and then have a big factory and you make a lot of money. He says, what do I do with the money? He says, you can go fishing. Take a look at that place. That's exactly what's happening. Everybody's going out to make a lot of money for free time. What does it take to have free time? Good food and health. Sit around and have a good time. But that's what the American government and the world governments don't want you to do. That's why they annihilated every tribe because that's all they cared about was food and enjoying themselves and having fun. And you can't have slave labor if they're healthy and relaxed and not working. So that's why there is that conspiracy to keep you unhealthy. Healthy people, what do you want to work for? You're already good, you're already happy. That's not going to work. So, okay. That pretty much carries the body. Also, you'll dump a lot of toxins out of your nails. So at times your nails are going to get dry and ridged. They'll get gaps in them when you have chemicals coming out. The body tries to get rid of the worst stuff in the follicles, build it into the hair, into the nails.

So you're going to do it sometimes. I went through a two-year period where this nail caved in and it stayed that way and it was finally finished dumping. Another six months and you won't even be able to tell I was dumping anything out of that nail. But look at these nails. 63 years old, those are pretty nice nails.

Q: I noticed that.

A: Pardon me? Yeah. Most people's feet are mangled and knuckled and, you know, my age. Don't have a problem. Okay, let's get into food. So don't ever be afraid of your body. Something comes out of your body, say, what should I put on that? Coconut cream, I can put lime juice, I can put tomato, I can put any food on it. Any food. Urine. Anything you put on a wound. Do not go for a medication. Do not go for a lotion. Sunscreen. What's your best sunscreen? Coconut cream. If you want a tanning lotion, you put coconut oil on it. The only problem that I have with coconut cream, I use so much of it, I stay whiter than I want to. I need to get more sun, because it makes the skin white. It breaks down the vitamin D, so you can absorb it faster. But that's good, because if I'm able to get out in the sun more, then I can get more vitamin D into my body, and get healthier and stronger quicker. Also, the stiffness. It comes about from lactic acid and uric acids forming in the body. So if you're an athlete, you have a tendency to collect, to help break those down and mitigate it. I was giving that formula, and somebody interrupted me. I said, one to one and a half cups of tomato. Two, two and a half cups of cucumber puree. That's tomato puree, cucumber puree. Peel the cucumbers before you puree. You have one tablespoon of vinegar, raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar. Two to four tablespoons of honey. And two to four tablespoons of coconut cream. And one to two tablespoons of dairy cream. And maybe three tablespoons of lemon juice. You've got a great sport drink there to sip on all day. And that sport drink takes two of my champion tennis players through five hours of play. One quart of it. And you see those other tennis players, they're going through a gallon, a gallon and a half of water in five hours.

Q: This is in the book.

A: Pardon?

Q: It's in the book.

A: No. That one's more tomatoes. That one's a lot more tomatoes.

Q: Can we turn this light on again?

A: How did it go off?

Q: It's on timeout.

Q: Can you say that one more time?

A: Yeah. Okay, so you have one to one and a half cups of tomato puree. Two to two and a half cups of cucumber puree, peeled cucumbers. One tablespoon of vinegar. If you're playing tennis, you might even need one and a half, two. Oh, I have to talk about Kieba. I've seen people do the butterfly. The guy who won the Olympics, what was his name?

Q: Michael Phelps.

A: Michael Phelps. I just saw him in Osaka, Japan, on my way here. And he even got the water too high. Kieba cuts it right at the water level. Right at the water level. It's phenomenal. I've never seen anybody cut it that cleanly before. And she's only been doing the butterfly for...

Q: I just taught myself after watching the Olympics.

A: And you've been doing it for two months, three months?

Q: Since August.

A: Since August.

Q: Actually, freestyle is the hardest one to learn. That's the one most people try.

A: But, I mean, that butterfly. Seeing her do it. It's so smooth. So efficient. Anyway, so you have... Two to three tablespoons of lemon juice. Two to four tablespoons of honey. You have a sugar reaction. Keep it to the lower. One to two tablespoons of honey. Two to four tablespoons of coconut cream. And one to three tablespoons of dairy cream. And you blend that all together. And you sip on it. Tablespoon at a time, all day long. And that's your hydrator. Along with milk. Sip of milk. Sip of that. Sip of milk. Sip of that. You're going to have more fluids than you need. Even if you're perspiring a lot. Yes.

Q: What you also do, is you vegetable juice?

A: Yeah. That's to alkalinize the blood. But you'll do yet less of that then. If you do that. If you do a quart of that, you're going to do less vegetable juice. You may only do one vegetable juice a day if you do that. Or you may make half that amount. Proportionally, half that amount. That may be all you need when you do two to three vegetable juices a day. Depends on your activity level. Okay, food. Now, talk about fat being the most important nutrient in the body, because we're in such a toxic world. It binds with toxins. It breaks down toxins. The body makes them into a solvent. The body uses it as energy. Now, materially, each fat will do a different thing. Now, we have meat fat. It's utilized in the body very well for detoxification. Also for strengthening muscles. Any kind of meat fat. Now, they say, oh, eat chicken. There's not as much fat in it. There's more fat in chicken than there is in beef. It's just not marbled. It's penetrated throughout. It's homogenized. In birds and in fish, fat is homogenized evenly throughout the body. There are very few pockets of fat in birds and in fish. Right around the rump in chickens and birds, you'll get a pouch of it. My love, that's my favorite. Those pouches of fat. But mostly the fat is all dispersed evenly throughout the muscles everywhere. So it's a little better for the skin for the digestive tract. That's why I suggest more white meat. Again, white is a category, not a color. So the fish and the poultry are better for the intestines and smoothing the skin. Red meats are better for the liver, the gallbladder, pancreas, spleen, muscles, and red blood cells. The fats in pressed oils, 90% solvent reactive. That means that they will clean your body fast, intensely. So don't have too much of that. Maybe four ounces a week, four tablespoons a week. If you're an athlete, one tablespoon a day.

Q: You're talking about olive oil?

A: I'm talking about olive oil, I'm talking about flax oil, I'm talking about coconut oil.

Q: Flax oil is a seed, right?

A: Yeah, flax is a seed, but because it's anti-carcinogenic, you can get by with a tablespoon a day. It's only anti-carcinogenic because flax oil can help you dissolve dead cells. Remember, oils are very caustic. Your animal fats, whether it's from dairy or from meat, are 50% first and foremost, minimum 50% soothing, calming, relaxing, restructuring. Relaxing, restructuring, building. Crest oils are not, 90% toxic, I mean caustic, cleansing. Now, your dairy cream is the hardest to digest. Takes a lot of bile, but it's the only fat that will feed the nervous system completely. So when you drink your milk, pardon?

Q: Even sour?

A: No, it's better that way. Yeah, definitely sour cream digests much, much better. It's pretty easy to digest sour cream. But fresh cream, the way most people have it, and in milk, it's very difficult to digest for the liver. So you do not want to drink fresh cream when you're having meat. If you see your chunks of meat pass through in your feces pearlized, or your feces pearlized, you're not digesting that cream. You need to eat it at a different time, in a different way. Sour, or cut it down the amount that you're eating. Reduce the amount that you're eating.

Q: What does pearlized mean?

A: You know when a pearlized finish sparkles a little bit?

Q: Little balls or something?

A: No, no, no. It just has a coating on it. It's kind of pearlized. Sparkly. Shiny. Not real shiny. Sparkly. And then you know you're not digesting that cream properly. You don't have the right kind of bile. Something's wrong. You're eating at the wrong time. You're eating too much at a time. And you need to change that. Not a cream. But let me tell you, if you're nervous and out of sorts, you drink a half a cup of that, it's all going to be utilized very well. Calm your system very rapidly. Also something that will help deal with anxiety is the nut butter. Nut butter is in the recipe book. And it's taking nuts like soft nuts. You don't digest hard nuts. Very difficult to digest hard nuts for most of us. So you have to eat walnuts, pecans, pine nuts. If you have low energy levels, don't eat pine nuts. Because that lowers some hormone production. But mainly you can use walnuts once in a while. It's pretty soft nut. Walnuts, pecans are your best. Blend them until they are a flour. Add egg, a little bit of honey, butter, coconut cream. Some kind of fat. Butter is always best for most people. Some people a little bit better with a mix of butter and coconut cream.

Q: How about macadamia?

A: Macadamia is very difficult to digest. It's hard to find them kiln-dried in less than 96 degrees. Most of you have been in the hundreds and fives.

Q: So it's pretty hard to dry them yourself?

A: Pardon?

Q: They're all over here?

A: You have to find somebody that has them in the shell and do it yourself. And it's not kiln-drying them.

Q: David Wolfe claims to have them from Indonesia where they're mechanically shelled.

A: Yeah, but they dry them before they mechanical shell first. So the shell splits and cracks easily. David Wolfe doesn't know what he's talking about. If he'd go to these places and see the process, he would change his mind. But he believes what they tell him.

Q: OK, so cashews are [unintelligible].

A: Cashews have to be laser-blasted.

Q: How come?

A: They shoot a radiation blast into the air and cause an explosion of it. It's the hardest, thickest nut in the world. The machines that it would tear up mechanically. That's why they stopped doing it that way and they used the laser to do it. He claims, I don't believe it, because I've seen the machines torn up. He could be right, but I'd have to see it to believe it. He won't give me that information. They caught him on two or three other things. He was not truthful. Only because he didn't search it out the way I did. He was too trusting. Because he wants to believe, he wants that. He's malnourished. He needs superfoods because he does not eat good food. Proper foods for his body. But you see him, he's not looking well. He doesn't have that spring, bright, good color look that he had years ago. Pardon?

Q: It's the first time I've seen him not look good.

A: Yeah, well I told him, I told him nine years ago when he, well it was about eight and a half years ago, down in San Diego I said, David, you're gung ho on this stuff. But I'm telling you, I've been there and most people have been there. I've only seen eight people able to live on a fruitarian, vegetarian diet, healthfully. And seven of them were males and all those females. You're going to hit the wall in about seven years. Seven years to eight years to hit it. Got a report back in January or February, it was February, that he was already eating raw dairy, raw cheese. Good thing. But he doesn't tell people. He keeps selling his superfoods. And there may be another cause there. He may have been threatened by the cartels. Food cartels. They threatened me this week at the Raw Games. I come up and said, I'm a member of the food cartel here. You sell these superfoods, you're in the family. Otherwise, we're going to take your money. That happened to me once before eight years ago. I got threatened the same way. David Wolfe may have accepted the threat. That's why he's into superfoods. I don't know. But because they said, David Wolfe belongs to us. You give in to it, too, and you'll be okay. Otherwise, money might disappear.

Q: Who's this food cartel?

A: Food cartels are the families that own most of the food companies all over the world. The major food companies. The king and queen of England are the biggest food manufacturers. They own most of the food manufacturers throughout the world. And yet, they have raw milk. The princes and the princesses, they only drink raw milk. They don't drink pasteurized milk. See, they know what the good food is, but they're not going to let everybody else. Okay, let's get on with this. I'm getting way behind. So, we have proteins. Now, when I was eating proteins before as a vegetarian, nuts, grains sprouted, germinated. I was skinny, unable to digest them. I wasn't supposed to be able to eat meat because I had my hydrochloric acid interfered with. I was not supposed to survive on meat. It was supposed to kill me within 24, 30 years. So, none of that was true, all that was myth. But I found in my animal experiences that animals who eat raw meat keep the level of growth hormones up the same as when they were children. Except that the cells have a great deal of their own growth hormones within them. When you eat cooked meat and other things, it deprives that of the body. Deprives those growth hormones. So most people lower their growth hormones at 21 years old and start downhill. My growth hormone factor was right up there with a teenager. I'm 62 years old, almost 62 years old. Almost finished with my 62nd year. You don't get awarded that year until you finish it. So I'm in my 62nd year and I'll be 62 in a year. So I still have the growth hormones. In the animal experience I found the same thing. But with nuts and seeds and grains, you don't have that. The ability to split cells as quickly as a growing child. And remember, we are producing as many cells as a child does, because that many cells die in a day. So we have to maintain this whole stature. They're growing into it for 21 years. We have to maintain it on a daily level. And the only way I've been able to keep that level is with raw meats. Not nuts, not grains, not beans, any of that. And beans are poisonous for all humans. Except for mung beans, those mung beans sprouted. All the other beans are poisons. If you ate a germinated bean without it being cooked, you would go into intense diarrhea and vomit, headaches, that could kill you. Within three days. I know, I did it. And I nearly died in 1974. And I thought I was going to fucking die. I had pinto beans that I germinated. And I ate them, and man, I was so sick. I was going to diarrhea every hour. Every hour. Headaches were splitting. And I had cramps, you wouldn't believe. I thought I was going to die. So they told me two days about the rabbit, and then I thought, I can handle that. But I got through the bean thing. I can handle this rabbit thing. But the rabbit made me feel good in my intestines and everywhere else. So beans are not an avenue for us. Raw meats are. And I mentioned that a lot of people say, well, should I eat white meat? Should I eat fish, should I eat chicken, should I eat beef? It's up to you.

In the book I say if you're a high, you know, if you hold your tan well, eat more of the white category meat. Fish and chicken, or fowl, seafood. If you're more white and you have a tendency toward anemia, you need more red meat. But always eat both. I always find that people who eat strictly red meat do not fare as well unless they're athletes. The American Indians almost live exclusively on red meat, but they were a nomadic tribe and they were very athletic, extremely athletic. And the women, they didn't eat as much meat as the men. They ate probably half of what the men ate. You know, the hunters and gatherers. Because the women were around [unintelligible] and stuff like that. Unless they had retort, then they would eat more. But you've got to find your balance between red and white. Don't eat just one. Milk is a good offset. People who have milk don't have to worry about over-eating red meat as much. But if you don't have milk, there are times when you won't have milk, maybe. Then you have to be very careful with your red and white meat intake. So you'll feel a good balance. A lot of people who eat an excess amount of red meat have a tendency to get irritable. Because it stimulates the adrenal glands. Remember, adrenaline is for fight or flight. And if you're pumping up hormones for physical activity because of all the red meat you're eating, you're not necessarily going to be violent. But you can be irritable, irascible, cranky, you know, and unhappy and acidic. So you can control that. Brains, I talk about them in the first edition of the first writing of the book. I used it for people to chelate with hormones, to level them out, to balance them. And I used the nut formula more often for that. And if the nut formula doesn't work, then you go to some cooked food. Now, I eat maybe two-thirds of a cup of rice a year, cooked rice. Because when I'm traveling in Asia, I don't usually get the milk as often as I'd like to. So I may go two, three weeks without dairy. And then I start getting overly hungry. You know, I can eat lots of meat and everything. And I just need to soothe that. Because I feel lots of hormones dumping at the same time. And I don't have the milk nutrients and fats to control the pollution, the toxicity that's dumping. Especially when I can taste AZT, which is known heavy metal poison. So when I get that dumping and I don't have my milk, I go for a cooked starch. So I'd like a third of a cup of rice with an equal amount, a third of a cup of butter. Or coconut cream with that rice. A third of a cup at a time. And that takes care of me for two, three more weeks. Unless I have dairy, then I don't have to worry about it. But if you've got psychological problems and you've got too much hormones and you don't exercise as much. The nut formula can help lower that for you. Those hormonal levels. So you don't have to worry about it. So you don't have to be in so much anxiety. Otherwise, exercise your butt off. Exercise hard and get rid of it. Don't live in anxiety. Not healthy. Not conducive to good relationships with yourself or other people.

Dairy in all of its forms is such a different remedy for each form it's in. When you have the milk straight, you've got good digestion, good flow, good balance of every cell in the body. When you drink it cold, you've got a problem. If you drink more than, let's say, two ounces, three ounces at a time. Unless you're an athlete and you've been running hard, you can get away with half a cup of cold milk at a time. But what happens when the milk or any fluid, no matter what you drink, goes into the stomach cold, the stomach contracts. No hydrochloric acid is produced. So you don't get the aid of hydrochloric acid in the stomach for your milk. So a lot of those proteins pass, including casein, passes into the duodenum, the second area of the stomach where the bile dumps. If it's still too cold there, your bile's not going to dump as well. You're also going to start absorbing undigested lactate when the bacteria was also neutralized by the cold from the mouth to the stomach. Unless you kept the cold milk in your mouth and got it warm before you swallowed it. But if you're just gulping cold milk, this is what's going to happen. You're going to absorb casein and lactate into the blood, undigested. You're going to get thirsty. You're going to get dry mouth. You could get headaches. You could get allergies. So minimally, you're not going to notice it, but that's the problem. So always suck your milk. Get a lot of bacteria into it. Drink it slowly if it's cold. Never more than, let's say, three ounces in a five-minute period. Unless you've been running hard and your whole body's heated. Let me tell you, that milk's going to be heated right there in the stomach. Before it moves over into the lower area, into the duodenum. Of course, this part of the stomach where the acid is made is the duodenum also. Between two sections to the stomach. They're not as bridged as you might think that they are. They have a pyloric muscle. It's not as tight or as small as we do at the hiatal. Where the esophagus dumps into the stomach. And where the small intestine dumps into the bowel. Those are very tight sphincters and we want to correct them. So that was a minor warning. It will keep the milk from moving and other foods from moving into the lower part of the stomach. Until enough hydrochloric acid is dumped. So again, you can feel these things going on. You drink the cold milk. You drink something cold. You feel the stomach contracting. Maybe your back aches a little bit. The nerves that go down to that part of the stomach. You feel those things and you see what you're doing to your body. If it makes your body discomforted, do something different. You can have your milk warm. Leave it out. Really, really hot and you want something cold. Cold water on your head. Let me tell you, there's nothing that will cool a body quicker than putting cold water on your head. Some ice water on your scalp and on your head will let your hair hold that cold ice water. You will cool quickly. Put it on your neck. You will cool quickly. Better not to drink things that are cold. Unless it's only three ounces at a time.

And it's okay to drink cold juice because there's no protein in it to wait for the hydrochloric acid to mix with it anyway. There's a little bit of fats by the time it gets into the lower part of the stomach. You need the bile and of course it will be okay by that time. But the juice will be mostly absorbed within the first few inches in the intestinal tract. Cheese does not digest raw. If it's salted cheese it will, but it takes the salt with it. Raw cheese does not digest in the human system. It absorbs and attracts poisons. As soon as you start chewing it, all the toxins in the brain dump out the gums, the tongue, and the salivary gland. And as that cheese goes down and you have the lymphatic system, the neurological system, and the bloodstream weave their way all the way through the digestive tract, the cheese, like a magnet, all those different minerals that have magnetism start pulling those poisons out of those three circulatory systems all the way out to the rectum. So you don't want that cheese absorbed. You know, hold on to it like a sponge. Pasteurized cheese, your body will do the same thing, but digest and reabsorb all those poisons. Salted cheese will do the same thing, but absorb those poisons, plus put the salt back in the body. So you need to stay away from salted cheese. And it doesn't matter what state, it could be cottage cheese, it will work the same way. Once you've dehydrated the milk, active enzymes are gone. Any food that is dried, there are no bioactive enzymes. There are just remnants after that. You do not digest anything dehydrated. Beef jerky, no matter what it is. Pemmican, doesn't matter what it is. Unless you're going to eat pineapple with it, or papaya, or honey. Then you will digest it. And if you're going to eat honey with cheese, now this is another remedy. So you've got cheese by itself, or with any other food, as long as the honey is not with the cheese directly. The cheese is going to absorb poisons and move it out to the system. If the cheese has honey in it, you're going to digest those nutrients in the cheese, especially the minerals. Cheese with honey is your best mineral supplement. You'll get the greatest amount of calcium. So let's say you take some dolomite. What is dolomite? Mined rock calcium. Hello? Who digests rock? I think the plants out there do. Nobody here does. It causes calcification in the body. It causes hardening of the arteries. It promotes arthritis and rheumatism. It promotes cancer. Your mineral supplement, if you want a high calcium, phosphorus, potassium and magnesium, you eat raw cheese. With a little honey. A tablespoon of cheese. Anywhere from a half to a whole teaspoon of honey. Some people even need less honey than that. Could be a quarter of a teaspoon of honey to a tablespoon of cheese. And then you will remineralize yourself. When I started experimenting with that, the people with osteoporosis healed it almost two times faster. So, dairy is an incredible substance. Anybody says to you, no other animal eats dairy. After the mother leaves. Yeah, but have you ever fed? Have you ever offered a horse or a cow? A sheep or a goat? A rabbit? Anybody milk?

I have. Everyone will drink it. It's just how many females are going to allow people to suck on them for their whole lives. It's not going to happen. A cow and a goat will. And a cow will drink its own milk. Just offer it. I've seen a horse drink two gallons of milk in an hour. It wouldn't drink the water, but it would drink two gallons of milk. Every animal that I fed offered milk to that was an herbivore that nursed their young drank the milk. I even had an alligator drink the milk. It's only because it's difficult for a woman to say, Okay, go suck me all day. You can suck me too. But a cow has this big udder and we can milk it two times a day. And basically, maybe your cows chose to do that on this plane to give us milk. Because it's a sensation. A wonderful thing. And the cows love it when they're milked. Udders get so heavy. If you've ever been around cows milking them, my grandparents owned a dairy and worked the dairy. Because those cows were so happy to run in and get milked twice a day. And if you didn't milk them, that night they were screaming all night long. Screaming to be milked. So they just get heavier and heavier. It's rough on their backs. So dairy is a wonderful thing. Cream, like I say, soothes the nervous system. Where no other food can like the cream. Butter. It lubricates the skin. Now I have people who eat like a pound of butter a day. They're huge and fat, but their skin is so dry. Why? Because their organs and glands have been dry for so long. That it's eating us all. It's like an orphanage. All the big kids who get to the tables first and get all the food. Then the skinny strongest kids only get the leftover. Well that's what happens with the skin. Also most of the toxins are leaving through the skin. So it needs more nutrients. How can you get the nutrients to the skin and the bones and the muscles and bypass all of it going to the glands and organs? And that's the lubrication formula. And for women I call it moisturizing formula. Women love moisturization, men love lubrication. I wanted to appeal to both, so that's why I gave it two names. And in the recipe book and in the other book it's called Moisturizing Lubrication Formula. Or Lubrication Moisturizing Formula. This one is Women First Moisturizing Formula. So, what happened there is, I've got the butter with lemon juice and an egg and a little bit of honey. Now how does that chemistry work? First of all, let's take a look at the egg. Egg is the quickest digested food on the planet. The protein, the egg white, the protein is already in mighty molecular form, liquid. So are the fats in the yolk, with all the B vitamins. Vitamin E and vitamin A, all of your vitamins are contained in that yolk. And that, not all of them, but most. And your protein is concentrated in that egg white. Plus a lot of hormones are in that egg white. So, when it goes into the system, the hydrochloric acid enters, egg white starts digesting rapidly, even before it moves into the second compartment. 

Bile dumps into the egg yolk, it's already dispersed cleanly. It's absorbed right into the fat, the bile starts fractionating the fat molecule. So the body is already realigning it into the cholesterols we need to carry on the body's function. Egg is digested from 3 to 5 inches of the small intestinal tract. Takes about 27 minutes, maximum, to digest an egg. Pretty fast, isn't it? Whole digestive tract, the whole body gets nourished, and you've done very little digesting. That's why in the recipe book, when I talked about the woman who had emphysema, who was going to die, her MD called me on a Thursday night, late, probably 9.30, 10 o'clock my time. She was 3 hours ahead of me in Maine or Massachusetts. She says, I've got an emphysema patient that was diagnosed 7 years ago. She has mainly been bedridden for 2 years, and on machines. She's going to die this weekend, I'm sure. Is there anything I can do? I said, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she said, well, I have my practice, you know, my family's welfare. You know, this is the law, and I said, we use the law. She said, we cannot, I'm not even supposed to be advising this, unless she's on her deathbed, or she's failed medical treatments, and failed them for 10 years. The law is, if you go to a doctor, they can only give you medical means, pharmaceutical, surgical, radiation, all that kind of garbage, for 10 years. If that fails you after 10 years, and you're not dead, then they can recommend alternatives. So never go to a doctor.

Q: So that's the contract that establishes the license.

A: Yep, they'll lose their license, and they'll not be able to work. That's it. So, I said, well that's your conscience, but you're coming to me now. So I said, the only thing I can suggest you do, is that you take 10 to 15 dozen eggs, put them on her bed table, and ask her to eat one as often as she can. So, I got a call, and this was a Thursday night, so let's say she got the eggs on Friday, got them to her on Friday night, it's Saturday morning. Maybe she survived the weekend, maybe she didn't. So it's Monday morning, about probably 8 o'clock my time, so it would have to be 11 o'clock back there. And I get a call from a raspy voice woman saying, it worked, I'm out of bed, what should I do? I said, who are you? She said, well my doctor called you, my medical doctor called you, and told you my situation, and you told her that I should eat lots of eggs, and I ate 33 on Saturday, 33 on Sunday, I'm out of bed, off the machines, what else can I do? I said, don't do anything else, just keep eating your eggs. For months or years, and then introduce raw milk and raw meat into your diet. That is how wonderful raw eggs are. The whole body doesn't spend all that time digesting fractionated clumps of meat and other foods, it's all liquid. So those egg nutrients go right in there. When people have Crohn's disease, they're not supposed to eat. Why? Because the mucous lining has thinned so much that their own digestive juices are eating their lining of their stomach and their intestines, so it's getting thinner. So they eat more than a handful at a time, sometimes that's too much. Half a cup can be too much. They'll split their gut and they have a leaky gut. Food particles, undigested food particles, usually travel to the knees first. The body becomes a digestive tract in the knees. So all Crohn's people have knee problems. Young ones can have bloated knees as big as this. And that's food particles that causes arthritis and rheumatism. It's from the Crohn. So what do you do? You eat only eggs and butter and honey. Sip milk a little bit. But you live on eggs. You eat 30 eggs a day. 50 eggs a day if you're a big person and you want to maintain your weight. But at least 20, 22 eggs a day. And you eat eggs all day long. A little bit at a time. A little honey and butter. Like two parts butter to one part honey. And you just sip on milk. No more than one, two tablespoons of milk at a time. You never eat more than an egg worth of food at a time. And an egg is never more than two ounces. Unless you've got an ostrich egg. And that's worth 50 eggs. A friend of mine, a primal chef, gave me an ostrich egg. So, you know, you've got optical illusions. How much food is in here? So I put it into a quart jar. And that was the egg white only. And then I started filling up another quart jar. And it went up about three quarters of a cup of the egg white. And then the yolk was two and a half cups. So I got one and three quarters quarts of egg from one ostrich egg. I mean, it doesn't look like there's that much fluid, but there was, in that ostrich egg. I drank that all in one day.  That's what it's worth, 50 eggs. You know, but I drank it all day long.

You know, like I sipped my milk. I just had the egg all day long. A little bit of the yolk, a little bit of the white. So, um, eggs. You've got a problem. You've got an illness. You can't do other things. You can't digest. You eat eggs. You've got diarrhea. You can't stop it. You eat lots of cheese and eat eggs. Cheese and eggs. Not together. Space them.

Q: Not together?

A: Not together.

Q: How far out?

A: Half an hour. You've got nausea. A lot of poisons that don't dump out the skin. They dump rapidly and immediately. Dump into the stomach. Anytime you experience nausea, know that poisons are dumping into your stomach. You need to absorb those. If they're natural toxins, your hydrochloric acid will neutralize. If you got bit by a snake, or a black widow, or a scorpion, or something like that. Stung by a scorpion. The American Indians used to go get a lactating animal and drink the milk. And it would draw the poisons into the stomach. In the same way. Cheese will do that. So you want to absorb it quicker in a larger amount. Just a sugar cube sized amount of cheese every 10 minutes. Until the nausea stops. Some people say, well the more cheese I eat, the more nausea I get. That's because your body is an opportunist. It's saying, oh you're putting the cheese in, I'm already dumping these poisons. Let me get rid of a lot. Then they'll just keep getting nauseous and nauseous and nauseous. Rarely will they vomit because the cheese cubes are absorbing it. But the importance of dumping the poisons into the stomach. Or out the bowels and getting diarrhea. Is phenomenal. Let me give you an example. A woman who had breast cancer. She was really skinny when she came to me. And very ill, fibromyalgia, all kinds of problems. She went into cancer even after she was on the diet. I could see it in the iris. It was already moving toward that. And she was so skinny. I'm not going to tell you what part of the punch line. Of understanding what I'm saying. So I told her, you need to gain about 30 pounds. So you're going to be about 20 pounds overweight. That's how skinny she was. So she got up to 25 pounds. Then went back to 23 pounds. You know, added. So she was only, you know, 8 to 12 pounds overweight. And I wanted her to put 10 more on. Because anybody who goes through cancer is going to have a heavy dump at some point. They're going to be vomiting for weeks. 6, 8 weeks sometimes. And you've got to be able to make it through there. You've got to have the weight on your body. If you don't, you're likely not going to make it. 9 out of 10 people out of that 5% that don't make it on this diet, 95% reverse their cancers on my diet. And the neurological scientist, Elnora Van Winkle, called all those patients and checked with them. And she put on the internet the statistics on the primal diet reversing cancer are true. 95%. Medical profession, 17%. And they tell you it's much higher than that. But they tell you you're cured after 5 years because most people get their cancer between 5 and 7 years later. After that. So their cut-off point is you're cured in 5 years. Even if you get cancer the next day and it's metastasized all over your body, it's a new cancer, the other two. You get a new cancer. Such a bullshit. Manipulation of the system. So anyway, this young woman, she was 38 years old at this point. And she'd been on the diet for about 2 1⁄2 years.

And the cancer of the breast was coming to an end. She started vomiting and vomiting and vomiting. It went on 7 weeks, 8 weeks, 9 weeks. And she'd get thinner and thinner. I said, oh shit, if she just had that extra 10 pounds. 8 weeks, she stopped vomiting. But after 6 weeks, I had to figure out what she was vomiting. So I asked her husband to keep 4 ounces of the vomit for me. And that's all he kept was those 4 ounces of the vomit. I sent it to the lab. And I said, I need you to check for all kinds of toxic chemicals, whatever it was, vomit. I got a call from the head of the laboratory. Somebody's poisoning their patient. Whenever they have a reading like that, they have to call whoever is, you know, whoever the tester was and say, hey, you know, people don't have thallium like that in their bodies unless they've been poisoned. She had 3,000 times the toxic level of thallium in that four ounces of vomit. Enough to kill her 3,000 times. That was in just four ounces. And I said, nobody's trying to kill her. She was a metallurgist. She designed and molded silver jewelry right over a Bunsen burner without a mask and without gloves for seven years. Breathed in all of that mercury, that aluminum, all of those alkaloids, bending, shaping right there in that burner. All went to the lungs. Who's responsible for taking care of that kind of toxin? The lymph glands in the breast. She had breast cancer. She died. Two days after, the cancer completely stopped and reversed. She died. Why? She didn't have the nutrients. She was so sore from vomiting, she needed five more days to get stable to be able to eat. She died.

Q: What about the eggs?

A: Couldn't get the eggs down. Sure tried. She couldn't keep them down. Everything came back up. She just needed the nutrients just for another week. That 10 pounds would have given her two more weeks.

Q: So this is a normal process, I guess, cleansing process, after the period?

A: Yep. Anybody who has that kind of poisoning in their system, they're going to go through a heavy detox like that. Coal miners, people who work in hospitals, around all those fumes, people who work in incendiary places, people who are manufacturing, processing, refining oil, and breathing all that kind of stuff in. So if they go into breast cancer, lung cancer, they're going to have a bout with it like that. So they better be fast. And they better get fat quickly, because you never know when you're going to start that process. So vomit is so important. When you vomit, you say, God, look how much shit I got out of my body so quickly. If you get [unintelligible] badly, that's good stuff. But the poisons and chemicals you got out so much, it's just a short period of time. If the body were taking that out through the system, you would have rashes. The thallium would cause rashes, hives, all kinds of problems. And 3,000 times the amount that is lethal. Can you imagine your whole body would be a sore? Whole body would be a sore. So vomiting and diarrhea, you cheer when you have them. Because you've gotten well so much faster. OK, so back to the moisturizing lubrication formula. The reason that the body can get that to the skin, the muscles, connective tissue, is because the lemon juice, with that rapidly digested protein and fat, makes it penetrate. The lemon juice goes in there and breaks down the butter quickly. So that it's digested and moves so fast through the system that the glands and the organs can't absorb it all. And it can get to the skin, the connective tissue, and the bones and the muscles. So you won't have that dryness, even if you're eating a pound of butter a day. And you don't need to be that fat, unless you're... 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You can always feed the skin from the outside. Butter doesn't do it very well. Use primal facial body care cream, which is a mixture of coconut oil, I mean, coconut cream, butter, and dairy cream, a little honey, a little royal jelly, a little bone marrow, if you want. And that revitalizes the skin very nicely, or co... straight coconut cream. Now, I've been doing some experiments over the last year with... Because people, you know, the brain is the most toxic. Remember, it has the metals. It collects it because of the electro energy and the light that it reflects. So most of your heavy metals and metallic metals go to the brain. When they dump, they dump out the gums, the salivary glands and the tongue. What that creates is all of your dental decay. Bacteria is not your problem. What happens is, the brain will dump that stuff out the gums. Your body uses calcium, magnesium, phosphorus and potassium to neutralize those highly acidic minerals and compounds. When they mix together, they are chemical abrasive compounds. So they damage the dentine. So the body takes all of this calcium, and people are eating cooked foods, it's all cauterized. Magnesium is cauterized, phosphorus, potassium, all the alkalizing minerals are cauterized. So they hit that, those metals coming out over the teeth and through the gums, and you've got plaque. It doesn't matter if you believe what Dave Wolfe says, they're like sea creatures, they're building scales, they're shell creatures, or the body is just taking calcium, with some bacteria, and attaching it to those metals. It doesn't matter how it forms, you've got scaly plaque there, that's mostly cauterized minerals from cooked food. And you have to get that off, because when a mineral, an alkalizing mineral is cauterized, it is less potent as an alkaline substance. Whereas your toxic minerals that are acidic, once they're cauterized, they're more abrasive and more acidic. That's why we live half the life we should. All animals live seven times the time it takes them to finish maturation. And they're on their natural diets. Animals that are fed processed, domesticated diets, live shorter lives. We live half of hours. We should be living to 150 years old. We'll be half that. Take a look at that. Other animals don't do that. The animals, the cats, after seven generations, well, after four generations of only cooked foods, three generations, three generations, they no longer procreate. So they are wiped out in the third generation on only cooked foods and how they process foods. The rats, they lived about, I think, half their normal lives, but he didn't let many of them live because he was always killing them and performing autopsies. The Howell experiments, he wanted to duplicate the Pottenger experiments, but cats take too long. Pottenger, there's 900 cats over a 10-year period in those experiments that are cooked and processed in raw foods. And Howell did it with rats because they only had a three-year lifespan.

So he fed them cooked and raw foods. And the rats that ate cooked foods had all the diseases of man, just like the cats did, but they lived their normal full life of three years. So Howell was struggling with him to figure it out. It took him a whole year to figure out what was going on. He looked over the notes, everything that was written. People just stood there and sat there and took notes day and night, all day long. And he realized, finally, the rats who were fed cooked food were eating their feces. So he said, that's the only difference. I can't find any element in the rat that would cause it to live longer, or anything like that. So he redid the experiments, put a wire mesh down there, so all the feces would drop through. They lived two-thirds of their life. They dropped one-third of their life. They were eating shit and living, so eat shit and live.

Q: On a cooked food diet.

A: Pardon?

Q: On a cooked food diet.

A: Yeah. If you're on a cooked food diet, eat shit and live.

Q: If you're on a raw diet, it might be better.

A: Even on a raw diet, I mean, you eat it, you're sitting there, you know, it gets the E. coli going. You're going to get a lot of nutrients that you don't digest otherwise. But don't eat humans yet. Nobody's healthy. First time I need my egg. I need to sip some milk. How long did I go so far without losing track? One time. 

Q: Almost two hours of this session. 

A: Two hours without any food. Okay. So the lubrication formula is very important to get to the skin, so you don't have dry skin. You're going to need a tremendous amount of fats. Moisturizing lubrication formula. Kefir and yogurt are fermented dairy. And they are pre-digested. So you're going to digest them easier. You can eat kefir or yogurt cold. As cold as you want. Because you don't need so much hydrochloric acid to dump into it when it first enters your body. You're going to get enough hydrochloric acid in the rest of the system to digest it. So you can drink it cold if you want. But there's a catch. Fermented foods have a lot of alcohol. So when you drink too much kefir or yogurt, you're going to have bloating. Swelling in the ankles and feet. I can now only eat... I'm already starting to get a little swell in my toes, I can tell. And I've had a pint of kefir. So I'm not going to be able to drink that anymore, very much, because it's going to keep my brain working. Put it in the refrigerator, and I'll get my fresh milk out and drink that for the rest of the day and night. I'm going to drink more of that tomorrow. So you have to find your level of how much fermented dairy you can eat. Now, who eats and advocates a tremendous amount of fermented dairy? Sally Fallon. Has anybody seen Sally Fallon lately? Huge. Literally huge. I'm talking huge.

Q: Two tons of fun.

A: Pardon?

Q: Two tons of fun.

A: Bloated. White as a ghost.

Q: Who is she?

A: She's the famous person.

Q: Nourishing traditions.

A: Nourishing traditions. Wonderful woman. I love her dear. But she's telling people a lot of bullshit. And, you know, I tell her all the time when I see her, when we're together. You know, at the Senate hearing. Both giving testimony in California about raw milk. And she just keeps getting bigger. You know, I keep saying to her, you know. You know, you lay off the dairy, you stop freezing your meats. Otherwise you're going to eat them raw. You know. And she believes bacteria is going to take over the planet. Take over the world. And that's your problem. If it were, I wouldn't be here. So, you have to look at what people are doing and saying. What's wrong here? She's looking anemic and bloated and very large. I don't mind people being fat. But she's not bloated with fat. She's bloated with alcohol and fluid. Also, she's lost her color. She's looking anemic. She's no longer... The fermented dairy is no longer helping her. No longer good for her. So, watch that in yourself. You start getting swelling. Are you drinking too much of this? Are you eating too much fruit? What's happening? She just needs to regulate that. Now, I'm going to go quickly and wind it up here before we get into Q&A. We took a lot of time for eating. We took almost an hour eating more off of my... That's why we're running behind back there. They came for mini readings. We're going to get into eating schedule and the importance of an eating schedule. When you wake in the morning, your blood is overly acidic. Why? Because your body detoxifies the nervous system when the sun goes down. And by midnight, it's in full swing. If you are detoxing heavily, you're going to wake up between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock at night and not be able to go back and sleep until about 5.30. Do not fight that. Never fight it. Get up and do something. You'll be productive. If you try to sleep, you're not going to be able to sleep and you're going to get frustrated. Get up and do something. Then you go to sleep at 5.30 and sleep an hour if you have to go to work. Sleep two hours if you can. You get home from work, you wrap it up, you get to bed by 8 o'clock, 8.30. You're going to get up at 1 o'clock again, 2 o'clock. You follow that cycle until your nervous system has stopped its heavy detoxification. On other times, just normal nervous system detoxification, which means you're dumping a lot of metals, the blood is going to be acidic when you wake up. You need your vegetable juice to alkalinize that. Or you're not going to digest your food well. So you have vegetable juices that have low carbs in them. For a couple of years to pull out all those toxic sugars that you've consumed all these years. Celery is so low in carbohydrates, there's not enough celery to digest celery. So it's a negative. It will help pull out toxic sugars out of your body. That's why I recommend a high level of celery, up to 80% in juices for the first couple of years. And this was left out of the book, because I didn't understand it until the book was printed and published the last time. So it's got to go into a different book anyway. 

So, once that happens, once you've gotten rid of your sugars, and once you start drinking your vegetable juices and you start getting low or out of sorts, then you cut way down on the celery juice and you add some carrot to start raising your sugar level and you add cucumber puree, not cucumber juice. And that way you can level it off. And you'll go with your body's changes. A lot of people who don't do well after two years on this diet are people that aren't listening to their body and they're not re-reading the book. You've got symptoms, this is the food you eat. These are the foods you change to. You do this for a while, why are the symptoms going on? The body's changing all the time. Your diet has to change daily if necessary. But it usually isn't daily, it's usually in cycles. Every few months you may have a heavy detox. You eat those foods for that detox, for those problems, for those ailments. And you switch off, maybe two days a week doing a particular food for one problem. If you've got multiple problems, doing several days of that fruit that handles that other problem. And you just handle it that way. Let's say fish in the morning, fish, red meat in the day when you need the energy and fish at night when you need to be calm or some kind of fowl to calm the body. So you shift with your daily needs. The main cycle of the body is juice in the morning because of the acidity in the blood. Correct that. No matter where you are on your sugar level. As soon as you shift to the different juice which has the cucumber and the carrot juice in it, you're still going to have the parsley in there. Or cilantro, if you're trying to detox metals. That has the chlorophyll to alkalinize the blood a bit. That's what you need. Now, one thing you should consider is that if you eat a high-carbohydrate food within the first 6-7 hours of your day, you're going to cause less focus, less clarity. Why is that? Because the body builds its glycogen reserve for the day. Glycogen is what the body uses to run the brain and nervous system throughout the day. It makes its storage of it in the first 6-7 hours of your day. If you eat a high-carb food, lots of carrot juice, cereal, fruit, you're going to have a glycogen that causes a lot of advanced glycation end product, AGE. And Columbia University found that it collected in a healthy body at a rate of 70% and in an unhealthy body at a rate of 90% for your lifetime. That's the stuff that the celery helps pull out. And if you're going to eat more of that stuff in the first 6-7 hours, you're going to build more of it to collect. I want to get those AGEs out of there because they cause confusion. They muddle your thinking. They block focus. How many of you can sit here and dance around the subject leading back to it 2 hours later? Not many people can do that. I can do it because I know how to eat throughout the day and the patterns. So I do not eat any high-carbohydrate food that is out of balance. If I have carrot in my juice, it still is not greater than the celery and the cucumber in it to cause my body to build glycogen from that carbohydrate.

I want the glycogen to be built from pyruvate, from a protein, because when your body builds glycogen with the help of glucagon from meat or eggs, what happens? Only 12% advanced glycation end product, maximum. Usually it's 7 to 8%. We can handle 12% in a day easily. So we get no accumulative AGEs, advanced glycation end product, that cause sugars to deteriorate the system in the body to age. So, you eat meat next. You have your juice. 45 minutes later, you have a meat meal. Always have a fat with your meat. Otherwise, your meat is going to get converted into a lot of fuel and you're going to burn your meat as fuel. So I always recommend people have one, one and a half, two tablespoons of butter with every meal. Butter is always the best. If you don't have that, you know, coconut cream. You don't want dairy cream, though. You can have a tablespoon, maybe, of dairy cream. If you have sour cream, go for it. Fine to have with meat. You can have two tablespoons of sour cream. If you're having, you know, coconut cream with it, it's not going to be as good, but at least it's a fat so you don't convert your meat into fuel. You want it as a building block, as a growth factor for your body to get younger and healthier. Avocado. Avocado's okay, but it's difficult to digest. But it will still stop most of the meat from being converted into a fuel. But often when you eat avocado with meat, it will convert a lot of it, probably 50% of it, into a fuel. You eat butter with it, how much will be converted into a fuel? The pyruvate? 15%. That's all. So not 50%. Or 90, 80% if you don't eat any fat with your meat. You can eat the meat fat with it. You can eat egg with it too. Stop it. You know what else?

Q: Olive oil.

A: Olive oil? That could do it. Absolutely. But you don't want a lot of olive oil because it's a cleanser and a stringer. You're going to turn a lot of that meat into solvent. Start cleaning out the body. So it's always, if you have a pressed oil with a meat meal. In fact, any time you have a pressed oil, whether it's coconut cream, olive oil, flax oil, if you can get a good peanut oil, any of those, you always want an animal fat with it.

Q: What about meat fat with meat?

A: Yeah, that's fine. They usually digest so well and so fast, it's not the same. Concentrated, separated fats are different than the meat fat. Meat fat usually digests mostly right away. I've eaten two pounds of that fat a day and a pound of meat, and still been hungry. You know, it isn't like the butter. You know, that butter is incredible stuff. So, you have your meat meal, and you're going to stay focused. Your body is going to get, you know, starting moving part of the day. Now the body needs cream to settle the nervous system to soothe the body. So you have a milkshake. Eggs, milk, a little honey. A little extra cream if you want, and so a tablespoon of coconut cream into that milkshake. Just a little, as much as you want. Depends upon what you're doing, how big you want to be. And that will soothe the body. Some people want to go to sleep if they have drank too much. So if you reach that level, you keep cutting it down, and if you're only drinking three quarters of a cup and not falling asleep, that's what you need to drink. If you're drinking a whole cup, cup and a half, and you're falling asleep after it, you're drinking too much. Or you're drinking it too fast.

Q: You gotta wait like a couple hours or something to after the meat?

A: Well, you need two hours. Well, one and a half, well, it could be anywhere from one and a half to three, two and a half hours to drink on your activity level. Then you let two to three hours pass after that, and you have another vegetable juice. Or you sip on your sport drink, the sport drink that I gave you. Then about an hour, two hours later, you have your fruit meal. If you have diabetes or hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia, you could split your meat meals into three a day instead of two. So you could have a meat meal after your sport drink or a vegetable juice, an hour after that, and then an hour, hour and a half after that, you have your fruit meal. So you take the same amount of meat and break it into three instead of two. Most people can do fine on two meat meals a day. I know some people that go on one meat meal a day. They can't eat the meat in the evening, but they can eat a whole pound in the morning. Or some in the morning and some in the afternoon and some in the night. Most people can eat meat morning and night, especially in a hot, sunny environment like this. It's best to eat the meat in the morning and in the night. But if you have diabetes or a problem, it's better to break it up into three. So with that fruit, fruit is what? Fruit is a cleanser. We need very little. In the citric acid cycle of fat utilization as energy, we only use 5% carbohydrates or vitamin C to utilize fat as fuel. We use 15% pyruvate, which is protein sugar. 80% fat. So we shouldn't eat over 5% carbohydrates in a day relative to the whole meal, to all the meals. So one fruit meal is enough. Most people need a little extra sugar, carbohydrates like fruit, to cleanse a little bit better. So instead of eating fruit twice a day, eat a cup and a half of fruit instead of a cup of fruit. If it's pineapple, you want to bring it down to a half a cup. Pineapple causes more over-emotionality than any other food. I'm not talking about alcohol. Those aren't foods. I'm talking about raw foods. Pineapple, ripe pineapple, will cause over-emotionality if you eat even a half a cup every day in a row for about 10 days, you're going to find yourself over-emotional. Do not do that. Have pineapple maybe every other day if you've got digestive problems. You want to clean the plaque out of your intestines, and you want to move your lymphatic through. You eat the pineapple every other day. Always eat a fat with your fruit, so the fruit sugar doesn't rush through you and start demineralizing your blood and your whole system. So always eat fat. You want to clean faster? This is where you put your major amount of coconut cream. Four tablespoons, three, four tablespoons of coconut cream. One, two tablespoons of dairy cream. Tiny bit of butter, maybe a half, quarter teaspoon. And then a fruit. And choose the fruits, like I say, that are specific to your symptoms. You go through the book, We Want to Live, the remedy section. You chuck off every problem you've ever had. And, you know, put notes at the top. Leg, you know, rash, whatever it is that you don't remember. And you go through there, and, oh, this is the food, this is the food I need to eat. You go through that time with those facts. Sometimes you say, oh, I want something really delicious.

So you take, you know, a half a cup of cream and three tablespoons of cream. You make whipped cream with a little honey in it. And you slice up your fruit, you know, without the coconut cream. Then you're going to have a fruit meal that's going to more feed your nervous system and brain than it will detoxify. Remember that coconut cream is your major detoxifier, but all fruit is detoxifying. That's why fruitarians disappear. And their, you know, their spinal cords and their bones start disappearing and their teeth disappear. Because it's, they are solvents. High in water and sugar. Okay, and after that fruit meal, you wait two to three hours. You have a small amount of vegetable juice or you still sip on your sport formula. You can sip through milk at any time. Sip here, sip there. And then after that vegetable juice, one and a half, two hours maximum, you have your second to last fruit meal. If you're diabetic and have two meat meals already, this is your third and last.

Q: Did you mean your second, you said fruit meal, another fruit meal. Did you mean meat meal?

A: I meant meat meal.

Q: I see.

A: You have your second or third meat meal if you're diabetic. So, again, have at least one tablespoon of butter with that meat or some other fat. If you feel like you're gaining too much weight, you reduce it to a tablespoon at that second meat meal. Then, right before you go to bed, half a cup of milk, some honey in it, a milkshake with one egg, half a cup of milk, tiny bit of honey, maybe a little extra cream, maybe a teaspoon of cream, teaspoon of coconut cream if you like. And you can make a double batch of that. And you have half of it before you go to sleep and half of it during the night. Very important. Do not go five hours without eating. After five hours without eating, your protein level becomes nil in your blood. So what happens? What happens on the planet when all other food is gone and only animals are left? They start eating each other, eating themselves. Red blood cells become cannibalistic and they start eating each other for protein. So every hour, beyond five hours that you sleep, you wake up after eight hours. What have you done? You've eaten two to four tablespoons of red blood cells. You're already amenic. People have eight, ten hours sleep. They wake up and they can't move it with a coffee or soda or some kind of caffeine to pump them up or cigarettes to pump them up. We should be waking up spring-like. They stretch. They're off doing their thing. Just like that. Humans, where's the coffee? Where's the soda? Where's the cigarette? Where's the pill? You have to eat. So if you're a hyperactive person and you wake after five hours and eat, you're not going to go back to sleep. So you wake up in three hours. Have your milk, your eggs, your meat or whatever you want to eat that has protein in it and you go back to sleep for five hours.

Q: If you don't have milk, can you just do one egg and a little butter and honey?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Is that sufficient?

A: Yeah. I gave all those alternatives, just what you said. As long as it's got some protein in it, that's what you want. So you wake and you have it. Now, a good friend of mine, John Fox, on the diet two years, gave lecture every year in the [unintelligible] area. And the third time I was there was after two years. Yeah, he was... When I first met him, he was a long-term vegetarian. And he was only mid-40s. And, you know, he looked like he was 70 years old with back problems. And, you know, he's a scientist, an inventor, you see. Always in his laboratory and doing things. So he hunched over and permanently staying that way as a vegetarian. He was a raw food vegetarian for two years, about. Got into the diet. So two years later, he's standing up straight. He's got muscles all over him. He's very narrow in here. Shoulders, knees filled out. Here he is now. He's late 40s. Filled out and all of that. And he says, what happens? I don't get any energy until 10 o'clock or noon. John, are you waking up and eating something during the night? No? Okay. Do that tonight and see what happens. So he did it that night. He set an alarm. Awakened. Had something to eat. Woke in the morning. All the energy's in. That simple little trick was all he needed to change a major focus in his life, was having no energy in the morning. If your red blood cells are eating each other, you're going to have anemia. Caffeine is no remedy for anemia. Eating protein is a remedy for anemia. Okay, Q&A. Leave out anything.

Q: The organ meats, they have high percent of the fat. They're more like fish.

A: All depends upon what you're eating. They say liver's full of fat. Liver isn't full of fat. Liver's full of protein. It's like the heart. It's concentrated in protein. It has very little fat. The liver makes bile to digest fat. It's not fat. It's the leanest thing in the body.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: My father broke both of my eardrums when I was young. He said, you listen, pop. Sometimes some levels of voice in the pitch, I don't hear. So for you, I need you to have a little bit more volume or change your pitch. Because I'm deformed.

Q: I think I got it.

A: Okay. All right, any other questions?

Q: You're talking earlier about hormones. And I guess you're saying that most of the hormones you shouldn't have any.

A: You don't need them. If you're eating a proper diet, you're utilizing your fats properly, your proteins, you don't need a hormone. Hormones are for danger periods. They're for emergencies. That's like a small, little gland. Everywhere in the body.

Q: Isn't that different than the female hormones that we go through once a month? Our menstrual circle? Is that different?

A: That's what I was saying. How big are those ovaries?

Q: So you're saying you don't need it. So people, women that are out, say they're hormone deficient, is that not really a concern?

A: It's the medical profession, the pharmaceutical industry, who can use hormones [unintelligible]. Who needs a good diet? Who needs a change of food? That's all. They made like a fortune by sucking people into this all I need hormone. You don't need hormone.

Q: You talk a lot about blending things. So for instance, for the milkshake, can you just drop some eggs in the milk, stir it around, mix it up that way? Or why do you always blend it? Why are you blending in the blender with the jar?

A: If you blend in a jar, you're preventing a lot of oxygen from mixing with it. When you oxidize your nutrients, what happens? You lose them. So if you're blending in a bowl, a blender bowl, you've got a lot of oxygen going down. If you're losing a third of your nutrients, it's because they're oxidized. Blending jars, to where you've always got your 4 ounce, 8 ounce, 12 ounce, 16 ounce, 24 ounce, 32 ounces, you've got the proper size of jar so you've got very little air space in it, so you're not going to oxidize your nutrients. But if you want to, when I'm traveling, I don't take a blender with me all the time. Sometimes I do. Most of the time I don't. Eggs and, you know, a little bit of cream or coconut cream and milk together and honey, shake it up and I eat it. Yeah.

Q: Okay.

A: Yes.

Q: What if you're not really sure how the purity of the animals you're eating, for example, if they don't have heavy metals in their organs or, you know, in their bodies or they've got a lot of pesticides. When it's raw, does it affect the body?

A: A lot of the toxins that we put into animals, they shoot them in the lung. So, those particular cuts, you have to be careful of. Some will shoot it into the upper shoulder. Most of them do it in the neck. So, don't eat the spinal cord. You know, unless you know it's an organic animal and there's been no vaccine. Now, the North Star Bison vaccinates their breeding females. So, you need to tell Mary Gracie that you're my patient. You don't want any vaccinated meats or glands or organs from any vaccinated animal. So, that's the only way you can be sure not to get them from her. But, I ate at a lot of supermarkets and all that for years. Because health food stores back in those days. They didn't carry meats, except there were Shelton's chickens or something like that. And that crap was bad, because they just fed on grains, you know. So, they were pretty bad birds. [unintelligible] But, I was eating out in regular supermarkets.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, I have to share one experiment that I did. I got a... I went all over, and I advertised for a fisherman that when they caught a swordfish, I wanted it. A whole swordfish. And I'd pay him for twice what he usually got. And that's what most... When you pay most markets, it's three times what the fisherman got. So, I was going to give him two times what he usually got. So, I waited something like almost eight weeks, nine weeks before I got a call from a fisherman in the Santa Barbara area who caught a big swordfish. He got 130 pounds. So, it wasn't like I got in the Philippines with 200 pounds, 230 pounds. Still, it was a big swordfish for me. So, I butchered it. We had the animals already collected and in the laboratory. And we were just waiting and feeding them raw meats and, you know, dairy and all kinds of discarded stuff from the Altadena. At the time, they were Altadena and they were to become Stueve's. And we'd feed them any kind of kefir or stuff like that that I could get cheap. Because these were laboratory animals and I was spending a lot of money on it, the whole experiment. And we divided them in two. Got the swordfish. We cooked... We took some of the swordfish, put it through a spinner and see how much mercury was in it. So it had a rate of mercury of about, I think it was 13.2. Don't keep me to that exact fact. I've got those records at home. Anyway, the mercury level was one point. It was at a particular level. And then we fed cooked swordfish, the same swordfish, cooked to one group and raw to the other group. Never frozen. Neither of them got frozen. We let it go a little ripe over many weeks period. It got very ripe, but they still ate it. And I ate it too. I ate the raw. I didn't eat the cooked. And we kept all the feces and urine. We collected everything. And we found that in the animals that ate the swordfish raw, 92 to 98% of the mercury passed in their feces and urine. Of course, with our gauges, some of the mercury could have been still there and we weren't able to get it from the feces, the fat molecules. But in all of that, the fat molecules that were bound with that mercury that were in the swordfish, relatively unetched with digestive juices. So in the raw state, the body, the digestive tract, could identify, this animal fat bound with this toxin, do not let it free. Do not set it free. In the animals that ate it cooked, only 2 to 12% was found in the urine and feces. That means that 88 to 98% of that mercury went into those animals that ate it cooked. Because I'm a big swordfish eater. I'll just eat swordfish until it comes out every pore in my body. And, you know, people are telling me you can't eat swordfish like that. They're toxic. Well, two years ago, my answers sometimes get long because I want you to understand them thoroughly. Greenpeace did a test and they asked to see how contaminating the human population was. So they asked for hair samples. So I sent them eight hair samples under different names. 

So Ralph was the right side of my head to the ear. So Ralph ear is right ear. At different places of my head, I cut the hair off because I wanted to see if, because most of them cut the hair here and check one area. I said, wait a minute. I got gray spots here and there. I'm going to be sending out toxins in different parts of my head in different levels. So let's see if that's accurate. So sure enough, every spot of my head had a different level. But none of them were over four. Eleven's highly toxic. I was way down at the four level. Most of them were down 2.8, 3.4 on that level. But one of them was almost up to where it was a 4.1 or 3.9, something like that. So that was what was coming out of my head. So all that mercury that I was eating with all of those swordfish were not staying in my body. They were moving out. So that is a long answer to your question, but I wanted to give it to you in an experience.

Q: In the same vein, what do we do about the dentists and the numbing agents?

A: Don't get any numbing agents. That stuff solidifies the gums, and you're likely to get some kind of tumor in the mouth.

Q: How do you deal with the pain?

A: I had 16 fillings removed with no numbing agent in 1978. Late 1978.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, that's what I did. But I also was smart. I took, you know, what I knew was a pain formula, you know, butter, egg, cheese, bee pollen, and mixed all that together and ate it before I went in. So I had my strength, lots of cheese, lots of milk, days before. So I had four hours of drilling one morning, four hours of drilling the next morning to remove them. But during those times, there was no water jet on the drill bit. So they got real hot. It isn't really the drilling that caused long-term pain. It's when the hot drill bit burns the nerve and it blisters. Can't get rid of the pain. Otherwise, if that drill bit hits the nerve, the pain's gone in 30, 45 seconds. It comes and goes. And you can handle a stab and it'll go away pretty quickly. But if it burns it, that pain is there for days because it's a blistered burn.

Q: So that epinephrine and novocaine is...

A: All of those are toxic. They'll cause all kinds of eventual dental problems and bone problems and gum problems. They harden the whole matter. They stop circulation into the bone. 

Q: That's a tough one. 

A: So what you do is now they have these water jets that cool the bit as they're drilling. It's a cinch. Absolute cinch. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You don't need that treatment. In fact, it makes the pain worse.

Q: It really does. I asked him to use half a cartridge. He was willing to do that. Other dentists have not been willing to do that.

A: You just find a dentist to do it. I had a tooth that had been capped and it had the biggest silver filling in it. So all that mercury had been absorbed into that nerve. So about four years ago it was dangling back there and I said, I don't want to deal with this thing anymore. I'm going to go have it pulled. So I had this great dentist in Tijuana who does exactly what I want. I have to go to Mexico to get exactly what I want. So I said, okay, I want you to put... What they have is they have this like corkscrew thing that goes in there only it's a blade shapes and goes around the tooth and it has a blade on it on this side and they turn it and it cuts the membrane, the gum all the way from the tooth and then you pull it out. So it's a big molar. We're talking about a huge molar back here. And he said, of course you want novocaine this time. I said, are you crazy? I want you to do it in two steps, though. Or even three. You push it in. You let me get through that pain. Take a few seconds. Maybe a minute, two minutes maximum. Then you twist it around. Cut it all the way. Let me recoup from that. Two, three minutes. And then you pull. And then I'll recoup from that for the rest of the day. So what he did was push it in. Gave me a minute and a half. I said, OK, I'm ready. He goes, phew, phew. Just like that. And his father's a dentist. His mother's a dentist. And he's a dentist. Three generations of dentists there. And they all cringed. They had to watch it, because they'd never see anybody pull a tooth without some kind of Novocaine or something, Xylocaine, some kind of anesthetic. And the nerve was still gray. And it was all swollen inside. And it was huge. So all the way up into here, that's why he wouldn't let go, because the nerve was so swollen up in there, it wouldn't let the tooth go. And it was so damaged, it was like dried together. The nerve with the tooth, at the point, would have joined the tooth. So it would have never come out without me asking him to pull it. Well, I went around there with it swinging around in there for a year and a half. So I said, this has got to go. That's it. So when he pulled it out, I mean, the blood went across the room. Stopped bleeding just like that. One heartbeat, it bled. And then it stopped just like that. He said, this is like a miracle. I've never seen this before. And then somebody have a tooth fall, be swollen up in the nerve like that. Nerve root come out this far. The nerve came out. So that means it was all the way from here. It came out all the way there. So let me tell you, you're prepared... If you're on a good diet, the pain is quick. Take a look at the bulls that the Maasai shoot. They take, you know, when there's the breeding period, when the calves are suckling, they're nursing, they don't give as much milk. So what they do is they bleed the bulls. They'll take a bamboo about this long and about this thick. They shave it down to a sharp edge. They take a huge slingshot and they shoot that bamboo. You know what I mean? It's a hard shoot. It goes right into the jugular. And you'll see that bull down there. He's eating away, and all of a sudden, shoo! And that bull is right back to eating. It's like something, you know, a fly bothered him for a second. And then they put a cork in there, and then they'll take a bladder and fill it with half milk and then half blood and shake that up and drink it. 

The first time I got to do it was in Pangaia a few years ago. We took a goat and we milked it. And then we all killed it. We did a ceremony. We put it to sleep and then cut its jugular vein. So it died in sleep, and then we bled it into two glass gallon jars, half with milk each. So it was half blood and half milk, a gallon each. So it was a gallon of blood, a gallon of milk, half each mix. There were how many vegetarians? You were there, right? How many vegetarians? There were like six vegetarians there. They actually drank the blood. You see the blood and milk combination. You see them going... Look on their face and get a few sips. He drank that two gallons in about 45 minutes to an hour. It tasted like ice cream. Couldn't believe it. And this is what the Maasai did. But the point of that was when you're a healthy animal, pain doesn't last. You can get through it pretty quickly, yes.

Q: So mercury fillings, fillings in general. What do we do about it? Do we have a mercury filling taken out?

A: Absolutely. When you've been on the diet, two and a half years. That's what I suggest. People be on a good diet, two and a half years. Because if you get that removed and your body starts detoxing that mercury all at one time, you're going to have abscesses in your mouth. You're going to have abscesses in your brain and your sinuses. Your gums could bleed like crazy. I've seen all kinds of things happen. When people wait two and a half years on the diet, I have never seen the problem.

Q: So other fillings that aren't like mercury are just okay? Maybe they pop out if I'm real lucky or something?

A: Yeah. Composites are fine if you've got a huge gap opening. Inlays are good.

Q: And if I've got cavities that don't have fillings now, just eat a good diet and they'll seal up or something?

A: They won't seal up.

Q: So what do I do?

A: I've only seen that in people under 25, under 24. Mine have been doing it because I found a new toothpaste. And for some reason it's even been whitening my teeth. My teeth are all black down here.

Q: What's that called?

A: It's called Aajonus' New Formula. One teaspoon of terramin clay. One teaspoon of coconut cream. And a half a teaspoon of vinegar. And you make like a, you know, put it in a little ounce jar. And that'll be good for, you know, four or five days. When the vinegar gets old, it doesn't work as well.

Q: What kind of vinegar, apple cider vinegar?

A: Usual apple cider vinegar. Mix that together in a little, you know, ounce glass jar. Put it in the refrigerator, keep it in the refrigerator. And then brush your teeth with it once a day only. Your teeth will, I haven't even done it for three months and my teeth still haven't gone back to those, you know, that black, brownish color, yellowish color that was happening before [unintelligible]. Somebody hit me with a crowbar. Tried to mug me in Bangkok for my movie camera. So, it starts whitening the teeth and it also started cleaning out cavities. All of a sudden, tubules started filling in some of my guinea pigs. I have people who are my guinea pigs. They trust me so much, they say, you want to throw an experiment at me? I'm your guinea pig. So, I have about 15 to 20 at a time who will do these things. And it's worked on every one of them.

Q: After how long?

A: Pardon?

Q: After how long did the cavities start filling in?

A: Well, depends upon the person. The first I saw filling in a tubule from a cavity, an old cavity, it was about probably 9 months of brushing once a day. But eating this diet, all the people I do experiments have been on the diet for at least 3 years. Some of them 10, 15 years. Yes?

Q: Dr. Schussler's tissue salts. What do you think about that?

A: It's chemical.

Q: Is it?

A: Those are minerals and proteins extracted. They're not food. Feed them to your plants. Any vitamin supplement you have, any mineral supplement, you want those nutrients extra, you give them to a plant. And then you juice or eat that plant, the food from that plant. Then you'll get those concentrated minerals. That's what plants do. Plants eat rock. They eat minerals. They eat dried substances. That's what they do. They convert it into food for us, for other animals, for us to eat those other animals. Yes?

Q: What about chlorella, like high quality chlorella?

A: Chlorella is good. I've tested chlorella out of all of the algaes. That's the only one I found good. If it's good quality, and if it's not, it's sun-dried, and not kiln-dried, or dried in some other way, with a chemical dry.

Q: I know David Wolfe is really into phytoplankton.

A: Pardon?

Q: David Wolfe is really into phytoplankton. If you're not familiar with that, what do you think about that?

A: You don't look like a fish to me. It takes a fish to digest phytoplankton. If it were working, he'd look a lot better. He's only 32 years old.

Q: Oh, really?

A: Yeah.

Q: Oh, I thought he was in his 40s.

A: That's what he looks like now.

Q: Oh, well.

A: Let me get her first. 

Q: Okay. Skim milk. So, if we take the cream off of the milk that we have, what's the best use? Do we drink that skim milk and replace it with water?

A: That's not a good idea. Make it into a cheese.

Q: Make it into a cheese.

A: Exactly.

Q: So, skim milk cheese is okay. Raw skim milk cheese is okay.

A: Absolutely. Because remember, you're not going to digest it. And if you have a little honey with it, you're going to digest the minerals. That's what we want. Don't worry about the protein and the fats in it. Okay? The whey is very good to relieve stiffness.

Q: Whey is good.

A: So, you can use every part of milk. Every part of milk is a remedy for something. Now, remember, vinegar. If you have a lot of it, it will demineralize the system. But if you have a lot of plaquing in your system, a lot of stiffness, you already have mineral collections in your body. A little bit a day, one teaspoon to one tablespoon a day, in a vegetable juice or in a milk, is going to help you gradually dissolve those plaquings throughout your body.

Q: Does lemon juice and lime juice do the same thing as vinegar?

A: Lemon juice is a fermenter. It encourages bacteria. That's why you marinate foods in it. Lime juice is an antibacterial. I didn't go into any of that here at all, did I? Okay, let's do these. Okay, let's see what this is. Oh, indeed. This is a guy that was told that he was in perfect health. All of his laboratory reports came out perfect. Doctors said there was nothing wrong with him, that it was all in his head. This is a happy, rich kid. Rich family, powerful family out in St. Louis. He had no problems. Company business. Wealthy. Never had to work much. Happy kid. Deteriorating. It's all in his head. Tried every diet named and unnamed. Nothing worked for him. And then this is five and a half months on the diet. 70 pounds. Pretty spectacular. Okay, let me show you...

Q: Do you put lime or lemon juice on the meat?

A: Yes, you can, but there's a little bit of a problem there. Okay, you see this woman? You see how bad this is? If you can't see very well, you might want to come up a little closer.

Q: What is that illness? Injury.

A: This arm right here, her wrist from here to here, was her... You know, you have a blender, and you have the blades, and you don't have the bowl on it. It went on, and it flew off and just tore her to pieces. So all the skin was mangled. She hasn't sent me the first picture yet. It's very ugly. I got to see it, but she hasn't sent it to me. And there's skin just everywhere. And guts everywhere. And the doctor said we can't do anything. We have to just shave everything off, take some meat from there and put it on there. So her son's on the diet. Her son was a very ill person who couldn't get out of bed. He was in his mid-twenties. Big guy. And nobody can help him. So he got on the diet and he's getting better and better every day. And this happens to his mother who's not on the diet. So he called me from England and said, you know, my mother, you know, had this problem. And, you know, her arm's all cut out. They want to do all the surgery. They want to do grafting and all of this. And I said, well, what you do is just take lime juice, squeeze it all in there, let her scream a lot. Tell her to scream a lot, bite on something. Rubber or cloth or something. And get through it. And that'll keep the body from pussing. Then put coconut cream on top of that. Then honey on top of that. And then put thin slices of meat over it. And put a moistened, a coconut cream moistened gauze over that. Some plastic just the size of the gauze over that. And then wrap it and just let it stay for two, five days. Without changing the bandage. Unless you get into a shower or bath and it starts coming off. And the moist gauze and the plastic is to keep the meat from drying out and becoming tight and shrinking. Well, the meat was drying out and becoming tight and shrinking on the third day or during the night, two and a half days later. So I said change it. So this was, the actual event occurred, I think it was July 1st. This is July 15th. This is the 19th. This is the 24th. So you can see the progression here. And this was September 16th. You can barely see any problem. I haven't seen the recent ones. Barely any scar. And usually when you have something like that and don't take care of it, you will have clumps of scar tissue everywhere. But you can see it's all smooth.

Q: Why is that bottom one so white?

A: Pardon?

Q: Why is the newest one so light-colored or white?

A: This one?

Q: Yeah.

A: Well, she wasn't getting out in the sun anymore. If you get closer, it'll look like that. Yeah. But she wasn't getting any sun at all on that. So it was covered. And then the light hit it. And also, you've got a darker background here.

Q: Right.

A: So that's why it looks white. Okay. And then I showed some people the other day the finger. I'm going to show it again for everybody here.

Q: Oh, God.

A: You know the couple I sold? One of the couples I sold those coconut grinding machines.

Q: Oh, God.

A: And their finger went into the grinder. Took off about an eighth to a quarter of an inch of the bone off of that finger and ground it right there. So did the same thing with her lime juice, coconut cream, honey, meat. So this was, I think, two days, four days after it happened. So we don't see the worst of it. Oh, shoot. Got to plug in the hard drive. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes.

Q: They'd like to see this.

A: Oh, they'd like to see this. But I'm going to publish it before I let them have it. Take a minute for it to read.

Q: So are you going to tell us about the difference between lime juice and lemon juice?

A: Pardon?

Q: Are you going to tell us the difference between lime and lemon?

A: Oh, I can do that while this is coming up, can't I? So the lime is an antiseptic. It's an antibacterial. It will surround particles. So your body doesn't have to use the white blood cells to escort the poisons out of the system and the degeneration. When I was in a motorcycle accident, it took all the skin off here and muscle. Shaved the bone, same on the side of the leg. I put lime juice on it, coconut cream. I had asphalt particles. And I shaved, you know, I rubbed the lime juice all over it. And I had, you know, some Thai girls do it. I was screaming and screaming. I couldn't get all that asphalt out of those... The muscles were actually ripped and grazed and all the skin was gone. So it was just too painful to get off. But that lime juice surrounded all those particles. So I didn't have to have... Infection is when the white blood cells are escorting poisons out of a particular area. So you don't have to use white blood cells to do it. The lime juice does it. So I put the meat over it. And in 10 days, all of my skin was [unintelligible]. Pink and [unintelligible]. Only place I had still a little problem was right here. And I've got scars there, because I couldn't bring the lime and the coconut and the cream. I just wanted to see what happened if I let that go. And I got a scar there. No other place on here do I have a scar. But right there, because I left it. If I had just taken care of it for two more days, I wouldn't have the scar there. But I have it. So the lime juice surrounded there. So for about almost a year after, little particles would come out and be built into the skin. I could just peel them off. And little particles of asphalt. The lime juice did that. So it's not coming up, is it?

Q: It seems weird to me that the lime would be that different from the lemon.

A: I don't care what you think. I would think the same thing. Put lime juice on it, you're going to have pus galore. It's been my experiment. Completely different. I mean lemon. Lemon, the pus would go crazy. Lime juice, no pus.

Q: Yeah, so I've got a bunch of lemons and limes on my ranch. I'm not sure exactly which is which all the time.

A: They taste different. They taste very different.

Q: Not here they don't.

A: No? Why?

Q: Lemon breaks things down, right? That's why you use it, because it doesn't have a [unintelligible].

Q: Do you put it in water? You just use your lemon in your water. You put it in water and it'll sit for a while. The intensity of the flavor comes out and becomes better.

A: Oh, I have a newsletter that comes out every two months. So you can subscribe on www.wewant2live.com. And you get all new information like you find out about the toothpaste and a lot of other things. Also you get to see like this article about the finger and how I did it. How I broke my leg and took care of that. How my body made its own cast. I lost my ass at that time. And all of it went to make a cast. A natural cast because I didn't have a cast put on or set or operated on or anything. So here's that finger. Isn't that pretty? And she said, you know, should I have them cut it off evenly? I said, don't do a thing. Just put that stuff on and wrap it. She'll grow another finger. She didn't believe me, but she did it anyway. Because everything else, she was on her deathbed when she started to die. Here's this little finger growing out of this big thing. It was just a month and a half later. Growing out.

Q: How old is she?

A: Fifty-something. And here it is. Let's see, that was three months ago. That's the back side of it. There's a little bit of deformity there. And then from the front, there's a little bit more deformity. But there it is. New finger. With a slight deformity. Diet, and using those things on the wounds. Miracles. Okay guys, we're going to have to wind it up.

Q: Vinegar?

A: Vinegar, whey. Bananas, pineapple. It's in the book, you'll find those. You won't find the vinegar for that, but I found out that works very well. Okay guys, thank you. For those people who want to stay and listen to mini-readings, you're going to learn more if you do. Takes about six to ten minutes per. Yeah, the mini-reading. Okay, we have... Raise your hand if you're getting a mini-reading. One, two, three, four, five, six. Okay, everybody's paid for it? Pardon?

Q: How much is a mini-reading?

A: Oh, we're doing a full reading on you tomorrow. So you have your mini-reading in the full. No. If you're getting a full reading, the mini's already in the full.

Q: Okay.

A: Yeah, you just do it like this, dip it in, you look up, you put it on the bottom. Hold your eye around this. The egg white is the same nutrients as the... almost identical to tears, except there's a little bit more protein. Okay, first I'm going to talk about the glands and the... I need you to... whoever is going to have a reading, when you put your hands in my hand, completely relax it, it can fall into my hand. If I move my hand again, it's going to fall. Let the whole hand relax. Okay, the left ovary is about half the normal size, so it's deteriorating. So you're vegetarian?

Q: Mm-hm.

A: Okay, so more than half of this ovary has been eaten away. So you're not producing very much estrogen from that ovary. The left adrenal gland is okay. The left side of the pancreas is about 65% alive. That's very good. You have a problem with the pancreas, if it's down 10%, you're diabetic. Since you've got a long way to go, so it's pretty good. On this diet it's great, because you're not having a lot of sugars, you're not getting cooked foods, so the pancreas doesn't work hard. So you don't need as much pancreas. Our pancreas are swollen two and a half times more than the caveman, because of all the sugars. Okay, so you have just about exactly what you need for this diet. The left thyroid gland is okay. Parathyroid, poor. The tonsil area, very poor. Relax. The right ovary is in pretty good shape. The right adrenal gland is very watery, waterlogged. Still okay. The right side of the pancreas is also very waterlogged. It's probably 70% alive, so it's still a pretty good pancreas. The right thyroid is very good. Parathyroid is okay. The tonsil area here is not good, but you've got some good lymphatic tissue and activity around the thyroid. This adenoid is not so good. This one is okay. 

Q: Which is this and this? Left and right good, or right and right?

A: Okay, you've got a lot of bile stored throughout your system. A lot of bile. All that yellowish cast? Carrot juice is good for getting rid of that. So I suggest that your vegetable juice be 10% parsley, 10% cilantro, about 15% carrot, about 15% cucumber puree, and the rest celery. Meat-wise I'm going to suggest... You're a medium activity person. I suggest that you have about 60% red meat for a while, and the rest fish or chicken or some kind of seafood or poultry. If you get more sun, you don't need as much red meat. So if you're getting an hour of sun a day, you can cut the red meat all the way down to about 30%. But you need the sun to do that. Also two days a week, instead of a fruit meal in the afternoon, I'd like you to have about six ounces of carrot juice with two ounces of coconut cream and one ounce of dairy cream. If you don't have the dairy cream, use four ounces of milk with that. And you sip that over almost a 20, 30-minute period. Because with the milk in there, it's going to rush the sugars in too fast. If you had the dairy cream in there with the coconut cream, it would slow it down more. So you could do it within 15 minutes. But here you need to stretch this so you don't inundate yourself with sugar. And that will help get rid of that bile. Some of that bile is interfering with a lot of things. You are very fat deficient and waterlogged. So in that bile, your body uses bile to bind with toxins. And there's a lot of metal toxins throughout your system in that bile. So it can cause rashes. It can cause all kinds of problems. When it's coming out, it can cause you to turn really orange. But it's not the carrot juice. A lot of people mistake that. It's not the carrot juice causing the coloring. It is the bile that is coming out through the skin that's causing that orange cast. You've got a lot of fungus growing in your body. And a lot of industrial solvents. When you were a child, did your mother use a lot of Clorox? Mix a lot of detergents. To help remove that, it's a good idea to have half of them, like two days a week. Half of a green mango with a kiwi. About three ounces of coconut cream. Well, let's make it five tablespoons of coconut cream. And either a teaspoon, a half a teaspoon of butter, or a tablespoon of dairy cream. I just have to cut it off the top of your milk to do that. And blend that all together. And then drink that over a 20-minute period. That'll help remove some of those industrial solvents. Also, you can eat berries with coconut cream on some other days of the week as your fruit meals. So you vary those to coconut cream and berries. About three quarters of a cup of berries. Make sure the berries are always organic. So you can't get berries in season when you eat the frozen organic berries. Freezing fruit is okay. Eating frozen fruit is okay.

Now, normally I don't get into characteristics. But you have some characteristics of somebody who tends to be too critical. That's because you're an artist. A lot of artists get bored easily. So you've got a mind that's constantly changing. If you expect other people to keep up with that level of mental change and you're expecting people to satisfy your need for that change, you're always going to be disappointed in yourself. So you just realize that the art you do today has nothing to do with the art you do tomorrow. Because they're going to be like night and day, you cannot cross them over. So you're going to be a very happy person if you can get excited with your new vision every day you wake up. Don't get frustrated with it. See what you can create, because that's what you're supposed to do. You've got a lot of anemia, a lot of poor circulation on the left side of your body. You need a hot water bottle at your left side. You've got a lot of lymphatic congestion, so you need to do those lymphatic baths. And the two days that I didn't tell you what fruit to eat, it's the pineapple and coconut cream for those baths. And I suggest that you eat about 14 ounces by weight of meat a day. It's about two cups of meat a day, a cup at a time, twice a day. And remember, when I say meat, it doesn't mean beef. That means any kind of flesh food. 

Q: Can I ask you one question? This summer I was in a house fire. And one of those mailing containers, a kind of a cellulose, was burning. My daughter and I were laying in bed breathing in smoke for about a half an hour before we woke up. Is there anything in particular that I could do to get that stuff out that I breathed in, that she breathed in?

A: I wouldn't even go near that right now. You go near that and you could throw yourself into chemical sensitivity where it would take you years to recover and you won't be able to function. Take care of your daughter, and your daughter won't be able to function. It's a big risk. So, wait. Don't do this for a couple of years. But what you can do to get rid of it is you can take that solvent mixture they gave you with the mango and the kiwi. You put a half a tablespoon of vinegar in it. And that will help start melting, pulling those polymers out, the BPAs. But don't do it for a couple of years. It's a big risk. I've seen people go into fibromyalgia, unable to be around anything. You know, even water, I mean, the fabric softeners, you set them off. It's a difficult thing to do. So, don't do it for a couple of years.

Q: Thank you.

A: Okay, who's next?

Q: Jump over. Are we taking notes for each other?

A: I think that's a good idea. Well, you have to find a partner. Some volunteers do it great.

[audio cut]

A: I still say things in a way that are contrary to what I mean.

Q: Yeah.

A: And it's so, people can misunderstand me so many times. Terrible. Okay, let me see both palms. Let them go limp. Okay, you also have a tremendous amount of bile throughout your system. See all the yellow?

Q: I always thought it was some carotene.

A: Pardon?

Q: I always thought it was some carotene.

A: Nope, that's bile. You've been using bile to bind with toxins. Biles to digest fats that bind with toxins, not the other way around.

Q: Okay.

A: So, when it meets with the toxins, it becomes more caustic. And it's harder to gain weight. You need a lot of cream. You don't know where you're going to get it, but you need to drink a lot of cream.

Q: Yep.

A: And you also need the carrot juice. So, two days a week, I suggest that you drink eight ounces of carrot juice with five tablespoons of coconut cream, one table, two tablespoons of dairy cream. For you, I'm going to suggest about a quarter of a teaspoon of vinegar in that. And one and a half tablespoons of honey in yours. And you have to sip that over a 20-25 minute period. Two days in the afternoon a week in place of your fruit for those two days. Now, let's go over the glands. Okay, the left testis is in okay shape. About 23% of it is hardened like leather, dried out. The left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape, but shrunken a little bit. The left side of the pancreas is only about 25% alive. Still has to be 10 to be a real problem. The right thyroid is in pretty good shape. Parathyroid is fair. Tonsil area is very poor. The right testis is in pretty good shape. The right adrenal gland is dehydrating. Maybe a lot of fats in there. But it's still functional. The right side of the pancreas is only about 10% alive. So your pancreas is really degenerated. Another reason you don't gain weight easily. So I suggest you get some pancreas. Eat some pancreas. I don't care what animal it's from, it doesn't matter. If you could get it from a pig, it would probably work better. We're built much like a pig. I didn't get into any bacteria or fungus or virus or any of that parasite. But I've got that in my books. On my website, if you join, subscribe, you can read all about that stuff. Okay, the thyroid gland, the right thyroid gland is pretty good. Parathyroid is fair. Tonsil area is very poor. Poor circulation and very drying of tissue all through the stomach and the upper part of the small intestines. Drying all around your heart. I'm going to suggest that you do two lubrication formulas a day. You're very close to losing your heart. See how sucked in and dry that is? That's where your heart is, right there. You see the heart right there, see that little bump right there? Yeah, you should not be able to see the outline of it. It's a little swollen, it's not dented. This right here is all caved in. So all the tissue around it is dry. So your heart attack will come to happen. So you need a lubrication formula in there. Put a hot water on your left side or your right side. Probably your right side would be better. Put a hot water bottle right here, put a towel over this way. Or a silk shawl, keep the heat in. Anytime you use heat, it forces circulation into that area. Circulation means improved nutrients flow to that area. Anytime you've got an injury, you don't use ice. Unless it's for a few moments to numb the pain. No more than two minutes, everything should be heat. Otherwise, you will restrict the circulation to that area. You're going to scar and be like all athletes who lose the ability of those limbs.

Q: Now, is that shoe the same on this side?

A: There's no heart problem. But you should have, along here, along the esophagus. The other side of the esophagus, the right side, yes, it's very dry. But not on the inside where the heart is. I'm going to suggest that you do mainly fish and chicken. Probably 30% red meat. And your vegetable juice. I suggest about 20% parsley. 5% cilantro. 15% carrot. 15% cucumber puree. And the rest, celery. I'll suggest that you eat 4 days a week... Make that 3 days a week, about a cup of raspberries. With about 6 tablespoons of coconut cream. 1 tablespoon of dairy cream. Or a half a teaspoon of butter. 2 days a week I like you to have dark berries. Blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries. Half a cup of that with a half a cup of raspberries. The same amount of coconut cream, dairy cream or butter. And you said frozen berries are ok. As long as they're organic berries. And then 2 days a week you're going to have the carrot juice. And the creams that I suggested. And then 1 day a week have whatever fruit that you're inspired by. Because you've got a lot of lymphatic congestion, there probably should be pineapple. You know, do the hot baths. If you gain weight, you only do 1 hot bath a week. You can do 35-40 minute baths to get out of your connective tissue. But to melt that out of the lymph system you need more weight to be doing it 2 days a week. Ok? Alright?

Q: Thank you.

A: You're very welcome. 3 days for the raspberries, 2 days for the combination of berries. 2 days for the... That's 7 days, isn't it? 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. Ok, so 2 days other, which could be the pineapple. No, 2 days are the carrot juice. So you're going to have to reduce that dark berry, I mean the raspberries, to 2 days. And then 1 day, yeah, 2 days with raspberries. 2 days for carrots, and then 1 for whatever other fruit pineapple mixed. And then 1 day would be pineapple. Pineapple, correct. Yours is pretty good. Yeah, yours is really good.

[chatter]

A: Ok, let your hands fall in. You drink a shit load of water.

Q: Funny you should say that.

A: Look at all that. Look at all this water. Just everywhere in your tissues. And it's not in the cells. You're bloated with 60% excess water, you're not even fat. You don't even have enough fat on your body. You're fat deficient. Ok, the left ovary is about 50% dried because of all the water. The left thyroid, I mean the left adrenal gland is 60% water. It's ok though, it's still functional. The left side of the pancreas, maybe 15% functional, getting close to diabetes. Left thyroid, very good. Parathyroid is very good. The left parathyroid is good. The tonsil area is poor, but you have good lymphatic activity in its place. And the right ovary is also 50% deteriorated from water, but it's not dehydrated, it's not dry. The right adrenal gland is also very water-logged, but it's functional, better than the left. The right side of the pancreas is about 25% functional. It's a little bit better than the other side, so you're not diabetic yet. And it looks like you're going to reverse it. You're going to take care of yourself.

Q: Absolutely, that's what I'm going to do.

A: The right thyroid is pretty good. Parathyroid, excellent. That's the way all of them should be. You see the way that's jumping out there? That's the way all of them should be. The tonsil here doesn't look like it's very active, but the lymph glands around it are pretty good. Now, see all this white splotching everywhere? All lymphatic congestion.

Q: I find that comes and goes.

A: No, that doesn't.

Q: All the time?

A: No.

Q: But sometimes my hands are splotchy like this, and other times they're not splotchy like this.

A: Yeah, but when you have that much, you've got lymphatic congestion everywhere in your system. So, with your fat deficiency, you have all that water, you need to perspire it out of there, replace it with fat, do those lymphatic baths. Okay? Meat-wise, you're in between, you're a little bit anemic, so you need at least 50% red meat, I'm going to say 60% for three months, cut it down to 50% after that. After about nine months, you can cut it down to 40%. And you could have chicken or fish as your major meat in your life.

Q: Seafood, okay.

A: Seafood, fish, yeah.

Q: Yeah, but I mean like, what do you call those, mollusks?

A: They are fine, oysters, clams, all those are great.

Q: Not shrimp.

A: Shrimp in clean waters is good, as long as they're not farmed. Yeah, some of them are farmed, some of them aren't right now. But you can go out here and seine your own. I could do, but I haven't yet. Just give a seine. I know they're illegal, but I used to sneak out on the beach and get them anyway. A lot of water all along your spine, those sides, especially the left side. Quite an imbalance in your back. If you're a massage therapist, that's all I have to say. You'd be in a lot of pain, a lot of trouble, because you're exercising in the back, moving your hands. That water would collect without abatement. You'd be having some serious problems. So you're dehydrating and drying out your intestinal tract. Water dehydrates the body. It does not hydrate the system. We've got a wrong word that they directly misled you. You don't think of hydration. Don't think of filling yourself with water. You fill yourself with fat. 

Q: Would that be part of dryness, perhaps?

A: Yes.

Q: Because I come from Arizona.

A: Yeah, and you drink a lot of water. But you're not holding it like she is. It's dissolving her body. Yours is just drying out. Do you need to turn those over again? So you need to do those lymphatic baths twice a week. Every day you need to do the short ones, five 40-minute baths to perspire that stuff out of your system. Fruit-wise, pineapple, two days, three days. Do it every other day. Do pineapple with coconut cream every other day. How tall are you?

Q: About 5'6.

A: Okay. So do about 6 ounces by volume of pineapple. Do 4 1⁄2 tablespoons of coconut cream and 1 tablespoon of dairy cream that you like to cut off the top of your milk, put in there. Get a little bit of cheese with that milk because it's a little bit of fish oil and fat. Get a little honey with the cheese so you get some of that fat that's missing by taking off the cream. And then, so that's every other day. So you've got two to three days a week with, you know, solvents all over. Do you paint? Did you ever paint? Take some kind of solvent. Oh, it could be an atmospheric...

Q: I live here.

A: What do you call it?

Q: A bog.

A: Bog, yeah.

Q: Yeah, I believe that.

A: Okay, so have... Just one day a week do this because you could throw it off too fast. You don't have enough fat on your body. Half of a mango, green mango. Kiwi. Four tablespoons of coconut cream. I rather that you have your butter, but if you don't have butter, add some cream. About a teaspoon of dairy cream or a quarter of a teaspoon of butter. I like it to have one and a half tablespoons of honey in that. Blend it all together and you sip that over a twenty, twenty-five minute period. That's a fruit, one fruit for the week. Do carrot juice one day a week. Only four and a half ounces as a fruit meal. And about three tablespoons of coconut cream. Two tablespoons of dairy cream. And a tablespoon of honey. Take fifteen, twenty minutes to drink that.

Q: How much coconut juice?

A: Coconut cream.

Q: What kind of coconut juice you say?

A: Coconut cream.

Q: I'm sorry, carrot juice.

A: Carrot juice.

Q: Four and a half ounces.

A: Four and a half ounces. Okay, you have that same personality characteristic as the last person who was here. Yours is worse than hers.

Q: I've been around longer. Come on, give me a break.

A: So, just remember it's to keep your mind entertained. Nobody's going to entertain you the way you can. You'll be disappointed in everybody. Yeah, yours is quite a bit worse than hers. 

Q: I come by it justly. You should know my parents.

A: They may have had the same trait. And you need about 14 ounces of meat a day. It's about two cups a day, a cup at a time. You could be a person to get away with doing it in the afternoon, but make sure it's after your fruit meal. So, no later than 4 o'clock. Or no earlier than 4 o'clock.

Q: The meat.

A: Yeah.

Q: My second meat.

A: In really hot times of the year you probably won't be able to do it. Do it morning and late. Okay.

Q: Thank you.

A: Thank you.

[audio cut]

A: What do you do?

Q: What do I do?

A: Work.

Q: Lots of different things. Work with beneficial bacteria, gardening, farming, using heavy equipment, cleaning.

A: Cleaning. I was wondering why you got so stiff.

Q: Oh, I've been climbing around all day. I've been training.

A: Let your hands relax completely. Okay. Now you just have the same kind of waterlogging that she had. You're doing a lot of water. Even more than she had. The left testis is okay, even though it's heavily waterlogged. The adrenal gland is still okay. It's almost like you're keeping the water just outside the glands. So the outsides of the glands are drying up. The left side of the pancreas. I see you've got a little bit more fat on you. So that's helpful. So about 30% of the left side of your pancreas is good. Left thyroid is excellent. Parathyroid, excellent. Tonsil area, poor. Working hard. You've got lots of activity here. The right testis is about only 40% alive, very waterlogged. The right adrenal gland's in pretty good shape. It's not holding the water like the other side of the body. The right side of the pancreas is probably only 10% alive. So you've got more over here than there. So you're still not diabetic. You're moving toward that. The right thyroid is a little weak and waterlogged. The parathyroids are pretty good. Tonsillary is very weak and waterlogged. Now is this dirt from your work?

Q: Yeah, this is from today.

A: Because it looks like surface. It doesn't look penetrated. You've got good red blood cells. White blood cells are okay. So you can do whatever meat you like. Whatever you feel like having is okay. You have a slight tendency...

Q: Sausages are okay?

A: No, no, no, wrong.

Q: Just tell him. Just tell him that, please.

A: You can make sausage raw. You get those herbs that they use to make the sausage. And you grind your meat in a food processor with those herbs. And you've got yourself the same case. Only it'll be better for you in case bets. And it won't back up on you and you won't have bad gas. Like those things create. A little bit more red meat. Even though you're outside a lot, are you? You're not getting and absorbing the sun very well. So you need butter, more butter than cream. You need a lot of butter. I would say at least one lubrication formula a day. And you can split it up into two. Half of it with your first meat meal and half with the second. And you need about a pound of meat a day. To get rid of all that water, I'm going to suggest that you do about 10 to 12 eggs a day. That's going to make you feel like you're dehydrating. Take some coconut cream, you rub it on your lips, or honey. Remember that mouth drying out? That's all those toxins leaving from the brain, drawing all the fats out of the mouth. That is not dehydration. That dry mouth is fat, is lipid deficient. So you put honey as a good absorbable fat right into the skin. So does coconut cream. Sometimes butter is a little acidic and it will cause some blisters or cracking. So it's better to have the coconut cream or the honey. And then put a little bit in your mouth and just let it stay there. And that takes care of that dry mouth. That is not dehydration. And everybody takes it as dehydration. And you can definitely use that sport formula. Try to get it from Keeler or somebody. I gave out earlier. Cucumbers are good for you. You should eat cucumbers all day long. That's in the sport formula. You blend it and puree. Fruit-wise... Every other day have grapefruit or pomelo. Have a half of a grapefruit. Do you want to have a whole? Well, you're outside working a lot. Okay, so you can have a whole grapefruit. Half of a pomelo. With about... Four tablespoons of coconut cream. A tablespoon of honey with that. And two tablespoons of cream. You can have that with some of the grapefruit. You eat the grapefruit, don't juice it. You peel it, you know, to get the buds out of it. But you might want to keep the white in there if you don't want to. But don't juice it. There's a lot of bioflavonoids that you need to help get rid of this water retention. And grapefruit and pomelo help get rid of excess water. Don't want you to do it too fast. So I've given you a diet for you not to handle it too fast. He's got swollen puffy all over. So, he needs to lose it faster. So you can drink that, you know, the fats in between eating the sections of the grapefruit or the pomelo. Do that every other day.

Q: I lost, I think, along with the grapefruit or pomelo, 4 tablespoons of coconut cream, 1 tablespoon of honey and... 

A: 2 tablespoons of dairy cream. You mix the coconut cream, the dairy cream and the honey together. You need to spoon that out or drink it while you're eating the section. You could drink that whole fat thing first if you like, and then eat the fruit. Other days, I suggest one day with about 6 ounces of carrot juice, with 2 ounces of coconut cream, and cheese, I'd like you to have about 4 ounces of cheese with that. And you have 2 days left for fruit, I think. I'd like you to have cheese and coconut cream with orange. And you eat those eggs in between everything. Have to get rid of that water. 

Q: Is there anything happening with the kidney or liver? [unintelligible]

A: I wouldn't worry about that. Because the kidney is not shrunken or dried out. It's a little water-logged and a little dry. But you don't really have a kidney problem. You're just retaining too much water. Remember, the doctors and the pharmaceutical houses are all here to get you to take something.

Q: These are all naturopaths.

A: It doesn't matter. They're all trained by medical profession. They want you to take something. And let me tell you, the grapefruit is the best thing you can do for the kidney. But your kidneys are not in bad shape. It's just a lot of water in your cellular system. You're overworking them, but you're not in bad shape.

Q: Anything for those tonsils?

A: Pardon?

Q: Anything for those tonsils?

A: Do you have tonsils? Because this is a beautiful tonsil here. It's all water-logged. Everything's water-logged, so it's not working as well. So those eggs and that grapefruit are going to help take care of that, or pomelo. Those will help you get rid of water quicker. Okay? Meat-wise, I said how much meat to eat, right?

Q: Yeah, a pound a day.

A: There you go. A pound a day of meat is about two and a half cups a day. Two and a quarter, two and a half cups a day equals a pound a day.

[audio cut]

A: Great. Okay. Very long-term vegetarian?

Q: Mm-hmm.

A: You're definitely not a cooked fooder either. Relax. The left ovary is only about 20% present or alive. Pretty much deteriorated, shrunken. Left adrenal gland is okay, but waterlogged. The left side of the pancreas? 70% alive, that's very good. Left thyroid is okay, parathyroid is very poor. Tonsil area are very poor. The right ovary? Is about 40% alive. The right adrenal gland is waterlogged, but it's okay. The right side of the pancreas? Is about 40% alive, that's very good. Right thyroid is very poor, parathyroid is very poor, tonsil area are very poor. You've got lymphatic congestion and poor circulation everywhere in the torso. Lymphatic congestion all over is blocked. You still have some purple cast in there, so you have some good growth hormones. Helps you heal faster, but it's planted in different areas, it's not consistent. But it's certainly enough to recuperate pretty fast. You've got some very damaged kidneys, especially the right one. And that's waterlogged, drinking too much water. The left kidney is a little bit better. Red blood cell count is okay, white blood cell count is berries in the body. If you were healthy, I would say that you could live on chicken and fish. But because you have some signs of weak cells all over in the body, I'm going to suggest that you have about 30% red meat. And you only have a little bit of red meat at a time. Let's say you have an ounce of red meat twice a day. And the rest, you know, fish or chicken. But you need a little bit of red meat to bring you out of it. Because a lot of your red blood cells are not carrying oxygen well. They're very deficient. So you need the red meat to help you. Okay, fruit wise. You've got a lot of toxic iron. Did you take iron supplements?

Q: No.

A: In your whole life?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Did your mother cook in cast iron?

Q: I don't think so.

A: Could it have been water? Sure you didn't take a one-day vitamin or something?

Q: No, I didn't take anything at all.

A: No, when you were a child?

Q: No, not really.

A: Where did you get all this iron? Okay. I'd like you to have about... Have about a little bit more than three quarters of a cup of raspberries. Raspberries help get rid of iron, aluminum, and zinc, and some of those other toxic metals that are in the body. So raspberries with about, for a while, three and a half tablespoons of coconut cream. As you put on weight, you can add another half a tablespoon at a time, let's say every two months, until you get up to about, let's say five and a half tablespoons of coconut cream at a time for the fruit meal. That'll help pull some of that out of there. It's lucky to have two lubrication formulas a day when you can afford it and do it with the butter. That means a good stick of butter a day, that's four ounces for each. But what you can do is when you have it, you make one big 12-ounce lubrication formula instead of making two once a day. And they'll last 24 hours, unless you keep them in a very hot place. They'll start fermenting, but still digest even a little faster. It just doesn't taste as good. So you can make it and keep it in a cool place, but do not refrigerate anything that has eggs in it. So I'm going to give you your lubrication and moisturizing formula.

Q: Don't refrigerate anything that has eggs in it?

A: Eggs in it, yes. Never refrigerate eggs. And don't refrigerate anything after you put eggs in it.

Q: Except for ice cream, though.

A: Except for ice cream, but that's a very...

Q: Like 24 hours, right?

A: Yeah, but I say don't really do that. That's the worst you can do. You know, it's better as soon as you make it to eat it. Okay, moisturizing formula for you will be four and a half tablespoons of butter. One and a half tablespoons of lemon juice. One and a quarter teaspoon of honey. And one egg. So double that to make a double formula, okay? And I would like you to break that up into fifths. So you have like two and a half ounces at a time, five times a day. So have it with, you know, a fifth of... With, you know, a fifth of it with your first meat meal. Then with right, maybe an hour before your fruit meal. And then again with your meat meal. Then again with some milk before you go to sleep. Or an egg. And then during the night, again your last fifth. Okay? I want to keep your body lubricated every hour of the day. Okay? I'm really afraid for you to have fruit. Except for those berries. You can have those every other day. Other days... Eat cucumber or have that sport drink. Did you write the formula? You can have that. It's a better thing to have. You can have as much milk as you want. Load up on milk. Sip it all day long. You need to be very nourished like a baby. I think that those growth hormones are going to start spreading. And you'll start invigorating that so you can heal faster.

Q: Does that happen when there's a transition?

A: It's that purple stuff all through there. You see purple spots all the way through there. That shows me you have good growth hormones in specific areas. A lot of people that are as thin as you will have whole purple areas showing they have a lot. So I know they're going to rebound quickly. They're not going to rebound as fast as those people will. But I'm hoping that your hormones will increase as soon as you get that moisturizing formula. You're assessing what they need. The hormones.

Q: Can you explain what you do for the full blown thing like that tomorrow?

A: I photograph the irises. Blow them up. We can take a pin prick and blow it up that big. So I can tell you what chemicals are in your body. What systems are affected. The worst places in your body. I direct your detoxification on what I see there. Which are the most common problem areas in the body. And then we'll give you a specific diet. How much to have all day long. Of what amounts with foods. So it's absolutely a diet that you follow to the T. If you want to.

Q: And how long did you follow that diet for?

A: For a year and then you do a follow-up? Sometimes they last up to a year and a half, two years. But, like I say, the body goes through its changes. You go into the book and you adjust what I've told you to take. For what's happening. If you need help, give me a call and I'll tell you what to do. And then you go back to the diet that I've suggested. For as long as it works. Usually you work for two to two and a half years. Unless I've stipulated to somebody, you have to change in three months, six months, nine months, something like that. 

Q: Do we need to record that?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do we have to record what we just did? The readings, the long readings?

A: Oh, yes. Absolutely. They have to be recorded. Now, you're not going to remember everything I say in 70 minutes.

Q: Right.

A: Okay? You finished?

[audio cut]

Q: Do you want me to talk to you?

A: War of the worlds.

Q: Do you want me to read as well?

Q: You've got this.

Q: Yeah, if you want, but I'll have to record you. Well, it's raining, so I'll tell you what.

A: What's your name?

Q: Brian.

A: Good. Okay, the left testicle is very weak and debilitated. If you talk, he's not going to pick this up from you. Okay? It's very weak and debilitated, a lot of water in there. You're drinking too much water. The adrenal gland is the same way. It's all puffy with water. It's still functional. The left side of the pancreas. It's about 50% alive. That's pretty good. Not quite 50. The left thyroid is okay. Parathyroid is pretty good. Tonsil area atrocious. The right testicle is in pretty good shape. About 20% waterlogged. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. The right side of the pancreas. It's only about 15-20% alive. The right thyroid is okay. Parathyroid is pretty good. Tonsil area is fair. It doesn't look like you have a tonsil, but you've got good lymph glands all around there working in place of it. You have smoke tars everywhere in your body.

Q: What is that?

A: Smoke tars.

Q: Smoke tars?

A: Yeah. Did your parents smoke?

Q: No. Well, my mom did before I was born.

A: There you go. Transferred them right into you. And man, that's been a major part of your problems your whole life. Smoke tars. And they are hardened all throughout your system, everywhere. So your mother stopped smoking when she got pregnant with you?

Q: Before, I think, but yeah.

A: And just started dumping them all. See, that's what happens when a person stops smoking. They start dumping the tars. And if they're pregnant or nursing, that's where they will go, right into the baby. So it looks like you've been a lifetime smoker.

Q: Wow.

A: This whole area is damaged. Your intestines, your back is damaged, especially the left side. And you need to get some tobacco, green tobacco. You can grow it here. You juice it, you ferment it. You add lemon juice and a little bit of vinegar to it. Let's say you have 12 ounces of juiced tobacco. And you put, let's say, a teaspoon of lemon juice in that, and you add a teaspoon of vinegar in it. And you let it ferment out of the refrigerator for several weeks. Take the top off. You might want to put it in a 16-ounce jar with 12 ounces of tar, of the tobacco juice. And then let it air once in a while. And then let it ferment until it's sizzling, until it's gassing. Then refrigerate it. Half of a teaspoon every four days in a vegetable juice. And you will detox heavily.

Q: In a vegetable juice?

A: In a vegetable juice. Don't take it alone.

Q: Every three days, you say?

A: Yeah. And in that vegetable juice, I would like you to have a whole tablespoon of vinegar, that you have with that. In your vegetable juice, I'm going to recommend 15% parsley, 5% cilantro, 20% carrot, about 30% celery, and the rest, cucumber puree. [sneeze] It's this carpet.

Q: It's mold and everything.

A: Meat-wise, mostly white meat. Maybe 20% red, 15% red is all you need. Red blood cells are pretty strong, pretty good. Very poor circulation in your intestines. So I'd sleep with a hot water bottle. Just remember, when you're using a hot water bottle, don't put it on and put the pressure on. You put it on the sides. You put it on the front to let the heat go in. Put a towel somewhere in that area. You don't put it on top of someone and block the circulation on top of that area and block the circulation with the heavy pressure of the hot water bottle. Now, you look like you'll heal very rapidly even though you have all those smoke tars in there. It's almost like your body is mutated into being able to handle some of those smoke tars. But it's caused some of the emotional distraction that you've had in your lifetime. Your physical body seems to handle it okay. But the nervous system hasn't. That right middle lobe and left middle lobe haven't handled it very well either. And you've got a huge spot of it in your right bowel. The ascending colon right about here. You might have some trouble there once in a while. Right below the liver. Off out to the right side.

Q: This is tars, you're talking about?

A: Tars, smoke tars, yep. You weren't around any other smoke? Some of it looks fresher than passed from your mother.

Q: I'm a painter. I don't know if that has anything to do with it.

A: You use oil paints?

Q: I just did a paint job with oil paints. I don't usually.

Q: How about around campfires?

A: Campfires will do it too.

Q: I've done some of those, yeah.

A: Some of those are the worst, because people will use walnut.

Q: Oh yeah, the creosote and all that stuff.

Q: Treated wood without realizing there's poison in it.

A: Well, even just wild wood, like walnut, with all that oil in it, turns into a tar.

Q: So any highly, like conifers, all those?

A: It's a vegetable oil. We don't handle vegetable oils. So you could also do half of a green mango with, say, one and a half kiwi for you. About two tablespoons of honey. Five tablespoons of coconut cream. For you, I'm going to recommend butter, for the heavier oils, rather than the dairy cream. So about one and a half teaspoons to a tablespoon of butter. And I'm going to recommend you put a tablespoon of lime juice in there. And blend that all together. And pour that mixture into three ounces of sparkling mineral water. Perrier, San Pellegrino, Apollinaris, one of those. Apollinaris is my favorite. It's a better water. If you're going to do that. Remember, don't pour the water into the mixture, the mixture into the water. It's going to foam up like a float. And it's going to be delicious, but do not suck it down. You have to take 20-25 minutes to drink it. Or else you'd get nauseous and vomit or have diarrhea. You know, and start pulling that stuff out, those oils. Did you wear a mask? Anytime you do an oil painting job, you've got to use an Israeli gas mask with canisters on it. You can't get around that stuff.

Q: Most, some of the time, half the time I wear a mask.

A: With canisters or just a regular old red can?

Q: With canisters.

A: Good, okay. But some of it got through because I can see it. It's already caused a rash in your lungs and in your chest. In your diaphragm, even in your brain. Mostly on the right side. You might start getting headaches or a little heaviness on the right side. Cream will help with that. Cheese, eat cheese all day long. Little sugar cube sized amounts every half hour to 45 minutes to an hour. Keep pulling it out. Vinegar will also help. So, you know, have a tablespoon of vinegar with a vegetable juice every day. I'm going to recommend that you have a good three cups of meat a day. So it's a cup and a half twice daily. And a lubrication formula. You can make one and a half of those and then break it into thirds. A third with each meat meal and a third in the middle of the night. So you're protected. And in your lubrication formula I'm going to recommend you use a half a teaspoon of vinegar. Along with the lemon juice. Let me give you a formula for your lubrication formula. I'd like you to have seven and a half tablespoons. This is for the whole one and a half worth. Seven and a half tablespoons of butter. Three eggs. Two tablespoons of, make it one and three quarters tablespoons of lemon juice, not lime. And one tablespoon of honey. And a half a teaspoon of vinegar. Blend it all together. Remember when you're making a moisturizing lubrication formula, you leave all the ingredients out the night before. Let it become room temperature. Blend it all together in the morning. If the butter is still too cold and it clumps and doesn't disperse evenly, then you have to immerse it in a bowl of hot water for about two, three minutes and then re-blend it. After it's all dispersed properly and it gets cold again and chilled and starts firming, that's okay. Because it's already dispersed properly. Raspberries and blueberries, mixture half a cup of each with about four and a half tablespoons of coconut cream. One and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. And about a pea sized amount of butter. You can blend that all together into like a parfait because the pectin in the berries will cause it to firm. Or you can whip the fats into like a whipped cream and have the berries whole. The berries have to be organic, so if you can't get them fresh and organic, get the frozen organic berries. Okay.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: [unintelligible]

[audio cut]

A: Always digest first. That makes everything bitter. When you add a starter, those villi, Fiji, or whatever those are, the different ones, they always have an excessive amount of acidophilus to digest the sugars instead of, you know, the fats first. Okay, let me see your hands.

Q: Are they trying to throw us out still?

A: We're finished right now.

Q: Okay, the whole system shuts down around 10ish.

A: What time is it?

Q: 9.25.

A: Oh my gosh.

Q: I didn't have the lights to go out then. Do you want flashlights?

A: Well, no, we're almost finished. Probably ten minutes.

Q: Okay, it's not an automatic system.

A: Relax. You're the last one, right?

Q: Do you want me to write something or are you getting recorded?

A: He's recording it, but do you want him to write to?

Q: It's alright, I got it.

A: Interesting. Okay, the left... Okay, we need silence here so this will record. The left adrenal gland is quite dry, I mean, testis is quite dry. And it's somewhat shrunken, but it's okay. Left adrenal gland is pretty good. Left side of the pancreas. It's a good 70% alive, that's good. The left thyroid is poor, parathyroid is very good. Tonsil area, very poor. Relax. The right testis is in very good shape. About... probably 20% debilitated. Left... right adrenal gland is a little waterlogged, but it's okay. The right side of the pancreas. Very poor circulation under there, very cold. So it's not working very well. It's about 40% alive, but only working by about 10-12%. You need to put a hot water bottle at your left side over here. Every night, stimulate circulation into that pancreas. The right thyroid is okay, parathyroid poor. Parathyroid is on the lighter poor. And the tonsil area over here is okay. Red blood cell, okay. White blood cell, very contaminated. Did you deal with chemicals? 

Q: Yeah, like in the hospital.

A: Yeah, wherever you got lots of chemicals all over in your system. Wow. So you need the half of a green mango. How tall are you?

Q: 6'1".

A: One and a half kiwi, kiwis. And about one and a half tablespoons of honey. Make it four and a half tablespoons of coconut cream. One tablespoon of dairy cream. One tablespoon of butter. Blend that all together, pour that into two and a half ounces of sparkling mineral water. Take about 20-25 minutes to drink it. Juice-wise, I'm going to suggest about 7% cilantro, about 10% parsley, about 30% carrot. About 20% celery and the rest cucumber puree. Two days a week in place of a fruit meal. You could do the mango and kiwi two days a week. Make sure at least three days apart. And two days with carrot juice. Four to six ounces of carrot juice. Five tablespoons of coconut cream. Make it three tablespoons of dairy cream. And one tablespoon of honey. Make sure you take 20 minutes to drink that. Even 25, even 30 minutes. I'd like you to have a half a teaspoon of vinegar in that mango stuff. Mango mixture. On the rest of the days of the week for your fruit meal. I like you to have three quarters of a cup of dark berries, blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries. And one quarter of a cup... Okay, change that, make that two thirds of a cup of dark berries and one third of a cup of raspberries. Strawberries if you get the small ones. The hybrid ones don't work. With about four tablespoons of coconut cream. One and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. And you can whip that into a whipped cream and have the berries whole with it or you can blend it all together in a parfait. Meat wise you need about two and a half cups a day, so one and a quarter cups twice daily. There are a lot of signs of anemia right now, so I'm going to suggest about 70% red meat, 30% white, mainly fish. And you need one of those sport drinks almost every day and lots of milk. Eggs, not so important. You're going to have them in your lubrication formula. Do one lubrication formula a day. Break it up into half, half with each meal. I'm going to put that in. Okay. While you can get them, get some cranberries right now. Freeze them. One day a week, I'd like you to take a half a cup of cranberries with two tablespoons of honey, three and a half tablespoons of coconut cream, a tablespoon of butter, and about, let's say, two and a half teaspoons of vinegar. So you're going to have a cranberry sauce, but it's sauce only for itself. It's going to be in a fruit meal, as a fruit meal, one day a week. So you're going to need to freeze about a half a cup of raspberries for one day a week. So you've got 52 weeks in a year. Of course, two months and you'll be able to get them. For ten months a year, half a cup of raspberries one day, you know, once a week. So let's say you've got 45, you know, half cups. So you're looking at 22, 23 cups of cranberries, I would phrase. It will help you with some or more of these poisons that are in your system. Okay?

Q: I'm missing my spleen though, and my appendix, so it's special.

A: Boy, you... Well, the appendix is a library of any bacteria or any foreign objects that's been in your body. So your body has to reanalyze everything every time. When you have an appendix, something comes into the body, usually in 40 minutes your body has an antidote for it. And us, without appendixes, could take 30 hours, 36 hours before we respond properly for it. Spleen means you better not get an accident, you better not bleed. You better have plenty of clothes to keep you warm, an easy way to strip them off, to get cool. So you're missing your gallbladder, so bile, so you can't eat a lot of fat at one time, you have to eat it all day long. Keep up with your liver.

Q: Thank you.
