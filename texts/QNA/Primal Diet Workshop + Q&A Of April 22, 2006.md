A: Africans and your Asians, the Africans especially [unintelligible]. The skin is a bigger bowel than your actual intestinal bowel. Discharges more toxicity with perspiration than it does out your bowel with a movement. So, what have we covered? We haven′t covered the intestinal tract. The intestinal tract is where you take your food and you break it down. You get elements, smaller particles that can be combined in many different ways, myriads of ways. Your stomach first secretes hydrochloric acid, and that′s best for digesting animal foods, especially proteins and meats. It dissolves it. Food goes into the duodenum. The duodenum is where the liver dumps bile to start breaking down and disassembling the fat so that you can synthesize 60 varieties of cholesterol. Cholesterols are all good. LDL, HDL, it doesn′t matter. They are all good. They want to confuse you. First it was all cholesterol is bad. Now they don′t want you to feel they are complete assholes. They will say, well, you know, we got it half right. These are bad and these are good. It doesn′t work that way. They are all good. All those cholesterols are good. Those that store in the body are very important for protecting you. They absorb poisons so they don′t get into your cells. So you got a third of the fats that will lubricate your body and protect it. Absorb poisons. You got a third that will give you energy. And you got a third that will cleanse your body of poisons. They make solvents like soaps that clean the system. Also, your pancreas secretes a lot of missing enzymes if there′s something missing in the food. And it needs to be corrected. There′s an imbalance. The pancreas secretes these combinations and dumps them into the duodenum. If you′re eating cooked foods, the pancreas has a lot of work to do. It has to make hormones and it sends out like thugs to every cell in the body and say, Hey, I need some of your vitamins and your metals and your enzymes and your protein and carbs. I just need a few cents. But that happens every time you eat a cooked diet, a cooked food. So you′re robbing from your bank account every time you do that. So as you get older, your bank account is getting lower and lower. Because it′s robbing. It readjusts them. The pancreas sends it into the duodenum. It starts to make [unintelligible]. So you start to digest it. When you eat a cooked food, do you know what happens? A condition called leukocytosis. It only happens if you eat cooked food. White blood cells leave the blood. The blood system, it goes right into the intestines. Now what is the job of white blood cells? They arrest toxins. They're mainly fat. They mainly consist of fat. Eighty percent of it is fat. White blood cells. Fat. Eighty percent fat. What does fat do? It protects the body. 

So the white cells go in and start arresting things. They call them antibodies. So the white cells arrest these toxins and hold them until the body can change its chemistry or locks onto them and passes out the bowels. Mostly they're reabsorbed after they hold on and do a little bit of the work. And then you move down. Hypochloric acid is secreted all through the small intestines. So even if you don't have much in your stomach, you can still digest the meat all the way through. [unintelligible]. Now, a dog or a cat, dogs and cats, felines and canines, have hydrochloric acid 15 times stronger than ours in their stomach. But they don't secrete much throughout the small intestines. We secrete just as much as they do, but we do it from the stomach and intestines, majorly from the small intestines, which is why I can digest meat and not have hydrochloric acid in my stomach. So as meat passes through and the fats, most of the fats and the juices and the enzymes are all digested in the small intestine. Then it moves into the bowels. This is where the final stage of protein digestion occurs. And it occurs because E. coli are in there. The bowel is where you synthesize, where the body synthesizes the myriads of B vitamins. And you can't do it without meat. That's why vegans have such a problem with B12 and other vitamins. Not just B12, that's the one they advertise. That's the one that gets so low. But all of the B vitamins. E. coli is so important for that digestion of meats. Their excrement is your vitamin B and your amino acids. They eat up this stuff, pre-digest it for you. That's the bacterial environment. You have Acidophilus, you have Calcoaceticus, you have Bulgaricus, all these other bacteria in the small intestine that are doing the same thing. They are getting it broke down to a certain extent. Then when it gets to E. coli, the E. coli is the final. Without E. coli, you will have no backup. So-called immune system. Now, if you talk to, if you debate with a medical professional about an immune system, it comes out as this ethereal little thing that you can't see and you really can't put your finger under this there. E. coli and the lymph system are basically everything you need to back up the system on anything. So if anything was to, any part of the body was to be identified as the immune system, it should be E. coli in the bowel and the lymphatic system. They're very, very important environments. And then when the feces comes out, it's predigested matter. Now why do a lot of animals go around eating manure? Because they have shorter digestive tracts. A dog will eat manure any time. They have only 10 feet of digestive tract. Here's predigested animal matter in this human curry. Sure they're going to go eat it up like that. Now, what is the other excrement we found out of E. coli? It's called a verotoxin. And the University of Toronto has been using verotoxin to dissolve human brain tumors in two to five days.

Now, why aren't we eating shit? Eat shit and live. Basically. And I have clients that I have eating. And they're very advanced in cancer. I will talk them into it. And the E. coli is, like I said, responsible for the amino acids. The finest dissolution of amino acids. What happens if you have a child that's like Kwashiorkor, a malnourished child on a vegetarian diet? Their nervous systems do not get the proper amino acids to structure itself properly. So they become deformed in many ways and very retarded mentally. So, I've had a few children that have been brought to me in that condition. And one child who was in a seizure 24/7. She was two years old, or just before she was two years old, she had a vaccine. They put her, that little girl, in seizures, a half an hour seizure, four days a week. Parents freaked. Nothing they could do. Put her on a [unintelligible] or other medication. Not even two years old yet. So she got pneumonia from this drug abuse. Because it was destroying antibiotics and [unintelligible]. So the antibiotics were destroying the child's ability to digest and get the amino acids, so it got pneumonia. So they put her in the hospital, put her on these drugs and an IV. They called the parents one night after about ten days in the hospital, nine or ten days, I forget what it was, and said, you're going to have to come pick up your child, there's nothing we can do for her. Parents get there, the child is in 24-hour seizures, seven days a week. They said, well how do we feed her, what do we do? [unintelligible], she's unconscious, you know, try to feed her. You have to hold her up, squirt the stuff down, otherwise you're going to have to put a tube in her stomach. So they brought her to me in that condition, just like this, eyes rolling, just like that. The whole hour and 15 minutes with me, she would have been like that, but as soon as she walked in the door, I started putting honey and butter in her mouth, letting it go down. Forty minutes later, seizure stopped. I fed her. She went back to her seizures of only two a week, she went through two seizures a week. And I knew that the baby's digestive tract had been so damaged, that probably was going to go in and out of seizures the rest of her life, unless we corrected that condition right then and there. So, the grandparents started feeding the child buffalo shit. Buffalo shit. Buffalo manure. Right out of the intestines. They would tie off like a sausage, take a little section at a time, chop up the intestine with the fecal matter. The first time she had the fecal matter, it never went into another seizure. She hasn't had a seizure in over two years. So, there is a tribe in Georgia, Russia. Same thing. First time I saw it was in the 70s. National Geographic had it on TV. And she looked almost identical to you, but she had blue eyes, blacker hair.

And she was sitting eating when she was [unintelligible]. And she was eating, and she has this big beautiful smile on her face. She's coming off of her face. Pull back. And you see something in her hand kept there with, you see this big buffalo tail in the back, behind her, swishing. And you pull back and she got... She was a diminutive person, about five foot, four eleven. She had this buffalo patty in front of her, like a bowl, and she was eating it, smiling and eating it. And there's a lot of tribes who eat that way because they found that the cow has the digestive tract two and a half times longer than ours. They have two to four stomachs. We only have one. They can digest all that cellulose. But still, 25 to 30% of them will pass through them undigested. But it's pre-digested like the dogs. Well, humans can do that, especially if they don't have access to meat. They can eat excrement from a vegetarian animal if it's eaten right when it's warm. And they can completely digest it and live as a semi-vegetarian. Does that appeal to you as a vegetarian? Eating shit for life? But it works. That's the way to do it, and that's the way some tribes eat if they don't have access or they're too poor to have meat. They'll go and eat the excrement from a vegetarian animal. And it works because it's pre-digested. So nothing should ever be seen as dangerous in our society except for industrial pollution. That's where disease comes from. Now we know that high levels of iodine, arsenic, barium, cadmium creates all these different disorders in laboratory animals of cancer. Magnesium with kidneys and pancreas. Barium with heart cancer or heart disease and a load of pulmonary disorders and pulmonary cancer. And the FDA has been told you're only allowed to do so many experiments. So if you go into barium toxicity, even up as late as 1998, they're only allowed to take the test so far. And they'll say, well, we haven't been able to find this disorder and we don't know the true consequences of the exposure to barium that will create cancer, because they don't want to go that far, because why? The pharmaceutical industry, the medical industry uses barium as a contrast in X-rays and CAT scans. CAT scans, what, $1,800, $1,500 a shot? They don't want to pass up that, and they've got to have a contrast. Contrast means it goes in the body, it's a mineral that reflects radiation and makes your picture greater. It's like internal flax. You drink it, or they inject it into you, and then they put you through the radiation machine. But then barium becomes radioactive. And they said, well, it only has a half-life, you know, 50 years. I mean, 50 days. Wait a minute. The test shows that only 7% is passed out in the urine, and 24% passes out in the feces in 24 hours. We know that once you're beyond that 24-hour period, the decrease in secretion or excretion, secretions and excretion, substantially, exponentially reduces.

So that means somewhere around 30, 40% of that barium is in your muscle tissues and in your bones. And barium acts like calcium. It is absorbent, just like calcium in the body. It locks in the system. When it's locked in, it's locked in. And it will displace calcium. And it will cause tremendous bone cancer. Yet, they give it to you when you go in for x-rays. Or they give you iodine, which is also radioactive, and displaces other minerals. Cancer-causing everything is from the Industrial Revolution. Anything that's pollution is causing the diseases that we have. We know that we take the serious diseases, especially cancer. And Pottenger was a scientist, an M.D., who worked mainly with respiratory diseases. But he got the idea about raw foods. So he put 900 cats for a 10-year period on different diets. All raw food diet where they got raw meats, some raw butter, a little bit of... Once in a while he gave them some cod liver oil. And at that time, cod liver oil was not purified. It was good and stinky and real. It was not processed oils from fish. Like everything is all purified now. It's a chemical. It's no longer good fish oil. I don't care who promotes it. The FDA has said that it has to be purified to the point where all the proteins are out of it so there's no bacteria can survive in it. To do that, it's a heat process. So anybody that tells you they've got a raw fish oil, whether it's cod or whatever, they are absolutely lying to you. They have to use heat to get the protein out of it and they have to use solvents to purify it. Absolutely, without a doubt. If you go into the chemist, and that's what you do, and I do too, I don't stop at the salesperson. I say, I want to talk to your chemist. The chemist knows exactly what's going on. And they don't lie because he doesn't want to go to jail. He'll go to jail if he lies to anybody. You can let everybody else run around saying, giving false advertising, because they don't know any better. That's what they can claim in court. But a chemist knows, so he won't lie. And I've gone to all of them. And let me tell you, you get a straight scoop. Yes, we use this solvent to break down this, we use this much heat to get rid of the protein, and it's a process that happens. So, anyway, Pottenger put these cats on raw, you know, raw dairy, some raw meats, a little bit of cod liver oil once in a while, and fed the others, the same foods, only cooked. Then cooked and processed. Like, you know, like your confection sugar and your condensed evaporated milk. He said that was the worst. All the animals were on the cooked diets. There was nothing raw, they got everything cooked. It wasn't partial. They got all the diseases that humans get. All of the diseases that humans get. And if they got processed and cooked, those diseases became chronic and severe. The worse the processing of the food was, the worse the disease was. The Black Plague. People always say, what about the Black Plague? Well, who did the Black Plague affect?

[unintelligible] people. People in the farms didn't get Black Plague. Why? You say, why? What happened? What could have contaminated them? Were they eating out of lead cups? Lead bowls? They were getting poisoned during everything they ate. They would cook in lead pots. And that lead was everywhere. And what was on every block? Either had a silversmith, a jewelry maker, or a blacksmith. And when they burned those metals in a place like Ireland, England, France along the coast, Germany, Denmark, all those areas that were affected, fog. Pulling in the heavy metals, vapors. Just locked in there. They didn't have stacked chimneys that sent it way up in the sky. It was coming out a few feet off the ground. And it would just hover in there and these people were breathing it for centuries. And it came to the point where all their lungs were so damaged and the children and their offspring were giving it to them, the pulmonary disease became inevitable. So you got the black plague. But your farmers didn't get it. The people who lived out of the cities didn't get it. They didn't die. They were using some lead cups and things like that, but most of them didn't use lead cups. They used pottery. But it was high fashion. They were considered more elite if you used metal pottery rather than clay pottery. They weren't wealthy. So all these people who were living in the cities believed that it was better to take out the metal, lead, then you had to deal with the pollution. So all the tales that you hear about the Hawaiians, they got a flu bug from us whiteys. Nothing happened like that. They were poisoned with poison in their water streams, just like what's documented in Africa and Brazil and all through South America. One particular writer that I first got into was in 1973. He wrote a play called Savages, and he showed that he had documentation that the Germans for the diamond and ruby and emerald industry in Brazil in the area, they would pay Brazilians in bars to poison their water systems. And when you're poisoned like that with certain kinds of elements, it looks like smallpox or just like any other disease. It all has vomiting and diarrhea and some kind of skin rash. And instead of saying it was a poison, oh, it was smallpox. They all died of smallpox or the flu. It's absolute garbage. It's a way they're still doing it. Ebola, according to Dr. Horowitz, Leonard Horowitz, was manufactured on an island off of the East Coast and given to the Africans. And the AIDS was originally intended to give to Africans to take over their resources, and it was made at UCLA in 1961. 59-62 was created there to induce cancer in laboratory animals to study cancer. The War Department got it. And I... You can read that book. It's called Bio-Attack Alert.

And it documents by a physician who was paid by an insurance company in San Francisco and was hiring mainly homosexuals. Sixty percent of the employees were homosexuals. And they wanted to know what the rate of AIDS would be and the insurance that they would have to spend on that group. So they hired Dr. Strecker, who's a world-renowned M.D., but he's a microbiologist. And he knows a lot about endocrinology. So he was hired to study AIDS to see the ratio of what it does, what can be done about it, whether it would be stopped. And there's theories on it. And he saw, every time you put an enzyme on it, normally it breaks into five parts. And you can study its individual parts. But this would keep coming in two, breaking in two. He said, only man-made bodies do that. So he took the opposite side, put them together, and found he had the leukemic virus of a sheep, I mean, the leukemic virus of a cow, bovine, and the lymphonomic virus of a sheep. They were spliced together and then put into the hepatitis B vaccine. And that was done by the War Department, getting ready to give it to Africans. So what did they find in America? The undesirable community were the homosexuals. Los Angeles, New York City, Houston, San Francisco, four cities they experimented with. Why did they put it in the hepatitis B vaccine? Because 90% of the people who were getting hepatitis were homosexuals because they were doing a lot of drugs. And they'll have a lot of alcohol at the same time, which is damaging your livers. In the meantime, your liver is damaged by drugs and alcohol. Your body can no longer get parasites and bacteria to clean the liver, so your body can only resort to virus. Hepatitis is a virus. But still, the cure, hepatitis is the cure. And you won't suffer, but they get you to attack it. They're taking the hepatitis vaccine. That's why 10% of the people who are not homosexuals were getting AIDS. So he documented that. He called his brother and said, hey. His brother was a famous attorney. And he said, here's what's going on. You've got to link this somewhere. Follow wherever it went. So they documented it. He got together with a senator because he could get the War Department to move on it. Wouldn't give them the Freedom of Information Act documents that he asked for through the Freedom of Information Act. Wouldn't give them the documents. So he got a senator from, I think it was Wisconsin or Minnesota to back him. And they both went in and got it. Right before that book was published, they both so-called committed suicide. Neither of them were depressed. They were both very down-to-earth, stable people. But that book is published and it's available. Nobody carries it, so you have to get it from the Strecker Foundation.

And that's a big book if you want to take a look at it. But Leonard Horowitz tells about the Ebola. He also shows that AIDS was put in, the hepatitis... I mean the vaccine, the smallpox vaccine, that 75 billion Africans were given. Who the hell gives anybody? This is the world health organization. The country of England and the country of the United States gave 75 million vaccines. Nobody gives anything to anybody without some ulterior motive. So what they did was create an epidemic of AIDS in how many African countries? 23. Guess who runs those countries now? All 23. Who? The World Health Organization through the World Bank. So who runs it? The United States and England runs those countries. Bankrupt them. They said, oh, you've got this disease. Here's all this medication. But if you can't pay us back, then we're going to have to take over your government and make sure we get our money back from the assets of your country. So they stole their resources. That's another warfare that's going on. It's a chemical warfare. And the only way you are going to be a part of it is if you go to a doctor and accept any medication. You're going to be a donator part of it. And you don't know what's in that medication. You don't have a clue. The only other way we have no choice about it is food. They're controlling more and more of the food source. Look what they tried to do to that country, Bolivia, in South America. The company went in and said, we're going to give you all of this but we're going to own your water supply. It became illegal to collect rainwater. Illegal to collect rainwater. Let me tell you, 70% of the population went crazy. They started taking politicians out, torturing them. And let me tell you, it became all over the country. So guess what company backed out of that country. Pepsi-Cola. A company owned by Pepsi-Cola. Backed out of the country because the people ran them out. They had the military, they had the army there, they had people dumping over the collected rainwater. And all the water had to be bought in this [unintelligible]. You can look it up on the internet. That is the extremes that are going on in the pollution of our lifestyles. And they're polluting our food. They're taking strongholds on it. They're saying that all this mad cow disease is a reason to restrict what kind of cows are bred. And guess who's going to come up with the safe cows? Dow, Monsanto. And all the cows will have to be destroyed because they are potential dangers and risks. So only genetically altered animals will be able to live. And guess, if you get milk from them or anything else, you have to pay royalty to Dow or Monsanto for that bovine's entire life. That's what the move is. That's what's going on with all this mad cow stuff. The mad cow is nothing but the other... All the mad cow diseases that I've seen, and the chickens that were so-called part of the avian flu epidemic, all those animals were given a liquid dewormer. 

[audio cut]

A: ...benzoate. It becomes benzene, carcinogenic in the system. Your soda pop companies, they are still allowed to put benzoate with that compound. And what do you have, benzene in your soda pops? In 1990, they debated that situation. The FDA said, well, you guys need to remove it. There was no mandate ever prescribed by the FDA, and a whistleblower just a few months ago said, wait a minute. Was anything ever done? So he did tests on these soda pop companies, and guess what? Benzene's still there. And it gives a little zing, and it causes an addiction. So it's better to poison, cause cancer in people with benzene rather than them losing their money in profits. It's that bad. So you've got to keep on your farmers. I call my farmers up and I say, where are you feeding them now? Where are you getting the corn? Where are you getting the oats or barley or whatever you're getting? And I'll track them down, see the sources. And some of them are taking shortcuts. Some of them are saying that they're organic, but they're not feeding them organically grown feed. So you have to be careful. You have to be on them like a hip pocket or have your own farm. And ultimately, that's what it's going to be. Because no matter how we look at it, the fear out there of some disease going from one animal to another, they're setting you up for it. It's this avian flu thing. Biggest crock of bullshit I've ever seen in my life. Now, I've been to Vietnam three times in the last three years. I've been to Cambodia four times. I've been to Thailand eight times in the last three years. I've been to those farms where they've slaughtered those animals. They just have the normal [unintelligible], which are normal for feeding animals, antibiotics. It destroys the bacteria and parasites that normally clean out and make a chicken or any kind of fowl healthy. So they have to resort to virus to clean out the system. They're going to get into that here in a little while. So then they're calling this virus. Now, all viruses are what they call retroviruses. They change within a 24, 72-hour period. They're nothing like they were before. Transferring from a bird to a human is the most stupid thing in the world. But they hooked you in the 70s with it, too. They told you the swine flu was going to get you. So what happened? Ford went on and took a swine flu shot in front of everybody. Who was our vice president? Rockefeller. What did he own? Five pharmaceutical houses. Who got $7 billion with the swine flu vaccine? [unintelligible]. That's right. So, what happened? A woman, a consumer advocate named Ida Honorof, who had a television radio show syndicated all over the United States, and an MD, a woman named McBean, San Diego, got together and filed suit on the federal government, U.S. government, on vice president and president and said, you have spent our money on a dangerous element. 

So, since Ida Honorof was syndicated on like 500 radio stations, it got out there. So, the media loved all this hype. So, they were there at the stations where they were giving the vaccine. 2,300 people dropped dead within two days of receiving the vaccine. And that was only out of 200,000 people. 2,000 died from the vaccine. You know how quickly that was pulled? The whole thing was stopped two weeks later. And guess what's still in the vaults? $7 billion worth of swine flu vaccine. Guess what they're relabeling [unintelligible]. You get all this hype that's creating this new vaccine. If it's retro, it's not going to be any valid for 72 hours after the virus has changed anyway. Any virus, any virus is antiquated 72 hours after it started. Any vaccine is just a hype. And I won't say it's a snake oil, because snake oil is really good stuff. But the vaccine is not. You know, in Mexico, in South America, in Central America, snake oil is the most pricey thing you can get. I've seen it take a person suffering with rheumatoid arthritis and severe pain... I mean, it's not easy to get snake oil. You have to ferment it, you have to take the meat, you have to chop it up, you have to crush it like you do a coconut. And then you have to let it ferment until the oil separates. Cut the oil. It's a very long, stinky process. And you give it to someone with rheumatoid arthritis in 24 hours, it's completely gone. So in the early days, we're selling oils that weren't from the snake, the snake oil, and getting away with it when people weren't being helped with it. But the snake oil is really an incredible substance. It's the highest in the Latin American countries. So you've got all this chemical poisoning to our environment, to our right to good food. So we need to protect real farmers and get our food from farmer sources, good farming sources. Take for example, let's say our health food stores have been blown out [unintelligible] companies like Whole Foods. Whole Foods is run by a bunch of redneck Texans. And I called them when they first opened up and talked to them. They didn't know their butts from a hole in the ground about health. Nor about foods at all. And what do you find in a Whole Foods store? 2% organic, and yet they're the biggest mouthpieces. Every one of their advertisements, go organic, go organic. And they've got the least organic of anybody. Of any health food store. And they go buying up all these health food stores. It's all hype. It's all hype. You have to make sure. You as individuals and groups of your community have to get together and make sure you're getting good food. Because you can't trust anybody that's in a corporation that's out for money. None that I can see. None, that I can see. So, poisoning. I mean, cooked foods. They denature your body. You lack enzymes. Your vitamins are altered and destroyed at various temperatures. Then chemicals are formed. And I name about 40 of them in this book.

I left the science out of this book because you needed the information. If you want the science about all of this, that that we can prove is in the last 50 pages of this book. So, we know that disease is created by cooking your food. If you eat all cooked foods, you know you're going to get disease. Inevitably you're going to get disease. 98% of you. Now, what kind of disease? What are the elements that cause the various kinds of disease? Well, we know that kwashiorkor, malnutrition, scurvy, that comes from eating only grains. In Ethiopia, all of these starving children, they collect hundreds of millions of dollars to feed these people. Guess what companies are getting paid to feed them? Purina, General Foods, they send them garbage cereals, pasteurized or condensed milk. They feed them the worst foods and make the most money feeding them garbage foods. They're not going in there and giving them agricultural, teaching them how to grow their own foods. These companies are making, multi-billion dollar companies, multi-trillion dollar companies are feeding these people garbage foods. Another way to get rid of them. Tapeworms only exist in people who do not eat meat. They only thrive and live in people who do not eat any kind of meat or dairy. They live in people who live on grains and don't eat heavy spices. Now, in Asia, they only eat like 5% meat. But boy, if you ever look, your eyes will melt by the amount of spice that they add in there. It's that hot. So they'll destroy parasites. So they keep parasites away and they can live, but they shrivel up very early in their lives. They wrinkle. The Asians [unintelligible] in their 40s and 50s. And they have terrible, terrible diseases from that stage on because they only eat 5% meat unless they're wealthy. It's different. They eat up to 25, 50%. So the Asians in Asia have that problem. But they ward off all the parasites and those having bacterial cleansings by eating all the spicy food. And I mean, it's so hot in Thailand. I have a girlfriend there, three girlfriends. And they all eat the spicy food. Two of them like the raw diet and the raw meats and the [unintelligible]. And the one that didn't, she would take her meat and put it in a raw meat and put it in a hot soup. And I thought, okay. I have no judgment about people eating it the way they want to live. It's their journey. It's not my journey. So let people eat what they want to eat. I'm just going to educate them. So I put my finger in to see how hot, just to get in my mind how hot that was going to be. So she asked me a question, because I was ready for it. Is this very bad if I put it in the hot soup? So I went to see how hot it was and if it scalded my finger. It didn't scald my finger. It's not so hot, it's okay. I went like that. Let me tell you, I had put ice on my tongue.

And there was a blister there the next day, blister on my tongue. And if you've ever sat in Thailand and watched one of those Thais eat their food, their soups and stuff, you'll see bubbles going on their nose and their eyes turn red and runny. They're used to it. They're conditioned from a young age to do that. But that keeps parasites away, bacteria and detoxifications away. But it also makes sure that you're going to shrivel and age quickly in your 50s, late 40s and 50s. And your life's going to be shortened. And for the females, it's horrendous. They have the worst gum and teeth problems in Asia that I've ever seen anywhere else in the world. Because that hot stuff also demineralizes the bones. It breaks down the nerves over the years and years and years of doing it. You know, if they do it in Mexico, you know with their jalapenos. But let me tell you, nothing like this happens in Mexico. Nothing like that. So, let's take now, let's take the individual elements of food and take a look at the value. So, first let's take a look at sugars. You know, the only natural sugars we know are in fruit and in vegetables. Now, we, can we digest vegetation? Can't break down cellulose very well at all. Maybe we can digest 20%, 10% of it. And hardly any of the proteins, not even a percent of the protein, not even 2% of the fat. An herbivore, an animal that eats vegetation naturally has a digestive tract 30 times the length of its torso. Ours is 12 times the length of our torso. Theirs is two and a half times longer than ours. They have two to four stomachs. We have two parts in the stomach. They have four, up to six and eight compartments depending on the animal. The bovines have the most. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fat and the protein. We don't do it. Unless it gives us the manure right behind the cow or whatever it is. Then we will digest it better. But when we're eating the whole raw vegetable, we do not digest it. That's why you cook your vegetables, right? To free up the protein and fat. But then the cooking creates other toxins. So, between a rock and a hard place. So, vegetation isn't right for us. Why should we eat it? Because we're [unintelligible]. We're told, you need your vegetables. They need to be cooked for your digestion. It's true. So, to get our sugars, fruit's the best place to get them, isn't it? Lots of fruit sugar. But what happens with fruit sugar? It defats the blood and demineralizes the entire system. So, then your body starts getting poroses of different kinds. Bone osteoporosis. Neurotissue and neuroporosis. So, you have the disintegration of tissue. In the Maasai tribe, in the Samburu, it is illegal to feed a child fruit. Your developing stages. It is a no-no to eat fruit in the tribe. Right? I'll give you an example.

When I lived outdoors, these mosquitoes ate the shit out of me because I was a fruitarian. I mean, that's all I ate. And they love sweet blood. Sometimes I'd wake up, you know, and be stark naked because it was so hot. And I'd have 200 mosquitoes feeding on me at one time. 200. Only at one time. So, you know, I could probably lose, you know, a whole ounce of blood in one night. The mosquito doesn't eat the blood for herself. It's the female that's the blood sucker. The male's about 10, you know, like the difference between the black widow male and the female. The male's really tiny, about 10th her size. And the female has this long proboscis. And the mosquito is the bee of the small flower kingdom. The bees are too heavy. And they get on these tiny little, you know, clover and the other very small flowers. You know, they're very tiny. And the mosquito gets in there, both the male and female. And they act just like the bees do. But the blood is for the larva. So the larva feed on the blood. And they love sweet blood because it makes them grow fast. And they're also hyperactive, so they can swim faster and get away from fish or birds that are eating, you know. And the mosquito hawk, that big thing that looks like an overgrown mosquito. It's not a mosquito at all. It eats larva. So when the mosquito puts a proboscis in you, it bites all the surrounding cells and makes a pool of blood. It sucks it all out. Let me tell you, if that blood was contaminated with yellow fever, the larva wouldn't live. So this whole idea that mosquitoes give you yellow fever is another tactic to get you to take yellow fever meds, vaccines, and medication. It is all bullshit. It's all bullshit to sell medication. So, the sugars are not a good thing. Now when I go to Thailand, I have no source for milk, so I take butter with me. And once in a while I get some goat's milk. But it's rare, and I get very hungry for my milk, because 50% of my diet, 60% of my diet is dairy, most of the time. Sometimes I'll eat 3 pounds of meat a day, and the milk goes down to 25% of my diet. But I love milk, so when I'm there I have to start eating other things, because I don't like to drink water. In Asia, so they don't have a high amount of sugar, the elders eat green fruit. Very low sugar, lots of enzymes. Green papaya, I mean really, green. Oranges and tangerines, so it's not sweet, they're tart. Lots of enzymes, acids that'll help you digest, and hardly any sugar. So I can eat... I can mix those, take a quart, half a quart of eggs and half a quart of juice. Or a ratio of 60% eggs, 40% juice, and I can drink that and mosquitoes won't touch me. I leave my hotel windows open when I'm sleeping in a hotel. I'm sleeping outdoors, I don't use a covered tent. And my girlfriends will get bitten all the time, and I don't get bitten at all, unless I eat one piece of watermelon.

I can eat one section of watermelon this big, and I'll be bitten by at least five mosquitoes that night. So, in the wild, humans didn't eat sugar because they'd become food for insects, especially mosquitoes. So you have to look at what the human being is geared to eat on a whole planetary level, if you really want to find out what's completely healthy. Because what would your life be like if you ate a medium diet, a pretty good diet, and you were sucking fruit? Because it tastes so good. And then you start getting eaten by mosquitoes, and you're very irritable. How are you going to treat, you know, the people around you? Is that going to make you hurt them, or are you going to fight? So you look at all these side effects. You take a look at the ape. The ape does not eat any ripe banana. They only eat green bananas. They eat the peel and all. [unintelligible] you know, they're not used to it. But that's the way they eat them.

[audio cut]

A: Anyway, he was showing me. He said, look at this film. And what they did was, they were in Africa. They followed this tribe of gorillas. And they noticed that they were only eating these green bananas. So they decided to cut down this big stalk of green bananas and carry them on their jeeps as they were following the apes. And when they got ripe, they took them and put them out there to the gorillas. The gorillas were very curious, you know. So they came out, they're walking around, pulling them up, trying to eat them and just squish all over, you know. Smell them. It took them about 40 minutes. One started peeling, and they all started peeling and started eating them. Within 40 minutes, they were fighting. One of the teenagers got killed, and one of the adolescents got his arm and leg broken. Because they just started fighting. They went sugar bananas. The sugar destroyed their nervous system and made them temporarily insane.

Q: Wow.

A: And they were so aggressive. The bigger gorillas, there was enough there for them to feed on for a week. And they became possessive and crazy, irrational, from this. And they couldn't get the bananas away, so they had to watch this last for about a week. There was a lot of damage, a lot of bruising going on. And the big silverback, he was really crazy for a couple of weeks, almost a month. Then you look at the killer monkeys. Killer monkeys, what do they do? They go on a binge of overripe figs and bananas. They're all fermented. And they'll go on a binge for 24 hours, and then they'll go out on a killing spree. Hitler was a vegetarian who loved sugar. He put two heaping tablespoons of sugar in each glass of wine. If he had a cake that had an icing on it that thick, it got a layer of sugar that thick on top of it. The the vegetarians in history, including the Bible, were the most vicious of all people. Cain and Abel. Cain was a vegetarian. Abel was a meat eater. They've got all these ideas about, you know, vegetarians are very calm, relaxed spiritual people. Which isn't true. I know when I, you know, I had been a vegetarian and then a vegan for a total of six years, or the two of them. And when I got into this raw meat thing, I went to a lecture that I gave at a health convention, the World Health, I mean, the Whole Foods Health Convention, in San Diego. And there's a whole raw community of fruitarians down there. And they came to my table. And I just sat there talking. And after, you know, they were about 45 minutes into it, and they're seething because I wouldn't acquiesce that I was doing something wrong. And I said, no, I've been where you've been. And it didn't work for me. This is healthy for me. But if you want to see how calm your diet makes you, I pulled up a mirror, because I was ready for it. And I put it right in his face, foam around his mouth. [unintelligible] And I said, you take a look at that. And you take a look at it, and you see who you want to be. And he walked away. All of them walked away, and everybody left. They're still eating that way. Ninety percent of them. Ten percent of them came on the other side. But ninety percent of them still believe in meat [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible]. The Dalai Lama started eating meat two years ago. Because, I don't know if you know Fred Segal. He's the man who owns the house I rent in Malibu. He's worth hundreds of millions of dollars. Fred Segal clothing, products, [unintelligible], soap, whatever else he's into. Anyway, he's been on the diet for about five years now and he's changed his life. Completely. He's a good friend of the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama got pretty sick a few years ago. He was going downhill. So Fred said, hey, look what he's done for me. Do you remember, you know, I was like this. You know, 68 years old. I was just always angry and everything. And now he stands up straight and vibrant. He's 72 years old. He says, look what it's done for me. This is raw meat. [unintelligible] So I never make the statement that he's eating raw meat because I was just told he was eating meat. I like to say things exactly as they are. It could be raw. It probably is raw, but I can't say that. Because Fred said he's now eating raw meat. He's now eating meat. I could assume that it's raw meat, but I can't say that. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: So then we look at what else has sugar in it. Dairy has milk sugar in it. It has lactose. It also has lactate. A way to break it down. Other fruits don't have a sugar fractionating molecule. Fruits do not have a sugar fractionating molecule. Milk does. So it makes it very different. It doesn't cause an accumulation of advanced glycation end products. That's another bad thing about high sugar content. [unintelligible] high in carbohydrate. Columbia University found that 70 to 90% of the advanced glycation end product that results from using carbohydrate, glycogen as blood sugar, I mean the nervous system and blood sugar, it stores in the body, 70 to 90%. Dairy does not cause that as much. Maybe it's somewhere around 20%, something like that. But the best sugar comes from what? Pyruvate. Protein. Pyruvate that's made, the sugar that's made from protein, then the body uses glucagon to convert it to blood sugar. So it's a carbohydrate, I mean it's a blood sugar, glycogen, that does not come from the same source, because I have the same chemistry. It can only store 7-8%, I mean it only manufactures 7-8%, so it never stores in the body. Columbia also found that that 70-90% that stores in the body, stores for a lifetime. You cannot get rid of it. That sugar environment makes it very appealing to cancerous conditions. Then you take a look at, if you fry a high-carbohydrate food, you create acrylamides. And a whole team of full professors in Sweden, several years ago, showed tests after something like 9 or 10 years that 60% of all cancer tissue is inundated with acrylamides. They went to the press and everything. They thought they were completely justified. They didn't go to their university first to the board and say, you know, we want to release these test results. They were right and called this a press conference. Totally innocent and naive and said we need to outlaw 90% of all cereals, donuts, all chips, any high-carbohydrate fried potato chips. I mean French fries. Those we need to outlaw right away. Any high-carbohydrate that's fried in oil. The acrylamides go from, let's say, a baked potato is about 160 acrylamides per gram. Once it's fried, anywhere from 1,600 to 2,100 acrylamides per gram. Skyrocket. So let me tell you, those guys were all full professors. Guess what they're now teaching? High school. Multi-trillion dollar industries. And those industries came down very hard on the politicians at their universities and everywhere. So they lost their tenure because they were honest and cared about people. And said, listen, this is probably causing 60% more cancers. Let's get rid of it. So that's what happened. So you're not being protected. So you've got to be aware. So the pyruvate, when the body makes the... 

[audio cut]

A: ...acrylamides, advanced glycation end products, it makes your fluids very sticky. What happens is your blood gets sticky or your neurological gets sticky. Your neurological fluid gets sticky. Or your lymph system gets sticky. Cells go by, stick to each other, things slow down. Things get misfired from the brain. And you take a look at the, you know, I was that way when I was a fruitarian. I was a basket cake. You know, I could go on tangents but never find my way back. Here you see me go off on tangents, but I always come back to it right way. Because my brain's not sticky, it's working properly. So, your protein is the best food for sugar. It doesn't create all that stickiness in the system, in the fluid system. So, take a look at protein. What else does protein do? Protein builds the system. It is the building blocks of the system. As long as there are minerals, the body can build anything [unintelligible]. Good and stable, whether it's bone, glandular, organ, skin, no matter whether it's ear lobe, anything. It can build it to a certain state of stability. And in my laboratory tests of animals, eating them, different things, raw meat was the only one that helped them regenerate nerve tissue. The science community says, the medical profession says, nerve cells can never have regeneration. Impossible. Never happened. Once nerve damage is done, it's for life. If you read my books, you find out that my son was in a car accident, destroyed a third, a fifth of his brain, he got to college. It was incredible. I was mugged in Bangkok two years ago in December. I was doing something very stupid. My last day in Bangkok, first time I went there, third time I went there, and I took my video camera and I was filming nightlife at 2 o'clock in the morning, 2.15 in the morning in Bangkok. So I'm going along like this, and there's these three guys off in a dark corner, and I'm just going like this. And they got, you know, they saw me with the camera, so one of them came after me with a beer bottle, and they stopped it. And I thought nothing better and went away. About a block, not even a block, a hundred feet from my hotel gate entrance, two guys jumped out in between a van, and another guy came from behind me. One guy hit me with a board here, split my eye open from here, and my guts were hanging out over my eye. And then when my head was starting to come back from that one, the other guy had a crowbar or a hammer, as the forensic detective told me. The way he hit me, had to have been with a crowbar or a ball peen hammer. Hit me right here, split this whole lip open like this, so I was completely open like that. The bones from here to here, you can still see this is where it hasn't fully healed, from here to here, this bone and these teeth were knocked under my tongue. 

Broke the bone, both sides, split the nerve, it goes through, connects all teeth to it, destroyed. My bone was stretched and all the way back under my tongue. [unintelligible]. So I had to, you know, stay in bangkok longer. Went to the dentist the next day, that was like 2 o'clock in the morning, 2.30 in the morning, 2.15 in the morning when that happened. And the dentists don't get in, the oral surgeons didn't get in until 1, 2 o'clock in the afternoon. So he had to do a whole lot of work, having the teeth and my bone under my tongue, you know. And everything, eat, you know, grind everything, mash it, you know, chop it up, put it into my mouth, get it down my throat. So [unintelligible], there were two dentist surgeons there, and they looked at me and said, the way you can fix it, the bone has been so damaged that if we put it back in place, it's just going to go into necrosis, the teeth are going to rot, everything's going to rot, the infection will go to your brain, and you'll die. I said, you have no idea about my diet and what my body is able to do. What I want you to do is you work that bone back in place, you wire my jaw, and you wire those teeth. He said, it may be criminal for us to do this. I said, listen, if it starts getting into having an infection, I can have it removed, have it all removed at any time. Throw in antibiotics, it's okay. He said, okay, but you have to let us keep an eye on it. I said, sure. I wasn't going to let them keep an eye on it. I was gone five days after the surgery. I was in the United States. But they did that. It took them two hours. They put that back in place, wire my jaw, and wire the teeth in. You see these teeth today? They said that hose will never regenerate. And there's a [unintelligible]. I can feel it hurt. I can feel it. So on this diet, on the raw meat, you can regenerate any tissue. Now, when I was taking animals who were injured, and I put them on raw meat, little bits of raw meat or just dairy, the raw dairy, I had three groups. One had the raw meat. Next group had the raw dairy. Next group had a little dairy and a little meat. The group that got almost all meats regenerated and healed their wounds five times sooner than the other. And better. Better. Meat is so important for regenerating and wanting it done. Now this is the first week of my 60th year, and I was supposed to be dead 38 years ago with some of the worst cancers in life. Only other people lived three months who had my cancers. Three months. I'm 38 years into living beyond those cancers. So you take a look at where my health was, and this is the first week of my 60th year. I get healthier every day that I do this diet. It works wonderfully. And I don't exercise. Do you know how much fat there is? This is my exercise, on my computer. I'm like Cary Grant, remember? This is his exercise.

And I'm fit, but guess how much fat I have on my body. Nothing jiggles. How much fat is in my body? How much are athletes, [unintelligible] athletes, who are trimmed [unintelligible]? 7 to 12 percent. That's what they aim for, 7 percent to be the healthiest. My body is 22 percent fat. Why is it so trimmed? Fat molecules, when they're raw, are very tiny. When you cook a fat molecule, it swells 10 to 50 times its normal size.

Q: Wow. 

A: 10 to 50 times. I've been eating raw food since 1972. No cooked fat stored in my body. So over the years, even in the bones, the fat cells that we use, when I was 15 years old, I had a 28 inch waist, very small shoulders and everything, and I got it in my fat period and then got fat again by after getting so sick. But I was small, with very small shoulders. I am the same now. It took me all those years to break it down. In the last three years, all those bones have been getting denser, tighter, and more solid and stronger. I was a kid who could not jump off a foot chair without worrying about breaking my ankle or cracking a bone. And that's how delicate I was. I jump from 10, 15 feet now, without even thinking about it. And that's how strong I am. 60, almost 60 years old. It works wonderfully. So raw meat is very important to keep you thriving with cells. Most people, when they get 70 years old, are walking around with 20% of their cells alive in their body. And then you see those ones who are going across the street like this. Those 22, 25% cells are not very strong and healthy, are they? Pretty bad. Everybody drops dead when your cell count gets to 22%. A lot of cells, 22% can't keep up 100% for very long. [unintelligible] You can imagine how many cells all of you have in the room. The older you are, the fewer cells you will have alive. Unless you eat raw meat, because you can start dividing them rapidly. And of course, they won't be as healthy as cells that will get healthier if you're on the diet. It takes 40 years according to Pottenger and Howell in their experiments with diseased animals. It took them five generations to become optimally healthy. That doesn't mean that we have to wait until, you know, my childrens childrens children. Children [unintelligible] cellular regeneration of the body. They say every cell in the body takes seven to seven and a half years. The bones take that long to regenerate. Five times that means 40 years, well 37 and a half years. So if you're doing this diet, you're going to be cleaning debris out every year, putting nutrients in, getting healthier every year, so after that 40 years, you're going to reach optimum. Some of you say, shit, you know, I'm already 60 some years old. You know, I'm never going to see the optimal. Who cares? Every day you're going to get healthier instead of going the other direction. That's what matters. And I'm a person who says, I don't care how long I live, as long as I'm healthy while I'm alive. If I got hit by a bus tomorrow, as Richard [unintelligible] said to me, you know, if you do all this work, eat all this diet and everything, what if you're going to get hit by a bus. I said, I'm going to be healthy when that bus hits me. I'll be healthy when that bus hits me. Raw meats are so important if you want to be vibrant, strong, and healthy. Look at fats. Fats, to me, in our toxic society, are the most important nutrient in the world to the human being.

As I said, fats lubricate, protect, and fuel the body. Cleans the body. Very, very important in our toxic society. Two years ago, to give you an example of how important fat is, I came here and, you know, this is a hippie community. Ashville has formed a long-term hippie community. Lots of long-term vegetarians, 14 to 35 years, 36 years. So, whenever I come here, those are the patients I expect to see. Well, two years ago, this biker dude looking guy came in. [unintelligible]. So, I photographed his irises, and I looked at the irises, and I said, you know, I looked at your skin, and there's a lot of damage in it from alcohol and drugs. [unintelligible] like 30 years. And he said, no, 30 years. And I said, but your insides are so clean. You know, it's like maybe you're 30 years old, not 50. 51. And I said, you're only 25, 30 pounds maximum overweight.It doesn't make any sense, that kind of abuse, that I can see in your skin, that the organs and the glands aren't affected. He said, well, four months ago, before I went on your diet, I was 300 pounds.

Q: Whoa.

A: Even the bad fats will protect you, because the toxins go into the fat. Guess what if you don't have fat? It goes into your cells and damages your cells. Cancer. Cancer. And that's why 50% of my cancer clients are long-term vegetarians. They don't [unintelligible]. They don't have enough fat on their bodies for the poisons to go into fat. It goes into their live cells, kills their cells. You have a lot of dead cells that collect in the body and you end up with cancer. Cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve and discard dead cells. So they collect in tumors. Now, if you have a benign tumor or a malignant tumor, which would you rather have? They advertise that you'd rather have a benign tumor, definitely not a malignant tumor. Well, let's take a look at a benign tumor. A benign tumor has no veins going through it, no circulation through it. So the body's going to dissolve it. Without surgery, you've got to slowly and gradually dissolve it from the outside in. Malignant tumor has blood vessels going through, and you have live cancer cells. Those cancer cells are like [unintelligible]. They can eat from themselves, get a little nutrients from the blood. They're not connected to the lymph system, connected to the tumor, and they're surrounded by hundreds of dead cells. Wha happens when a cancer cell dies. It sends on a serum. It dissolves all the surrounding dead cells. You can dissolve a malignant tumor in two days. Maybe two years. Maybe three years. But not like a benign tumor, it could take you 30, 40 years to dissolve. From the outside in. The problem is that once those cells start dissolving everything around, do you have the minerals and the fats to bind to those poisons before you disintegrate all the tissue in that area? That's the problem we have, especially with long-term vegetarians. They have no fat, lots of dead cells in the body. Not enough nutrients to get into the area. So for those people, [unintelligible] lately, because the long-term vegetarians are the hardest ones to turn around. So I've been giving them mainly a milk diet. Milk and honey and cheese. They have to live with their constipation as much as possible, but they're going to get in there and then collect this dissolving stuff so it doesn't start dissolving good healthy tissue around, because that's what will happen. Because there's so little life in a long-term vegetarian. There's maybe, you know, 30, 40% of their body alive. I mean, 60% dead tissue there. And that's still a lot of tissue to dissolve, good healthy tissue. So they need lots of minerals. And, you know, I don't know how many of you are exposed to people with cancer. 

In the later stages of cancer, the osteoporosis is prominent. The body starts eating up its own bone to supply the minerals to bind with that toxic fluid that's melting the tissue. So the body eats itself because there's not enough minerals. Mineral supplements don't seem to work very well. It helps a little bit, but it doesn't do what cheese can do. Cheese and honey together, I'm jumping ahead a little bit because I just want you to hear this within context of use. Cheese is a dry food. It is not a live food. It's not cooked. It isn't dangerous. It won't cause disease. But any food that is dehydrated is not an active food. Your body has to take enzymes from itself, reconstruct them, and drop them into the food. Whether it's fruit, cheese, meat, or no matter what it is. Eskimos make a pemmican every year. They will not eat that pemmican if they don't have to. If they don't eat it, 90-pound block for each one of them to make it. That means drying it. They take the meat strips out and put them in [unintelligible]. They beat it into a powder. And they mix it with whale or seal blubber or whatever fat they can get. And they bake it in the sun, melt it down, and mix it together and press a block. A 90-pound block. They keep that in case they don't get any food during the winter. And if they don't eat it, it gets buried in the [unintelligible]. Because there's no enzyme activity in it. They know it as a less-healthful food than fresh food. But cheese is an asset because it is so mineral-proficient that it creates a magnetic pull in the stomach and intestine. And I mean stomach duodenum. When I talk about stomach, I'm talking about the duodenum and stomach together as one unit. So in the stomach and intestines, it creates a magnetic property. So as they lift the neurological streams and the lymphatic, as they pass through the stomach and intestinal walls, the cheese will pull heavy metals out of the serum and dump them there. So your body's not using your minerals from your live food, your fresh live food, to bind with these poisons. The cheese will do it. Now if you eat cheese with anything, it's okay, except honey. If you eat cheese and honey together, the cheese then digests, the minerals then digest. Because if you eat honey with cheese, the honey provides enzymes to digest the cheese. So it won't be a magnet anymore. So if you want a good mineral supplement, you eat honey and cheese together. That's your mineral supplement.

Q: All minerals or just [unintelligible]?

A: Everything. All of them are absorbable.

Q: Why is cheese so mineral rich?

A: For growing a calf, all mammary glands produce mineral rich fluid. Because they have to grow bones quickly, the children have to grow fast, or the calves, whatever it is, grow fast. So all mammary secretions are concentrated in minerals. That's why a lot of women get very mineral deficient post-partum. They start losing their muscles on their thighs, their bones start thinning, they start to be [unintelligible] and more irritable because they're not on a good diet. Because the body will start taking minerals out of their own body if they're not eating properly. But an animal, like a vegetarian animal, who's out there on the farm, who's eating all natural foods, they have the digestive tract to break down that cellulose and get all those minerals out of it, and make that mammary secretion very, very concentrated. Now, when I talk with a mother these days, I say, do not suckle your children. I say, you have not been on a raw diet your whole life. A cow has. 99% of the time, the child's going to do better with the cow's milk than they do with the mother's milk. Well, 1% of the time, I've found babies who get allergic to any milk but the mother's, and that's only 1 out of 100. Raw milk, of course. When I'm talking here, I'm talking raw food, unless I specify otherwise. And I've got lots of mothers who, their babies, you know, are normally whiny or cranky or get little rashes and stuff like that. And 99% of it goes away once they start the cow's milk. Because a cow has been on the raw diet its whole life, and humans have not. So the quality of mammary secretions are going to be a production that's a lot healthier in an animal that's raw its whole life than we [unintelligible]. They know that if they pasteurize the dairy given to a calf, 60% of the calves will not survive. And there was a memo that went out from the USDA six months ago that says, we recommend that you pasteurize all milk to your calves. Do you know why? [unintelligible] the big farmers, the meat production, they want you to destroy your own farm. They want you to make your cows very weak so they can get the disease so they can come in and slaughter your whole farm. Big business takes over more. They can say it's mad cow disease. All the herds around are infected too. Farmers, these new farmers, people who go into farming, they don't come from a farming background [unintelligible]. So they buy it all. Same thing comes with the USDA or universities. Universities are all run by [unintelligible]. The University of Davis is the only one that's got balls.

They come out repeatedly and say raw milk is preferable. Raw milk is not disease-causing. They're the only ones that have any balls. Out of all the universities in the United States. 

Q: Which university?

A: The University of Davis in Northern California. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You just go online. There are [unintelligible]. Yeah, well, ask Mark. [unintelligible]. Okay, so, fats. Cleaning the body will give you the strongest amount of energy. Now, we can see that in daily life. In the sports field. Take a look at Arnold Schwarzenegger [unintelligible]. Cut. 7% fat. Out there pumping iron. Put them on a competition of who can lift more weights. Get the fat weightlifters in there and they'll push a lot more weight. Sumo wrestlers. Let one of them get a finger on you. [unintelligible]. I mean, I had one just pick me like this. I had a cloth band on here from a monk. And the guy just picked me up like that. I'm 172 pounds. [unintelligible]. Fat. These guys eat all day long. Fat. Strength comes from fat. You have two and a half times more energy from the same calorie of fat that you do of sugars or protein. That's your strength. Fat is so important. It keeps you warm. All the eskimos. Can you imagine being a baby? Would you allow your baby to be butt naked crawling around on an ice floor? You'd be worried about them getting a cold or a flu. And these babies crawl around butt naked on an Igloo floor. And they sleep on that cold Igloo floor with just a hide between them and the ice. These guys eat blubber like you wouldn't believe. It's so rich and delicious. Have you ever had seal blubber? [unintelligible] whale blubber. It's kind of rank, but seal blubber is phenomenal. Really good. And they're considered by a lot of archaeologists who work for the government that the Eskimos are the happiest, most vibrant tribe in the world. They call the Maasai the healthiest, strongest, and tallest and most intelligent tribe in the world. So they got lots of [unintelligible]. And the smallest tribe's man is something like 6'7". The tallest is 8'1". They're all very skinny, but they're very strong. They live at 20% body fat. They have a really skinny body, but they're incredibly strong and incredibly intelligent. They let people like Shirley MacLaine and a lot of people into their tribes for years, from the 50s, from the late 40s, all the way through to the 70s, 80s. And then they really saw that all the candy and cake and garbage that everybody was bringing was causing illness. So they went to the government of their country and said, they don't want the white man within 20 miles of our villages. We will hike 20 miles and do rituals and dances and things for them and sell them our goods, but we don't want them within 20 miles of our villages. Since then, they've been more purified. They're back to their old nature, much healthier. But they were getting very sick for a while. But they were so smart that they got rid of the white man. That's what [unintelligible]. It's great. It's, you know, it's a wonderful thing. They got educated on that level. You know, it's sheer ignorance. Not stupidity, it's ignorance. And our government breeds ignorance. They can control you if you're ignorant. Because if you're ignorant, [unintelligible]. Then you always let everybody else make you [unintelligible]. So that's the way they like it. 

Anyway, so fats. So very important to the system. The more toxicity you have, the more fat you need. That's why I say in my books, get fat. If you have a problem, get fat. If you want to get well and you're weak, get fat. This is a perfect size. Perfect size. Pretty good. But she's young. She doesn't need as much fat. So let me give you an example. I had a woman who came to me 14 years in chronic fatigue. She started on chronic fatigue at 14 years old. She came to me at 28 years old. Breast cancer. Breast was down to here. All this tumor. She had the cancer of the hip bone. And then the kidney attached to the adrenal gland. Skinny. And I mean skinny. 5'5", 118, 116 pounds. Very thin. Got her to go on the diet. She was a neighbor. And got her to go on the diet. She took to it, like, very well. So we got romantically involved. So I was able to help her with her diet all day long every day.

Q: Owanza?

A: [unintelligible]. Owanza had 63 tumors. [unintelligible]. I'd stop them. It doesn't work in a relationship as well for me. So she went up to 160 pounds at 5'5". And stayed that way for almost four and a half years. Her eyes went from black to blue [unintelligible].

Q: Wow.

A: Her father had blue eyes. I mean, mother had blue eyes. Mother had green eyes. Two sisters, one blue and one green. She was born with black eyes. Why did she have black eyes? Mother was 1969. Mother was in college. Got pregnant. Norwegians, so they drank a lot worse than the Irish did. And I mean, they drink. So you can imagine, she was pregnant for five months.

[audio cut]

A: ... so blood didn't get [unintelligible]. So all those toxins from the mother went into the foetus. So when she hit 14, she started becoming chronically complete. And when I met her when she was 28, she could only work six hours a week. She would sleep 14 to 16 hours a day. This is eight years later. She lives in Hawaii. She works on a community that's mainly on my diet. Fourteen, fifteen hours a day working in the fields. Growing things and milking goats and pigs and cows and stuff like that. Vibrantly healthy. But for four and a half years, almost four and a half years, she was willing to forego her vanity and get fat and stay that way. And it worked for her. It worked fast for her. Other people are too inhibited to go to that place to do it easily. So, in my book I say, you know, okay, women gain ten to twelve pounds. I just slide it in there.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Right. First [unintelligible], then go higher. It's really, I'd like everybody to, you know, to be twenty-five, thirty pounds overweight. You're looking at me and saying, well, you're not that way. I said, yeah, but my fat molecules are small. I'm twenty-two percent body fat, you know. I'm her size. She's about twenty-two percent body fat. Maybe twenty-five, twenty-four. But that's my, this is the difference in the fat molecules from cooked to raw. I look skinny, and trim, and tight, yet I'm twenty-two percent body fat. That's almost a quarter of my body in fat. You can't see it anywhere. It's in the muscles, it's in everything, concentrated and small. But it took me, since 1972 of eating raw foods, to get here.

Q: Only thirty-four years.

A: It's true, in the last three years I've gone down from, I used to go up to a thirty-seven inch waist. Now I can't get over a thirty-three. And I'll go down to a twenty-nine inch waist. In my fluctuation. But I still have carried all that fat. When I was very sick, I like to stay at twenty-seven percent or higher body fat. I was large. And that's the way I like to stay. Now I don't have to go that high. Fat, fat, fat is so important. Don't deny it. Fat is so important. If you've got poisons running out in your blood and you start putting on that fat, those poisons are going to go into the blood. Even if you're dissolving cancer, it's going to go into the fat. If you're having the cheese, those poisons are going to get into the intestinal tract. And the cheese is going to hold on to them and discard them, as long as you're not putting cheese and honey in your mouth at the same time. You need to do that a couple of times a day to get your mineral supplementation. But the cheese, if you've got poisons running in your body, the cheese in the intestinal tract without honey directly linked with the cheese will not digest the absorbed poison.

Q: The cheese alone is a detoxifier. The cheese with honey is a mineralizer.

A: Correct. You've got to...

Q: I'm talking about either raw cow or goat cheese.

A: Doesn't matter. Doesn't matter. Any mammary production is going to be concentrated in minerals. And it's [unintelligible] no matter what it is.

Q: And without salt.

A: Oh, no salt, yes. You've got foods and nutrients and fats. Salt. People always say, well, salt. You've got to have salt or dehydrate. When did that come out? It was the... It was that company out of Britain. The one that ran the slaves and did all of that. The Asian... Pardon?

Q: Salt company.

A: They handled everything. They imported the Pacific trades.

Q: Asian Pacific trades.

A: Asian Pacific trades, yes. They were an English-British company. And they owned trading of everything. They're the ones that started advertising. Because they were selling massive amounts of salt. They outlawed the Indians being able to mine their own salt. Like the South American country having their own water. Gandhi changed that. They couldn't even mine their own salt for their own use. But that was another company. They wanted to sell something. When did water become a thing? Eight cups a today. 1960. Bottled water started coming in. And it was eight glasses a day. Before that, you sip water. You know, at the fountain at school two or three times a day. That's it. That's all the water you had. It was milk. Or it was, you know... You didn't need water. It wasn't [unintelligible]. Bottled water companies came in in the 60s. Eight glasses a day. Why? Asians don't drink water. They've got some of the worst diets in the world. They don't drink water. You can't get them to drink water. Except for some of the young ones who buy the TV commercials. But your elderly Asians barely drink water. And usually the only time they drink water is with all of their rice. It's so thick and sticky. They need something to dilute it. Well, [unintelligible] digest it in their intestinal tract. Otherwise they don't drink water. Salt is supposed to be a conveyor of H2O. If you're eating raw foods, your H2O is 100% absorbable. Salt is... sodium isn't the only carrier of H2O. And sodium never works alone in raw foods. It is always combined with a myriad of other nutrients. There's nothing isolated until you cook it. Once you cook it, you've fractionated all the bindings and properties. It's like in my experiments with swordfish, feeding it to animals. They say swordfish is the highest fish in mercury. It's my favorite, swordfish. I said, if you take my swordfish away from me, I might do tests on it first. So I took animals and I fed them. Half of them, I [unintelligible]. I ate it raw with seven animals, and then the other animals ate it cooked. We ate swordfish, we've got one big swordfish, we cut it up, and we fed it to these animals for two weeks. Check the feces, every feces. It contains the content of feces and urine [unintelligible]. We found out that the animals who ate the raw swordfish passed 92 to 98% of the mercury in their urine or feces, mostly the feces. And the animals who ate it cooked, 2 to 8%. There's a lot of mercury that stays in your body when you cook. Any fish that's high in a contaminant will stay in your body if you're eating it cooked. There's also one other little confusion that the government is throwing you into, and that's that the mercury in fish is causing all of our mercury pollution. It's ridiculous bullshit.

Mercury pollution is coming from industry, especially the military industry. Mercury is a by-product of making your tanks and your munitions. Mercury in vaccines. Where do you think they're feeding people that mercury from vaccines? It comes from the waste of the industry. They have mercury for the new vaccines. The same way they're putting fluoride in your water. Because they can't get rid of the fluoride without poisoning the [unintelligible]. So they're going to feed it to you in your city water every day. Every one of you gets to recycle some of that fluoride. And the only thing that the tests show in fluoride that was good for teeth is that there were fewer cavities in the groups that had fluoride. You know why? Teeth were falling out. They had fewer teeth to have cavities. And so instead of having a cavity in your tooth, the whole tooth would fall out. So they weren't lying. There were fewer cavities in that group. But they didn't say that that group also lost a lot of teeth. So they're lying to you. That's the way industry and the government are going to take care of their pollution. They're going to feed it to all of you. And then you [unintelligible] and pass it out. Less contamination, less concentrated. So you've got all that mercury in vaccines and in the air. But they want you to think it's all from your fish. Each vaccine carries 76,000 trillion molecules of mercury. 76,000 trillion molecules of mercury in one vaccine. That doesn't count the aluminum. Or the formaldehyde that's in it. Where do you think you're getting your mercury from? From the medical profession. Lots of fat to take care of all these guys. Lots of fat. And to harness one molecule of mercury, you need 200 to 2,000 fat cells. Or white blood cells, to harness and prevent damage to the body from one molecule of mercury. 200 to 2,000 fat molecules and white blood cells to harness one molecule of mercury. It's less if your body's using white blood cells, larger and a little bit more controlling. Probably take 50 to 200 for a white blood cell to handle. 200 to 2,000 molecules of fat to handle one molecule of mercury. And if you download that, I think you have that DVD from Calgary University?

Q: Yeah.

A: That's a good one. [unintelligible]. Just go to Calgary University. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Anyway, that stuff is scientific and observable. It's there. That's your best friend. Get fat. Get fat and happy. That's a true saying. Of course, it does make things rough for some people with walking and breathing, but still they're protected from poison. If they lose the weight, they may be functioning wonderfully. Salt. Like I say, salt is not a natural substance for a human diet unless it is fed to plants. What happens if you feed the salt to plants? Saline gets so high, it destroys and dehydrates the roots. Wait a minute, you mean salt, that's a carrier of H2O, causes dehydration? That's exactly what it causes. The more salt you eat, the more fluid you need to drink. I didn't eat a tomato when I was a vegetarian. I drank two gallons of water a day. And I needed it, I craved it. When I started drinking milk and eating meats and eating tomatoes and things like that, the avocados are very high in sodium. I don't touch water. This last week I've had about two ounces of water. When I'm in Asia, I may have up to two cups a day. Because I don't have milk. But when I'm here, my fluid is food. It's 100%, the H2O is 100% cellularly absorbable in raw food. You cook, 10% maximum is absorbable. Because you have all those bonds that are functioning. They're split by the cooking. So you're going to absorb 10% of the H2O. You're going to be thirsty. You're going to demineralize your system. The salts are going to counteract the other minerals. So you have all this contrast going on. Why? Because 50% of your calcium is destroyed at pasteurization temperature. So 140 degrees. Sure, your labile point for fat may be 170 degrees. But if you don't have the raw minerals, non-cauterized minerals available, that's the labile point for the fat, for the protein, it's a moot point. Because the other nutrients aren't there to be able to utilize the fat or the protein properly. So when Sally Fallon and all these people talk about the labile point, you know, 170 or 190 degrees. Phosphorus is 98, 96, 98 degrees. Phosphorus is destroyed, it's cauterized. Phosphorus is the most important nutrient to keep you from going overacidic or overalkaline. It's a great harmonizer, destroyed at 96 to 98 degrees. That doesn't mean in the cow that the phosphorus is destroyed at their body temperatures of 101 to 102 degrees, but artificially heating it outside of an animal's body destroys the phosphorus.

Q: It's not phosphorus, it's phosphatase.

A: Phosphatase is the enzyme. I'm talking about the mineral phosphorus that's cauterized. It's made into glass. It's [unintelligible] hardened and porous. It's non-penetrable. That's what happens with minerals the higher you go. At 140 degrees, you have destroyed, cauterized half of your calcium. Calcium is the most concentrated nutrient we have in the human body and in any animal's body. You destroy half of it, and the association with calcium, with zinc, with your B vitamins, with harnessing any kind of arsenic to neutralize it so it doesn't become benzene and benzoic acid. All calcium prevents all of that. When it's cauterized, it's gone. And all of these other imbalances. So cooked food is disastrous when you're looking at keeping the body in an optimum state of growing and functioning. I think we need to take a break. I'm not ready to, but I can see that a lot of people here need a break. See what happens when you get on a raw diet.

Q: [unintelligible]

[break]

A: There's so-called vegetable oils. And what happened when the vegetable oil came into being? Heart disease. Big time. Why? An herbivore, an animal that eats vegetation, digesting animal fats, I mean vegetable fats, has a body temperature of about 101 to 102 degrees. They have the enzymes do dissasemble fat molecule, and keep it fluid in their bodies for a lifetime. If a human eats vegetable oil, we don't digest it properly, so it dries and crystallizes. Hardening of the arteries. Heart disease. Multiple sclerosis. [unintelligible]. How many problems can exist from vegetable oil? And then they hydrogenate it. And it's the same molecular structure as plastic. In fact, that's how plastic was invented. Someone over-hydrogenated and over-heated some vegetable oil, and they had plastic. The guy was fired. But the plastic, you're going to see, [unintelligible]. So most of that oil out there is plastic. Liquefied plastic. And when it gets into the body, it does dehydrate and doesn't crystallize. It actually turns into plastic molecules in the body. No relationship to burning. No relationship to binding with any kind of poison. It is just a plastic structure that's in the body that has no beneficial use. Those that aren't crystallized harden in the system. Now we've known this for a long time, because in tribes like in Borneo, [unintelligible], they're only eating meat, and all cooked. The only problems they have are gout, arthritis, rheumatism, those kinds of diseases. But no heart disease, and no arteriosclerosis. No sclerosis of any kind. No liver disease. Theirs are mainly skeletal and gout, collection of toxic uric acids in the joints. No heart disease. So vegetable oils are not on the diet. Safflower oil. There's a lot of oils from seeds that are in between. They also crystallize in your system. Flax oil, you can take it once in a while if you have cancer. But it's not something they have regularly. If you have it, you better have it with meat or cheese. So that it does not crystallize, it does not stay in the body. The body does not build something out of it. If you have vegetable oil with meat, that meat will not turn into something that will structure your body. If you have it with olive oil, it will not structure your body. It will be used as a protein for detoxification. It will be made into a solvent to dissolve toxic matter that's hardened your body. So, when you're eating vegetable oil, I mean any kind of pressed oil, know that it's going to be for detoxification. And if you don't want to detoxify, don't eat it. Coconut oil is the same thing. Coconut oil is a concentrated fat. It is only fat-soluble. If you have a whole food like coconut cream, so you take the coconut pulp, you know, the meat of the coconut, the mature meat, thick hard meat, and you separate the pulp from the cream, the Asians, they have a different name for each of those Asian countries. In Thailand it's called kathi, and it's the most used item they have as a condiment.

They use it for everything, the older Asians, the new kids that are watching the TV eating Coca-Cola and, you know, Jack in the Box and, you know, McDonald's and Starbucks. That's the [unintelligible], the white thing to do. They're very bad, but the elders use a lot of this kathi, the coconut cream. I use it throughout the book because it is amazing stuff. If you take the coconut cream and you put it on this metal lid, it will turn gray in an hour. That's how quickly it rips up the metals. Put coconut oil on here, put butter, put cream, a day, two days, a week, it will start ripping the metal off of it. But kathi, coconut cream, will do it in an hour, start it in an hour. You leave it on this thing, this will be black in a week. Coconut cream is one of the [unintelligible] cleansing elements. It's better than oil because oil only works in conjunction with oil soluble anything. But the coconut cream has oil, water soluble vitamins, fat soluble vitamins, enzymes, bacteria, it has everything in it. It helps dissolve all properties. That's the best thing to have. And that's why I have it so much in the book. Coconut cream helps cleanse the body of so much. And now the oils, the fats, I don't say olive oils, anything that's pressed are oils. When it comes to fats, I'm talking about meat fat, dairy fat. Meat fat and dairy fat. I don't care if it's from insects or whatever it is. Now a lot of you women, some of you men that have been kissing women, have a lot of roach fat in your body. All lipstick, up until eight years ago, was made with roach gut.

Q: What?

A: That's right. They have trillions of plots of roaches. It's the only substance they could find that was natural, that was non-toxic, and it was white. [unintelligible] roach guts white. So they could sterilize it, pigmentate it, and not cause a lot of harm. Now they've got synthetics and they don't care what happens to you. But at least when it was mainly roach guts, it was less non-toxic. Now they're getting severely toxic. But a lot of you women have a lot of roach guts. Roach gut fat in your body. That's not so bad. Except the pigments along with your lipsticks were pretty toxic. A lot of pancreatic cancer risk came from some of that. But animal fats, insect fats, the best thing you can eat to stabilize and strengthen the body. Butter is utilized very rapidly in the system because liver does not have to use a lot of bile. It uses half the amount of bile with butter than it uses with cream. Cream is very difficult for the liver to digest because the pancreas has to make a lot more enzymes to help the liver break down the cream because it's got a lot of fluid and a lot of enzyme activity which will release the fat from the oil, the fat from the water in the cream. However, before it does that, there's a network of fats that are used to feed and nurture the nervous system. Cream is the only one that can relax and neutralize and soothe the nervous system. Milk will do it, of course, because the cream in milk. Butter will not. The butter gets into the joints, the bones, the skin, where the cream will never make it. And if you're just on the diet, butter is never going, the fats are never going to get to your skin, connective tissue, and the areas around in that area. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Nothing will. Because your organs and your glands are going to, and your lymph system is going to get all of it. There's no way you can eat enough in a day unless you're 600 pounds. Because you'd have enough to distribute throughout the body. So, the way I do handle that is to make the moisturizing lubrication formula. And I've got it in both books. And I call it the moisturizing lubrication formula because for women, the idea of moisturizing is very appealing. And for the men, lubrication is very appealing. That's why I gave it two names. They're the same thing. So, it's the moisturizing lubrication formula. So, if you're a woman, the moisturizing formula. If you're a man, I'll call it the lubrication formula. It's the same thing. You mix eggs and lemon with the butter. It digests it so rapidly that the cells in the glands and the organs cannot break it as fast as it passes. So it gets to the skin, it gets to the connective tissue. It gets to the joints. It gets to the bone. The lubrication moisturizing formula is so important on this diet, especially when you first get on it. One a day, and having it shortly after a meat meal or some people can digest it with a meat meal, wonderful. It tastes like a lemon meringue drink.

Q: I've been eating that for a snack for a while now. What do you think about it?

A: Enjoy it. So that's a way to get that fat deep into the tissue. Because when I was working with this diet for so many years, there was still a lot of skin disorders that I couldn't control, especially in the area of cancer coming through the skin, melting the tissue away, and people with psoriasis, eczema. The organs and everything, they feel better, but they look like that. Skin disorders, rashes, pockmarks, and all that stuff. So, when I came up with this lubrication formula, or Owanza came up with the lubrication formula. Is that what she came up with? I can't remember now, but I think it was Oanza who came up with it and started experimenting with it. It was wonderful. The skin started glowing within 10 days of eating it once a day. So, it's getting where I want it to be. You can eat the same amount of butter, even more, without that mixture, and it will never get to the skin. 

[audio cut]

A: More of this chemo and the radiation in this area. And I got four weeks that I was going to be in town with no traveling, no workshops, just seeing patients in my office. I decided I was going to do a detox, so I got meat fats. I ate lots of meat fats for two weeks. I drank two quarts of milk a day with a half a cup of honey blended in. A half a gallon of milk plus extra cream, and I put it in my hot tub. It kept my hot tub on 24 hours. So I always drank it warm, like 101 degrees, cow's temperature. Let me tell you, I started detoxing like crazy. First it started off in the buttocks and the arms where I got those injections. You know, from when I was 12 years old, I started detoxing heavily. They would hive up, and they would ooze, they would itch like crazy, and then they would crust over. So I took the crusty particles and I put them in distilled water and broke them up and mixed them, got them fluid again, put it under an electronic microscope, and guess what was there? Mercury. Thimerosal injections coming out of there. Then it went from there to my abdomen, and all the way down in here, and it made a huge circle of it right here and right here. That's where I got the irradiation, and guess what was in there? Barium. Because I took the barium when they were first examining my ulcer, and of course it's stored in that area. And then also mercury and thimerosal that they coated me with methylate and mercurochrome. You know that methylate and mercurochrome are liquid mercury. Those things you put on wounds and cuts, that's poison, mercury. It's there to kill bacteria. The pharmaceutical industry has got you to believe that coating yourself with liquid mercury is a healthy healing thing. It's the most absurd thing in the world. What is good is, I'm jumping a little bit here before I'm into a story. It always gets you to remember better. I was on the island of Moorea, which is in between Bora Bora and Tahiti, and I was snorkeling. I got carried away, not watching the tide. The tide went down, so I got caught in a coral. I had to move over the coral with these waves hitting it. This was a huge barrier reef, too, and it was like 12 to 20 feet thick. I had to find a place that I could get through in between waves. I found the lightest spot, but I still got caught, so I ripped my thigh, this thigh, all the way down from here to here. This was in 1996, and I thought I was Superman by then. I thought, oh, I've heard all these stories about the coral. So, on Moorea, it's not like Bora Bora or Tahiti, [unintelligible] white, they're all fat and angry. And Bora Bora where there's a lot of tourists and stuff like that. Moorea is more of an island, a native people's island, so they're very nice, they're very happy. And that's why they're eating raw chicken, marinated in lemon juice.

And they have lots of raw fish to be marinated in lime juice. And I was sitting at one of the restaurants, a typical restaurant there, is this little shack with a picnic table outside and they cook it in their home and they bring it out to you. So, I was getting the raw chicken marinated in lime juice there. And a girl came out and looked at my thigh, I had shorts on, and she said, it was just festering, starting to ooze pus. And I didn't even know it was like that because I didn't feel it. I felt it sting and hurt. And I was ignoring it because I was Superman. And she looked at that and said, did you get that in a coral? With her heavy accent. And I said, yeah. And she said, you wait right there. You know, just like a mother. She went in and got a half of a lime and says, here, put that on and rub it in. And I said, it's going to sting me. She knows. So I put it on, rubbed it in, 20 minutes. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I know that, yes. But see, the lime juice can break that stuff down. You don't have to have white cells do it. There's a chemistry. The lime juice will actually break that stuff down and pull it out, harden the skin, so it'll [unintelligible]. 

Q: But there's an infection present. It's okay to use antibacterial action.

A: That's not really an antibacterial action. It just supplements what the bacterial action would have done. Lemon juice won't. Lemon juice creates fermentation. It does just the opposite. It will cause more festering. But lime juice will dissolve whatever toxicity is in there, so you don't have to use the infectious activity. It's amazing stuff. When I learned that, it opened a whole new world for me.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Cleans out the infection. Yes. Wonderful.

Q: But not lemon juice.

A: Correct. Lemon juice will cause more festering.

Q: How about fungus?

A: Fungus? That's a hard one to do because that's deep under the skin. And all that itchiness is their secretions leaving through the skin. So to get deep down in there, I say in the book to use honey to smother it. And that'll work for a period of time. So the coconut cream is one of the best things that I've found. The animal fats will detoxify you quicker. It will also stabilize the body if you don't use a lot of honey or some other... Now honey is a solvent to some extent. When the bees collect the nectar, they swallow it. They produce enzymes which convert the honey, and it's like an insulin-like substance, one of the substances, and converts the carbohydrate into enzymes for digesting and utilizing proteins and fats. Only 10% will be used as sugar, unless it's heated over 93 degrees. Now a lot of places will heat their honey 110 degrees, 115 degrees, so they can pour it in a bottle and pass. They make more money, less work. To bottle a honey, when it's unheated, is very thick and takes 50 times more time to bottle than heated honey. But the bees will not eat the honey once it goes over 93 degrees unless they're starving. Now a lot of beekeepers say, wait a minute, my hive's sitting 110 degrees, 140 degrees, desert, it's all this. And I got together with John Pauls, is his name, with Honey Pacifica and put a thermometer in his hives in the hot desert that's up to 140 degrees. Guess what the temperature stayed in there? It never went over 86 degrees. It usually stayed around 80-82 degrees, hot desert. They get in there and they fan. They fan the hive. Half the bees will stay there fanning the hive the whole time. So with all that enzyme activity present, honey will help you digest and utilize and synthesize and absorb fats and proteins very easily. You can marinate your meat, your red meat, in honey if you like. It will help digestion and break it down. With white meats, you can use lemon juice with fish. And when I'm talking about white, it's a misnomer. It probably isn't the best thing for me to utilize, but that's what I use for this book. Because even red fowl is considered white meat. It doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's what I call the red or white meat. It's a bad choice, but that's what I have to live with.

Q: Is chicken liver red or white meat?

A: White meat. Anything from a bird, anything from a small animal is a white meat. Pig is in between. Pork is in between. So, I mean, ostrich is as dark as liver. It's as red as liver, the thigh. Yet it's considered white meat according to my system of eating.

Q: The rabbit is considered white meat.

A: Yes. So you can marinate it in lemon, but if it's red meat from a large animal, buffalo, venison, deer, elk, goat, sheep, any of those, you don't want to marinate them in lemon juice because it converts them into fuel or for detoxification. And you won't have it as a healer, help rebuild your cells. But you can marinate it in honey, if you like.

Q: Honey over it?

A: Spread honey over it, yeah.

Q: Leave it there overnight?

A: Yeah, leave it overnight. And you'll see that you can make it very soft. Very soft. You also take, understand that if you take meat and you put it in a, you know, like a 2-ounce, I mean a 2-cup ball jar with a wide mouth, [unintelligible]. And you fill it with meat and you put it in a bowl of hot water that's about 104 degrees. When it gets in, it gets a little hotter than 102 degrees, which is a cow's normal body temperature. If you leave it in that warm water and reheat it about every 45 minutes to 2 hours, then the meat will be [unintelligible].

Q: Wow.

A: Just putting it in warm water. Warm water does it by itself. Then you put honey in it and it'll start dissolving.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's right. Let it leave for about an hour. I used to put mine in a hot car to keep mine. Because I love that rich taste of warm meat, especially the fat. [unintelligible] trick since then. Using the hot water is easier and quicker than letting it sit in the car half a day or so. Then there's one other category that, like I say in the book, I threw in, and that's starch. And some people need it. In fact, all of us need it. The nervous system creates a lot of emotional by-product hormones. What I mean by emotional by-products, when you fall in love and you have all this glee going on, you have all these chemicals going on that keep you elevated. They have by-products, but they don't normally store in the body. When you get upset, full of anxiety, guess what? You have by-products from those hormones that do store in the body. Those waste products. And when they clean out, when you detox them, guess what happens? You have the same emotional experience as when you created those hormones. The anxiety and the trauma that visits you. And if you want to learn about that, go online and look under Elnora Van Winkle. E-L-N-O-R-A Van Winkle. Two words. V-A-N-W-I-N-K-L-E. And look for her paper called The Biology of Emotion. She has two versions. Very complex scientific version with all of the neurological names and by-products. And all the chemistry names and the layperson version most of you would understand. In fact, everybody would understand. She was a neurological scientist at Millhauser Laboratories, Columbia University for 50 years. She was responsible, solely responsible for cataloging all the chemicals in the nervous, nerve, and brain system in the human body. She spent her life doing that. Last few years she found this diet. And she was very nice to do experiments and follow-up on the cancer developments of this diet. And that's how I have her quote down here. Dr. Elnora Van Winkle, all results with remission from cancer with Aajonus' diet are statistically valid. And there was one person that could actually chemically go in and prove it. And she did. She did the diet for about two years. It changed her life. She was in her 70s. And then she found another diet that was superior to this one. And she was dead in a year.

Q: What was it?

A: Instincto.

Q: Oh, yeah.

A: She thought that Instincto was preferable. You don't eat anything unless it appeals to your sense of smell. So guess what she started eating. Lots of fruit. 60-70% fruit. She got really skinny. [unintelligible]. You know, we're not made for a fruit diet. She was such a good person to have around. I tried to tell her.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, because you have to understand. When I was a fruitarian, it was the same way. I had a very sick background. I was very weak all the time. I couldn't play with other kids. But when I had that fruit, I was wired. Wired. You know, I felt alive. You know? Until the pain got great within the, you know, the happiness, the mania. But I was a manic person on a fruit diet. So most of your fruitarians are manic. [unintelligible]. You're not incredible. And they're very quick to anger. I sure was. You know, so when you're having that experience, you know, and she went from a very, you know, sickly person working with all these neurochemicals, you know, in the laboratory for 50 years. You know, so she's exposed to a lot of stuff. So for her, that vibrant feeling, that manic feeling was euphoria for her. It was a drug. And it killed her. It killed her quickly. All these little tidbits are giving you a good idea of what the body's all about. That's my intention. Now, we're going to start talking about foods other than honey. We've been through with the honey and the coconut cream and the oils. And we're talking about the starches for the neurological compounds and detoxification. And like Elnora said, that when these start detoxifying from the body, you have the same experience. The way she found that out was that, and when, because she had a lot of women [unintelligible]. I'm not picking on women. When she had friends that would go through some kind of, you know, trauma or upset, either with their father or their husbands or their boyfriends, for no direct reason. They didn't do anything, but they felt angry with her. She took blood samples and found emotional byproducts that had had, that showed signs of having been stored or being pulled out of the body. And it ignited the same emotional behavior every time she tested them. And she tested them, and when they weren't in that anxiety, she found none of that compound, of those compounds. So it was always directly linked with the detoxification of that hormone, of those hormones that are created during stress and trauma. So, I had found that cooked starch handled it. So that's why I added it to the first edition of the book. Cooked starch, lots of raw fat, so it doesn't stay in the body and get rid of it. However, I found after watching people who did more than eat, you know, they started eating cooked starch every day, you know, some pasta or some French bread, mostly French bread, some Italian bread with lots of the fat. They were still collecting acrylamides and advanced glycation end products in the intestinal tract. What can I, I can't find any starch that we can digest to handle this. We have nuts, we have the phytic acid, then, you know, it prevents the body from digesting any proteins properly because of the mineral imbalance.

And just, you know, lots of people who speak, talk about the phytic acid, they talk about the mineral imbalance. Well, if you've got a mineral imbalance, you're going to have a digestive system imbalance, digestive juice imbalance. You're not going to be able to make the hydrochloric acid properly, and you're not going to digest protein properly from animals, any kind of protein. So, I was, you know, befuddled. Here I've [unintelligible], I need a starch, I've got to find some other source. So I started combining other foods with nuts to see if I could get a way of neutralizing the phytic acid without having to do with heat or some kind of chemical. So when I came up with a combination of egg, nuts, butter, and honey, here, look, and that's the nut formula. It's in both books now. And I say, however, if the nut formula doesn't work for you, if you can't get rid of your high anxiety with the nut formula, then you will have to eat a cooked starch and alternate between the nut formula and cooked starch until the nut formula does it for you exclusively so you don't have to eat the cooked starch. That is the ideal, of course. Most people only do the diet, let's say, 70% to 90%. There's a huge element of them that do it from 50% to 60%. But I'm talking about the ideal because I'm offering the ideal. And if you understand it, you can take that information and go with it at any time to make things more optimal. And that can just make your life better. If somebody says to me, well, if I only did the diet a little bit here and a little bit there, do this and that, will that be okay? And I say, if you only had one raw food in your whole life, that would be beneficial because you'd be adding enzymes and vitamins and good nutrients to your body. So as many times as you want to do it in your life, you're adding to your life. But also remember that when you're eating a cooked food, you're draining your body of your bank account, your nutrient bank account and your health. So just realize what you're doing and be responsible. So you know when you make the choice, it's your choice, and nobody is to blame for your health but you for what's going on. It's not ignorance anymore. And here's what you can do to be ideal like me. I never, ever want to get near crawling on the floor like a worm, in excruciating pain with every movement. You know, that I was in tears and I was defecating and urinating on myself on the floor. Having people that have to, you know, fend for me. You know, looking after me, you know, the anxiety to look at, and if you look at somebody full of defecation and urine all over them and they're crawling on the floor like this, and you see the pain they're in, it's not something that you can go unemotionally through. You know, I've never seen anybody who doesn't do it [unintelligible]. It's excruciating. I never want to get there again. I just want to get healthier and healthier. I want to be vibrant.

I want to be able to do backflips, you know. I can't do them now, but I'm looking forward to it when I get [unintelligible]. I've got my bones down now. Now I can use my hamstrings. My hamstrings were so tight. And after that radiation therapy, it tightened the [unintelligible] in my back. So I have very limited ability. I mean, I can touch my toes. But I, you know, that's as far as I can bend backwards. And that's as far as I can get back when I was a child. You know, my mother stuck me in ballet class because I tripped going up the steps and down the steps. So she said, you need some coordination. You need to learn how to focus on your body. So she put me in dance class, ballet and tap. You know, they made me walk down the wall, you know. And I could never get down unless I was walking down the wall to turn my back. And it was excruciatingly painful. And this was as far as I could go into the splits when I was a kid. And it was painful. I was having excruciating pain. And they didn't understand that because they could, just something could push them down and be okay. I mean, I can get down this far now, which is twice as far as I did before. But I'm starting to feel the pain a little bit right here. I'm not having it here. But it used to cause me such severe pain that I'd go into joint cramps. And I would collapse on the floor. That was at eight years old when I took the dance lesson. And that was happening back then. I want to be able to be at 80 years old and start doing back flips. That's what I'm working toward. So I'm giving you the precise information as I go. So you try to do the nut formula. If the nut formula doesn't work, then use some cooked starch with lots of raw fat. And then try the nut formula again. And just do it back and forth. But everybody should have the nut formula once a week. Before a meat meal or after.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible] taking it after a week or so, yeah. [unintelligible] blending them until they are a flour. So that's a starch thing. It's very important to keep us from going crazy from all of our past trauma. Because that binds with those particular by-products that cause that craziness. And it's very relevant, especially if you're skinny. If you're skinny, you're going to have a lot more trauma. And because you have no fats to protect you, you have those chemicals going into your system, you have no fat to harness it to reduce that kind of intensity. You have more impulses to get up into the brain because there's very little fat in the myelin to buffer it. So that's why vegetarians, especially fruitarians, are so manic. They're skinny, they have no fat. And if you're a skinny man or you're a skinny woman, it's the same way. I stopped dating skinny women after Twiggy. I took her to Butterflies Are Free for the opening. My publicity agent was the head of MGM's publicity department and he arranged for me to take her to the Butterflies Are Free. So we got a limo there and everything. Here's this tall model, this is 1973. And you know, all the [unintelligible]. I'm not into all that, I don't like all that. So I went into the theater and I said, I don't want to go through that again. You know, the lights bother me. The radiation therapy, all this [unintelligible]. It actually made me feel burned and irritable. So I said, let's go out the back. Now the Avco Cinema had just been built. It was the first, you know, multi-theater complex in Los Angeles. So they had three theaters in the [unintelligible]. So it wasn't completely built, they hadn't quite finished it. So the hallways were full of building material. So I said, you know, after it was over, I said, let's go out to the back exit and we'll meet the limo on the side exit. So [unintelligible] Freeman arranged it. So we went out to the back way and I saw all this building material around and the door shut. I said, I hope we're not locked in here. She started screaming and yelling. Justin, her manager, was there with us and he actually had to slap her to stop it. And I shook her to stop it. I said, never again will I go out with a skinny woman. Because I could tell right away, because she was so malnourished, she was just like a crazy person. And I've learned that over the years from patients and other people I've come in contact with. They just don't have any fat to buffer anything. It all is a mountain. And it should be just a molehill or nothing. So, fats, get fat, I mean I keep throwing it in there, get fat, get fat, get fat, get fat, get fat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: [unintelligible]. You have to eat lots of fat or eat meat to do it. Now a lot of people can get fat just from fat. But usually you really skinny people cannot. They have to eat lots of fat, equal amount of fat as their meat. It's got to be a lot. Pound of meat, pound of fat together. It's the way my bodybuilders do, too. I had one fellow, 61 years old. He'd been on the diet two years. He felt so healthy. I said, I don't believe this. I feel so good. He was 61 years old. He was real skinny. He was about 6'1". Decided that he'd always had a fantasy of being a bodybuilder. But he could never be healthy enough to do it. He was very skinny and lanky. So, he said, can I bodybuild? Is there some way you can help me? I said, yeah. Just eat a lubrication formula.

Q: Yeah, a lubrication formula.

A: Every time you eat meat twice a day, pound twice a day with a whole lubrication formula. And your lubrication formula has to be on the high end. Two to three eggs in it. Four ounces of butter. Two to three tablespoons of lemon juice. And a tablespoon of honey. With each pound of meat. Twice a day. So, in two and a half months, he put four inches on his arm and six on his chest. And they told him at Gold's Gym he was taking steroids. He said, I'm just eating raw eggs, raw milk, raw butter. With honey. You know, that's what's doing this. Wouldn't believe him. Wouldn't believe him. So, I just saw him, we just had our last potluck in his house on Marina Beach, you know. One of the big apartments on the beach. He's just so proud, you know, he's so excited. Now he's what, 65 years old? [unintelligible] thought he was young looking. Built. All these women around him. If all of his fantasies were coming true in his 60s, you know. Yeah, that's, to gain weight, some people have lots of meat and fat together. Some people can put on fat just by eating fat. Some people can't.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You have to really tank it.

Q: Yeah.

A: And most people who are that thin don't digest the fat without the protein. That's the problem. You can't digest the protein without the fat. So you have to have equal fat together.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Liver is 90%, 85 to 90% protein. It's not high in fat.

Q: [unintelligible] the muscle meat with liver?

A: Liver is higher in protein than meat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's fine. You just have to eat a lot of fat with it. Because liver has less fat than muscle meat does.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, no, no, no. Liver is highly... It has bile, which breaks down fat. It makes the bile, but it's not concentrated in fat at all. It sends the bile to the fat in the duodenum. The fat doesn't really pass through the liver at all.

[audio cut]

A: [unintelligible]

Q: Wow.

A: Yeah. Yeah, blended it. And put it in a bottle and cut a big hole in the nipple. And that's the way he had it. And this child... Let's see. He would have turned two years old. This was seven years ago, six years ago. He was going to turn two years old in December, and this was September. So he wasn't two years old yet. And I stay with the family when I go there to New Jersey every September or October. And I stay with the family. And this was after the workshop. He came home, and he was sitting next to me on the floor. And his six-year-old cousin, seven-year-old cousin was on the other side of him. And his mother came home with a new toy. It was a board with a cut-out alphabet. So it had the pegs of the alphabet that you put into the shape of the alphabet. Square inside a square, A inside the A, and so on and so forth like that. So she put it down between the two kids. And of course the seven-year-old took it over, and she said [unintelligible], she didn't get one in. It could have been six or seven minutes. She couldn't get one in. And little Forrest was just sitting there so calm and so patient. Encouraging her to get on. [unintelligible]. And she gets up and leaves it all frustrated and throws one of the parts away. He goes, F, B, Q, A, every one again, the whole alphabet. And then identified the alphabet. Mother and father and I sat there looking at each other. And then his mother said, Okay, sing the alphabet. And he sang the alphabet song without a beat missing. And I said, Okay, sing it backwards. Without missing a beat and sang the whole thing backwards. He started self-educating himself. He knows the 186 countries, where they are on the globe, and how they're juxtaposed to each other. And whether it's a monarch or a communist country, who's running the country. He knows all the presidents from George Washington and all the vice presidents. He's now five. He'll be five in December. And he reads eight-year-old material to his preschool. He started doing that when he was three years old. He was fed buffalo liver and cow's milk. Equal portions. That's still a lot of what he eats now.

Q: Any green juices?

A: No, no, you don't want children to eat green juices.

Q: So they're not [unintelligible].

A: No, with that kind of growth, they utilize all of their alkaline minerals much better than we do. And growth hormones are alkaline-based, so they have a tendency to be over-alkaline. And if you give them vegetable juice, they're not going to be able to digest the meat, and the meat's going to be repulsive to them. Fruit does the same thing. You give a kid high fruit, they won't eat the meat because it will repulse them. They won't be able to digest the meat. It alkalinizes the intestines too much. So you have to be very careful with children. That's why in the Samburu families, the tribes, it's illegal to feed children fruits. It will arrest their development. It's like, you give a kid fruit, what happens? They start going... It's like sugar. They go crazy. Exactly. Bouncing off the wall. So you don't want to give them vegetable juice unless they're on a high cooked diet. If they're eating a high cooked diet, vegetable juice would be good for them. They'll even crave it.

Q: How much vegetable juice do you have in your diet?

A: On my diet, well, an adult, that can be anywhere from, you know, one to four cups a day. Depending upon your acidity level. How much alkalization you need. And that's a very important factor. Alkalinizing with juices. And most everybody needs it because we're highly acidic. If you have, let's say you're diabetic or have hypoglycemia. Or even hyperglycemia in some cases. If you have a glycemic problem, including diabetes. You need less vegetable juice and you need three meat meals a day instead of two. Most people just need two meat meals a day. First thing in the morning and late.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Three meat meals a day. Late, seven o'clock in the evening. Early in the morning, seven o'clock. I mean, you can eat later, ten, eleven o'clock, right before you go to sleep if you want. That's fine. And going to bed on a full stomach is the best thing you can do on this diet. Just remember that people who have trouble are on cooked diets. Nothing digests. Digestion stops. But when you're eating raw food, all of the minerals and vitamins and enzymes are there. So the pancreas doesn't have to wake up and take care of you during the night, like people who eat cooked food. The pancreas has to work very hard when you're eating cooked food. The liver has to work very hard. And if you're eating raw food, none of that superfluous work has to be done. So you go to bed on a full stomach and sleep wonderfully. Also, it's very good to do that because if you go five hours without eating, red blood cells become cannibalistic. They start eating each other. And that's like [unintelligible]. Very toxic when the red blood cells start eating each other. The Maasai, samburu and the fulani can do it because they were raised on raw food all their life. So their cells are healthy enough to eat each other and not get sick, not get over-acidic. But our system gets extremely toxic. Five hours, red blood cells become cannibalistic. So never go five hours without eating. So if you normally sleep eight to ten hours, and you wake up like you're drunk from sleep and you can't wake up and you can't move, it's because your red blood cells have been eating each other. You've had eight to ten hours sleep. Why are you tired? Why are you lethargic? Why are you nauseous? Why are you sick? Why are you weak? It shouldn't be. Most animals only sleep... most apes and gorillas and monkeys sleep five, six hours a day max. No more than three and a half, four hours at a time. And that's about my pattern. I've been on this so long, so I'm officially one of them now. I'm big enough to be an ape. So... Patterns of eating. And that is very important, not to go five hours without eating. Now, some people, if they set an alarm for five hours after they go to sleep, they'll wake and eat something and can't go back to sleep. Well, then you should set your alarm for three hours. Wake up, eat something, and go back to sleep. I don't care if it's one raw egg, or, you know, an ounce of meat, or an ounce and a half or two ounces of meat, or a half of a milkshake, or a cup of raw milk. Something with protein, because it's the protein that bottoms out after five hours. If you were 700 pounds, have lots of fat in your blood, it wouldn't matter. It's the protein that bottoms out. Everybody bottoms out after five hours of protein. That's when the red blood cells have to start eating each other to keep the protein level up. So you need to eat something with protein in it. You can't have a fruit at that time, that won't work. Meat or eggs, milkshake, those are all preferable.

I prefer milkshakes because it makes you sleepy again. It relaxes the body. Or warm milk, makes you want to go back to sleep. So, we're going to continue with patterns of eating. When you first wake in the morning, the system is going to be very acidic. Because you've done a lot of detoxing during the night. The body is shut down and the nervous system is detoxifying. There's no light, there's no activity. So, the nervous system does its detoxification during the night. All other detoxification takes care is done during daylight hours. Even into the evening up to midnight. And that's when the nervous system shuts down and starts to detoxify. Now, the nervous system is highly toxic. The most toxic systems in our body. It's the highest organ in fat. 60% of the brain is fat. So that's why a lot of poisons go through the brain. Now, we got a big brain in the last 60,000 years. The more we began cooking, the bigger our brain got. And the more toxic the brain got. So we have to keep growing a bigger brain, the handle of toxicity [unintelligible]. And the increase in brain size in the last 10,000 years is exponentially greater. And that's the highest record of cooked foods up until 50 years ago. Now we're, you know, 90% to 100% of what people eat is cooked and processed. So, even with all this huge brain, the biggest brain of any animal on the planet, and we're all stupid, still. What does that say? The brain is a toxic organ. Very toxic. And what is toxic? What stores in the brain? What helps conduct electricity and transfer light? Metals. And minerals. Aluminum. Mercury. Lead. All those wonderful nasty metallic minerals, heavy free radicals. So whenever you cook a food, you turn every metal into a free radical, because it's lost its bonds, its natural bonds. So it goes to the nervous system, mostly the brain. So when you detox the nervous system, it's highly acidic. There's only a few minerals, like barium, that's alkaline. Most of your heavy free radical minerals are acidic. So when that dumps during the night, you have a highly acidic bloodstream, and you want your bloodstream to be neutral. Your urine, your feces, your saliva should always be acid. Don't listen to these new age people that say, oh, your urine and your salivary glands should always be alkaline. No ape, no monkey, none of them have an alkaline saliva or urine. It's always acid. The blood, though, you need to keep at an even keel. So the way you do that is you have a vegetable juice, a green vegetable juice in the morning. First thing, and you don't wait, get out of bed and go have that drink. You lie there and you're going to get weaker by the second because the nutrient level is going to keep incrementally decreasing.

You get out of the bed and you drink that vegetable juice and you're going to supply lots of vitamins, enzymes, and minerals that are going to get you ready to digest for the day. That's going to pick you up, because all of a sudden it's going to make you hungry. It's going to get things moving, so you don't have to run to coffee or tea or something like that as a pick me up. Hour later, maximum, well, an hour and 15 minutes for some people, an hour maximum for most, you have a meat meal. Meat, it's early in the morning, are you crazy? It's all like steak and eggs. Exactly like cowboys. Everybody wants to have the energy of a cowboy, and that will give it to you. Now, the reason for it is, I talked about if you have a high-carbohydrate, what happens? The blood and the neurological fluid gets sticky. You're not going to think, you're not going to focus as well. If you have a meat meal, and no high-carbohydrate food up until noon, guess what happens? Your body plans on using pyruvate as your blood sugar for the rest of the day. So you'll never have a high sugar content in your neurological system, unless you sit there and eat a whole plateful of fruit sometime later in the day, then you can cause it to throw into that. But if you eat the fruit, you know, once a day, and eat your carrot juice later in the day, it's not going to throw you into carbohydrate-burning glycogen. So, meat meal is very important. Never eat meat alone, because your meat, the body always goes, especially after a sleep period, goes to make, you know, wants to make fuel to burn, some of it pyruvate, going to be made into protein sugar, to run the blood from the nervous system and the rest of the body. The rest of the [unintelligible] fuel for energy, hormonal activity, if you don't have extra fat. Why burn that expensive meat meal? It isn't the most delicious thing to most people. Keep it to a refined place where it will help you divide cells and regenerate and heal you and grow you into a younger person. Younger meaning newer cells, more cells than you had when you were, as you got older. So, meat meal with fat. Fat will be your energy, the fat will be provided so your body has [unintelligible] to transform the meat, the protein into a fat. And your body has ability to do that. You can take a starch and make it into an acetone which is a fat and make it into poor amino, incomplete amino acid for building. Won't be a good strong build, but the body can do it. That's how people survive, eating cooked foods. And the Asians survive on 90%, 95% rice. 90, 95% rice. Well, in Thailand and Vietnam, it's like 90% rice, 5% vegetables, 5% meat. That's about the average ratio. That's not a healthy diet to be strong and healthy for a long time. But they're able to do it because the body's ingenious.

It can convert a lot of things into a lot of things that doesn't come as normal. But if you want the easiest route, I'm giving it to you. Easiest, simplest way to make sure the body handles everything. It handles everything smoothly, conveniently, and easily. So the fat, if you want meat, I mean the animal fats for that meat meal, once in a while you can have avocado, but if you have avocado with your meat meal, plan on getting a little bit hornier because it'll go into making more hormones. If you have avocado with meat. If you have oils with meat, you're going to detoxify more, as I explained earlier. But if you have animal fats, there's a balance in everything in this meal. Eggs are fine. Fat and protein with it. However, you're going to have more hormones developed from it, and maybe you'll get a little bit more horny. It's, you know, [unintelligible] a radical hormonal excitement instead of your physiological strong come from. That's what the butter and cream will do with the meat. Now most people who get onto the diet don't digest the cream very well, as I explained. So if you have cream with meat, you could coat the meat so you don't digest it. So if you're going to have cream, it should be a small amount, or there should be some onion or honey with it that's going to help you digest that cream.

Q: How about sour cream?

A: Sour cream is a little different. It's a little different. It's already partially pre-digested, but still you have to have something else with it. It also will coat, so honey or onion. Now the gorillas, gorillas will go like 28 days without eating any meat, and then they'll kill an antelope and eat 14 to 28 pounds in one sitting per gorilla. And then for two days they'll eat onions. They'll rip them right out of the ground and eat onions to help them digest all of that. They [unintelligible] eat bananas and berries and stuff like that. They'll eat the leaves. But when they eat a creature like that, they'll eat onions to help them digest. So onions help with cream digestion. So that's why I have recipes in there. If you're going to make a sauce, use as much cream as it suggests, but also use it with whatever is in the recipe to help you digest. None of those sauce recipes in there, [unintelligible] two of them. It can be made three to five different ways each. So it's up to 400 sauces. They're all made to help you digest. [unintelligible] just for palette. So I've done that. But if you find one that you don't digest well, then that is one you wait to try a few months later. Doesn't work then, you keep waiting. I don't care if it's years before you use that particular sauce frequently. Don't use it frequently unless you have an easy time with digesting your meat afterwards. If it just sits there, it means it's not digesting. [unintelligible] got to move through. You start eating honey to help it move through. Then you avoid that sauce. You delay it until another time, a few months down the line. Until maybe you're digesting better. For some people, a sauce they may never be able to have because that combination is one that they may never be able to synthesize the enzymes and digestive juices properly to digest. So you just have to be satisfied with some other sauce. But that's not many people. Those people who are highly environmentally sensitive and don't digest things well may need very, very simple combinations or mono meals. I'm just going to jump right in because I don't want to forget it [unintelligible]. I want you to bring that up to me and the best I can answer to you about environmentally sensitive diets. Would you bring that up to me? Because I don't want to go off on a tangent right now. Okay, so you've had your meat meal with extra fat. Animal fat preferably. If you don't have that available, you can have coconut cream. You can have some kind of oil. You can have avocado. Just some other fat to go with it because you just don't want to waste your meat. But preferably an animal fat. Especially butter. Have at least two tablespoons of butter. At least with each meat meal.

Q: [unintelligible]

That's at a meal.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it may help you make some soaps to clean out the body. It'll make more hormones, whether they're sexual or otherwise. Anda fuel for burning. That's pyruvate, if you have avocado. Then let two to three hours pass. Let your body digest and assimilate that. Now, with all that protein that you've digested, the body's going to start doing things that it's not used to doing. It's going to get [unintelligible]. It's going to be awakened consciously. You're going to say, wow, I'm a different person. However, it's going to cause a little acidity in the nervous system. So you need to calm it. Preferably with a milkshake. You don't want just milk because it's going to make you tired. You want some eggs with it so you can get some protein in there too. Heavy protein that's assimilated and absorbed just like that. Because in an egg, there's nothing more digestible than an egg. Egg will even digest quicker, five times quicker than raw milk. It digests two times quicker than kefir. Egg is the most absorbable nutrient that we have on this planet. Egg and milk. This is where you can put your cream in because we want to get to the nervous system. Two, three, four tablespoons of cream. One, four eggs depending on your size. I add a minimum of three eggs. I'm a little guy, but I still add a minimum of three eggs. I have some guys that eat ten eggs. You know, there are six fives that eat ten eggs in a milkshake. Their whole milkshake is a quart. Mine's a cup and a half to two cups. So you have your milk, you have your cream, you have your honey, and you have your eggs. If you add fruit to it, that's a smoothie. But what happens if you eat fruit in the morning? High carbs? Your brain will start making glycogen from carbohydrates. It causes a lot of stickiness and advanced glycogen end products. Don't do it then. If you want maybe an inch and a half section of green banana, that's okay. And that'll help. And if you want to put a tablespoon of coconut cream in there, if you're healthier and stronger, it'll start dissolving some hardened tissue in your body. But don't do it unless you're very healthy already. Start putting a little bit of green fruit in that milkshake. Put a little nutmeg if you like. You're not going to digest nutmeg at all. It gives a good flavor. Just take a nutmeg and just grate a little bit, very finely, into the milkshake, like an eggnog. I don't recommend cinnamon very much because it's hard to get non-treated cinnamon. Your cinnamon bark is black, normally, and they bleach it to give it a red-orange color.

Q: Oh, you're kidding.

A: It depends. It's more orange and brown-orange underneath the outer bark, but they use the outer bark. Some of them are going in and taking some of the younger stuff, which is brown-orange. But when you see it red and bright-orange, you know [unintelligible]. You've got to be careful about the bleacher. They use real chlorine bleach. And then rinse it and say, oh, [unintelligible]. And [unintelligible]? They lie like [unintelligible].

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh yeah, you've got benzene that will form. It's like citric acid mixed with benzoate, you mix it with benzoic acid.

Q: Citric acid with what?

A: Citric acid, you mix it with benzoic acid like you use in soda pops. It creates benzene. Benzene is carcinogenic. The combination creates benzene. They're not putting benzene in it. Benzene is a product of the combination of benzoic acid and citric acid. You never call citric acid vitamin C like the pharmaceutical industry calls it because vitamin C is not ever citric acid.

Q: They always call it ascorbic acid.

A: Ascorbic acid is never vitamin C. Never. That is a misnomer and it's a false advertisement. Vitamin C is a very complex network of different nutrients that make up vitamin C. If you look at the difference between the ascorbic acid and the natural vitamin C, you'll see the little tiny round fluffy looking almost hairy molecules in vitamin C. [unintelligible] hairy balls that look like your children want to play with them and hug them. You look at the ascorbic acid and it looks like somebody has broken glass. You have all these sharp jagged edges and that's what it is. It's broken glass that cauterizes this mineral, this combination, and it is glass. They're just going to rip up the system. And they are 50 to 100 times the size of these little cute little round fluffy hairy balls that is true vitamin C. If you go to the internet and you say put vitamin C pictures or photographs, you'll come up with one of those sites that shows the comparison. And it's astounding what they can call that vitamin C. [unintelligible] because you are not the chemist. You don't know. Unless you're going to look at it. I refer to a book in the recipe book which is the truth about supplement, vitamins and supplements. And you'll see that none of them, none of them are real vitamins. They may react and do things chemically to the body that may be similar to what the real vitamins and minerals will do, but it's no true [unintelligible]. It's like you get vegetable juice, it's a good pick-me-up, it's a healthy pick-me-up. You can go for coffee or tea and do the same thing, but it's not a healthy way to do it. So it's your choice on how you're going to do it. Did I start [unintelligible]? I'm just kidding.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay, so after you have your milkshake, two, three hours pass, or if you get hungry, [unintelligible]. Another vegetable juice. The first juice could be the highest, 12, 16 ounces, depending on the size of your weight.

Q: How much cream?

A: In your vegetable juice? Only if you're skinny, or if you're very toxic you need to put cream in your juice. Or a, well, for you I would say a tablespoon. For people who are very toxic and using, let's say, cilantro in their juice for detoxification, maybe not, you know, except for a tablespoon of coconut cream before the juice. But I explain that in the recipe book. Before the juice.

Q: Do you have butter before the juice? [unintelligible].

A: Yeah, cream is more cleansing, but you don't need either. For a person your size, fine, you don't need it. Okay, you don't need cream or butter, cream or butter before your juice. If you're skinny, you do. Or you're going through a metal detoxification, you need a fat before you drink the juice, because if the cilantro starts pulling heavy metals out of the glandular tissue or soft membranes in the body, then you want to have the fat there to bind with, so it doesn't cause you a problem. But if you don't have cilantro in your juice and you're not putting a lot of exotic herbs in there, juicing a lot of exotic herbs, you don't need fat. So, have another juice, this one could be anywhere from 4 to 12 ounces. Just decrease the amount of juice.

[audio cut]

A: If you're going to eat something an hour or two hours later, and it sits there, that's a vegetable juice you should not have the next day, maybe the next two days. Skip it. Then you go, next you go to, if you have a sugar problem in the body, diabetes, hypoglycemia, whatever, you want to go for another meat meal at this point. So, if you're having two meat meals a day, you know, you're having about a pound of meat a day, it's a cup and a half, a cup and a quarter, a cup and a half in the morning, a cup and a quarter, a cup and a half in the evening. If you're breaking it up into three meat meals, you'd have a cup, a cup, a cup, three cups a day, three times a day, and eat back fat that meat. Next, a couple of hours later, this will be your fruit meal. If you're not having a meat meal, this is the time for your only fruit meal, your fruit meal. So, if you're not having an in-between meat meal, you go from the juice to the fruit meal. If you're hypoglycemic, you're going from the juice to a meat meal to the fruit meal. So, now we're going to talk about the fruit meal. Fruit meal should be, 99% of the time, an unripe fruit. Still keep the sugar down. A orange would be okay to have more ripe, if you're eating with avocados, to get rid of radiation in your body. Or if you're having it with a lot of eggs, or an ice cream, then a ripe orange is okay. Otherwise, you should stick with as green and as hard of fruits as you can get, like pineapple, papaya. Those are good digestive enzyme fruits. Other fruits are for cleansing and doing different things. Berries have very little sugar in them anyway, so they don't have to be unripe when you eat them. Berries and coconut cream, this is a time for a cleansing meal, unless you're already into a heavy cleanse, into a heavy detox. Then, I don't suggest that you have coconut cream at that meal, maybe just a tablespoon. But if you want to, let's say, clean out, let's say you have MS. And you want to break some of the hardened tissue down. You're going to have two to three ounces of coconut cream with a half to three quarters of a medium green banana. Now, whenever you have coconut cream, remember it pulls a lot of toxicity out quickly. And if you don't have enough animal fats in the body, you're not going to be able to police it from keeping it and doing some other damage in your bloodstream or in your lymphatic system, even in your nervous system. So, always have a little bit of butter and a little bit of cream with that meal and the coconut cream. So, let's say you have two and a half ounces of coconut cream, which is five tablespoons of coconut cream. You have anywhere from a half to a whole tablespoon of butter. Anywhere from three quarters to a tablespoon and a half of dairy cream, thick cream, cow's cream. And then a little bit of honey. So, whatever fruit you like, whatever one I mentioned, if it goes along with whatever you need to repair in your body or detoxify, that's a fruit you don't eat.

Q: But no fruit is okay too? No fruit?

A: For some people, that's okay. If it makes them hyperactive and crazy with a little fruit, damages their digestion, they should not have fruit at all. The vegetable juice, they'll get enough carbohydrates from that. There's always carbohydrates in milk. So, there's plenty of carbohydrates. The human body needs 80% fat, 15% protein, and 5% carbs. So, milk is fine if you need carbs. Some people need those fruit enzymes to help them digest, and to alkalinize the over-acidic digestive tract. But some people don't. But most people do need some fruit. [unintelligible] fruit three days a week, I used to do it once a day. Now I can only eat three days a week. During the winter, I can eat, sometimes if it's dates, I can eat fruit every day. But mostly I can't. And that's the only time I can eat dates.

Q: But date is a fruit?

A: Date is a fruit. I eat dates with cheese and butter. And it's delicious. But I'll only eat three big dates for that day. And twice as much cheese as date. And then probably three tablespoons of butter with that. It's delicious. Or I'll make a cheesecake with the dates. Now cheesecake, it all depends on what you're able to do. And that you have to play with. And just remember that your body is not a fixed circumstance. The chemistry is always changing. So if you find something's not working for you, you need to change what you're doing. If you've read the book and you've highlighted the things that normally apply to you, you know where to go. If you're still confused, then you can give me a call between 7 and 9 Pacific time in the morning, any day. And I'll answer your questions, unless I'm gone like today. Then you just call back when I say that I'm going to return. If it's an emergency, then you leave a detailed emergency message with your symptom. But try to work it out yourself. Because I prefer you learning your body better than me helping you. Some people need to help others. I don't want your money. I want you to be healthy and happy as you can be. I make enough money to be very, very comfortable. So I write these books so that you can educate yourself, so you can know yourself. And be your own doctor, heal yourself. Just try to be as aware as possible. But if you're having trouble, or you're very confused, then give me a call. Sometimes if you catch it when I'm out traveling. Sometimes I can never get to a phone if I'm in the jungle. However, I'll run across somebody who's got, you know, a wireless internet connection. And the internet connection will work with my phone line, my cell phone line. So I might be able to send you an email if you're in a situation like that. And I'll let you know that an email is quicker in that circumstance than a phone. But it all depends, [unintelligible]. But tell me that you've left also a message on the machine. Tell me that you've left a message in the email, so I won't answer it twice. So, after the fruit meal, you let two, three hours pass. Now that coconut cream is a difficult cream to digest. It is a difficult cream to digest. It's heavy, it's thick. Unless you eat no dairy. Then it goes right through you quickly, and you cause diarrhea. If you're a dairy eater, the coconut cream is more difficult to digest. It takes more time. So two, three hours pass. Then have another vegetable. Usually four ounces if you're a person my size or smaller, and eight ounces if you're larger. If you find that when you have a meat meal, your second or third, depending upon your dietary regime. It's your last meat meal. If you go an hour and a half to two hours after that vegetable juice and if the meat sits there, then you eliminate that vegetable juice. 

And if it interferes, if let's say your metabolism is getting a little higher, or it's getting a little warmer, and everything's moving quicker, then you put the vegetable juice in. And then it will work for you again. If it doesn't work, then you eliminate it. Like I say, your body's fluctuating. You need to stay attuned to it. Then after that, second meat meal, second meat meal should be the same as the first and the second. If you've had a second meat meal before this one. And the same amount of fats, always with fats. And then it could be right before you go to sleep, depending upon your work schedule. If you're on the thin side, I suggest that you have that meat meal no later than 7, 7.30, so you can get another milkshake in before you go to sleep. If you're overweight, you don't need a milkshake when you go to sleep, unless you're hyperactive or anxious or unhappy. Then you might just want a little milkshake, you know, have half of one, drink the other half during the middle of the night, or have a half a cup of warm milk and have another half a cup of milk during the night. It helps us relax and calm the body and warm milk is always preferable [unintelligible]. Make sure you don't sleep over five hours, set the alarm if you have to. If you normally wake during the night, just have it ready there to drink, pee and go back to sleep. Okay, questions and answers. Before we go into questions and answers, we're going to take our last break. Okay?

[break

A: I think that it takes pretty much a pretty good master to be able to do that like I did with Owanza. She was allergic to everything except grapefruit juice. And then even at the end she was allergic to that right before she met me. So I knew combinations to give her. If you don't have that kind of help and you've got friends who are having that problem, eggs are the way to go. If you've got any kind of a pulmonary problem, any kind of a lung asthma, anything like that, eggs is the diet. That's all you eat is eggs, maybe a little honey and butter, but eggs. You eat every hour to every half hour you eat an egg. And maybe you'll do that for a month, six weeks. Everything is completely utilizable, digestible, and absorbable readily. It doesn't take, you spend all of your energy on healing. Very little on digestion when you're dealing with eggs. That's why in the recipe book I talked about the African-American woman who was like 68 years old and had had emphysema for seven years. And her MD called me on a Thursday night and said, I've got this patient who was diagnosed with emphysema seven years ago. She's been mainly on machines for the past two years and mainly bedridden. Is there anything I can do? I said, well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she says, well, I've got my practice, I've got my family's welfare, life support system, so I have to be very careful. I said, well, that's on your conscience. The best thing I can suggest that you do is you get 10 to 15 dozen eggs, put them at her bed table in the hospital, and have her eat an egg as often as she can, and nothing's too often, nothing's too frequently. So on Monday morning I got this call from a raspy voiced woman telling me, you know, this is the first time I've been out of bed and off the machine, off of oxygen in two years, and I'm feeling pretty good, what else can I do? I said, well, who are you? So she explained that she ate 66 eggs over the weekend, 33 eggs on Saturday, 33 eggs on Sunday, when she was out of bed, and then I knew who she was. So that's the kind of things that eggs can do, and nothing else can do it but eggs. Meat won't do it, I don't care if you purify it, I mean, pulverize it into liquid, into a pate, it still takes too much digestive activity. So the eggs will supply you with concentrated protein, concentrated fat, that's already in a liquid form, that's very easy to digest and utilize. I remember one woman came to me with environmental sensitivity, and she was allergic to water, and her husband was a very well-educated PhD, and when he came in with her, the doctors, nobody could help her, which is deteriorating, which is at the end of the line after about 8 or 9 years. Very thin, about 62 years old, and her husband just glared at me the whole time, very tall, very [unintelligible], educated, a proper man.

When his wife wasn't looking. Gives me this kind of stuff. Kind of hard to ignore, you know, but I did it. And yeah, I put her on mainly eggs. I said, that's all you're going to eat is eggs. A little bit of honey and butter in between every three, four eggs, and about a half a teaspoon each of honey and butter. I can't eat the honey. I can't eat the honey. It's going to cause me problems. Cut it down to a quarter teaspoon of honey and three-quarters teaspoon of butter. And I said, eat it. I don't care if you have any bad reactions. She ate the eggs and did that. She did it for three months. And her health went, shot up. So then we started introducing other food. And we had to introduce them only an ounce at a time, new food once a week, an ounce at a time. And it took her almost, you know, four or five weeks, sometimes two months, eight, ten weeks to get used to ingesting that one extra type of food. So it took her two years to get a semi-normal diet. But her husband's on the diet. And the diet [unintelligible].

Q: Calls you all the time?

A: Well, he doesn't all the time. But when there's a problem, he calls. One time he called and he said, you know, I'm going in for a biopsy. I've got a lump. And I said, Quinn, I just took a photograph of your eyes, you know, a month ago. It doesn't look anything like tumors. You know, I said, even if it's benign, it does not look tumorous. I said, you're going to go through a biopsy. They're going to plug you. They're going to take several plugs. By the time they finish, you're likely to get cancer. So I said, it's a risk. To have a plug, he called me two days later and said, I'm sorry. I should have listened to you. Eggs. Wonderful food. But you have to drink a vegetable juice every three to five days. It has to be one vegetable juice every three days. One vegetable juice. At least 12 ounces.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, that's because eggs have a tendency because a lot of people are afraid of the biotin deficiency. Now what happens is, in my laboratory test when I was working with that chemistry, I found that the link between the biotin and the avidin caused a chemical that was attaching to biocarbons. Whenever you utilize fats in the body, there's a biocarbon left over. Or you're using pyruvate with a fat. Or just using carbohydrate acetones that are made from carbohydrates. Anytime we utilize a particular fat to burn something or carbohydrate anything, to utilize this fuel, we have a biocarbon byproduct, a waste product, like we have gas that comes out of the exhaust of a car. Well, the avidin and the biotin combination are excellent to handle those biocarbons. Because people eat so much cooked foods, they have a lot more biocarbons in their system. Even cooking creates biocarbons. So, of course, people are going to show a biotin deficiency. But it has never been symptomatic in one of the people on this diet. As long as they're eating one vegetable juice every three to five days, then there's no problem with eggs. Sometimes if they don't have the vegetable juice, people have a tendency to get irritable with eating the eggs and get overly hungry, famished. So there's that scientist perspective. Problem with eggs, which is really not a problem. And there isn't any problem with the biotin deficiency as long as you're not eating cooked foods. And then there's the... I can't say exactly what it is. But I think that what happens is the chloroform and the chlorine in the body reduces to a pretty drastic level. And the vegetable juice helps raise that. That's the only thing I can find that happens in my laboratory experiments and analysis of blood and urine with eating mainly egg diet. And the thing that is the reduction of, like I say, the chlorine, so hydrochloric acid is being minimized in digestion. And then I say, well, you don't need that much hydrochloric acid with eggs. So it's superfluous to make a lot of hydrochloric acid if you don't need it. But that's one of the things I found that was lowered. Not necessarily it was a bad thing, but I had to consider it. And then the biotin, the so-called biotin deficiency. And there was just never any ill effects from an all egg diet even without the honey and butter. It's just that you won't gain any weight on just eggs. If you add honey and butter, you won't lose any weight. But some people, if they're eating an egg every half an hour to an hour, they're not going to lose weight. But if they're eating an egg every hour and a half to two hours, they're going to start losing weight. And if my weight loss program in the book doesn't work for you, do an egg every hour.

And I give them one meat meal a day and a cup of milk before you go to sleep and a cup of milk during the night. I guarantee you, you will lose weight. And sometimes, I like the other diet in the recipe book for weight loss because it's slower. If you go on the egg diet that I just gave you, you knock off 12 pounds in two weeks. You know, I like to knock off 3 pounds a week, 4 pounds a week max. Even less. When you go on a diet, like I just said, with lots of eggs, one cup of meat a day, and two cups of milk in the evening and night, you're going to lose a lot of weight quickly.

Q: I just got the [unintelligible]. When I got all the glands, I [unintelligible]. I got some brain, I got some kidneys, but I have no way to preserve them other than freezing them. And I'm like, how do I... I can't get them [unintelligible]. I finally get it, I'm freezing them. I get all this meat too, and I'm freezing it. So I'm like going, well, what...

A: How many people saw me on Ripley's Believe It or Not? Nobody. July 17, 2002. I think you have to call Ripley's, and you can get it. They'll give you a number of people who make it. I've got several people who've gotten it. But I sat there in front of a food inspector who told everybody on this, who was watching the show, you will die if you do this. He is going to die. And basically that's what he said. And I sat there and I ate... I had all along the back porch, outside my kitchen, overlooking all of the forest there. I had 50 jars of different glands and it had molds and parasites and bacteria, green and yellow molds, you name it, stunk like hell. And a plate of moldy steak. And you see me eating this with flies and worms and all this moldy stuff. And I had three other patients who were there. And they get interviewed and you see them eating it too. And it's only like seven and a half minutes long, but it shows my whole refrigerator full of that. It's the refrigerator where I keep that high meat. I have two refrigerators, but they always show the one full of high meat, so they make it look like that's all I eat. And I do have patients that that's all they eat, is the high meat, the high bacterial meat, because it elevates them. It's like the eskimos, it makes them feel high. But mainly those people are people who have spent 20 to 40 years in chronic depression all their lives. And that high meat, the old moldy meat, the meat makes them feel, the stinky meat makes them feel so good. I've got one guy who only eats high meat and eats two pounds a day. And he has no bad breath. He was very antisocial. He went from different jobs, you know, which was dealing with people, very antisocial by the time he was 23 and became a landscape artist so he didn't have to deal with people. After two years on the diet like that, he has five girlfriends and all knockout looking. And he's a bear, you know, this big bear. And, you know, he's an okay, he's about a six out of a ten for a man, you know. And he's got these gorgeous model girls now. So he eats all this garbage, you know, I mean not all this garbage, all this high, stinky, so-called rotten meat. Never goes rotten unless it's cooked. Never putrefies unless it's cooked. Those bacteria, those enzymes and parasites just predigest it. So he's eating predigested meat. He couldn't eat meat before. He wasn't digesting it. He wasn't breaking it down into the finest molecules. His E. coli wasn't working properly. So he was chronically depressed because his nervous system could never get nutrified. It had never been nurtured. He eats the high meat predigested.

Q: Did he take some like E. coli [unintelligible]?

A: He did that prior to eating a lot of high meat to help infuse that, but the high meat works for him. He may have some kind of poison in his, like I did in my large intestine, that created such a problem. Oh, I didn't cover parasites and bacteria at all in detail. So I should do that. Did you want to ask a question?

Q: I vacuum packed my meat. That's a way to deal with large amounts of meat. [unintelligible].

A: Absolutely. I kept meat for... Refrigerated, yes. I kept it up to a year... I have some. When Y2K was coming around, I never thought it was going to happen because I was a programmer. That's bullshit. So they were just milking people. Programmers were taking advantage of all these companies. I liked that. I liked them doing it, so I was going [unintelligible]. But I knew there was going to be no Y2K. But people were asking me about preserving meat. So a friend of mine hunted a deer, so I butchered it for them, and I kept part of the meat. And I put it in, some I put in peanut oil, and some I put in olive oil, and some I put in kefir, and some I just put in buttermilk and plain milk. And I still have all of them today, and that's five years ago, six years ago. 

Q: In the refrigerator?

A: No, out of the refrigerator.

Q: You can still eat that?

A: You can put them in the refrigerator without any preservative in it, and they will keep, I've had them up to a year. But this is out of the refrigerator, and they're still good. 

Q: Are you eating them?

A: No, because I want to see how long they'll last. So I look at them and make sure to see if anything is decomposing or changing. Nothing has. The idea I got that from, I think I wrote it in the milk report that I wrote, it was in William Campbell Douglas' book called The Milk Book. He talked about the scientist that preserved milk, I mean raw meat, for ten years by putting buttermilk at the top of the jar, kept it for ten years. [unintelligible] him try it. But it's been six years.

Q: And in the refrigerator?

A: Just put the top on.

Q: In a mason jar?

A: Yeah, in a mason jar. Only when you expose it to oxygen... That's how I say you have to make high meat. You have to keep opening it, putting fresh air in it to get it to start decomposing. If you never open it, that meat uses up the available oxygen, but once it's gone, the bacteria, the aerobic bacteria that mainly work on it. And unless you're airing it, it's not going to decompose. It's just going to stay. So I had that meat for a year, and I ate that meat a year later. Didn't have a stink to it, nothing. A year.

Q: So it's okay to use a vacuum pack and with the plastic and...

A: Yeah, it's okay if it's refrigerated.

Q: Okay.

A: If it's frozen, it's not.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you don't put the meat [unintelligible] touch the plastic. It's refrigerated. You still fill the jar all the way.

Q: [unintelligible] you a plastic bag.

A: Oh, you're freezing?

Q: No, no.

A: [unintelligible]

Q: No, I mean, when I have too much, I vacuum pack it in the plastic. 

A: I've seen that, I've seen that. I don't like the odor. I don't like the odor because some of those phthalates gassing into the meat. And when I've had that, I've taken good well water and rinsed off and shaved the meat all along the outside.

Q: But as an alternative to that, you're saying put it in a jar and pack it kind of tight...

A: Yeah, they've got those vacuum packers, you know, that suck the air out of jars.

Q: Oh, I didn't know that.

A: That's what I thought you were talking about.

Q: I didn't know that.

A: Yeah.

Q: Is that what you do with your meat when you order it? [unintelligible]

A: I eat it within two weeks, so I don't [unintelligible]. I just put it in, you know, in my glass jars.

Q: Oh, you take it out of the wrapper when you get it and put it in your glass jars?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: See this? I cut it in thin strips, put it in a jar, plenty of air space, and just do not open it until I'm ready to eat it. And if I open it, this is beef. And what I will do is I'll eat this in two meals, so this is for one day for me.

Q: And you got that... 

A: It's two pounds.

Q: [unintelligible] came in a plastic bag?

A: No, I got that here. [unintelligible]. I've even eaten mad cow. Now, I don't have a problem. I had a girlfriend that lived in Paris. So from 93 to 96 and a half, I went to Paris three months a year. And I was eating out of Carrefour supermarkets while I was in Paris. Because there was no other source of meat there. You know, when you get out to, you know, out around Normandy or St. Laurent, those areas, you know, you can get good wild butchered meat everywhere. But in Paris, the only thing that was available was Carrefour supermarkets. And when I wouldn't marry her, she broke up with me. So on my trip home on the airline, there was an article that said that Carrefour supermarkets had been supplying the beef from the mad cow herders, you know, since I had been eating it. So I thought, oh, I wonder if it's going to affect me. But here it's ten years later and I still have a problem. So it didn't turn out to be a problem. That doesn't mean that I'm advocating eating low-quality meat because there will be less nutrients in it. I'm just saying you can't starve. You have to eat the best you can.

Q: On the beef liver, it seems that the store, you know...

[audio cut]

A: Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes.

Q: It's just sitting out.

A: Yeah, in a cupboard, dark cupboard. Yeah, if you put it in light, it will change it. A dark, cool cupboard.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, they had a lid on that. They had a lid on that meat. They had a lid on that buttermilk.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, no, no, no. There was a lid on it. It wasn't open for that ten years. He didn't open it until that ten years had expired.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it's from something that, I think it was from a friend of Vilhjalmur Stefansson's. And when I was going through the material in Dartmouth, I found it there also. And I think that's where William Campbell Douglas got it too. But I don't remember what report that was in or what book. No, Stefansson's. I don't know which one it was. So it's easier for me to reference Douglas' work than Stephenson's. Let me tell you my experiment that I did. I took 14 animals and I put them on frozen meat. Half of them on frozen meat and half of them on fresh meat. Same meat, same animal, same cut. Same cuts because we fed them different ones. Fed them frozen, one group frozen, the other fresh. Fresh, you know, it's not frozen. For, what was this, almost 13 to 14 weeks. Within 6 weeks all of them had signs of skin disorders. They were eating the frozen meat. Within 10 weeks all of them had pronounced skin disorders. One of them had scabies. And the ones that ate the same meat, and that's all they got. They got meat, they didn't get bone, they didn't get milk, they didn't get egg, they didn't get honey, they didn't get butter. All they ate was meat, frozen or unfrozen. Those that ate it unfrozen had no problems at all. And even their coats were shiny and lustrous still. I expected that they would get dry, but even at the end of the 13-14 weeks, their coats were not dry just by eating the raw meat.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It was New Zealand. This was one of the last experiments I did in 93. And still I did, I said, okay, I'm going to take the seven that are ill and we'll put them on butter, frozen and unfrozen. So I put four of them on the frozen butter and three of them on the unfrozen butter. I took two of the unhealthiest and put them in a group of three for the unfrozen, non-frozen butter. And four of them for the frozen butter. The three in the non-frozen healed three to five times faster than the four that had the frozen butter. So nobody can tell me that freezing butter does not alter it. And, you know, Sally Fallon. I love her dearly and she's a sweet person. And Mark McAfee are lying to you when they say there's no difference. How the fuck do they know? They didn't do any tests. And I just chewed up Sally and Mark for that on the internet. And Sally came back and said, well, I'm going to have some of our people eat frozen and non-frozen milk and see if there's a difference. So I have found that it is true. Show me a test that shows differently. Because that's a pretty good test. Three to five times faster healed from their skin disorders. They got no meat. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, that was all I gave them. All they got was butter. And it only took four weeks. Yeah, it only took four weeks for all of them to heal. But the ones who ate the non-frozen butter were healed in 10 to 12 days.

Q: McAfee [unintelligible]?

A: Oh, yeah. His milk is put at 32 degrees once it comes out of the cow. His milk, everything that comes out of hits cow is 32 degrees. And most of it is frozen as it's transported. In L.A., most of it arrives at the store partially frosted.

Q: And then when you do that, then the particles separate. [unintelligible]

A: I tried to talk Mark into it. He wants to do things his way. He won't listen to me. That's him. That's why we get ours... We're right there in California. We truck ours all the way from Pennsylvania. We won't touch his milk.

Q: Really?

A: We won't touch his milk.

Q: Wow.

A: We get our milk from Amos Miller in Pennsylvania.

Q: Wow.

A: There in California. Every week we have a truck that comes all the way from Bird-in-Hand, Pennsylvania, all the way to Los Angeles.

Q: You must have a big co-op to support that.

A: Yeah.

Q: Is he on your list?

A: He's on my list.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, I get my cheese from him too.

Q: I love cheddar.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay, you know, I forgot to do the bacteria parasite thing. People have always said, you know, have you found any bacteria that's bad for the human body? I have to admit, no, I haven't. Any parasites that are bad for the human body? Only one that I know of, and it goes up the urinary tract when you pee in the Amazon River. It's very small, it's about the size of a very small, thin, you know, pin-sized worm. And while urinating, it will go into your urethra, whether you're a man or a woman, and it grows like a fish. And it's got a spine on it, so it locks itself in there. And I saw one removed, and it went from being this thing that you could hardly see, and it can only get into your urethra when you're urinating. So if you're urinating in the Amazon River, it's going to get in you if you're urinating. Otherwise, it can't get in you. But it's very quick, and it goes right in. It smells, and that's when it gets into fish, while they urinate. It goes right into their gill or their urinary tract, whatever it is. They smell the ammonia, and they just speed right toward the ammonia. If they hit a brick wall, it's like a sperm hitting an egg that's already been penetrated by another sperm. It bounces off of it. But if it's open, it can get in there. That parasite grew that big when it was taken out of his penis. It was this big and thick. All these spines just look like a fish crawling out. That's the only one that I've ever seen that's bad. Yeah. Somebody mentioned trichinosis. Somebody said trichinosis. If you read in this book, I quote the gastroenterologist. His name is Joel Weinstock, Dr. Joel Weinstock at Iowa University. About 16 years ago, and he grew up on a farm. He saw the farms at Iowa University, which is a major agricultural area because it's a farming state. He noticed that the pigs at the university were very unhealthy. So he did different gastrointestinal tests on them and found out they had no normal whipworm. They didn't have trichinosis. He thought, huh, I wonder if I give them trichinosis, if they'll get healthier. So he gave them trichinosis. He went in and got pigs on a farm, got the whipworm out of the intestines, bred it, gave the eggs to these pigs. They got trichinosis and they got healthy and happy. He said, you know the human, all archaeological finds of humans show that the human had trichinosis millions of years. It's just that in the last 10,000 years, the trichinosis has been sporadic in the remains of humans. So maybe humans have a problem because they don't have trichinosis anymore. So he went to the FDA and said, I'd like to do an examination. I'd like to do a test with six of my patients. Here are the patients. Here's their history and background. The FDA says, well, you know, everyone has to have been treated with medical therapy and has been useless for at least 10 years. 

He said, the youngest one of these has been treated for 10 years without results. And the other ones up to 32 years. Six of them. So he got permission. So he took the whipworm and got the eggs out of it, put the eggs in, and Gatorade. Gatorade is highly alkaline, so it neutralized all the hydrochloric acid, so it didn't break down the eggs. Now, I've tried to give all kinds of parasites to myself over the years, but I didn't have hydrochloric acid. I don't have the hydrochloric acid here anyway. But I never thought about alkalinizing into the small intestines, too. So all this time I was eating all these parasites and never getting them. All I had to do was put them in vegetable juice, something highly alkalinizing, to allow the eggs to get rooted to the intestinal wall. It would have been perfect. So he did it in one week. Five of the six completely stopped and they were asymptomatic of their inflammatory bowel syndrome. And I don't mean irritable bowel syndrome. I mean inflammatory bowel syndrome. No matter what they ate or drank, they had severe cramping, gas, diarrhea, or vomiting. They lived that way for as long as 32 years. And having that whipworm, that trichinosis, one week, all symptoms gone. However, because their systems were so toxic, within five months those whipworms were all poisoned to death. And of course they didn't change their diet or anything either. So the whipworms were gone and they were back to Dr. Joel Weinstock asking for more trichinosis. So there's your answer about trichinosis. Okay? And I have, I've been using it. I go to Amos and I say, I need some, I need the small intestines of a pig. I've got people who are constipated. One man who was constipated for 62 years. And even on this raw diet, he still had constipation. He would go every day, or every other day, but he would still be very hard in the beginning. So I had him eat an inch section of the small intestine, and he ate that in November, and to this day he still doesn't have constipation.

Q: Is that the same thing as like [unintelligible]?

A: Yeah, tripe, [unintelligible], yeah. Mexicans call it tripe and we call it [unintelligible]. Now, what happened to me was, two years ago, I was in Cambodia, in Vietnam, and that's when I was studying this bird thing, and also looking at the health. As I visited the hospitals and was visiting, mainly I wanted to see young birthing mothers. So I was looking at older birthing mothers, women who had had infants or babies. I wanted to see the health of their abdominal region. Children who had babies from 16 to 20 years old had plasticized stomachs. All of these stretch marks, but they were actually glossy and shiny like plastic from their diets now, of all this plastic that they're taking to other countries and getting away with it. And again, to me, it's genocide. A mother that could be 50 years old had six kids, no stretch marks, and beautiful. So that's what I was watching for. I was there a little bit longer than I intended, because in Bangkok and Thailand, I get vegetable juice almost every day. And I was very thirsty for some vegetable juice. The only vegetable juice I could find in Cambodia and Vietnam was sugarcane juice. The juice was right there on the street. So I went and got some vegetable juice. So I had two ounces. No sugar reaction. So I went back the next day and had four ounces. No sugar reaction. Next day I went back and had eight ounces. No sugar reaction. Next day, 16 ounces. No sugar reaction. The next day, a quart. No sugar reaction either. Wait a minute, how do they make sugar? They boil it. 450 to 700 degrees to release the sugar from the cellulose. So all I'm getting is the same thing I am from celery. No sugar, but I'm getting this juice. So I was able to drink it and I thought, ah, that also reminds me, and this is mainly what the detoxification book is about, anything that you eat when you're uncooked, the byproducts of that food are still in your body. Because there's no way to recycle. There's no bacteria. There's no fermentation bacteria. Nothing, no molds, no bacteria, no anything, will go in there and eat up that juice supplement, that juice product and recycle it and get it out of the body. So I realized this back in about 1979 when I started fermenting foods that I used to eat. And I would ferment them and drink the fermented juices from them. So I decided to do this with, and you only have to do that, you know, a little bit at a time, because even if you're [unintelligible] it if you're not careful. Because, you know, I think that I'm infallible sometimes, because I've been doing science for a long time. But even I am not infallible to this day. So, I fermented... Now, I used to eat cereal like this, and it was a sugar crisps. 

So if I ate a bowl of cereal, like sugar crisp, which is already terribly sweet, I put two to four heaping tablespoons of sugar on it. I was like Hitler. Hitler put two tablespoons in his wine and on top of his cake. I loved sweet things. I was diabetic. I loved it. But I knew that I always drank a lot of milk with my sugar and grains. So I decided to ferment a little bit of grain, floured grain, with milk. And I did them separately, the milk separately with the grain, and then the powdered grain, and then the sugar cane juice. Fermented them until it was so fermented that the alcohol burned my nose. So I drank three quarters of a quart. Three cups. It was a big mistake. A big mistake. I had hives and welts all over down in this area, and it was coming out all over the place. It went into my bones, and that's what started taking apart my bones. And that lasted for about a year. And all that sugar started dumping, and I got diarrhea for weeks from that, constant. And then within a few days of that detoxification started, I noticed a section of tapeworm. Now, I'd never been able to harbor a parasite at all because of all the chemo and radiation that I had. If they were going to eat any of my abdominal tissues they would get poisoned. I had all the direct radiation and the surgery, [unintelligible], the mercury, everything, all in this area. So I'd never been able to get a parasite. So I had a party. [unintelligible] away in a hotel loaded with, you know, hives, and I can't even leave the hotel because every hour just to keep from scratching my skin off, I'd be coated with refrigerated, you know, tomato or cucumber, and every hour I'd use tomato one hour, the next hour, took an hour before I was going to start taking my skin off, next hour would be cucumber, refrigerated cucumber, next hour would be a cold bath with vinegar and tomato. So that's what I did every hour, had to do one of those. [unintelligible] went crazy. So I had this tapeworm in there, and I said, how wonderful, I've got a parasite. But what's a parasite doing in me? They're literally living people who eat only cereals. You know, like the third world people that they give, you know, oh, we're going to go feed them, feed them what? Cereal, garbage food, the condensed milk I talked about earlier. They have the tapeworms. So here I'm saying, wait a minute, I eat all this meat, what am I doing with the tapeworms? And I realize I've just got all this fermented stuff, and that's what I'm detoxifying. So they're in there eating all this sugar product that's coming out of my body, crystals of it. And then about three weeks later, yeah, it must have been three weeks later, I was in, I was back in Thailand, and I got this craving for onions. Who sits down to eat half an onion? I hate them. I mean, I like it, just the flavor, but onion can get overpowering for me.

So, you know, a little bitty thin slice in a whole jar of meat like that, as long as butter and tomatoes and something in it to dilute, this all makes me happy. Here I ate a half of an onion, and the next morning I had diarrhea, and shot out 45 to 47 feet of the tapeworm. And he just, he's all folded up like this. So I got it out quickly, you know, holding it so I don't break it into pieces, because they're all in sections, like a bunch of little noodles, flat noodles, and they're all moving, and they can move independently, and they can breathe independently. So I laid them out on this wood floor, running up and down the floor, trying to see, because they shrink fast. They dehydrate and shrink fast. So I had to measure them before, you know, they dry it up too much. It was probably about 50, by the time I measured them it was about 45.

Q: What color?

A: White.

Q: White?

A: Yeah, off-white. When they shrivel up, they look like a piece of rice, and they all dry and shrivel up. But inside, they look like a flat noodle.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, everybody has all those parasites inside. I was detoxing all that toxic sugar. There was a part that is deteriorating tissue, along with it.

Q: So you're sorry that you did that?

A: Well, I was sorry that I ate the onions until I saw another week later, another section that was moving, and then a few days later, another section that was still around, still alive. He was around for about four and a half to six months, five months, I guess. And then that was it. I had another diarrhea, shot out about 50 feet, maybe a little bit more, and that was it. I haven't seen him since. But since the day that he showed up, I haven't had constipation. When I was a child, starting from about the age of two, I started getting so congested in the bowel that I only went every three to five days. So any time it came out, it came out the size of my fist, even when I was a little boy. So I always bled. Sometimes a half a cup of blood, it would just rip me to pieces. It would come out fast and hard because I forced it out. Because if I let it come out slowly, it was like granite. It was just scratchy. And it just hurt so badly that I had to just take that force and push it out in order to do that. So when I went out and took this raw diet, I'd go every day several times a day, that first one of the day was still big. Not as big as it used to be, but still big enough to cause tear in the rectum. Since I had that parasite, I haven't had it once. My fecal matter never gets larger than my two thumbs together. And that tapeworm did it for me. So I was very happy with it. Very happy. Don't be afraid of anything in nature. You've got to be afraid of man's industrial pollution. That is the greatest disease promoter. Cooked foods does cause disease in all animals in tests. So you've got a problem there. [unintelligible] it into the state that it is with the industrial pollution. Because people didn't get cancer even on cooked diets. Cancer was not a thing that they got until the revolution of building armor. And the people who got cancer were the people who were working with metals. The blacksmiths. Most of them got lung cancer or liver cancer or pancreatic cancer. So it wasn't until we started messing around with having pollutants. Of course there were some tribes that went around drinking and eating clays that had too much arsenic in it or too much cadmium. Too much cadmium in a yellowish kind of clay. Or they were using it for body paint. It was causing pancreatic cancer. But it's always some kind of pollution that is involved in cancer. It is not a cooked diet that causes cancer. Cancers cause a lot of [unintelligible]. So anybody who has cancer, you know that there's some poison in the system. I'll give you an example. A year ago, I lost a cancer patient that I never thought I would lose. She came to me about 36 years old. She was very thin, but very willing to do the diet.

She gained about 25 pounds, which was okay. She was your size. That's the biggest. That was okay. I would have liked to have gone more, especially now. It took her two years on the diet to go into a heavy detoxification. The breast was still very slowly developing its tumors or its hardness. It didn't get larger, but it started getting harder. Then she started going into her detox [unintelligible]. 90% of the people, which is 5 out of 100 I lose, I lose to the inability of them to [unintelligible] stop eating because they're vomiting all the time. They can't keep anything down. So what I do is I take their vomit and analyze the vomit to see what it was that is the pollution in their body that caused the cancer. So I sent off to the laboratory and the head of the laboratory called me from St. Louis, he said, or Missouri. He said, somebody's poisoning your patient. I said, what do you mean? He says, she has 3,000 times the lethal dose of thallium in her system. Thallium, for those of you who don't know, is an organic mineral, or an inorganic, depending on how you treat it, in our soil. It's an element that is soft, almost as soft as lead, and almost as toxic as mercury. She had 3,000 times the lethal dose of thallium in one four-ounce vomit. She was a jewelry maker. She never wore a mask. [unintelligible]. This lady, remember, I talked about the black plague, what it did. And for her, all that thallium collected, she never wore gloves. And with all that metal, that thallium went into her system. And it buried itself in the breast and the lymph glands up here and here. So by the time she got to the end of that detoxification, that was almost two and a half months of constant vomiting, you know, she was able to eat until the last two weeks, some foods. But then she started losing weight in the last two weeks and unable to eat. If she had just been able to withstand another week. If she had another ten pounds on her, I think that she would have made it. Because all of the cancer in the breast stopped just before she died. It had gone to the liver. She didn't have enough fat, so it was eating her body up. She didn't have enough fat on her body to continue that detoxification process. So all the melting of the tissue here and those acids went into the liver and hardened and killed the liver. So get fat if you have the inkling of cancer. Get as fat as you can because you're going to go into a time when you're going to start detoxing and vomiting. And you need to collect it. And you have it. It costs me $2,200 per sample to test it. And it's well worth it because if I know what metals in your body, I know what I can use to chelate with it and get it out of the system.

So if anybody who wants to see, if you have cancer, and if they vomit, save that vomit. Not the first vomit. [unintelligible]. The more it gets out, the more your poison is going to go. So, you know, if you're going into a vomiting spree, let's say the third or fourth or fifth vomit of the day, that's the one I want. And I can use all of them, but that one will give me the biggest picture of what it is. And another fellow, his father had pancreatic cancer, and I said, well, if you want to know what it was, get the pancreas and have it analyzed. Came back with high manganese. I mean, manganese. [unintelligible]. And if you look on the internet, and you find out a toxic level of manganese, like we also have cadmium, and most of them apply to tumors of the kidney and pancreas in laboratories. Bacteria, parasites, your best friend. Molds, another way that the body cleans, molds. Especially if you're dealing with antibiotics. They live in the joints. When they come out, they come out the nails. They come out the joints. The hives, a lot of times when hives come out of the body, it has to do with a mold or a mixture of molds and bacteria. I've never seen molds and parasites mix. But I've seen molds and bacteria. Fungus. All fungus, yeast, or mold. All fungus. So molds and yeast are fungus. So fungus are good for you, even though it's not comfortable and doesn't look good and it stinks. All good. Yeast infections are all good. They clean out certain toxicity. Tissue that has been damaged by something that they normally...

[audio cut]

A: Virus are not alive. So this whole notion that they're contagious is absolutely bull. How can something that's not alive be contagious? It's absurd. I've never found anything to be contagious unless it's crabs. [unintelligible] yeast because they live on the skin. So they can feed directly on the skin, but a bacteria and a parasite lives in the body. It feeds on what's in the body, not on the surface. So it cannot get in and make its way through a channel that it doesn't normally go. It has to go directly into that area. So I don't know anything besides crabs and yeast infections that live on the skin are contagious. Viruses are protein bodies and structures that disassemble particles. There are about 50,000 viruses in the human body. Somewhere around 92,000 viruses in birds. Why? Because viruses usually work in a toxic environment. They cannot utilize bacteria or parasites and molds to eat up the toxicity in the body. So the body makes a soap out of these protein combinations that will dissolve finite particulate. Let's say you've got a toxic liver. Your body can make four varieties or five varieties of hepatitis. Between a toxic liver that can no longer utilize a liver parasite or bacteria to decompose the damaged tissue. So it's going to dissolve it with a virus. Hepatitis. So it's a finite, so intercellularly you have all of these different organs and glands inside the cell. So it's a macrocosm of our... Microcosm of our macrocosm. So they have all of these intestinal parts. Those viruses may be for a specific part of that inside of that cell. In a cell, on a cellular level, they never last more than 72 hours. The detox is over. For us going through a three-day flu is rough enough. Imagine them going through a three-day flu, which it is. That flu's over. It's gone. That particular virus will not occur for maybe ever in that cell's life. Ever, even if that cell lives 50 years. They never need that virus again for that particular particle of that cell's body. The problem, though, with viruses is that it's like any cleaning compound. What do you have to use with a cleaning compound?

Q: Elbow grease.

[laughter]

A: Water. Water. If you look at an archaeological book, what is the first element that it calls solvent? Natural solvent. Water. What is the job of water? It rains, it dissolves earth, rock, plants eat it. Water dissolves, water melts, water disassembles, water degenerates, water causes molds, all kinds of creatures to come into being. Rust is a fungus of different metals, metallic minerals, iron, cadmium, any of your oxides combined with the mineral iodine. Those are all rust in combination with water. When it contains water, it turns into a fungus and that's what rust is. A fungus, rust is a fungus. It deteriorates. Now for plants, rust is a good thing. Unless it's from a cooked, burned, molten metal, then it can become very toxic. That's why around volcanic ash, only certain plants can survive because when that organic ash breaks down, it's a rust that destroys most plants. And in us, it's just [unintelligible]. So if you've got a [unintelligible] with metallic metal in your body and you take it as a supplement, like an iron supplement, it's heat processed and sterilized. When it rusts, it's not going to help you with any blood iron deficiency. It's a whole myth. It's going to put a metal in your body that will rust and contaminate you and destroy tissue around and even become carcinogenic. So any metallic mineral supplement is a dangerous one to take. So, water dissolves and causes molds, funguses, rust and all kinds of things to disassemble. With protein particles called virus, it gets in there and breaks something down and dilutes it in all this fluid. What happens if I take, this is let's say a garage and I've got grease all over the floor here, and I take a solvent with water and I break up all this grease all over the floor, and what do I have a bucket of? A toxic grease-filled bucket of chemical solvent and water. I've got all this contaminated waste. How is the body going to get enough nutrients to handle and neutralize all of that toxicity? Very difficult. That's why when somebody says, when a doctor says you have viral meningitis, you're in trouble because there's massive swelling because of the fluid buildup. If you have bacterial meningitis, you most likely will. Why is that? They will still shove the antibiotics into the person. And that bacteria is going in there to eat up the waste. Why? Does it have very little swelling? Because when bacteria and parasites eat toxic flesh, its waste is reduced to a fraction of what it ate. It's like you. You can eat 14 pounds of food in a day and have a bowel movement of only a pound the next day or even less. Parasites can eat 100 times their weight and have a feces movement of one percent of that. Bacteria can do it about 5 to 15 percent. Reduce it. So if they ate 100 pounds, they'd have about a 15 pound, at the heaviest, 15 pound bowel movement.

Hey, that's a preferable way. Because what we've done is reduced the waste product. Our bodies don't have to spend so much nutrients and exhaustion and energy getting rid of and getting exhausted by putting all that energy into neutralizing that much waste matter as you do when you get a virus. So, virus is your last ditch cleansing. So if any animal has a virus, you can better believe that they've been feeding that animal toxic substances. And they feed almost all fowl arsenic. We grow 8,700 tons of birds each year in this country. 90% of them are fed arsenic. Now, I've got an article that I wrote. The first primal diet newsletter comes out on Monday. And it talks about that, and it tells you which creatures are being fed, which stores, whether it's Smart Chicken, Smart Chicken feeds theirs arsenic. And you look at the different chickens that you're getting. Now, I go for Rocky Junior or Rocky Chicken, they don't feed theirs any arsenic. So there's none detectable, so you have to be [unintelligible] there. And there are some others. But then you have to talk about, are they feeding on soy? And that's a conjoining article that I have in the newsletter. It talks about what happens if they feed the chickens or fowl soy. So you have to find out, the less soy, the better. So the article talks about that. Now this first newsletter is free, it will go out to anybody who might want it. And you just click on to the website that will hold the document. I'll just add a paragraph about each article that will be there. After that you will have to become a subscriber to the newsletter, because I spent so much research and time, I need to get something back for it. And it's something like $80 a year. It's not my website, so I have a contract with somebody.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: They feed it back to cows.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Virus. Last ditch effort to clean the body, and a very toxic way to cleanse the body, but it still cleanse it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Absolutely the most ridiculous thing in the world. How can it live? Every biochemical book you get into says that viruses are not alive. They are a protein structure. They have no signs of life. They don't breathe. They don't reproduce. If you take a petri dish and you put it in a nurturing environment where cells can breathe and breed, you put a certain number of viruses in there, you'll never see another virus reproduce. There is not one added to it. As soon as you put cells in there, all of a sudden you'll find new virus. Why is that? Because the environment that they're eating is a man-produced nutrient environment. It's a toxic chemical environment. Not normally would the cells breed into. It destroys, it's sterile. It destroys any bacteria or parasites of a microscopic level. So the cells go to help themselves by creating virus. So they create an environment. That's all that can help those cells is a viral activity. But the viruses do not multiply unless cells are there, because the cells are the ones that's making the soap, the solvent. So you have to look at the facts. It's like some Hollywood bad B movie writer got into this situation who doesn't have a lot of logic, doesn't step all the way to the beginning and the end of it. He should get paid like a B writer, which is poor. Okay, any other questions? Yes.

Q: You referenced before about the person sending the e-mails [unintelligible].

A: [unintelligible] the juice, vegetable juice, and you have it. Honey, if you can eat it. Or you eat some pineapple or some papaya. Something with enzymes that will help you digest that meat.

Q: Don't you need juices [unintelligible]?

A: It depends upon the individual. If the only one you can have for the first juice in the morning is your alkalinizer, that's fine. But if you have any other part of the day that you're not digesting, then whatever you've eaten before that, or that particular meal, you're not digesting. You have to look at those two meals. There's something you may not be digesting. It may be right within that food that's sitting there that you're not digesting. Maybe you put something with the meat that you're not digesting. Yes.

Q: Okay, so when you say that, I know you're [unintelligible]. How about if you tested other people?

A: Yep, on the diet, babies, children, on the diet, all acid.

Q: What pH would you get [unintelligible]?

A: It all depends upon the individual. It's always slightly on the acid side. Mine is higher.

Q: Below 6, or below 7, or?

A: I've seen it 4.5 at worst.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, but that's the virus again. It's the solvent reaction. Because bacteria and parasites won't get into a thallium-rich or a benzene-rich environment. They can't survive. So your body uses the viral-type solvent to dissolve that tissue. Of course, the acid is going to go way up during that kind of environment.

Q: But they also say cancer cells die when you alkalize it.

A: No. That is so much bullshit.

Q: I mean, they do that in a Petri dish [unintelligible].

A: Well, in a Petri dish, but you don't have a normal environment in a Petri dish. I've seen literally hundreds of people come from the Optimum Health Institute. Tumors growing like crazy from all the over-alkalization. I remember one person they sent to me had multiple myeloma. You know, a 76-year-old woman. And they had treated her, even down to the way she went from the Optimum Health Institute to Issel Clinic. Issel was a famous scientist that had kind of a vaccine kind of work. And he was, you know, let's say somewhere around 56% of the people he treated were able to recover from their cancers. That's a pretty high rate for a medical professional. Normally 17% live over six years after treatment by the medical professional. That's why you use that five-year cutoff. Five years, they healed you. What happens is the next day and the next year, 90% of those come down with cancer again. But because you went five years, that's why you make that five-year cutoff. You were healed by it. I beg your pardon? Well, you should bring statistics [unintelligible]? That's what happens. So she came to me on her way up to San Jose, stopped in Los Angeles from Mexico from the clinic. And I put her on the diet in two weeks. Nothing alkaline, but a little bit of juice for her. And lots of meat and lots of honey and dairy. All of her signs of cancer completely reversed. And in 30 days, Issels himself took a trip to see me and thank me and said, Your work is phenomenal. Josef, [unintelligible], yeah, he died a year later. After he congratulated me and thanked me. Because he was watching, he wanted that patient to live. He was involved with her. He loved that person. He was a good friend [unintelligible] because he had a wife. So, yeah, for her to reverse that condition, he was blown away. All acid, all acid. You don't look at those markers. You don't pay any attention to those markers.

Q: It's almost like you don't want to ever second guess what the body is doing. Because what it's doing is trying to create health. You know, whatever those readings are, it's always doing it on its own.

A: The best it can for the condition with what you're giving it.

Q: Right.

A: So, like I say, if you're melting in the body from cancer, you need as much minerals as you can get, as much calcium as you can get to bind with that acid so it doesn't keep eating away at your body. That's what it is. So cheese is dairy. They even have to keep away from, you know, much of the meat. Tons of dairy, I don't care if it's a gallon of dairy a day, with butter and cheese, you know, just keep doing that to alkalinize all that stuff if it's broken your skin. If it hasn't broken your skin, you're not really melting away yet. If it's breast cancer. If it's broken the skin, you'd better believe your body's already melting and dissolving the tumors. And then you'd better have plenty of calcium in your body, plenty of minerals to bind with. 

Q: I really love the coconut water. [unintelligible]. Not coconut water. Coconut cream.

A: Coconut cream.

Q: Is it okay to drink 8 ounces of that a day?

A: As long as, if you're going to eat 8 ounces of that a day, remember it goes into a solvent. So if you're melting, it's going to help you dissolve, make more to dissolve that matter. So you'd better eat tremendous amounts of cheese with it.

Q: Yeah.

A: Yeah. Or cheese will depend, if it's already in your stomach, [unintelligible], it's going to be fine. Or you can put the coconut cream in your milk.

Q: [unintelligible] casein.

A: Casein. Yeah, it's a protein in milk. And a lot of people are allergic to it when it's cauterized. It turns into glass. People can't break it down and digest it. It doesn't link with its normal minerals and other related conjunctions like vitamin D. So it's a free radical when it's taken from pasteurized or cooked dairy at all. So about 80% or 98% of the people who are allergic to pasteurized dairy are not allergic to the casein in raw dairy. 2% of them still will be allergic because they've collected that casein in their body from the pasteurized dairy products over the years. And when they eat the raw dairy, it starts a detoxification of the old casein. So it seems like the fresh dairy is causing them an allergic reaction, but it's not. If you have swelling of the eyes, the mouth, and tongue, that's an allergy [unintelligible] the raw milk. So you have to be careful of that. If you have intestinal cramping within 10-15 minutes after drinking the milk, you have an allergy to the lactate in the milk. I mean lactose in the milk. So you've got a milk sugar digestive problem. So you just have to pay attention there. And like I said in the book, if you have 4 ounces a day, you can get through that, you know, 4 ounces a day for 3 months, 4 months. You'll break that. You'll have detoxified all the old casein, and you're fine. However, if you have swelling of the mouth and tongue and eyes, about a tablespoon a day, an eye dropper a day for 3 to 6 months is where you can break that allergy. But I've never found anybody except one in [unintelligible] that was allergic to milk beyond 6 months. [unintelligible]

Q: And the lactose intolerance?

A: I just talked about that. Yeah, I said if you have stomach cramping, you've got a lactose intolerance, or your eyes swell and mouth swell. That's either a lactose or a casein.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That doesn't apply in all, it only applies with [unintelligible]. Yes, questions? Okay, we're going to move on to the mini consults. How many people are getting mini consults? One, two, three, four, five. I'll be quick. We've got ten minutes now. Do people have recorders to record? Do you have a recorder? Anybody else? If you don't have a recorder, you're having it done. So the three people that don't have recorders, find a partner that will write this information, that can write fast because I talk fast. You're going to need to write it down.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: There's a lot of people that need to move fast. Why do you have to leave first? Okay, you have to leave. Who was it? You have to leave fast, I know.

Q: This lady over here, she's left her mom up in Mars Hill all day.

A: Okay. I'll do her first. I'm going to steal someones chair here. [unintelligible]. Okay, relax. The left ovary is pretty sound. The left adrenal gland is only functioning by 10 percent. It's probably got about 40 percent dead tissue in there. So there's some kind of chemistry in those [unintelligible]. This side of the pancreas is about 85 percent dead. So that's a problem. Left thyroid is excellent. Parathyroid is excellent. Tonsil area okay. Right ovary is in pretty good shape. The right adrenal gland is only working by 30 percent. But it's in good shape. So there must be some kind of chemistry in the adrenal. This is the right side of the pancreas. And it's about only 25 percent dead. So that's pretty good. Right thyroid is okay. Parathyroid is pretty good. Tonsil area is okay. Red blood cell count is fine. White blood cell count is a little high at this. And lots of lymphatic congestion all over. You've got a terrible lymphatic system. Hardened, not breaking down the hardened fat. That egg diet I talked about? With meat, a cup of meat, somewhere around 7 o'clock in the evening. A cup of milk for dinner, a cup of milk at night. That's about all you need to do. For about four months, you'll lose probably about 60 pounds. [unintelligible]. This lymphatic congestion [unintelligible] high blood pressure when you've got this much weight. People who have high blood pressure have high blood pressure for a reason. Either their veins are going to collapse or they've got too much weight and they need to make the pressure higher. You're just going to be like a limp noodle, you know, if you take those things. You know, it's better to have the high blood pressure, have everything moving. The best way off is just to start eating that egg diet, you [unintelligible]. And that may be what's causing the adrenals to collapse, because if you start having energy and do things, you might have a cardiac arrest. It happens. They've lowered the blood pressure, so it happens. The veins aren't expanding as much as they need to be, and the [unintelligible] weakens, starts exercising, and those veins aren't wide enough to collapse or cause a spasm in the heart. And it's a Charley horse in the heart, what happens if you have a Charley horse in the heart? That's it, you're dead. Cardiac arrest. You know, you want high blood pressure if you're overweight. You've got to have high blood pressure. That's why almost everybody, 95% of the people I've ever met with high blood pressure were overweight. [unintelligible] overweight for a reason. What you need to do is in the new book version of We Want to Live, look under lymphatic congestion and do the lymphatic baths. You may feel absolutely like a limp noodle when you get out. You move slow as a turtle. You might have, you know, a little bit of milk or something in there.

And if you drink the formula just before you get in, you shouldn't have that problem. Then you bundle up with heavy clothes and you take a snail walk for about 45 minutes. And that will clear that. So you won't contain so much of that. But the egg should give you all the nutrients that you need to start moving your lymphatic system. Because right now your lymphatic system isn't moving. It breaks down fat enough that it's not holding in the lymphatic system. But when it dumps it in the connective tissue, just perspiring out through the skin, it's not doing it. It's locking it in an [unintelligible] environment. And the hot baths will help melt it down to where you can start eliminating it. But you only do that bath two days a week. Never closer than three days apart. Dietarily, just do the egg and meat and milk diet for four to six months. Vegetable juice [unintelligible] every three days. Vegetable juice, I'm going to suggest, would be 90% celery and 10% parsley. And have about 16 ounces every three days. About once every three weeks, I like to have eight ounces of carrot juice with two ounces of coconut cream and one ounce of dairy cream. Just to give your liver a little extra vitamin A or carotene to make vitamin A. Help the liver a little bit. And I don't know what it's going to look like at that time, so you give me a call in six months if you need help. Otherwise, you may not need my help. Okay? You're welcome.

[unintelligible chatter]

A: Okay. Left ovary, fifty percent dead. Only about ten percent working. Very cold. The left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Left side of the pancreas. Only about ninety percent alive, but only about forty percent working. So it won't take much. You just need the right chemistry to get that going again. The right ovary. I believe sixty-five percent alive, but only working by about twenty-five, thirty percent max. The adrenal gland. Fifteen percent dead. Hardened. But very cold. It's not working very well. The right side of the pancreas. Forty percent dead, sixty percent alive, and sometimes it doesn't [unintelligible]. The right thyroid is pretty lax. Parathyroid is very good. Tonsil area is poor. Left side thyroid area is okay. Parathyroid is excellent. Tonsil area is okay. Very poor circulation all throughout the torso. Red blood cell count is okay, but the red blood cells are somewhat [unintelligible]. You've got aluminum all through your body. Aluminum everywhere. That aluminum destroys the zeta potential. Zeta potential is the ability for nutrients to stay suspended in fluid. So it's neurological fluid, all of it...

[audio cut]

A: Spleen. Lots of metals in the spleen. Bone marrow looks okay. So it must be the heavy metals that you have in the spleen. So when the spleen is holding the blood, the spleen does not create blood. Blood is grown in the bone marrow. All the spleen does is hold excess blood, about a pint and a half for most people. If you're a larger person, you can hold up to a quart. But what it does, let's say you get a cut and you bleed, the spleen has this reserve of blood dumped back in the bloodstream so you don't get anemic and so you can outrun an [unintelligible]. So you don't get eaten. Or you, let's say, get very cold and your blood's too thin, the kidney will filter out water and your spleen will dump more red blood cells to thicken your blood to keep you warm. So that's the activity of the spleen. If it's highly metal-contaminated, the metal's going to leach into the blood cells that are sitting inside of it and that'll weaken those blood cellss so when they get it back into the bloodstream, they're not going to transport oxygen as well. So you've got like a secondary anemia. Even if you have the right red blood cell count, the red blood cells aren't very strong. Coconut cream will help remove that. Beets and coconut cream together. Once in a while, let's say, two ounces of shredded beets with about two ounces of coconut cream. You can do that once a week. Then also once a week, about three days apart from that, you can do two ounces of beet juice with two ounces of coconut cream. That'll help break that metal down in the spleen. It may be a little too acrid for you, so add two ounces of carrot juice to either one of those two. If it's the grated beet, still two ounces of carrot juice will do. I recommend your other vegetable juice be 80% celery, 15% parsley, and 5% raspberry puree. So you get raspberries, you put them in a blender, blend it, and pour it into your vegetable juice. Start pulling out some of that toxicity. [unintelligible] cooked, so try it one time with a tablespoon of raspberries in that mixture of vegetable juice. If you have a reaction, then use one raspberry to break it [unintelligible]. [unintelligible]. With this kind of poisoning all over the system, I'm going to suggest the egg diet for you for at least two and a half months. When you have the vegetable juice, have that vegetable juice once every... you could use it every two days. There's only one raspberry in there at first, just to make sure.

And have an egg... I would say go every... have the egg... first week in the morning, days when you have the juice, you have the juice, about 10 to 12 ounces. Hour later, you have an egg. Forty-five minutes later, have an egg. Half an hour later, an egg. Half an hour later, an egg. Then two cycles with an egg every hour. Then four cycles with an egg every half hour. So keep it rotating like that. Then when you get into the evening, whatever meat you can handle. I don't care if it's marinated fish, with lemon juice, or chicken or beef, whatever it is. Cup, cup and a quarter of that. A cup of milk before you go to sleep. And I'd say definitely eat during the night, something. And do that egg diet until you can get enough protein and fats in your body that you have a better chemistry. Do you like honey and butter? Can you handle that okay?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: So I would say just the eggs, the meat and the milk. Just do that for about two and a half months. It may take up to three months, but I think about two and a half months from what I see. And you should be pretty regulated where you start adding butter or cream or something else without causing a reaction 36 hours later. Because your system is slow to react, it looks like. But then you still have to suffer the reaction for a while. So that should pretty well handle it for you. But like I said, when you have the vegetable juice with the coconut cream, that's only like every other day. But you're only going to have that two days a week and not three days a week. [unintelligible]. So you're not having the beet and the carrot and the coconut cream. You have the one raspberry with celery and parsley. You'll follow the recipe in the recipe book. It tells you how to do a mix of lime juice with coconut cream that will last six, seven weeks. I've had it last up to three months. Don't throw away anything that's fermented like that, including milk. It just digests better. Coconut cream is great toothpaste when it's fermented like that. It's also even a better cleanser. So don't throw that stuff away. You know, after about two and a half months, I suggest you give me a call. Adjust it a little bit more. I'm not sure how you're going to react. Before you call me, experiment with adding the butter to the meat. Another meat meal in the morning. But do one at a time. For about five days maximum. Five days [unintelligible] to see if you have a reaction. That works out after five days, add another half a cup of meat in the morning. That works out after five days to add butter, add a tablespoon of butter to that. That works out, add another half a cup of meat in the morning. Then another tablespoon of butter added like that. Maybe in a year you can get up to the point where you can handle honey. Alaso... Anybody know about chemtrails? The streaking in the sky. High barium and aluminum. They're great precipitators. The combination is radioactive. We're breathing that stuff in every time they dump. You just may be a person who can't handle the aluminum. The raspberries help you handle the aluminum and the coconut cream. But I don't want to put the two together yet. You're welcome.

[unintelligible chatter]

A: The left testicle is about 50% hardened. It doesn't look like it's working very well. The left adrenal gland is hardened. It's working fairly well. The left side of the pancreas is about 70% hardened. That's a problem. The right thyroid, left thyroid is barely working. Parathyroid is barely working. The tonsils are barely working. So you've got a real glandular problem. The right testis is about 50% hardened and about 20% protein deficient. The right adrenal gland is okay. The right side of the pancreas is about 90% hardened. That's about 80% hardened. So you've got a real pancreatic problem. The right thyroid is okay. Parathyroid is very poor. Tonsil area is very poor. Lymphatic congestion everywhere. Are you a vegetarian?

Q: No, I'm not a vegetarian.

A: [unintelligible]. It tells me you're not assimilating the meat. You're not digesting the meat. Have you tried eating raw?

Q: Yeah.

A: That's better for you?

Q: Yeah.

A: Do you get better energy from it?

Q: I believe so.

A: Because so many of your glands, more than 60% of your glands are not functioning. And also you're just shriveling up, your whole torso area. It's like you're shriveling like a raisin. Or like a [unintelligible]. And you're both protein and fat deficient. You're not drying out like it's just a fat deficiency. It's almost like a big protein deficiency and a little fat deficiency. So you've had a problem with protein absorption and digestion for probably almost 25 years. Long enough to fight your way here. You've got to see the journey back. Even digesting the raw meat, you're going to have difficulty with. So, what I'd like you to do, is you do an egg diet too. To get those proteins, you know, already dissolved proteins. What I'd like you to do is have three half cup, or a little bit more half than half cup, meat meals a day. So they're small. And always have a, never have butter with your meat. For you, yeah. I want you to have eggs with your meat, like steak tartare. I want you to have eggs, and more eggs, and meat and eggs together, eggs and more meat. I would like you to have a vegetable juice, two times a day, only make the first one, eight ounces, and the one about, somewhere around five o'clock, should be 12 ounces. Normally that's backwards from how I do it. But you're backwards [unintelligible]. So, what you might do is have like, six volume ounces of meat, first thing in the morning, after your vegetable juice, then eggs, eggs, eggs, and then somewhere around, one, two o'clock, you have another, half cup to six ounces volume, volume ounces of meat again, and then after your juice, one and a half, two hours after your juice, you have another meat meal, but just under a half a cup. So it's about three volume ounces. That's about 12 ounce juice. After you have the 12 ounce juice, I want you to consume two eggs. 30 minutes after you finish, you have one egg, the next 30 minutes another egg, the next 30 minutes your meat meal. Okay? Then, in the evening, I'd like you to have a milkshake. Even if you have stomach cramping from it, I'd still like you to plan for it, you know, an hour to 15 minutes before you're going to go to sleep, in case you have to deal with some cramping. I'd like you to have one night, two eggs in it, the next night, three eggs in it. I'd like you to have five ounces of milk, three, two and a half ounces of cream, when you have three eggs, three ounces of cream, when you have two and a half, two eggs. So then, up to two tablespoons of honey. It may be very sweet, but that's okay, you need it. And then, what you do is leave about a quarter of a cup of that for during the night. Okay? And down it with another egg. Down the egg first, and down the cup, the quarter cup of milkshake after that. Okay?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: There you go. Do you mind the eggs rocky style?

Q: No.

A: Rocky style, sucking them out. Try and find the eggs with chickens or feeders that have the least soy. Can you rest that on there? I'm just asking. Left ovary is in pretty good shape, but it's not working. Left thyroid is about 50% hardened. Left side of the pancreas is about 80% hardened. Left thyroid is good. Parathyroid is excellent. Tonsil area is pretty good. Right ovary is probably 70% hardened. Adrenal gland is about 50% hardened. Right side of the pancreas is about 20% hardened. [unintelligible]. Right thyroid is barely working. Parathyroid is okay. Tonsil area okay over here. Smoker? Did you grow up around a smoker? Is your parent a smoker [unintelligible]?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, it doesn't make any difference. You suck in enough. You've got benzene. You've got saltpeter. That's what's causing your [unintelligible] pain. You didn't have enough fat to bind anything else. Poisonous cells in that area. It's already moving out of your body, so there's no point in trying to force it out. It's already moving. And since it's on the move, it's a little too radical. I'm going to suggest that you do three quarts of milk a day. I'd like you to eat about a half a pound of cheese a day, but I'd like you to eat it a tablespoon at a time. So every hour and a half, you eat a tablespoon of cheese. And if you have a tendency toward constipation, you need an equal amount of butter with it. Then, I don't want you to eat much honey. I want you to eat honey twice a day with two of the tablespoons of cheese. That will help re-mineralize the minerals for your system. That will be to start with. Then, after a week, I'd like you to have three times a day a tablespoon of cheese with a teaspoon of honey. Only a teaspoon of honey. The honey, right now, will cause too much dissolution. We don't want to cause that [unintelligible]. You just need the minerals to be binding with it. So, I'd like you to have... What I'd like you to do is start the day off with... Wake up and have... I'd like you to have six ounces of carrot juice with two ounces of coconut cream, two ounces of dairy cream every four days. Then, after that, I'd like you to have two eggs, rocky-style, about 40 minutes later. Then, a half an hour after that, you start drinking milk. I don't care if it's every, you know, 20 minutes, you're having a half a cup or a cup. I'd like you to have at least three quarts a day. A gallon a day would be fine. But at least three quarts a day. Then, after you drink about a quart and a half, I want you to do a series of eggs. Every half an hour, an egg. Every half an hour until you get four eggs. Then I want you to go into another quart to a quart and a half of milk again. Four eggs again every half hour. Milk again, four eggs. And then you go to sleep, and you wake up and you have milk, and you go back to sleep. And that's your cycle. And the cheese will just [unintelligible]. You know, in between something you're eating. Like, it's in between the... You don't have it around the eggs very often. When you're doing the cycle of four every half hour, what you can do is, about after you've had two eggs, have a tablespoon of your cheese. Fifteen minutes after that, you're going to have an egg again. And go through two eggs. And then do your cheese again, two eggs. And then you're back into the milk again. And do the milk, the cheese and the milk any time. 

You're going to need the juice every fourth day. So, let's say you're doing the carrot juice, the coconut cream, and dairy cream. You could have a teaspoon of honey in that. You're going to need a teaspoon of honey in that. Then two days later, a vegetable juice. Greens. Let's say 80% celery. I'd like you to have 10% cilantro, cilantro 10%.
