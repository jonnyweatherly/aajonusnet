A: I got into health because I was a very sick individual. I was born in a very violent household. I had a brother who was only 18 months older than I and still in diapers. So when I took my mother's attention away in a snap of a finger, he was not happy. See, he tortured me every day of his life and my life. Up until he went into the Vietnam War when I was 15 and a half. And he did such things like push me on rusty nails and rakes and stuff like that. My mother was a nurse, so she panicked, very afraid of tetanus. So I was getting tetanus shots every six months. So by the time I was 18 months old, I had my third tetanus shot. And it caused me to develop autism. So within two days of the vaccine, the mercury had gone to my brain and destroyed the neurons going to the communication center. So I was unable to address symbols with language. So I never learned languages until I was 22 years old until the autism shut down when I started drinking raw milk and raw carrot juice. In between all of that, I just got sicker and sicker because medication was heavy. It was the era, born in the 40s, mid-40s. That was the era where we had canned foods. World War II was basically started to bring in canned food. That was all they were promoting. That was the only thing they were promoting. Yeah, I mean, there was big money in war. Every time you blow up a bomb, it was like $100,000. Now it's like a million dollars for every bomb that's dropped. There's big money for blue-chip stock in war. So that's why they keep wars going. Bush family owns the Carlisle Group, and they sell bombs and weapons. So every bomb dropped is a million dollars profit. Not a million dollars profit, it's a million dollars sales, and they make about half of that in profit. So there's big profit in it. But for other industries, the king and queen of England, they own 70% of all manufacturing in the world, including in the States. They own Purina, General Mills, General Foods, all the big companies. Well, that was the advertising in World War II. Support your loved ones fighting the war. Buy canned foods, Campbell's and all of them. What does canned food have to do with these people fighting a war? Yeah, they live on rations, but what's that got to do with your health?

But that was the big ad verbs on all radio networks and billboards all over every country. Eat canned foods. Support the troops. Eat canned foods. What happened from the canned food industry? What was the big epidemic? You know, when canned foods came in in 45, went big in 48. What did we get out of that? What was the next two epidemics? All through the 50s, late 40s, and 50s, and early 60s. Polio was one. Tonsillitis was the other. Metal poisoning went to the tonsils, because the tonsils are part of the lymphatic system that guards the brain. So anything that you eat that's contaminated, the tonsils are supposed to absorb it, neutralize it, send it out through sweat, out your neck or your head. And that eliminates the problem. But heavy metal poisoning was big. Tin is a very toxic substance. But it's what they used to make tin cans, and that's why they called them tin. Only 10% tin in a can. Other metals were involved in that. But they only used about 7% to 10% to harden the metal, to make a very thin metal hard. Tin is next to lead and mercury and thallium, it's the most toxic metal there is. Metal was going in, poisoning the tonsils and spinal cord. And that's what polio was. Poliomyelitis is a virus. Viruses are not alive. That's all fiction. Any time you see these new little images of a virus that look alive, like they're round with these little hairs coming out, it's all computer-generated just like Disney computer generates fictional images. These are not photographs. These are generated images. Whenever I was in the lab for 10 years working with a virus, there was never a body to be found. There was a waste, a solvent that dissolved dead cells, dead animal cells, no matter if it was a human or another animal. And there you had the waste of the cell that was present, plus a solvent, like muriatic acid, in this. So there was no living organism that causes that kind of a detox. That is the worst a detox you can have. If you have a bacterial detox, which is normal, we have 260 bacterial genes to every one human gene. You're not even 0.01% human. You are all bacterial. Everything, your smile, your laugh, your tears, 99% bacterial generated.

So why do we go to destroy bacteria? It's counterproductive, isn't it? Why do we cook the foods to get rid of bacteria? It's counterproductive. Your entire digestive tract functions on bacteria. There you have like 350 bacterial genes to every one human gene in your intestinal tract. The only time you use digestive juices like hydrochloric acid is to break down larger particles of food. You eat a raw egg, you don't need hydrochloric acid. Milk, very little hydrochloric acid. But when you eat meat, you need lots of hydrochloric acid unless you chew it until it is completely minced. Then you don't need hydrochloric acid. So if you eat everything liquid, let's say you take your meats and you chop them up, put them in a food processor and grind them until they are minced or pated, you don't need hydrochloric acid. You've reduced the amount of energy that your body has to spend on digestion considerably. Like if I eat all of my meat pated, I only sleep three and a half hours a day. If I eat chunks of meat, even though I chew it well, I'll sleep an hour to an hour and a half more daily. So I conserve my energy on digestion and can use it for other things. So, bacteria is a major part of functionality. The medical profession gives you just the opposite view. They tell you bacteria is your enemy. And they've set their whole premise on the bacteria theory. And it's bunk. Because it doesn't prove well. In 1957, I remember my mother telling, in 1956, my mother talking with a doctor about the occurrence of cancer in the human population. And it was 1 in 10,000. Now it's 1 in 3 in females, and 1 in 2 with males. That's pretty radical. Big change. So following the medical model is no answer to health. They have a vested interest in making money. They're a corporation, just like anything else. The hospitals, all of them, are geared toward profit. If you're healthy, they don't make money. And they know that. And pharmaceutical houses pay these scientists to make drugs that are addictive. So you will have the exact symptoms magnified when you stop taking the drug. And we're not talking about magnified one or two times. We're talking four to five times. 

Take, for example, all these high school killings. Every one of those assaulters had been on psychotropic medication for over a year and were on withdrawal in the last two weeks before they went in there and gunned everybody down. Laboratory animals on those drugs would go into homicidal activity in the same time. They'd kill anybody in the cage with them. They would fight until they killed everybody and even themselves by ripping the cage and ripping their mouths apart and bleeding to death. Pharmaceutical houses know this. The government knows this. But all of our senators and all of our congresspeople, their main stockhold is in pharmaceuticals. So it's a very controlled environment. They want us to be in this medical model. Now think about vaccines. Let's take vaccines as the worst item that's in the medical profession. We have five main ingredients. You can have up to 63 so-called inert ingredients, but you have five main ingredients. Liquid mercury, liquid aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, and detergents. All of them are highly toxic, mercury being the worst. In the workshop, I'll show you a video taken from Alberta University and shows you what happens to mercury, not even in contact, but in a space this far away from the neuron, when mercury is introduced into the petri dish. And you see the mercury way over here and the neurons just start disintegrating instantly. In fact, mercury is the worst neurotoxin on the planet. It damages neurons worse than radioactive material. Radioactive material is very harmful because it keeps cells from regenerating. It completely stops DNA activity, whereas mercury absolutely dissolves it, disintegrates it. So that's in vaccines. And then they say mercury-free, it's a lie. They've reduced it and called it by another name. They have 11 names for a mercury additive, or they call it adjunct. Yes?

Q: Is it true that in some fish there's also mercury, like tuna?

A: Yes, but it's already biochemically solid in impact and won't harm you if you eat it raw. Once you cook it, you fractionate that bond, so then it becomes dangerous again. When you eat, like, sushi, sashimi, you're not going to have that same reaction. You can have some toxicity from it, depending upon how your body handles it, but most of it won't be. 92% of my laboratory experiments showed that it passed out of the body, 92% of it. When it was cooked, only 12% left the body.

Q: So what if a pregnant woman eats raw tuna?

A: Like I said, as long as she eats it raw, fine. If she eats it contaminated, if she eats it cooked, she's set free of all that mercury. Now, my main fish that I love are high in mercury, the highest in mercury. Swordfish and tuna are my favorites, and I eat tons of them.

Q: Do you cook it?

A: No. That's the whole point of this. I'm a raw fooder completely. So let's get back to, well, let's finish with the vaccine. Each vaccine gives you 260 times the toxic dose, 260 times of what the FDA says is toxic exposure to mercury. One vaccine, 260 times the toxic level. Now, children are getting 49 vaccines by the time they're 16 years old, 15 and 16. How much damage is that doing? Why are the learning levels going down? Why are children now so combative? I take a look at my mother's family. She's one of 13 children. Can you imagine being raised with 13 kids, 12 brothers and sisters? I would have been nuts. I couldn't stand my three brothers. Neither of us could stand each other, and that was a problem. Why did that happen in that generation, that World War II generation? My mother loved canned foods, and was heavy into medication. She loved taking a can opener and dumping that into the pot and cooking it. She didn't have to take the vegetables and scrub them, slice them, put them in the... She saved her an hour, hour and a half of work to take it out of the can and put it in a pot. That's all we ate, canned foods. A lot of the meat was canned. Your luncheon meats are all processed, heavily.

Q: Spam.

A: Well, that came before my time as a child. That came later. I'm a little older than that. So, that kind of contamination in my body, in the human body, creates all this anxiety, this angst about life. And, of course, you grow up in a family. Who is going... Where are you going to direct that angst? The people around you. My mother's brothers and sisters all got along. They all got degrees. My father, my grandfather, my mother's father was a pharmacist. A drug, legalized drug pusher. But, he did not believe in taking drugs unless they were prescribed by a doctor. And even then, he would limit it. He was a pharmacist and knew this stuff was toxic. So, he wouldn't allow his children to have it. I don't think he gave anything other than occasional aspirin to those 13 children. We got everything. The vaccines, everything. When I was 15 and a half, I got my third polio shot. I went into juvenile diabetes and angina pectoris within a few days. I had 300 heart attacks between the age of 15 and 22 years old. I passed out in 50 of them. But, they took me to the hospital because I was constantly grabbing my chest, falling over. I was uncommunicable because I didn't know language. I couldn't...I just would parrot language. I would hear phrases and then I would repeat them just like a parrot. That's how I communicated. But, I was full of mal-props and misunderstandings. I heard certain things on... Of course, back then, I was like 10 years old when TV came out. It was black and white. It was a whole thing like this. But, my parents listened to a lot of radio. So, all of the things that I learned were by watching Elvis Presley movies, James Dean movies and stuff like that. So, I learned posture. That's how I stayed out of a lot of criticism because I was always being criticized because I didn't talk or I said stupid things. I basically didn't communicate with other kids. If you look at all the pictures of me taken as a child, I'm apart from everybody else. 

I remember in my kindergarten class and first year class, everybody's all grouped together. I'm off on a tricycle away from everybody else. Uncommunicative. And that's the way an autistic person lives because they can't communicate and they're ridiculed because they can't communicate. So, my expression was parroting language that I thought worked. And it often didn't. I mean, when I went into my first year of high school, I was at a Franciscan priest high school. So, Franciscan priests were pretty brutal. And they were mean and they would hit you with fists. And I remember Father Sylvester, he was 6'5". We called him Gordo. And he would say something to me and it was something I learned to throw out what I heard at home. And it was, you're stupid, you're an idiot, shut up, sit down. So, when Father Sylvester would say certain things that my brothers would say, I would come back with something that they would respond to. So, I said not good things to him. You know, he took his big, his hand was as big as my head. And he would just hit me until I bled because I didn't know how to respond. I didn't know what to say to make it right. So, I was expelled on my first day of my second year in high school when I went back because I didn't understand that I was expelled for my first year. But, you know, it was pretty rough. I had 45 days of detention, 2 days of sanding crew, I mean, 2 weeks of sanding crew and 2 days of shoveling coal. If you're really bad, you come in on Saturdays and you shovel coal for the furnace. Coal furnace. And what is the result of burning coal? Mercury vapors. That's what's polluting most of the oceans is burning coal for power. So, I had to breathe in all that crap and I was just getting sicker and sicker as I got older. So, by the time I... Now, I cheated through school. I always picked the smartest, you know, most sensitive girl in the class to sit next to and I would copy her hieroglyphs onto my paper. And that's all it was to me was hieroglyphs. 

They were images that I just put down and sometimes, you know, they weren't really the images transferred from one paper to another. But by the time I was in high school, I could do... I could identically copy somebody's handwriting. So then I was getting accused of taking somebody's paper and copying it, doing all kinds of things. Like all children who are autistic, all of a sudden they have an idiot savant ability. And I could do math like that, like the Rain Man. Give me a problem and I wrote the answer without doing all of the steps to get to it. So, they thought I was cheating. So, they took me into a room three times with a prepared test and when I aced that with no... you know, this divided into this and I just equals instead of putting it down in the diaphragm word, you know, method and going through all the process, I just put down the answer. How I knew the answer, I don't know. My mind would just come up with the answer. So, finally they wrote problems out because they thought I was breaking into the classroom and getting the test beforehand. They had all kinds of scenarios how I was able to cheat. And they were pretty magnificent, you know. I thought, wow, I could be that smart. Now that I think about it, in hindsight, what they thought that I could do. But they wrote down the questions and answers five minutes before they came in the room and gave it to me. Then they realized that I was special. Then they thought, because I got D's on everything else and was barely passing, that I was a slouch. And that I just didn't talk because I was anti-social. All of these things they generated into it because nobody thought about autism in those days. Nobody looked at anything other than radical psychiatric behavior. So, somebody who was autistic was not really examined for their particular condition. And I certainly wasn't.

I got through schools by cheating. However, when I got out of high school, I got married when I was a senior, when I was a sophomore in high school. The second smartest girl in the school liked me. And we didn't have to communicate with language. We just understood each other. And, of course, I didn't know myself. And then when we lived together, she was a year older, she was a grade older than I was, a year older and a grade ahead of me. So, we didn't have to intercommunicate a lot. But when we were together, it was easy. But when we got married and started living together, she realized she was living with an idiot. And it didn't work. It didn't work at all. Because here, she was the second smartest girl in the school. And so, it was difficult. Now, when I was eight years old, after all the vaccines that I had up to that point, probably about seven tetanus shots by that age, I was getting them yearly. Before that, I was getting them every six months. So, by the time I was eight years old, I was into fibromyalgia and constant chronic fatigue. If I lifted my arm this high, I was in excruciating pain. Just to turn over in the bed, just to move was painful. No energy whatsoever. My father just called me a lazy jerk. They didn't understand what was going on in my body, and I couldn't communicate with it. They could see me going into pains and moaning and groaning, and they thought it was all an act, but it wasn't. So, I had to counter that because I was getting beat. They would come in with a belt and strap me out of the bed. To get me out of the bed, my father would use the buckle sometimes. My father was a very emotionally uncontrollable person. He invented the first Bering computer when he was in college. He was a genius. He worked for General Electric and the government on experiments all of his life. But, emotionally, he had no control, and especially with children like we were. He didn't realize that what he had created with his industry and his technology was mutant emotionally and physically human beings.

So, he treated them with violence, all of us. I was the worst, of course, because I couldn't communicate. He put me in the hospital several times by using a two-by-four as punishment. He broke both of my eardrums when I was nine years old. He said, I told you to listen to me. Pop, broke both of them, lost 60% hearing in one, 80% in the other. I still don't have, but I have 60% hearing in this one where I only had 20%. Over the years, it's gotten better. This one is at 90%, and this one is at 40% after the break. So, I had to deal with a lot of stuff. I had no energy by the time I was eight years old, and in pain all the time. I had to find some way to give me energy. So, I noticed that my parents were drinking coffee, and it gave them charge. Now, I could see the energy difference and even the light difference in their body, another talent that I had as an autistic child. So, I could see the whole radiant change when they drank coffee. So, I started drinking coffee. The next morning when I went in to have my cup of coffee with them, they freaked out. I'm saying hypocrites again. They don't want me to do it, and they do it. So, what I did was I go in at nighttime. They'd always leave a half to three quarters of a cup in the pot, and nobody would drink that last bit of coffee. It got thrown out in the morning. So, what I did was go in the middle of the night, put it in a jar, put a lid on, and put it under my bed. And then they'd come out in the morning and make their new fresh pot of coffee. So, I had all this old, cold, stale coffee in the morning. And I got to like it, because it gave me energy. I mean, it would wire me. And I could get out of bed, I could move, I could maneuver, even though I was in pain still. So, then when I got to school, I had the same kind of lack of energy. I'd go to sleep in almost every class. And I couldn't sleep at night because I was terrified. Was my brother going to get me? Was my father going to get me? Was the boogeyman under the bed going to get me? And, I mean, I was terrified of something under the bed getting me. Because I had nightmares.

Every night I had nightmares, so I didn't want to sleep. And I didn't sleep at night, rarely. I had one night of sleep because I took the saw and cut the legs off the bed, so there couldn't be anything under the bed. And when my father saw that, he put me in the hospital. When he saw that, I cut the legs off of the bed. I couldn't explain to him why I did it. He just thought it was a mean thing to do. So, that night I got a good night's sleep. Because I wasn't afraid of anything coming under the bed. My brother and I, that brother and I were in different bedrooms that six-month period. So, I couldn't sleep well, so what did I do at school? I started smoking at eight years old. I smoked non-filtered Lucky Stripes or Marlboros. Sometimes Chesterfields. All the heavier ones. So, I'd go out into the pines outside of school, and I'd go light up a cigarette and smoke a cigarette at all the breaks. So, I was having about six cigarettes a day during school. And that gave me energy. It did. The nicotine would keep me high, not as well as the coffee did, but still it would keep me high for an hour, an hour and a half. So, that's how I functioned. By the time I hit 16 years old, I was smoking two packs a day and drinking 11 cups of coffee a day. And then I had to start drinking alcohol to sleep. By the time I hit 19, I had a bleeding ulcer that was gushing blood when I vomited. So, I went to the doctors, and they gave me Maalox. Maalox is nothing other than calcium-dense rock, pulverized rock. It absorbs all your digestive acids, so you can't digest anything anymore. And that caused a tumor next to the ulcer. So, they said, we've got to go ahead and cut that out. So, they went in, cut that out, tried to seal the ulcer, stretched my duodenum three times inside, so they cracked it and caused massive internal bleeding, and then sewed me back up. They severed all the vagus nerves to the stomach, so I'd never secrete hydrochloric acid again. So, they put me in the category of octogenarians, who don't secrete hydrochloric acid, and basically have to take hydrochloric acid with everything they eat.

So, after they took that out, that surgery, the vagotomy pyloroplasty, the incision from here to here turned tumorous. It got up to at least three-quarters of an inch high, and up to an inch and a half, maybe one spot, two inches wide, all the way from my skin to my stomach. So, they said, we have to irradiate that to stop the growth of the tumor. So, I had ten weeks of intense radiation therapy, where the beam was going like this. And it was slow, it wasn't fast. About like this. So, I would have a full twenty seconds of direct radiation at a time for ten minutes. So, as soon as we come back here, start again, go down for about twenty seconds, hit the low point, turn off, cock back up, and then go back down again. So, what they did was, it pinpointed one spot on my spine that they were hitting, and that cauterized two-thirds of my spinal cord. That's like taking malleable clay and firing it at cone ten. So, now you don't have a malleable clay, you have what? You have rock. Solid rock. So, anytime I moved, the vertebraes would pinch and cut and lacerate the nerves. So, I was in constant pain. I couldn't move this much without being in excruciating pain. I couldn't sit down. It took me five, ten minutes. And it wasn't instant like that. Every time I went for the radiation over that ten-week period, two days, three days would go by and the pain would start building up from it. So, after six months, I was literally an invalid. And I had to live on a hardwood floor. I couldn't sleep on a bed. I couldn't sit on the couch. I had to live on a hardwood floor. Now, that radiation therapy gave me the ulcer treatment, the Maalox, caused the tumor to form. The radiation therapy gave me blood and bone cancer. About six weeks after the finish of the radiation therapy, all the bone deteriorated around my teeth. So, my teeth dangled in my gums. And they wanted to pull all my teeth. And I got that. Even though I still didn't understand language exactly, I knew what people were thinking. It was like being psychic in a perceptive way. Of course, I had a lot of misunderstanding of words because I was forming meanings of words by the way they sounded and felt to me. So, I had a lot of misconception of words that sounded rough and mean would have a rough and mean meaning to them. 

So, I had a lot of misunderstandings. But I could always get the gist of what was going on. So, I refused to let them pull out my teeth the last few weeks of my life because they didn't give me the three weeks to live at that point. So, they said, well, with the bone and blood cancer, we need to give you chemotherapy. We'll give you 1% chance of living. Now, my uncle, because he was living here, he was living in Los Angeles when I moved. I got divorced at 19. I got married at 16, divorced at 19, came out to California. A little tidbit in there. When I got out of high school, my mother didn't know what to do with me because everybody, all of her brothers and sisters got degrees. And here were her three sons, four sons, and only one of them college material. So, she didn't know what was why we were all stupid and dumb when my father was the first inventor of a Bering computer. And everybody in her family was pretty smart. How did they develop these? And they weren't really looking at the whys. They would just have these questions going on without looking deep into the answers. So, she took me to a, she knew I was good with pictures. I could do portraits, I could do anything in a graphic manner, easily. So, art was my biggest accomplishment, as well as math. But the math, what can you do with math as a kid? It didn't make any sense. So, she took me to this, Newt was the first college for computer programming unit record wiring equipment. That's when what would fit into a little chip this big used to fill up a whole room. We'd have these disks this big running on tracks. And everything was on punch cards. So, I went to that school and I got the highest marks of anybody. I could write a program in two hours. It would take them a year to write flawlessly. But I could write flawlessly. So, the professors knew what they had there. So, they always put somebody with me who could interpret what I did and do the language. So, they farmed me out to Time DC, to IBM, to Carte Blanche Corporation as a systems analyst. I was making 80 grand a year as an idiot. At 19 years old, 20 years old, 21.

By the time I was 21, I was so sick. I was living on the floor and crawling only with my elbows on the floor. To make it, I couldn't work anymore. I couldn't even concentrate, couldn't focus. I was vomiting, defecating, urinating all over myself after a few months of chemotherapy. Two months of chemotherapy. They wanted me to go to a three-month, just to help me have a 1% chance of living. I mean, if you talk about stupidity, we look at doctors as the most authoritative and beneficial profession on the planet. Yet, it is the worst one in the world. They say, do no harm, but everything they do is harmful. Everything they do is harmful. Even what they say is harmful because they terrorize you. Oh, this is going to happen if you don't do this. And they scare the crap out of you. And then you do what they say, and you do idiotic things. I mean, think about it. If they said, okay, we've got a shot here. We want to give you two cc's of this stuff, maybe three cc's. We've got liquid mercury in it. Mercury does this, and this is the most neurotoxin known on the planet. We're going to put liquid mercury, which disturbs synapse fire, and jams up ganglion and axions. So, you're not thinking very well and clearly. You won't be rational. You won't be practical. So, if that gets jammed in the brain, then we have ether. Ether, what does that cause? That causes certain parts of the brain to shut down, to cut off. They use ether to put you to sleep, to have surgery, right? They're injecting this into your body. And then you have detergents and formaldehyde. Formaldehyde is an embalming fluid. It coats a cell so it no longer functions, no longer respirates, and solidifies it in that form. Five basic ingredients of every vaccine. Now, if I brought that to any one of you in here and told you that, would you take that vaccine? Would you give it to your children? Anybody raise a hand here? Of course not. But that's what they do. They tell you you're a bad parent if you don't give it to your children. And you have to look at the science behind the disease that they put in these. They use rotten eggs or diseased parts of animals, organs or glands, and they decay it, and they break it down, and they infect it with poisons to cause it to create a disease.

Now, they say that you become immune by taking it. The most bacterial waste that you have is less than 1% of an entire vaccine. That's, let's say, 2 million bacterial products in there of disease. Two million? That's nothing. Our white blood cells, five white blood cells could wipe that out in an instant. Consume the phagocytes, just consume it in an instant. The idea that that little bit of material causes any kind of immunity is absurd. They have never been able to prove it. Because it can't be proved. And it doesn't work. That's why a lot of people who get flu shots get the flu, and even die from getting the flu. The first flu vaccine was when? 1918. What did they sell to kill those 50 million people? Spanish flu. No, it wasn't. It was the Spanish flu vaccine that killed everybody. Nobody died of the flu until they got that vaccine. That was Rockefeller's and Rothschild's first vaccine. They were going hard. They tried to push one out three times before that. That's why they supported Pasteur. And Pasteur even said it was a death bank. It is not the bacteria, it's the environment. If the environment is contaminated, you're going to have disease. Bacteria does not cause disease. But there's no money in that. If I tell you to eat all the bacteria you can, that means you don't cook your food, because all food is full of bacteria. It is bacteria, just as much bacteria as we are. That's why it starts decaying when it's not eaten. And you can eat decayed, pre-digested food like that. We have sauerkraut. We have lots of food. There are tribes that eat rotten meat as their main function. There's a tribe in Africa, there's a movie called The Last Dance. And it was the last hunt, because the particular government of Africa made that national forest and said they could no longer hunt. So that means they're going to live on welfare packages of processed cereals and powdered milk and water. This is a tribe that lived on hunting. They could hunt and outrun an antelope. And that's what this movie is about. They show these last three hunters going after an antelope and running the antelope down after five days. The antelope has to keep going, not able to rest, and they just keep going after them. And on the fourth day, right in the evening before they get the antelope, they find a rotten animal, probably several weeks old. The vultures are eating it, the flies, the worms, everything's eating it. So they shoo the vultures away and eat it raw. 

And they say, this is the best food that you can eat. We will run that antelope down easy. We are so lucky, because we're getting tired. The antelope is getting tired, too, but we're getting tired. And they eat this rotten meat. I mean, several weeks old, this thing has to stink for miles. And I mean several miles. And they eat it raw and have all this charge and energy. So I've experimented with that. When I was on Ripley's Believe It or Not in 2002, July 17, 2002, you see me eating all this rotten meat. I've got jars of it up to a year and a half old. Anybody see that? You can go online and see it. And they've got a food analyst, an expert on there. He says, you eat that, you're going to die. It will kill you, dah, dah, dah. This guy, he's just told this stuff. It has nothing to do with reality. He believes, but he was freaking out. And I was there eating all this. I had two patients that were eating it. You see the male and the female. And that female had been on psychotropic drugs for 27 years, in and out of all kinds of psychotropic problems. Manic depressive, schizophrenia, everything. She was taking 27 psychotropic pills a day, seven different drugs. One to counter this, one to counter that. She was all over the place. One of them I died was still all over the place. I said, listen. Well, after a year and a half, she called me. She says, this diet is crazy, it's insane. Everybody thinks I'm insane. It's an antisocial diet. And I said, but it works. But what you have to do is, you need high meat. You need rotten meat. You need to eat that, just as an experiment. Just to see what it does. So she said, I'm always on this crazy diet. Bam, slammed down the phone. Called me back about an hour later. She said, okay, how do I make it? I said, well, you need to cut it up, put it in a jar, half air, half not. You make it quicker by leaving it outside, outside the refrigerator. You can probably produce it in 14 days or so. And then if you put it in the refrigerator, it may take three to six weeks. She said, ah, I may kill myself tonight. I don't have 14 days to wait for that process. I said, listen, the other man who was on, the young man who was 27 years old he was, who was on the show also, who was sitting and eating with me at one point in the show, he used to make a bunch of it. So I said, I'll have him call you if he has any extra and you can get it from him and you can try it. Hmm.

So he called her, I called him, he called her, and then about 9.30 at night I get a call. Okay, I ate about a golf ball size amount and I'm really, I really need your help. I need to talk with you. I knew that I'd have to babysit her all through the night. I didn't answer the phone. Every 45 minutes to an hour she called. Okay, I need to talk with you now. It's been three hours and I don't know what's going to happen. Nothing's going wrong with her. She's just having all this mental stuff going on. So about 4.30, 4.45 in the morning she called and she said, okay, if you don't answer this phone, I'm just going to stay on here and wait for you to answer. She's whistling a happy tune. Now I've known this woman for a year and a half. She never smiled, she never said anything funny. She was just a morose individual personality-wise. But good at heart. A famous yoga professional with videotapes out teaching everybody how to be calm and nice. Because that's what she needed and she went to yoga to do it but wasn't able to find it there except in the moment that she was doing it. So I picked up the phone at that point and I said, I'm listening to you, you're singing, you're making funnies. She said, oh yes, I am. She ate high meat every week after that. I have people who eat nothing... I have one fellow who was probably the most anti-social person I'd ever met. Big guy, about 6'2". And he was a landscape artist and he chose landscape art because he didn't have to deal with people. He hated people. Didn't have a funny bone in his body. He was the same as that woman. After a year and a half I said, listen, you've got to try to high me. So he made it and tried it. Now I hadn't seen him in like, I hadn't spoken with him in like six months and it had been a year since I'd seen him. So I went back to give a workshop in Nevada City where he lived. And here he was in the room. It was quite a, you know, five times as many people here. And he had three girlfriends. This is a guy, I don't think he ever had a girlfriend in his life. And he had three ten plus looking girls. And he's only like a six, maybe a five and a half. But he became so funny and so charming that everybody just loved him. And he had three girlfriends in the same room. It was remarkable. But he doesn't eat any fresh meat. He only eats two pounds of high meat daily. He has an outdoor refrigerator, a huge one. It has all this rotten meat going.

Q: Excuse me, are you calling it high meat, H-I-G-H?

A: H-I-G-H. High meat.

Q: H-I-G-H. Okay.

A: The Eskimos eat it every year and frequently. And they call it high meaning it gives you a high happy. You know, their word for high is different. But it means high. It makes you high and happy. And it does. Anybody who eats it, if they're depressed, they're happy within 10, 20 minutes of eating it. And there's never any, you know, diarrhea or vomit that results from it. Sometimes there's a liver detoxification that goes along with eating any raw meat. Because it helps the body provide the protein to get rid of the contamination in the liver. But that's only like 2% of the people who go on this diet and eat the raw meat. Normally, people eating cooked meat have a 12% reaction to it, vomit and diarrhea or some kind of reaction to cooked meat. It could be mostly the hormones and antibiotics that are in the meat that cause that. And they release those even more when you cook it. So, cooking meat has a lot more reactions than can be coincidental with the raw or high meat. So, now why does that work? Because in the colon you have two intestinal tracts. You have the small intestines. Then you have the bowel. It goes here. Now, what happens in the bowel? Mostly E. coli activity. But what does that, why is that separate from, why is that large intestine different from the small intestine? Because the bacteria in the small intestines breaks food down. Now, get this. You'll never be squeamish again after this. Once you get through this concept. Bacteria eats the food you eat. Their excrement, their urine, their secretions, their sweat is our food. All that they produce, which is sweat, urine and feces, from the food is our food. We live on poop. Eat shit and live. Basically, we live on poop. Eat shit and piss and sweat and live. That's how we function. The bowel has E. coli, predominately E. coli, which breaks the fat and the protein molecules in the finite form that feeds the brain and nervous system. So, if anybody has depression, they have a bowel problem. Low bacterial problem in the bowel.

So, what happens when you eat high meat? The natural bacteria that's in the meat is pre-digesting it, just like kefir or yogurt is with milk. So, you pre-digested the meat. And it goes right, feeds the brain and nervous system, and all of a sudden you've got a whole consciousness change like that. And that's why it works. Now, is there another way other than to eat rotten meat? Yeah. You can take, maybe do a suppository of raw cream, a little raw egg, and raw butter, a little coconut cream, and you squeeze that up inside you before you go to sleep. About four ounces. And you do exercises, you know, like a belly dancer. You know, when you're on all fours and you face down after you put it in you. And you get it to move up the descending colon. Then you lie on your right side and lift your left leg, and you roll your stomach like a belly dancer, again. And it will move across the transverse colon and down the ascending colon. So, now you've provided fresh fats, which the brain and nervous system never get because all the fats are absorbed before the food gets to the colon. So, the brain and the nervous system, because of the diets that you're on, never get fed. So, you feed it that way, you know. If your brain isn't deficient in protein, protein will always make it to the bowel, but the fats won't. So, good fats, animal fats. So, you feed them directly, and what happens? All of a sudden, your brain and nervous system, your myelin gets coated and fulfilled, buffers the information going to the brain. And all of a sudden, you've got a different nervous system. 10 to 15 minutes. If you're eating high meat, if you're doing the suppository, you wake up in the morning and wonder, my God, I'm different today, I'm strong, I feel resilient, everything's better. So, there are many ways that you can do it. I mean, two ways that you can do it. And both are the best, if you have psychological problems. Anxiety is always needing to exercise. Certain people produce hormones for physical activity. Adrenaline, testosterone, estrogen, all of those create energy in the body for physical activity.

If you're a person who is a high energy person, you need to exercise. You can tell that by the amount of activity rings, which, most iridologists call them stress rings. If you don't exercise, you're going to be in stress. I call them activity rings because they're basically to provide you with a body that can be high energy. You can be an athlete. Athletes have 7 to 14 activity rings. Your average person has 3 to 5. I have none. So, I can sit at a computer all day long, 20 hours a day. And the only thing I do is eat. You know, that's my activity. I have lots of them in the brain, but none of them in the body. So, I don't have to be physically active. People who have that kind of energy had better be physically active. You better be a massage therapist, or an athlete, or a ditch digger, or a carpenter, or some kind of building construction. In the construction, you better do something that's physical, or you're going to be in high anxiety and an unhappy person. And the people around you are going to be unhappy. So, anxiety means you need to exercise. Depression means you need to feed the brain and the nervous system.

Q: When you say meat, is it only red meat or white meat?

A: Meat, any flesh food. I don't care if you're eating insects. And there are many people in Asia, they raise scorpions, big old wood cockroaches. You know, they eat everything there, even bats. I got fresh bats in China. In China, fresh, beautiful. And bats, I've never seen one close and alive. And they sell them alive, you know. And they're gorgeous. Hello. So, anyway, I got well from all of that stuff. Somebody turned me on to raw milk and carrot juice. That started me off on the train of getting into all this other stuff, experimenting with raw diets. And here I am today, about to start my 67th year next month. And I'm doing fine. And I should have been dead at 21. Okay, that takes care of our introduction here. So, we're going to go into the workshop after we take a short break. So, those people who just arrived, you can mingle.

Q: Oh, they belong here.

[break]

A: Bacteria, not by parasites. It's caused by industrial toxins. Always. Like I said in the introduction, 70% of all disease is created by vaccines. They lay the groundwork for you to go to the doctors your entire life. They poison your system. By the gene generation that mercury causes, every one of those toxins. They're even putting squalene now in flu shots. So now they have up to 63 ingredients. Pardon?

Q: Preservative?

A: Yeah. Yeah, like you use in the lab, yeah.

Q: They use squalene because it's from the shark, right?

A: No. If it were from the shark, it wouldn't be so bad.

Q: Shark liver?

A: But when they make a synthetic squalene, it's not the same.

Q: Okay.

A: It's highly toxic. And all of your ingredients that come from, like, shark cartilage, things like that, you know how they make it? All of your supplements that are natural, they have to make it into a soup. They have to dissolve that food into a soup and then extract what they want out of it. So there are two ways to do it. Only two ways laboratories do that.

Q: Can I still sign up for it?

A: Pardon?

Q: Can I still sign up for it?

Q: Sure, sure.

Q: Is it too late? I'm sorry.

Q: No, it's not too late. Don't worry.

Q: Okay, good.

A: So there are only two ways that laboratories make supplements to dissolve stuff. If it's from food, if it's so-called natural, they use kerosene because kerosene is natural. The companies that make, that dissolve food and to extract elements out of that, no matter what your supplement is, they use hexane, which is gasoline. So it's either gasoline or kerosene. Now, kerosene is natural, but how many of you would soak your food for 72 hours in hexane, I mean, in kerosene, rinse it for two minutes, and then drink it? I don't see any hands. All supplements are made that way. All natural supplements are made that way. Unnatural supplements, that is gasoline that they use. So all of these additives, food additives, cause disease. Not only do they cause disease, they incite disease, they promote it. Reducing bacteria in foods gives forever a shelf life, but you've removed all of the bacteria from that food. If the food is 99.5% bacteria, that is the main food that we're eating. The bacteria in food feeds the bacteria in our body, feeds us. So when you pasteurize something, you've reduced the bacteria level and destroyed most of your enzymes, you've altered most of the enzymes, and you've damaged all of the vitamins. When you get above pasteurization temperature, which is 141 degrees, then you start altering everything in a very toxic manner. So you start creating heterocyclic amines, lipid peroxides, and acrylamides. Those are the three that they know cause cancer. The acrylamides come from cooking carbohydrate-dense foods. Cereals, chips, potatoes, breads, especially donuts. In lipid peroxides, that's from oils or fats that have reached high temperatures. If you take the acrylamides and put the lipid peroxides in it, you have some very potent toxic food. And that is chips, any chips, french fries, of course the British call french fries chips, and donuts, anything high-carbohydrate and fried. Almost all of your cereals are the most toxic food on this planet.

What do they send as care packages anywhere on this planet? Cereals and powdered milk. Now according to Pottenger, when he fed cats powdered milk, they got the most diseases the fastest, 2,300 diseases. Same number the humans get. When they fed fresh raw milk, no diseases whatsoever. Powdered milk generated the worst. However, he didn't deal, at those times when he was doing the experiments, margarine didn't exist on the market. Margarine, like a lot of your crystal oils and all those, are hydrogenated oils. When you hydrogenate an oil, you turn it into a liquid plastic. Literally, a liquid plastic. So any food that's fried in any restaurant, anywhere unless they're frying it in olive oil, but 90% of all the olive oils on the planet are only 10% olive oil and 90% hydrogenated oils. Mineral oils, not even vegetable oils. Vegetable oils are very difficult to make, very expensive. So it's easier to make rock oil, mineral oils from the earth. So you take an oil deposit, you purify and clean it, hydrogenate it so it has infinite shelf life. Because there's no bacteria, there's nothing alive in it. And what is swimming in is the same molecular structure as plastic in liquid form. And that's how you make plastic, by hydrogenating oils. So, when that came out, and if that had come out when Pottenger was doing his test with animals, we would have seen that that creates more disease than powdered milk. Most of your milks nowadays, when you go into a market, you get your large manufacturers who distribute their dairy throughout the United States. They take the milk, they remove all of the protein, animal protein, and all of the fat, animal fat. So you've got a blue liquid, literally blue. It looks like a swimming pool.

Q: Because old skim milk used to be blue, the original skim milk.

A: Well, now what they do is when they get it to that blue state, they have mounds of dolomite, if you've ever seen these plants. They've got skyscraper-sized buildings, mounds of dolomite, which is calcium-concentrated rock, dissolved, powdered. So they shovel this stuff into that blue liquid, add hydrogenated vegetable oils, and all of these now nanofat molecules flavoring. So the flavoring makes it taste like it's real milk and real cream, but it isn't. It's plastic oil in there, no protein whatsoever, and lots of rock minerals that you can never absorb. We don't eat rock. Plants eat rock. We eat the animals that eat the plants, because we don't have a digestive tract like that. Their digestive tract is two and a half times longer than ours. They have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to absorb the nutrients from it. And it takes 48 hours to go through their systems, and ours is 24 hours. And if we eat vegetables, we will only get about 2% to 3% value from it. That's why I don't know any vegetarians that can sustain themselves on vegetation. And I've known 2,500 vegetarians. Eight of them did okay, but they were eating lots of nuts and other things, but they also deteriorated later in their lives. One completely spinal cord just disappeared in one year. And those eight people who did pretty well on it were all males. No, well, seven of them were males and one was a female, but when that female hit 35, her spine went. It started collapsing like this at 35. All of these were high-activity individuals. They had high testosterone, adrenaline, and estrogen levels, and they were all athletes. So their body was able to somehow work with that so-called semi-vegetarian vegan diet where they weren't having dairy or meats. But they didn't do well in their later years. In their 70s, they all went down, one of them even in his late 60s, and the woman at 35.

So not a proper diet. We are not built to be herbivores. We are built to digest meats. Our acids in the mouth, our mucus and saliva has bacteria in it that's acidic bacteria. When I put that bacteria on the different foods, the vegetables, meats, dairy, only on the animal foods did it completely work on it. In the vegetation, even the fruits didn't break it down very well. It is for meats and dairy products. Then when the food goes down into the stomach, what do we produce there? Hydrochloric acid. What's hydrochloric acid for? It's to dissolve large particles of protein in meats. So when I put the hydrochloric acid from eight human corpses on those different foods, it worked on the meats and the dairy perfectly. On the nuts, on the vegetation, on the other foods, it barely etched it. Then in the last part of the duodenum, the stomach, we secrete bile. Bile digests fat. When they took the bile from those eight corpses and put it on those foods again, it only broke down the fats of the butter, cream, and meat fat properly. Nuts, it barely touched. So all these concepts that say, oh, there's fat in this, there's fat in that, we can get from this. That's if you were meant, if you were built to digest it. According to my laboratory experiments, we do not digest those things. It just does not work. Then we go down to the small intestines. It's 90% bacteria. The bacteria eats the food we eat. Their excrement, their secretions are our nutrients. That's the way it goes all the way through the intestines in different stages. As you get in there, you digest a certain amount of the fats and a certain amount of the proteins, and the enzymes make it all happen with the bacteria. Everything is dispersed, and as it takes time to digest all the way through to the bowels, we get to feeding the brain and the nervous system.

The bacteria in the bowels breaks the nutrients down to the finite molecules to feed the brain and the nervous system. How do we make sure we get enough of the proper foods down to the bowel to feed the brain and the nervous system? We've been on bad diets for all those years—pasteurized, cooked, processed, contaminated food. What if we starved ourselves? We've starved the whole bodies, every part of our bodies. Aging and deterioration are synonymous. If you're eating the live foods, it's not a problem. It's always nourishing the body, so there's no detriment. There's no spending the bank account. The bank account will always exist. The nutrients that you have in a cell that hold it together, your body won't have to leach from it to supplement for those that are lost in your cooked and processed foods. So we generate health that way. Now, if we have toxins accumulate in the body because the lymphatic system is jammed— now, the lymph system is supposed to clean all the waste out of the body and neutralize poisons. Now, we can do that here and there throughout the body. The body can react to something and neutralize it if it's toxic in the system. Let's say we get a scorpion sting. Those fluids are going to pass this way or this way, depending upon which passage it stings next to. If it's going down or up, it will pass into our systems. Now, we have immediate areas to counter that, and that's the body throwing those poisons right back out through the skin. So then we'll have a rash around that area. The body says, well, the rash may create neurological damage, so we won't dump it out there. We'll take it to the stomach and dump it in the stomach, where the hydrochloric acid will neutralize any venom. So let's say you know somebody who's been bitten by a rattlesnake or stung by a scorpion or bitten by a tarantula. You can vomit and put that vomit on that whole arm or wherever it is, and that body will absorb the hydrochloric acid from that vomit and neutralize that poison. Now, I've seen people get, you know, like a black widow bite causes the whole arm to swell. If you put vomit on that arm, I'm talking about, let's say you're out in the wild and doing this, you can go get HCL from a store. It's not true HCL, but it will neutralize it, and then there will be less nerve damage in the body.

But the best optimal way to do it would be vomit, and then spread that vomit on that arm, and it will absorb it, and it will neutralize those toxins, that venom. Now, three years ago when I first built the house in Thailand on the farm there, I was taking some bedding out of a box, and that box had sat around the house while it was being built for like six months. So I was going to finally get to sleep in my new house, so I'm taking, you know, the pillows out, and all of a sudden I got a sting on my wrist right here, and it was sharp and painful, and I pulled the pillow away, and there was this little bitty scorpion. And the little bitty scorpions are the deadliest, because their venom is intensely concentrated. As they get larger, each stage they get larger, like a centimeter larger, their venom dilutes by half. So by the time they're adult, their venom is five times less concentrated than it is at the smallest. So I thought, how healthy am I? How am I going to get through this one? So my arm just ached all the way up for about one day, 24 hours. Very little swelling, a little rash in this area, and I didn't do anything to it. I just wanted to see what would happen. So it was gone 24 hours. So I went on a trip to get some milk and look for some cows to buy, and I returned, and I was taking some more stuff out of a box, and I took some gloves out, put the gloves on, got another sting, another little bitty one. That one affected me for only two hours. A week later, I put on some shoes, and I learned to check everything. Clothes, you shake it out, even if it's sandals, you just make sure there's no scorpion there or other insect that can sting you. And that one didn't affect me at all. Not at all. No soreness in the area, nothing. Just a little rash to the skin. So when you're healthy and you've got all these nutrients in the body, your body can react and do things very well. Now, I don't believe there's such thing as an immune system. The medical profession created this immune system concept, again, to make you afraid. Oh, your immune system's attacking itself, or your immune system isn't working, or your immune system is deficient.

It's simple. If your lymph system isn't cleaning the body, you're going to accumulate toxins. Now, the body can neutralize venoms, like I said, sending it to the stomach. It can also dump poisons in the stomach, and hydrochloric acid can help neutralize some of the industrial poisons, but not so well. But at least when it gets into the stomach, it can dilute it in food. But then if you digest that food, you're going to recycle those poisons, and you're just going to have a merry-go-round of the poisons in and out of your intestinal tract to the rest of the body. That is the big issue that I've been working with for 40 years and trying to figure out how to stop that. And it's very easy. You eat small amounts of cheese every 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes, one hour. You eat cheese, a little cheese, all day long, and it'll go through. As long as it's no salt, raw cheese, it'll just absorb the poisons and pass through. It keeps absorbing poisons as it passes through. So, cheese is the... Raw unsalted cheese is the best way to remove that. Now, those who have been here before know how I feel about salt. Salt is an explosive. It is more volatile than nitroglycerin. When you isolate a solute molecule, it is volatile. When you combine it with iodine or potassium, it neutralizes the explosive nature. However, when it gets into your body, it fractionates it. Now, how can that be proved? There was a couple of guys, or three guys, that were ridiculing me on the Internet saying, oh, explosive, that's so full of shit. But I even learned in biology class, or from a biology book, that one football-sized crystal of pure sodium is worth ten hydrogen bombs. It will take out all of New York City, one crystal this big of pure sodium. That's pretty explosive. So, there were these few guys on the Internet. So, they did a little experiment.

Q: Did you get that connected to the TV?

A: Yeah.

Q: The remote is right there.

A: I will show you. Anybody see frog legs there? Where'd you go? Maybe it's under salt and frog legs, I guess. No, it's up here. Well, this isn't good. So, where did you go? I'm going to have to run a search on the whole... So, what these guys do is they take frog legs, dead frog legs. They're off of the frog. And they sprinkle salt on both sides of those legs. And you see those legs go into spasms. Those spasms go on for 32 minutes. You only see two minutes of it on there. But as long as the sodium from the frog leg fluid on the skin keeps separating the sodium from the iodine molecule, it goes into spasms. Now, they said, well, would the same thing happen with pepper? Because the pepper's an irritant, I said. Pepper's not an explosive, it's an irritant. If the frog legs are dead, it's not going to create any spasms. So, they pour this pepper all over this leg. And because there's a little bit of salt in the pepper, it spasms once. That's it. So, that was evidence. I don't know what happened to that file.

Q: Do you have an internet connection?

A: Pardon?

Q: I'm sorry, do you have an internet connection?

A: I don't have an internet connection here.

Q: We do have an internet connection.

A: You do? Well, you can just look at it. Just put salt frog legs and video, and you'll come up with it. You get to see it. And you see these guys laughing, and then all of a sudden it starts spasming, and then they're very impressed. So, I guess I don't have it here. Okay, let's talk about the—I'm not quite finished yet.

Q: Salt was even used as ammunition.

A: Yes. Even aluminum. When you put aluminum in gunpowder, let's say you put 7% aluminum in gunpowder, it makes it five times more explosive. And they're dropping all that aluminum on us from the chemtrails. So, you have to think about that. It makes the brain despire all the time.

Q: Not to mention your parents' pots and pans.

A: Yes, and also aluminum in cans and everything. But they counteracted the tin can stuff by putting plastic in it. That was about 1959 when they starting coating the inside of cans with plastic. By 1961, they were coding it with various types of plastic. But then you were getting bisphenol phosphates in your food, and phthalates, and all kinds of outgassing from the plastic. So, when they were doing tests with frogs with it, the males were becoming females, and the females were becoming males. And you didn't really have any distinction between the male and female anymore. And then they did it with rabbits and all other kinds of animals. Basically, they became sterile. So, plastics in food are highly toxic. Plastics with food. And, of course, your hydrogenated oils are liquid plastic. So, they're going to damage sex drive and everything. And that's why everybody jumps on Viagra now. You know, 60 years ago, you wanted to get something to suppress all the males from having so much sexual energy. Now they're dropping pills left and right because they have no sexual energy. Because of all these hydrogenated oils. Still looking through here. Well, I don't think it's there, so let's pass on to the next... Okay, let's take a look at what mercury does in the system. 

Video: How Mercury Causes Brain Neuron Degeneration Mercury has long been known to be a potent neurotoxic substance, whether it is inhaled or consumed in the diet as a food contaminant. Over the past 15 years, medical research laboratories have established that dental amalgam tooth fillings are a major contributor to mercury body burden. In 1997, a team of research scientists demonstrated that mercury vapor inhalation by animals produced a molecular lesion in brain protein metabolism, which was similar to a lesion seen in 80% of Alzheimer's diseased brains. Recently completed experiments by scientists at the University of Calgary's Faculty of Medicine now reveal, with direct visual evidence from brain neuron tissue cultures, how mercury ions actually alter the cell membrane structure of developing neurons. To better understand mercury's effect on the brain, let us first illustrate what brain neurons look like and how they grow. In this animation, we see three brain neurons growing in a tissue culture, each with a central cell body and numerous neurite processes. At the end of each neurite is a growth cone where structural proteins are assembled to form the cell membrane. Two principal proteins involved in growth cone function are actin, which is responsible for the pulsating motion seen here, and tubulin, a major structural component of the neurite membrane. During normal cell growth, tubulin molecules link together end-to-end to form microtubules, which surround neurofibrils, another structural protein component of the neuronal axon. Shown here is the neurite of a live neuron isolated from snail brain tissue, displaying linear growth due to growth cone activity. It is important to note that growth cones in all animal species, ranging from snails to humans, have identical structural and behavioral characteristics, and use proteins of virtually identical composition.

In this experiment, neurons also isolated from snail brain tissue were grown in culture for several days, after which very low concentrations of mercury were added to the culture medium for 20 minutes. Over the next 30 minutes, the neurite membrane underwent rapid degeneration, leaving behind the denuded neurofibrils seen here. In contrast, other heavy metals added at this same concentration, such as aluminum, lead, cadmium, and manganese, did not produce this effect. To understand how mercury causes this degeneration, let us return to our illustration. As mentioned before, tubulin proteins link together during normal cell growth to form the microtubules which support the neurite structure. When mercury ions are introduced into the culture medium, they infiltrate the cell and bind themselves to newly synthesized tubulin molecules. More specifically, the mercury ions attach themselves to the binding site reserved for guanosine triphosphate, or GTP, on the beta subunit of the affected tubulin molecules. Since bound GTP normally provides the energy which allows tubulin molecules to attach to one another, mercury ions bound to these sites prevent tubulin proteins from linking together. Consequently, the neurite's microtubules begin to disassemble into free tubulin molecules, leaving the neurite stripped of its supporting structure. Ultimately, both the developing neurite and its growth cone collapse, and some denuded neurofibrils form aggregates, or tangles, as depicted here. Shown here is a neurite growth cone stained specifically for tubulin and actin, before and after mercury exposure. Note that the mercury has caused disintegration of tubulin microtubule structure. These new findings reveal important visual evidence as to how mercury causes neurodegeneration. More importantly, this study provides the first direct evidence that low-level mercury exposure is indeed a precipitating factor that can initiate this neurodegenerative process within the brain.

A: Now you notice the mercury is put way over here. That means even the gaseous molecules that emit from mercury are destroying it way over here. And we inject ourselves and our children with 260 times the lethal dose, the toxic dose, the contaminating dose, with each vaccine.

Q: With each what?

A: With each vaccine.

Q: Oh, vaccine.

A: There's no rational explanation to do this. It is criminal to our children and our own bodies.

Q: Are they not doing that anymore? They're not using mercury as...

A: It's a lie.

Q: Really?

A: It's a lie.

Q: Before they were using thimerosal, which is from mercury, but now they're not using it anymore.

A: That's a lie. They're still using it. We've tested them. They've reduced it from 76 quadrillion molecules of mercury to 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury. Do you know how long it would take you to count to 1 quadrillion? 1,000 years. And yet they're putting that many molecules in 56 quadrillion molecules of mercury in every vaccine. It used to be 76. So they've reduced it and they've called thimerosal a different name. But still there's mercury in every vaccine. So it's a lie. They're just saying it's mercury-free as far as thimerosal goes. So they've created a new formula still with mercury in it and just calling it something else. But it's still thimerosal by a different name. Just like mercurochrome and methylate, that's thimerosal in a different formula. That's rubbing mercury on a wound. I mean, how sensible is that? Nerve and neuronic damage that it can do. You know, some of that's going to get to the brain, I don't care where you put it on the body. It's going to get to the brain. When you inject it into the muscle or blood, man, you contaminated the body grossly. That's just mercury's 260 times the lethal dose. That doesn't count the toxicity of the other ingredients, namely liquid aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, and detergent, which are your five basics.

Q: You put iodine on the skin, doesn't it?

A: Iodine is a poison too? It is.

Q: To do thyroid skin tests, they suggest using iodine on the skin, but that's bad, right?

A: That's toxic.

Q: Toxic.

A: They're looking to see if you have a bad reaction.

Q: Yeah, or see if you absorb it.

A: Your body doesn't want to absorb it because it's rock. It's a rock iodine. It's not a food iodine. It's not bound with other nutrients. It's an isolated. When you have isolated nutrients, you've got isolated rock. We don't eat rock. Plants eat rock. You want high iodine in your food? Grow zucchinis and put your iodine in there. Mix it in with the mulch. Then you'll have concentrated iodine in your zucchini juice. But you're taking it directly, it's poisonous. I'm going to show you another one on mercury, just so you get an idea of how bad it is. Just from being in your mouth, one filling. I think I'll jump forward.

Video: All mercury silver fillings leak substantial amounts of mercury constantly. The amount increases with any kind of stimulation. And as a result, mercury from fillings produces the majority of human exposure to mercury. The International Academy of Oral Medicine and Toxicology is extremely concerned about the anecdotal claims of safety by manufacturers and dental trade associations. They're at variance with the published, peer-reviewed scientific evidence to the contrary. The precautionary principle requires action once the possibility of harm exists. It does not require proof beyond a shadow of a doubt that in the case of heavy metal and xenobiotic exposure is both nearly impossible and unnecessary in our opinion. What you're seeing is mercury vapor coming off a 25-year-old silver amalgam filling in an extracted tooth. The background is a phosphorescent screen. The mercury vapor absorbs the fluorescent light, and you can see it as a shadow on the screen. This is mercury coming off a filling that was dipped in water that's the same temperature as the human body. This is a filling that was rubbed with a pencil eraser for just a few seconds. Like going to the hygienist and having her clean your teeth.

A: Or brushing your teeth.

Video: These are not small amounts of mercury. You can see it. It's more than 1,000 times higher than the Environmental Protection Agency will allow for the air that we breathe. 

A: 1,000 times.

Video: What about the last time you went to the dentist and they drilled on your teeth? Here is the mercury vapor every time you raise the temperature to 110 degrees with hot coffee or warm water, or even chewed on it. Mercury comes off fillings every time you stimulate them. And that simulation causes the mercury to continue to leak out of the fillings for an hour and a half at a minimum. Some people grind their teeth. Some people chew gum. The dentist might send an old gold crown to the dental lab to be welded. How about the dental personnel? They're not being given informed consent. Back in 1985, the International Academy of Oral Medicine Toxicology set out to determine the amount of mercury that was coming off fillings. And here's the graph. Showing substantial quantities of mercury were measured coming off fillings. And then we estimated the total dose. And then we began animal experiments and put radioactive fillings in sheep. Mercury accumulated in the jaw, stomach, liver, and kidney of the sheep in just 30 days. Substantial quantities of mercury spread from the fillings to every organ in that sheep's body. This should be of concern for everyone. Then we measured that the sheep's kidneys dropped in their ability by 60% to clear inulin, an indication of kidney malfunction. Whole body imaging of monkeys found exactly the same thing. Proponents of amalgam fillings claim that sheep chew too much. Well, what's the problem with monkeys? They had mercury in their jaw, kidneys, liver, intestine, and heart. And further research found dystrophic bacteria that were antibiotic resistant cropped up in the intestines within two weeks of receiving these mercury-leaking fillings. Further studies have found damage to the ADP ribosylation of brain neuron proteins. In response to the controversy and at the request of the Federation of Experimental Scientists and Biologists, Drs. Fritzloff Scheider and Murray Vimy wrote an editorial, the first ever in facet, that point by point refuted the claims of the amalgam proponents. In 1991, the World Health Organization acknowledged that the predominant source of human exposure to mercury is from your fillings. That should be of concern to anyone wanting to have healthy children because mercury is highly damaging to fetuses. Experiments in sheep...

A: It just goes on, just compounds the same thing. Now, they didn't mention vaccines at all.

Q: Right.

A: The vaccines are about a thousand times more mercury directly dispersed into the entire body with each vaccine.

Q: What would you do if you had all 16 of them?

A: I had all mine. I had 16 of them. And I had them all removed in 1978. 1978. And put, you know, composite fillings in, plastic fillings in. The reason I don't use porcelain is because in experimenting with people putting porcelain in, they have to drill out a lot more of the tooth, and they have a tendency, when they snap them in, to crack the tooth. So they destroyed so much that you've damaged the tooth. So it's better to put composites in there. Maybe it won't last more than 10, 20 years, but you just replace them. So, okay. So let's talk about when we have disease. Remember I said that we will have different ways of expressing... Different ways of expressing disease. Each person has a different way of expressing disease. I'm going to go into these. Remember I said the lymph system is responsible for cleaning all the waste out of the body. Now it has glands and nose. I should have shown that first, shouldn't I? And where are you? The body. System. Okay. This is the skin, and this is the lymphatic system. Now the lymphatic system is a circulatory system just like the blood and the neurological. All three of them are complex, and it isn't just this. You have capillary-type endings in the skin everywhere with the lymphatic circulation just as you do the blood. So it permeates everywhere throughout the system. And here we see that the greatest amount of the nodes and glands, lymphatic nodes and glands, are in the crotch area. They don't show going down to the thighs, but they are quite a bit. They show on the male here down more, but they're way down into the thigh. And then the breast area and the armpits are the next, and then the neck is a lot more. Now they're just showing several. You have 11 of those lymph glands on every breast, male or female. You have about 20-some in the armpit, each armpit.

So you've got different amounts of these glands, and then you have infinite nodes all over the body. Those are smaller little glands they call nodes. And the body absorbs any toxin from the area, puts it in one of those glands or nodes, and it will neutralize it by the fats that are in the lymph system. The lymph system is mostly fat. It's like 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate. Now, a lot of the cholesterols are used in the lymphatic system. It can take a substance and dissolve it into a fluid. Normally you'll take a cell, a cell like this, and there's a cut cell. This is a blood cell. These are blood platelets. These are phagocytes of the white blood cells here. And this is just other bacteria in the cells. Some are enlarging, some are growing, and some are... You know, the body will throw platelets into the blood after they've been bred in the bone marrow when they're about this small, and then they'll grow to this large a size. But when these die, like this is a dead one right here. So the normal process is the body doesn't like to have a lot of waste products in the blood. So the phagocytes, that's why the phago in Greek means to eat. So you've got these phagocytes of white blood cells that will eat. You've got two here ready to eat this cell right here, this dead red blood cell. So they'll eat that cell and prevent all that waste. So the white blood cells just get bigger as they get fatter. They don't have a lot of waste product. And when they do, they usually dump it into the kidney to pass out of the system with the help of ammonia that the kidneys produce. So normally, though, when a cell breaks down inside the body, you've got a whole bacterial reaction, and the bacteria will dissolve it like you see a piece of food just dissolve into a liquid. That's bacterial activity. That's the normal process. It may happen in a lymph gland or it may be localized wherever it is as long as the body is healthy enough to take care of the waste. 

If the acids get very high in that process, then it has to do it inside a lymph node or a lymph gland. Then it's made into a fluid and dumped under the skin and the connective tissue to be perspired out of the body. If you don't perspire, you're in trouble. If you've taken a lot of hydrogenated oils, eaten fried foods, you're in trouble because that plastic waste blocks everything. So you can perspire but never get rid of high compound waste because you're blocked with that plastic because that plastic dehydrates, clumps, and blocks pores or connections under the skin. This is the skin. You've got 11 layers to get to the muscle here. So you've got all these layers of the skin, layers and layers. This is mainly the fat area. You see this lymph node here, and all this yellow stuff is lymph. The red is blood, and the blue is neurological. And then here you see the follicle, the hair, coming out through certain pores that have hair. So all that waste gets sent down to here, and the connective tissue here, then has to be perspired through all of those other layers of skin. When the plastic fat liquid plagues it, it blocks all of these secretion points. So you have to get the body up to 105 degrees to get it liquid again to be able to push it through. So all those plastic molecules will detach from each other to get it through. You have to get a hot tub, ideally, and sit in it for 90 minutes a day to get clean, 90 minutes a day. Or you're not going to improve if you've eaten margarine or anything fried in the last 50 years. I've watched people get better on this diet and do very well. And my rate of cancer reversal was 95 percent up to 1992. And then as I explored more and taking hot baths and everything, my rate, my ability to help people reverse cancer is now 99 percent.

I've only lost four people to cancer out of 500 in the last five years because of these baths. I have them take at least one 90-minute bath a day. If they want to sleep all night in it, that's terrific. Just fall asleep in a hot tub. Keeps it right at 105 degrees, four, five, six hours. You get up, take a nap in your bed, and then you're really charged and going for the day. And that's the best way to do it, if you want to move that stuff out fast. And that's the only way to really clean the system.

Q: How about Epsom salts in baths? 

A: Epsom salts are good in water. They'll help pull more stuff out. They'll help you perspire more. Sea salt will do it too.

Q: Combination of Epsom and salt?

A: Yeah, either one or both, that's fine. But if you have well water and it's not contaminated, you just put the salts in if you want. If you don't want the skin to dry, then you put a little coconut cream or a little milk in it. If you're using city water, you have to put raw milk, like three-quarters to a whole cup of milk, two heaping tablespoons of Epsom salt or sea salt or a combination of the two, and then three to four tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar to neutralize the toxic metals in there, including the fluoride. That will keep you from drawing in the substance. Now, I figured that out when I came back to the cities and started taking hot baths with this theory. I was in L.A., and there are 192 chemicals in L.A. water, because Saugus uses that water first, then down into the valley uses it next. The valley's an industrial area, and nobody thinks green in the valley. That's why you see those jokes about the valley mentality.

Q: The Jolly Green Giant.

A: It's like they call them the trailer park mentality. People, not really that way with all of them, but a lot of them. So they dump everything. They put their paints in the toilet and wash everything into the water system. Then it gets to L.A. for the third use. So you have 192 chemicals in that water. You have to neutralize those poisons. When I got into that water the first time, and not having been there for a long time, like 15 years, I shook. I was just a nervous wreck after 10 minutes in the water. Then I started putting different amounts of ingredients until I got it right. That ratio that I just gave you worked very well in L.A. It would probably work anywhere, unless your concentration of fluoride is higher. Fluoride is toxic. The garbage about that it reduces dental decay is absolute lie. They're using an old experiment that was done in Massachusetts in the 50s. What they did was they put one town, fluoride in the water. The next town, no fluoride, not water. The towns were right next to each other, basically using the same well. But in the municipal water, they put the fluoride in one and not the other. In the town that had fluoride in the water, there was less dental decay, fewer cavities overall, over a year period. Now you have to look at the finite. They're only telling you that information. In the people who had fluoride in the water, they were losing teeth a lot. Those people who didn't have fluoride were not losing teeth. So they had fewer teeth to have cavities. But they just tell you the one side of the fact, and that's it. The tooth loss was something like two per person at the level that they put the fluoride in the water. But there were less cavities. So fluoride is a very toxic substance. It's poisonous. Military, it's a lot of their waste for making aluminum and other metals. So the military industrial complex has all this waste they have to account for. So they force and browbeat counties and municipalities into putting fluoride in the water so they can sell it and get rid of it. They don't give it to these municipalities. They sell it to them and force them to put it in the water. 

Q: When you distill the water, does it take the fluoride out?

A: No. It turns into a gas form and then crystallizes again as it solidifies. You have to understand, a lot of things that are distilled transfer into gas, transform into gas. Mercury goes into a gas form and then a particulate form.

Q: So it goes back into the water?

A: It doesn't go back and never leaves the water. It goes with the water in a vapor form.

Q: Because in West Palm Beach they put fluoride, so I thought I was distilling it and getting rid of it.

A: No, you're transforming it into a vapor form and a gaseous form back into a crystallized form once the water cools. They talk about mercury and iodine having a half-life. They talk about mercury having a half-life of 45 days. What that means is it takes 90 days for mercury to transform from one toxic substance to another toxic substance. That doesn't mean it's dormant, there's no more active damaging mercury. As long as mercury is in and viable, is there, present, it will always do damage. Unless you have minute amounts that connect with other nutrients, then it allows like flying fish and swordfish to be able to jump very high, because it makes their bodies lighter and they're more buoyant. So, it has a purpose when, and it has a functionality and a non-toxicity when it's in a particular form. And that is rare. In small trace amounts, the amount that goes into vaccines, the amount that comes in amalgams, each one is 260 times the toxic level.

Q: Now they're promoting the spiral light bulbs, you know, the CFL light bulbs.

A: Full of mercury.

Q: I just read that on the internet the other day.

A: If one of them breaks, if they break in your house, you have to have the fire department come, you have to pay them $3,000 to $6,000 to decontaminate your house.

Q: Which kind of bulbs?

A: The spiral, you know, the gore, mercury filled.

Q: All the spirals?

A: All of them are mercury filled.

A: You get, what do they call those?

Q: Incandescent?

A: No, the new LEDs. What do you call them? LEDs. I thought they had another name for them. But the LEDs, no mercury, no vapors of any kind.

Q: So when they claim a full spectrum, they also have mercury?

A: No, those are not the spiral. Those are different.

Q: You said the fire department has to come and clean out the house?

A: You're supposed to call them. Most people don't have a clue because it doesn't say anywhere on the box. But if you call the fire department and tell them you broke one of those, they will immediately come over and detoxify your house. They'll come over in white suits, masks, just like you've got the most contaminated laboratory. They will be in your house cleaning it up. And you will get a bill from $3,000 to $6,000, depending upon how much is contaminated in your house. Let's say you had several doors to the house open, where the room where that broke, it explodes and goes into a vapor. It can leak into every room. If that happens, you close every door, and you get out of that room as quickly. You get out of the room, you close every door, get out of the room as quickly as possible, and you stop breathing. You've got to breathe. You get something wet if you can. Breathe out first and get a little breathing in there. And then you start moving. Hold your breath as long as you can until you get out of that room. Then you get out of that room, you take off those clothes in the bathroom, in the bathtub, and you rinse yourself off as quickly as possible in almost tepid water, almost body temperature. Get that mercury off. Leave those clothes in that bathtub. Then you go get some new clothes. What I did, I broke one one time. That's how I discovered it. I have these Israeli gas masks. I had one in the car, several in the house. I got pulled over by customs when I was going to the border. They thought I was a terrorist. I said, you don't live in L.A. We have spills all the time. If I'm on the road and a spill happens, I'm going to get that out of the trunk and have it right there for myself.  So I had these two canister masks that completely covers up to here on the head and all the way around, completely covers the eyes and the mouth and everything but the ears.  Then I put a sock cap over that, dampened it and put it on. Then I had a jumpsuit that I put on like a mechanic's jumpsuit. I went in there and I decontaminated the room. So I wouldn't have to pay $3,000 to $6,000. But that took me eight hours.

Q: How do you decontaminate it?

A: You have to get a solution like from grapefruit seed oil. So any of the Bio-Kleen products, B-I-O hyphen K-L-E-E-N, you mix that with water and you just wipe everything, the ceilings, the walls, the floors. If you've got carpet, I don't have any carpet in the house because carpet is highly toxic. It can take anything.

Q: Aajonus, before going through all that, would it be better just to get rid of the spirals in your house?

A: Absolutely.

Q: Okay, is it every kind of bulb that spirals?

A: Any bulb that spirals, yes.

Q: The fluorescent, the natural bulbs that go in those long fluorescent, they're okay?

A: No, these are fluorescent here, and they have toxic mercury vapor as well as some fluorescent vapors and aluminum. So they're toxic too. But any fluorescents, unless they are full spectrum. The full spectrum are okay if they're fluorescent.

Q: Fluorescent, full spectrum is the only thing that's safe.

A: Well, there's a debate there because I've experimented with those bulbs, and if I put coconut pulp next to the lights, all of a sudden I turn off the lights and you've got radioactive, you've got the coconut pulp's like a light, like it absorbs light like there's paints. So that looks like it's a little radioactive. So I'm not sure about those either. But I use all LED bulbs now. LED. LED bulbs. And, you know, like a 9-watt bulb is like a 60-watt to 100-watt regular bulb.

Q: Is that the one they want to discontinue, the LED, the old-fashioned bulb?

A: No, those are just regular.

Q: LEDs are the new ones.

A: LEDs are the new. They use very little energy.

Q: They last like 30 years.

A: Yeah, they can last up to 25 years.

Q: And then Kiva light is okay, right?

A: Pardon?

Q: The Kiva light is okay.

A: What's that?

Q: I mean the Kiva light, the one that's like the sunshine you put? Kiva, you remember that?

A: No.

Q: Oh, well.

A: I haven't experimented with that, so I don't know that.

Q: I'll ask you later.

A: Okay. Okay, so we have all these contaminants in the body. If your lymph system is working, you're lucky. If it's full of plastic in the glands and nodes, it's going to be backed up, so you're going to be dumping your poisons into your intestines. Now, 90% of your waste products are supposed to be perspired to the skin. It's supposed to be dumped under the connective tissue and out the skin. But things are so toxic now, we have these reactions as they come out the skin, and I will show you the different reactions so you'll understand and not freak when they happen to you. And also how to treat that localized area so you can reduce the damage to the skin. There will always be scarring and damage, but you can reduce it. 

Q: Would you like a chair to put in front of that computer?

A: No, because I have to bend over. Okay, so you understand all of that. Let's go to—oh, I just want to talk about—I don't have it there. Where are they? Vitamin supplements. Just to go over it. Remember I said that when they make a supplement, this is vitamin C in food, like little spongy balls. This is that dissolved. This is this dissolved with kerosene and made into a supplement, rock crystals. Nothing like here, and the behavior is nothing like real vitamin C. And this is natural vitamin C. We're not talking citric acid, which is just a chemical created that looks like the molecular structure of vitamin C. It has nothing to do with vitamin C citric acid. So there you have the different appearances. Now we'll go to B1 is the same way. This is B1 in its raw food form. This is made into crystals for a supplement. Has no relationship, and it does not work the same as true vitamin B1. It's toxic. This is full of kerosene. The vitamin C was full of kerosene. So all this high people are getting on their vitamin supplements are getting high from the kerosene, which causes an adrenaline reaction because of the toxicity from the kerosene. Adrenaline pumps because what? Adrenaline—almost all your hormones are 60% to 80% fat. What does the body use to detoxify the body and bind with contaminants? Fat. That's why I say a high-fat diet is very important in a toxic environment. In my books, I talk about fat being the most important concentrated nutrient that you can have. And everybody should be fat and have lots of fat. Now, I don't look that fat, but I am. I'm 21% body fat. Normally people this size maybe are 12% body fat. But when the fat molecule is raw, it's very tiny. When you cook it at varying temperatures, it will go from 5 to 50 times its normal size. So normally, this much fat, if it were cooked, I'd be like this. But because I eat only raw, and I've been eating raw for 40 years, only raw fats since 1972, except on three experiments, my fat's all raw, small molecules. Okay, now, when that goes out the skin, when the poisons go through the skin and out, we have different reactions.

Now, this was, I don't know if some of you have read my newsletters, knew about my being abducted in a hotel room and being injected with three hypodermics. In 2009, when they were coming out with the small, I mean the H1N1 vaccine, I was on an international radio show talking about it, the swine flu garbage. And they did it and tried to do it in 1976, and they accomplished it in 1976. They made this swine flu vaccine, and Ida Honorof, who was a consumer advocate, who was syndicated on 3,200 stations, was rallying against it with an M.D. from San Diego, Eleanor McBean. And they put all the statistics, they wrote a book called Vaccines, a Clear and Present Danger, mostly talking about the swine flu hoax. So, she got, because she was an accused, as a consumer advocate back in 1976, when this occurred, still mostly families owned your media networks, especially newspapers and radio shows. Now, conglomerates, General Electric, all these companies own all the networks now. So, no truth. Back then, they cared, to an extent. So, she got everybody in the world to watch this swine flu fiasco. And our vice president was who? Rockefeller. Owned five pharmaceutical companies. That made the swine flu vaccine. So, and he got Ford, the president, to go on television and take the shot. But, Ida Honorof got all these networks and media to go to the polling stations where these people were receiving these free, government-sponsored swine flu shots. 2,331 or 2,332 people dropped dead in two weeks. Mostly children and the aged. And that's what they say are more vulnerable to flu epidemics. But it's the swine flu. When I looked at it, when I knew they were coming out with this new swine flu fiasco and getting ready, they were saying April will have 2,630,000 doses ready to give to the people all over the world because it was going to contaminate all over the world. Hundreds of millions of people were going to die if they didn't get this swine flu vaccine. So, they got almost all of the countries in the world to buy this swine flu vaccine. 

I went on that show in February 2009, two months before the vaccine was supposed to be distributed. And I gave out all the information. The CDC said only 46 people died as a result of receiving the swine flu vaccine. And it was 2,331 or 2,332. So, I told everybody on this show where to go to get the information, the books, the proper statistics. The CDC was lying. The CDC is behind the pharmaceutical industry and all of that. I got death threats for five weeks. So, I left the country, and I went to a small island in the Philippines, and I was in a hotel room. And I awoke somewhere in the night, and two guys were at my side. You know, they were kind of military CIA-looking guys, clean cut. They were all Caucasian. They weren't Filipino. And I had a hypodermic hanging from my arm here and two on the bed, still full. And this one was almost completely empty. And this cloth was down to about here falling as I'm halfway sitting up. And both of them were shocked. This all happened in like three seconds, five seconds at the most. This guy over here grabbed the cloth and put it back over my face. I was out in a split second. There was no odor to it. And I've had ether many times in my life during surgeries. And it took 15, 17, one time 19 seconds to put me out. This had me out in a split second, no odor or anything. So, it was a highly developed chemical that's not on the market anywhere. They don't use it in hospitals or anywhere. So, it had me out. So, I woke up the next morning thinking it was a bad dream. And I turned over, and I was sick and aching all over the place. Three bumps with a red hole at the top. You know, the irritated area where the hypodermic had gone into my arm. So, I knew I was in trouble. I didn't know what had been injected in me, but I put it together. It was probably the swine flu because in that interview I said, the only way you can get swine flu is to be injected with it. You are not a pig. Pigs get swine flu. The only way you can get it is to be injected with it. Or you work with pigs and you breathe their dander all day long. Pigs don't have much dander. So, handling a pig and maybe brushing it or something like that, you might get a swine flu-like detoxification.

But that's the only way. But the only way for the average person to get it is to be injected with it. So, I think they injected me with it, didn't expect me to wake up and discover them, and not be able to handle it and deal with it. But I knew what to do. I was sick like crazy. All of a sudden my skin started exploding. I mean, huge patches just exploding in my skin. The biggest one was right here. You can see the scar. This whole area just exploded open. Oozing and just dripping. Not much blood, but lots of oozing and serum and fluid. Almost like impetigo. So, I knew I was passing out every 20 minutes. If I stood and was standing for 20 minutes, I would black out and hit the floor or the ground, wherever I was. So, I called from the hotel. I said, I need to get a driver. I need to go to a wharf right away. So, I knew I needed to get either shark or stingray. Every fish, when it's dead, will graduate in production of ammonia. Ammonia binds with poisons, doesn't let it get into the bloodstream or brain. So, that's what I wanted. I wanted that ammonia in my system. So, sharks and stingrays develop, once they're dead, it's like every two hours the ammonia doubles in it. It's like the Swedes and Norwegians will rot their shark for nine months and eat it. Sometimes they'll get a toxic ammonia reaction, but they do it to help clean industrial pollution out of their systems. And they have to deal with a lot of cold weather and temperatures, so they need a little bit better health. So, they do that once a year. So, I went looking for shark or stingrays. This fellow in his van took me around, the passenger van, took me around to two wharfs, and finally we found a stingray that had been dead two days. Perfect. Very high. Chopped it up as much as I could, you know, into a mince, and then ate it, vomited a couple of times, kept it down. In 24 hours I stopped the blackouts. I would have been dead probably in 48 hours or less if I hadn't done that. But I knew what to do, you know, and then consumed lots of... I'd take medium young coconuts, scrape the meat out of it, and blend it with the coconut water. So, I was consuming that. I had some cheese and butter with me.

So, I was consuming the cheese to help bind with some of those poisons and the butter to strengthen my system. And the coconut cream to help flush out the garbage. So, I knew what to do, but I was having explosions, and the explosions went on for six months. Then a year to that date in April, I went through it again. It exploded more on this foot and this leg rather than this one. And all over... I mean, it looks like I was hit by shrapnel. I've got scars all over my shoulders, back. You can see the scars here, big ones here, all over where it came out just exploding on my skin. Toxins. So, that's what happens when you have concentrated pollution like that leave the system. Now, it could have accumulated from vaccines or anything like that in your body in a particular area, and you're still going to have an eruption like that. You don't have to have three shots like I did. That was their plan. He got the flu shot. I mean, he got the swine flu, see, and he didn't have any injections. I think that was their ploy, what they were going to do. But I caught them. The biggest noise that came from my radio show in February was that a rap group in England heard that show. They spent a million dollars on a music video called Just Say No to the Vaccine. It's 7 minutes 32 seconds. You can still see it. Just Say No to the Vaccine YouTube video. Music video. And you come up with it and you can watch it. And you've got my voice going through it saying, after I think 13 seconds into the song, the only way you can get swine flu is to be injected with it. And then you've got my voice coming through and two other places in that 7 minutes. Now, mine's the only current voice in that. But they spent a million dollars on it. They have babies getting injected. They have bodies from the Nazis using chemical injections and stuff. So you see all these bodies. It goes on for 7 minutes and 32 seconds. That made so much noise, you know, parroting what I said that to my interview and that propelled it all over the world. Seven countries sued Glasgow for convincing them to buy that when there was no swine flu. Seven countries sued that pharmaceutical company. We paid $7 billion for it. Bush paid $7 billion for it. Our government didn't sue. In fact, what they did was they passed a law where you can't sue the pharmaceutical industry for any damage from a vaccine. 

Q: Well, he probably got a piece of the action.

A: So, like I said earlier, all of our politicians, everyone of them, has stock in pharmaceuticals. Vested interest there. Okay, so I'm going to take a look at these. And you're not coming up to them. Okay, this was just a month ago. Well, it started January. Let's see, December. This is what it looked like in December. This is a cancer that came up from this injection, but it came up over here. You can see it was coming out all over. This time it lasted a whole year. Gave me a break. It started in April at the anniversary of the injections. Went on for two months. It was pretty light. Gave me a two-month break, and then it went on, and it lasted up until a month ago. And this was a tumor that was up here on the chest. And you can see it started off as one of these little red bumps all over there. But that particular lymph gland got swollen there and started pushing those chemicals out through the skin. And then here it was a month later when it started scabbing. Now, what I did was I kept putting the bacteria from my saliva on it. I put vinegar on it. Vinegar, there's certain amino acids in vinegar that binds with poisons. Helps chelate with metals and poison. I was putting on that there. It was making it a little bit more irritable and painful. So then I just started using my saliva, and it just started peeling off. Every day some would peel off, and now the tumor's gone. But that was there for about three months. But that was actually a tumor. This is just... This is right after it happened. Well, this is a year after, two years after some of this. Still coming out of my body. See how it's coming out? That's the second year after. That started coming out a little bit again. This is one exploded there and here, and a little bit here. So you can see it started erupting again in those areas.

Q: Were you able to determine what exactly your body was throwing off?

A: Well, just parts of it, because my body had fractionated the chemicals. So I could tell some of them, but they put a whole different soup in me, I'm sure. They wanted to make sure I died.

Q: Were those basal cells or squamous?

A: Basal. Squamous cells are a lot thicker and larger. I mean, the one that was on my chest was going from a basal to a squamous and it starts scabbing like that. See how it's just coming through the skin, and this is a week later or a few days later. You can see how bad it's getting. It's coming out through the skin, exploding through the skin.

Q: The nail.

A: Oh, it just discolored my nails and everything. I used to have Michelangelo feet. The only part of my body that was not harmed by anything. And this destroyed even my feet. My whole bottom of my foot was all the way from the heel to the toes were thick with callus after that. It destroyed so much skin in my body. Remember, cancer is nothing other than the collection of dead cells. Your body can't dissolve them and get rid of them, so it collects them into fibroids or cancerous tumors, malignant tumors. Well, the whole bottom of my foot was a thick pad like this of dead cells. It was like I had thick socks on and had been out in the snow for a week. My foot was all numb. It's still that way from the arch to the ball, not the toes anymore. Most of that hardening is gone. But I was taking a knife, my honey knife, and I was cutting off layers this thick off the ball of my feet. I was just cutting them off because they would get so big and start to wrinkle up and dry that it was uncomfortable to walk on. I just cut them away.

Q: Well, your foot was all swollen there.

A: Oh, huge.

Q: Just from the fluids from the poison.

A: Yeah, they were under the skin trying to come out, and they were damaging the fluids under the skin. They were damaging connective tissue as well.

Q: What happens to the poisons for the year before you started having these symptoms? What's it doing in your body?

A: Well, my body has enough fat. Right in the last four months, I've had severe pain here. Now, I had a few of the scars. I can show you scars from where they punctured me because there are absolute scars there because those did come out a little bit. But this year, starting in about September, I started having massive pain in the arm, right where those injectors were, all the way to the bone, every muscle and tendon. Again, I couldn't lift my arm like when I was a kid and after injections. And right now, I did that for three months, and then two days it was gone. Then as I was getting off the plane today, it moved from here up to here. So I started having pain again up here. So at least now I know it's moving. So I know the body's now in control of all that that was deposited here. Tendons, muscles, everything. So my body had contained poison vessels or, you know, fluids in my tissues. So, getting ready for a time when I could detox as safely as possible. That's not safe, but as safely as my body could do it. Because I've got scarring all over my body now. See how it's progressing?

Q: Yeah.

A: This was after I soaked it in hot water and took all those things off. You see all this skin just peeling away. This was all after cleaning it and watching it dry for an hour. See, it's just peeling off. Now, it created a tumor right here, a cancerous tumor, melanoma, right here. It got darker than that and bigger than that. But I was able to dissolve it and get rid of it. Now we're back to the beginning of that one again.

Q: How did you dissolve it?

A: I put vinegar on it.

Q: What's that?

A: Vinegar. Vinegar, okay. Raw apple cider vinegar.

Q: Vinegar, okay.

A: Okay, let's take a look at another detoxification. This was mercury. It was coming out of my jaw. See how black it was? Now, I had an electronic microscope before somebody broke into the house and stole it. It was an $11,000 microscope. Stole it four years ago. This was like eight years ago when this happened. You see the mercury coming out there on the jaw. You see how it swelled up the whole area? And it was painful, even though it maybe doesn't look like it. It was pretty painful. You see how it's deteriorating all the tissue around? That's not white blood cells, which they say is infection. And remember, when you have pus coming out of an area, 99% white blood cells. Your body, let's say you eat a cooked meal. What happens? Leukocytosis. A third of your white blood cells will leave the bloodstream, go into the intestines, and eat up the contamination from cooked foods. Every time you eat a cooked meal, that happens. So, in this area, you think that white... They can leave any area and go to an area. If you don't have bacteria, because you're taking antibiotics or whatever, you can stop that migration of the white blood cells to help that area. That's why dogs and cats will lick that stuff up in a second, because that's good. It's only 1% contaminated. It's only white blood cells, so animals love that white blood cell. Concentrations, fatty good cells. But this isn't. This is actually burned cells from the mercury. That's not pus. Actually burned cells. Literally burned.

Q: Do you think it was specific to your fillings, and that's why it came out of your jawline?

A: I had 16 in my body up until 1978. I had them removed, but this was until 2002, April 2002. It actually came out of my skin. This was a finger detox from penicillin. That was this finger right here. That's not nasty. I had stuck my hand a lot more when I was 3 years old, cut off the end of the finger. They took a grafted skin from here and put it on here. Now it turned into rock. I could put this through glass. When I started eating meat, a year after I began eating meat, it turned red and fell off. The graft fell off, and then my more normal skin grew in. Now it's nice and soft. But when that had happened, they injected tetanus all around that finger. So here I had tetanus coming out this finger. This was 50-some years later, 58 years later. I'm just showing you the different things as it got bigger and expanded. You can see it swelling up over here now. Now, interesting, a lot of times, you can see that area right there. It was open. I've had other people going, you press it and a lot of pus will come out, which are white blood cells. This one didn't do that. My body reabsorbed the white blood cells because they were still good, and that whole area of skin just peeled off. We're talking a thick layer of skin like a snake's skin. Peeled off completely all around from here all the way down and around the whole finger. What you have to realize, whenever you have a condition, it is the body cleansing and healing itself. It is not disease. The disease is contamination. The body's reaction, which the medical profession identifies as disease, is the cleansing, the healing process. They want you to freak out about this stuff and go get more medications and put more contaminates in your body so you have more of this. You keep running to them and it's a cycle. It just snowballs. But I don't do that. I don't go to them. I just deal with all this on my own.

Now, this woman came to me with cancer of the nose. When she came, it was probably about right here. This is how much it grew in, let's see, this is 2002. You'll see the progression over a six-year period that she was my client. The medical profession wanted to take out all of her bone, all the bone all the way around and put a plastic face bone in her face. When people have that kind of operation, they're dead in a year and not just six months. They said if she didn't get that done, she'd be dead in six weeks. That's the point when she came to me. She lived ten years. And I said, Barbara, the only thing you're going to lose is your nose at the most, maybe not all of it. You've got so much contamination from all your dental amalgams, you need to have those removed. You've got all that toxicity stored up there. Flu shots, all that's coming out here from your brain. Your brain detoxifies through your nose, your throat, your gums, your teeth, and your tongue, sometimes through the ears. That causes all kinds of facial sores and reactions. I said, Barbara, if you can live with a damaged nose, fine. She was a nightclub singer. She was also exposed to that phony smoke. When they used to use dry ice, there was no harm done. Sure, some oxygen was gone out of the air, but this vaporized hydrogenated oils is what they're doing. They're vaporizing hydrogenated plastic oils into the air. All these actors and musicians are breathing this stuff in. It's causing even more reactions with mercury and all the other stuff from dental reactions. Now, a lot of the dental anesthesia causes a lot of tongue and jaw and mouth and throat cancers. 

Q: So how do you go to the dentist without having to inject anything? 

A: You go to a dentist that has a water jet on his or her drill. I don't like women dentists, not because I'm prejudiced against women, but women like to make everything as so clean as they can get. So they take two times more tooth away than a male will. Literally, I've gone to six female dentists and six male dentists, and every female dentist robbed me of more tooth than ever. And that's just a consciousness. It's a bad cleanliness consciousness. So I won't go to a woman dentist anymore for that reason. I've even told them, I said, don't get... I went to one that was a holistic one, and I said, I don't want you to get overly clean thinking. I don't worry about bacteria and tar. The contaminants that come out of the brain and the mercury that locks onto the tooth, that damages the dentine. The bacteria is there to eat up the damaged dentine. Now vice versa. So the metal comes first. You need to brush your teeth, clean your mouth, do oil pulling, something, to get those metals off of your teeth as they're draining from your brain or even from amalgams that are draining out your gums that damage the teeth. So you can see, this was at the end. She died in about 2004, I think it was, or 2006. And at the funeral, two of her daughters came up and she said, thank you so much. They would have killed my mother in weeks. And although her nose was embarrassing to her, we got to be ten more years with her. So think about that. It's okay to deal with that. She just went around with a bandage over her nose in public when she was at home it was wide open. So you can just see what she had to live with. This is about the way it was when she started. Right there. This was the first when she came to me. And that was one of the last pictures I took. So that's all that advanced. She lost probably 20% more of her nose.

Q: And you just waited for it to get well, or did you treat it?

A: Well, on an open wound like this, it's difficult to treat it without massive burn and irritation.

Q: So you just let it heal, let the body heal?

A: I just had to let her, I had to do it all with food. If it were on some other part of the body, I would have had her put some pineapple on it, some coconut cream the next day, vinegar on it the next day. And I'll show you other tumors that we've worked with. But when it's on the face and so painful in the nose, I couldn't treat it directly because she was in excruciating pain with headaches when we tried. So that was just one of those situations. I'm just trying to give you all different perspectives so you know what is in store if you have a problem. Just get through it.

Q: What about ozone therapy?

A: Ozone therapy is terrible. It deprives the body of oxygen and it turns fats into what they call putrefies oils in the body. Okay, you take an oil that's been oxidized. Let's say you take olive oil and they put it through that process. Smell it. It is rancid. And olive oil doesn't normally turn rancid because it's a natural food. Oils can turn rancid once they're treated and processed. And that ozonation and the oxidation is a process that changes the chemistry. Have you smelled olive oil that's been treated that way?

Q: I haven't smelled it like that because I have an ozonated olive oil that I use for irritation on the skin. But because you have to put it in the fridge to make sure that the ozone will not leave the oil, I don't smell it. I haven't smelled it.

A: Well, then leave it out in the air. In fact, as soon as you ozonate it, take a fresh olive oil and ozonate it, and you'll see that it really is rank in 24 hours. When you chill it, it subdues the bacterial odors. So, very toxic stuff. When the whole body is treated that way, all of the fats are damaged in the body, putrefies. It's going to cause massive detoxification.

Q: But how come in Europe they're using ozone therapy for dental procedures to make sure that there will be no cavity?

A: You can treat tissue in different ways and harden it. So, it's a way of treating something, but that doesn't mean it's leading to good health.

Q: This is an alternative form of medicine, too.

A: Let me tell you, all the alternatives are this far away from the medical, because they're using the medical model to get to that alternative. And that's the big problem. And 99 times out of 100, if you do the opposite of what the pharmaceutical and medical industries say, you'll be doing proper. 99 times out of 100, you do the opposite of what they say, and you will be right. Remember, the pharmaceutical houses write the procedure manuals for the doctors. Merck's is this thick. And how many times does the word heal occur in the book? 53 times, I think it is. 51 or 52 or 53 times. And it's only talking about a wound healing. There's nothing about a disease healing, and the word cure does not exist. They don't want you even thinking toward healing and curing, except in a wound.

Q: So, how long did she live after the nose healed?

A: It didn't heal. It was constantly... I mean, you see how little the body was throwing off dead cells up to the end. I mean, the doctor said that the whole face would be taken over in six months, and she wouldn't even live through it. She probably lived three, six weeks. Ten years. You just can't panic. If you go the doctor's route, they will kill you and make a lot of money killing you. For every cancer that is treated, they make a minimum now of $176,000. Average is $226,000 or $227,000 per cancer patient. That's the average. And there's some that even go higher than that.

Q: Did she die of the cancer-related...

A: Pardon?

Q: Did she die of the cancer-related...

A: She didn't die of cancer. She died of old age.

Q: Was she on the primal diet beforehand, before she came to see you?

Q: How old was she?

A: Let's see. When I was doing that, I wasn't putting age as I put age now. She was like 82, somewhere around there.

Q: Did it stay raw?

A: She was not a healthy person. She was 100% raw that whole ten years or nine years.

Q: What did she do? She just stayed home?

A: No, she didn't. She just wore a bandage over it. Just a gauze bandage over it. Okay. Here's a breast cancer. Now, this is a squamous cell underneath the skin. Just starting to break the skin, but you can see the layers of dead cells that are collected in this glob. When the body can't dissolve dead cells, the proper way is bacterially. The second way is fungally. The third way is in the lymphatic system, using solvents, like a virus, to break it down. And that's the most toxic way. And that's basically what this is leading to right here. Now, the body's cancer cells are viral cells. Cancer cells have a dissolving fluid inside them. So, when the cancer cell dies, it sets all this acid into the system to dissolve the dead cells. So, a cancer cell, malignant tumor, can dissolve at any time and in a fast rate. If you have a benign tumor, you've got no circulation into it. This has circulation. You've got veins, you've got lymphatic, you've got neurological flow going into this, at least to the cancer cells in the midst of all these dead cells that are there. So, this can dissolve rather quickly or over a shorter period of time. A malignant, I mean a benign cell, there's no circulation into it, so it has to work on it from the outside in. And it can't help itself. A malignant tumor has lots of help from different fluid systems. I'm just showing you different views of it. And this is as it's progressing. You see now it's starting to shrink on the diet.

Q: It's your hour and 45 minutes.

A: Hour and 45 minutes? Okay, well, I don't want to leave you with that awful thing before we go to lunch. Let me get something to lunch. Oh, this is a bladder stone that I had. Now, you see the size of this bladder stone? It's the largest one in history. I have the largest one. Why don't you go down in Ripley's, right? Not Ripley's, who is it?

Q: Oh, Guinness.

A: Guinness, yes, Guinness book. Now, when the surgeon saw this, I was 50, 2006, so I was nearly 60. I was 59 years old when I started having problems with this. And all of a sudden I couldn't pee unless I lifted my leg like a dog. So I really had to go over to the toilet and pee like this. I couldn't figure out what was going on. Then I was having penis pain like crazy. So I went to the urologist, and I wouldn't let him do x-rays. I would only let him do ultrasound. And he sent pictures. He said, my God, that's a huge stone. I've never seen anything like it. He called the nurses in and everybody. Nobody had ever seen a stone that big in the medical books.

Q: It was a kidney stone, right?

A: No, bladder. Bladder stone. Bladder stone. So you can see how huge that thing is. So he said, you know, the only way to get that out, you know, surgically, we're going to have to go up to your penis. And then you'll get a laser blast to break up in parts. And I said, okay.

Q: Not through the penis, you know.

A: I said, yes. I said, absolutely. Because I could see that was so big, there was no way I was going to dissolve that. Okay. And, you know, maybe 50 years I could dissolve it. So, I mean, that's the only time I've let them put me out, you know, since I was probably 21 years old. And when I went into the operating room, I saw why I agreed to that. The pipe they were going to put up my penis was this big. Through that little urethra, that big. And I said, I'm glad I'm going out for this. So, and then they put a video tape, you know, feed up there. They've got a laser tube. They've got a fluid tube and then a suction tube. There's four tubes going inside that tube. And he said, it'll take me about 45 minutes, 40 minutes to dissolve this thing. And I'll be out in two hours. He said, because when he got to the core, it was all mercury. And he said, this has to have been forming for over 50 years. And I said, well, ever since I can remember, I was very slow to pee. Three minutes minimum to even start the passage. And it was never a big flow. So ever since I can remember, my mother used to slap me on the back and say, hurry up and pee. You know, it was my way my whole life. And then when that was blasted out of me, I was peeing like a racehorse. First time in my life. And now I'm 59 years old. So you can see the intensity of it. Now this is the picture of it when they were inside of me. That's a close-up of those. This was inside me. This is the photograph. You can see it. Now it looks like coral, and it was coral. Stones all the way around. But the center was mercury. He said solid mercury, and it would not break up.

Q: Good.

A: Yeah, that was one way to isolate all that mercury from all those injections that I got. Instead of in the stomach lining or somewhere else. So, I mean, the nurse said I'd never seen him... He was sweating like a horse for an hour. Because it took him an hour, almost two hours to break it up. An hour and 48 minutes, they timed it. So, you know, because those lasers, if you miss, you cut the bladder wall. And then you have massive bleeding. So, you know, you have to get it just right. Each time you send a blast of the laser out to break that up. And he said that center mercury would not break. And he said when the fluid came out, he kept a pail for me. And it was charcoal gray, the fluid. And this was just some of the particulate. They were chips, actual chips that were in the bottom of that pail. So, that's how bad it was. Your body can do all kinds of things. You just have to look at it rationally. You can't take the medical perspective. You know, he wanted me to go on this diet with all this kind of garbage. So, I wouldn't have kidney stones. Basically, it would have demineralized my body. I said I'm not going to have that again because I'm not getting any more injections. So, of course, I haven't had any problems with it at all. I pee in seconds, and I'm finished peeing in maybe 30 seconds. That's good. That's normal. Okay, let's take a break.

Q: Oh, but just before you go, what happened to that woman's breast? Did she die, or what happened?

A: No, it's still going away. She's still in process.

Q: She's in, she's still, did she operate or chemo?

A: No, she's still going on the diet. That was only recent pictures of her.

Q: Okay, but did she do chemo already?

[break]

A: Now, this guy was deteriorating his whole body. He was even 15 pounds thinner than this.

Q: Oh, my goodness.

A: That is worst. But this is when he came, he went to Hippocrates first, gained 15 pounds, but didn't get well. You know, kept, nothing could help him. This was six months on my diet.

Q: Oh, my goodness.

A: Huge difference.

Q: Can we take a picture now? Is that private?

A: Yeah, well, you can get this off the internet.

Q: Yeah, it's on your website.

A: It's good, too, wewant2live.com, and it's on there. I think it's on the front page, isn't it? Somewhere in there. It is not my website. I just contracted with somebody to sell my information that wasn't in the books. Because I stopped books. Books are too expensive. So the newsletters, there was 1,500 pages of newsletters from 2006. So there's three books' worth of information. And that has all the detox information in it, plus the new stuff that I'm putting out now. We'll go into the newsletters. But you can see that. This picture was actually taken a year after this, but he was like this in six months. He took the pictures like this, but with no glasses. So I told him to retake the pictures with glasses. So we can see it's the same person. So it would be the same appearance. He was 30 years old here.

Q: Oh, my gosh.

A: Yeah, and what was he, 36 here?

Q: Wow.

A: So you can see the difference. Now, this is another way that dead cells can produce on the body. You see how his skin is very dried and wrinkled here? Instead of building tumors, he put all of his dead cells in his neck. So all this is dead tissue, like fibroids.

Q: Is it hard and firm?

A: Oh, yeah. Well, it's not one solid piece. It's just a lot of dead cells, like bricks on a wall.

Q: Was he a smoker?

A: No. No, but he had bad reactions to his vaccines when he was a child. So he's the guy that I said in the book that took five minutes to say a simple sentence. Now he talks too much. But you can just see.

Q: How old was he when you took that picture?

A: Oh, this was, I think, just 30 years ago. Well, what I did was, it was worse than this. This is after about a year after I had him put pineapple and vinegar alternating on his neck to break down the cell. You see there's less wrinkling here, a lot less dead cells. But he only did it on one side of his neck. On this side he didn't do it. See, this is irritating because I had him put that stuff on to remove it. But that's just an idea, another way that your body can remove the poisons out. Now this fellow is a guitar player and singer. Around lots of smoke. And you see where he got his. Remember the other singer had hers in the nose. This is around the eye. Malcolm Gold, you can see his. He has two videos on his ten years on the diet, he and his wife. 

Q: He got this after he was on the diet?

A: Yes, but he was in a show that had heavy smoke for two hours for a whole year. And I went to see the show when he came to L.A. at the Universal Amphitheater. And there was someone, I said, you've got to quit that show. And this came up three months after he quit the show.

Q: The same sort of liquid smoke you're talking about.

A: That's when it was the worst. Yeah, it's that vaporized smoke. That's when it started draining out of the hole.

Q: Do you have them put something topically on in addition to your diet?

A: Yeah, I have them put pineapple and vinegar.

Q: Just fresh pineapple?

A: Fresh pineapple. And yes, you just take a slice of the pineapple and you rub it. You don't rub it on anything where there's an open sore.

Q: No.

A: It'll burn like hell and that's where you already have cells dissolving and serum coming out. You don't need that there, it'll just irritate. You can put butter or coconut cream on a spot like that. Coconut cream will burn a little bit, butter might be a little bit better. Because it helps soothe the skin that's being damaged by this toxic fluid coming out. So, you put the pineapple around these areas and vinegar, one day, one next day. You can only put it on once a day. 

Q: Apple cider vinegar?

A: Yeah, raw apple cider vinegar. Anyway, it took him a whole year to go through that. His family was freaking out in panic, he was going to lose his eye. But that's what they tell you, the doctors want you to take their treatments. They'll tell you the worst thing is going to happen. And I just saw him last week in New Jersey, Sunday, and he and his wife came. I mean, he looks like he's now, what, 44? And he looks like he's 27. His wife's the same way.

Q: And it didn't damage his eye.

A: There's not even a scar left. He got through without a scar. No scar there, and that's how big of a swollen it was. I mean, his family really panicked, and all of his friends said, that that Aajonus is out of his f-ing mind. Oh, this young lady, she came to me, she was completely crippled. Her skin was completely black. She had, she was in her, she went to college. She lived on Antigua, the island. And she was in her sophomore year in college, but transferred to a different college. And they lost her vaccine records, so they asked her to take her vaccines all over again. So she got like 12 vaccines. The mercury just burned her skin. She couldn't eat anything. She came to me in a wheelchair. When her mother took her over one of these little thresholds like this, she was taking her over so slowly, screaming in pain with the slightest jolt. Screaming in pain. And I gave her, and she wasn't able to eat anything without vomiting. Her whole body was half the size that it is right here when she came. And her skin and bones were gray. I have pictures, but she says, I can't use it. She doesn't want anybody to see them. And her skin is just peely, peeled gray from all the mercury and aluminum. And I gave her a half a cup of my kefir that I had made. And she like drank that in like five minutes. She hadn't been able to eat anything. It took two hours to eat a half a cup of anything. She ate it in like 20 minutes or 15 minutes or even less. So I gave her another half a cup and another half a cup. By the time she left after an hour and 15 minutes, she was laughing for the first time in three years. Now she's feeding herself and everything. But this was 2009, and I saw her in 2008 for the first time. This was only a year on the diet. She's eating the custard here, as you can see. So she's reading. She's able to function now. Now I mean she's out of bed, and she's functional. But when I saw her the first time, the only thing she could move was her head. And I could never understand. Her mother would put her ear right over her mouth to hear, and then she would talk to me. So that's how bad of shape she was in, really bad. All industrial pollution. 

Now this one, let's start off with where it started. So this fellow is like 62, 63 years old, I forgot, when he first came to me. This is a tumor in his jaw right here. And he kept taking supplements, and I said there are no real supplements. I don't care. Standard process, and they have to put it in that kerosene. So you're eating kerosene. And he took supplements for 60 years, lots of them. So this was his process. And you saw he kept getting bigger, started to cut off his belly to swallow and breathe. That's where it was getting very large. And then he decided to have it surgically removed. So he had it surgically removed, and it took me three weeks to talk to his surgeon. The surgeon wanted to take his whole jaw away. He wanted to take all the lymph glands from here, both sides, remove all the lymph glands. I said, doc, your lymph gland cleans the body. What happens if you take his ability to clean? Where is the tumor going to go next time if it still has dead cells to remove? It's going to go somewhere else. It will go to his lungs. Wouldn't it be better to go back in the same place where it's less harmful? So he said okay. So he made an incision, you can see the scar, all the way up around here. So he cut out the tumor, but this is the second growth of it. I don't like surgery, but he couldn't breathe. He couldn't swallow. So it was either feed him through a tube and be completely bedridden or go back to a life. But it only took a year for this to grow back, a year and a half for it to grow back. And you see, from having it cut, the body at his age, and he'd been only on the diet a little bit, very little. He was an elderly fellow. So you can see, none of his veins, he's got all kinds of bleeding in here. Massive bleeding in here because his veins didn't grow and clot properly. He's got this thing growing too fast. And then finally it ruptured right here. And then he went the medical route. You can see the scar here. So he had chemotherapy and he was dead in two weeks. This is the second growth. But it didn't cut off his breathing and swallowing the second time, even though it was larger.

Q: This was not cancer?

A: This is cancer. Now that was the first tumor. I didn't want him to take any of the skin because of those veins and capillaries. But he cut a whole chunk of that skin out of there and that's why it came back like this. I was upset about that. And that's the tumor. I had to analyze it. It cost $9,300 to analyze for everything. And what they found was supplements. Kerosene and lots of mineral supplements. And that's what it was full of. And I told him. And he continued taking them until this lab test came back and then he stopped taking supplements. It was too freaking late. 60 years, he took like 80 supplements a day. Kerosene, if they're natural. If they're not natural, they've got gasoline or they're completely synthetic. Vitamin E, 95% of the vitamin E out there is Kodak and Fuji's development film. Development solution, the throwaway development solution. Kodak and Fuji spent $100 million a year in research because when they have to take that film waste, when they used to have to do that, they'd have to put it in stainless steel drums, thick stainless steel drums, in 12-foot concrete vaults in the ground in tombs. Very expensive. Lots of land, very expensive process. So they were trying every year, they paid scientists $100 million a year to figure out how to decontaminate that fluid and either put it back into nature or utilize it for some chemical process in industry or something. Well, in about 1970, no, my nutritionist who taught me already knew about it. He taught me in 1972. So this had been about 1966, somewhere around there, that they figured out that the chemical byproduct of developing films looked like the same or 70% the same as d-alpha-tocopherol or tocopherol, which is vitamin E. So now they sell you, that's why Fuji and Kodak are still in big business. Even though they don't develop film anymore, they've got enough of this stored in tanks to sell vitamin E until 2056. So 95% of the vitamin E out there is not even vitamin E at all. It's Kodak and Fuji waste product from developing fluid. If you go into a health food store and get a natural vitamin E, five units of each 100 will be from soy or corn, again with kerosene in it. Then the rest of the 95% will be Kodak or Fuji development waste. 

These people are ruthless. They will make money at anything, and they make a fortune from it. They don't have to bury it anymore. Now they're digging it out of their graveyards and selling it as vitamin E, and they'll put it in anything that's fortified with vitamin E. Development waste. So that's a kerosene and supplement tumor. This is a 68-year-old woman. She developed a stye here above her eye, and it took about a month to go away, and they had her rub pineapple on it one day, vinegar on it the next, and it was gone in a month. This is a woman who cut off her finger. This is when it's growing back. You see the little finger coming out. You see all that little finger growing back. This is an early stage of regrowth.

Q: It grows back like a lizard's tail?

A: Yeah. See it growing back slowly. Now this is when it was first cut off. And that's the way it was a year after. But now today, I mean, that was in 2008. When I saw her last year, you couldn't even tell. You know, this deformity here and the crooked nail on that finger. It's all straight now. And this was a 56-year-old woman. Did she cut off any of the bone? Oh, yeah, took off part of the bone when you saw it. See? That much of the bone went from here to here. Cut off that much of the bone. That's immediately after it happened.

Q: She just went on the diet?

A: Well, she had been on the diet. She has a big coconut juicer that I imported from Thailand. She got her finger stuck in it, ground her finger off. So there was nothing to sew back on. It got ground up with the coconut. So this has grown back on its own.

Q: What was the treatment there?

A: Well, what I had her do is I had her put lime juice on the open wound. And she screamed a lot, of course. I was in a motorcycle accident. And I was wearing a short-sleeved shirt, shorts, sandals. Took all the skin off, all the way here, part of the elbow bone off. Took all of this bone off. So I had muscle and skin and bones. I mean, very little skin showing in those areas. All down my hip, all the way down. All the ankle bone was shaved off by the asphalt and part of the toe bone. You know, that lump on the outside. And what I did was I put lime juice on it. Now, lime juice is truly an antiseptic. Lemon juice helps fermentation and helps bacterial growth and fermentation in nature. That's why it's good to marinate in. Lime juice is not a good thing to marinate in because it stops fungal bacterial activity. So it stops digestion. But what I like about it is I had all the asphalt in those wounds. And I couldn't clean it out. It was too painful. So I had all these little spots of asphalt. I took out the larger ones that were the size of sand, but some that were smaller. I just couldn't pick them all out. It was just too painful. So I put the lime juice on. The lime juice coats any foreign particle. And it just, like, puts a plastic sealing over it. So even though it stays inside, my body wouldn't be trying to get rid of it with, like, white blood cells. So I wouldn't have pus and all of that. So I put the lime juice on first, bit onto a towel and screamed a lot. So I put all that on. And then I put honey over that. Then coconut cream over that. Then butter on thin slices of meat. Put meat there as my skin with butter on it. Then I put coconut oil on the backside. Took damp cloths and then put those over the meat. Then plastic over the cloth, the damp cloth, keep them from drying out. And then wrapped it with an ace, all with an ace. Wrapped it with gauze and then an ace bandage over that. So kept it on. In 12 days, all my skin was back. And in six weeks, all my bones were back. You know, all of these. So, as I had her do the same thing here.

Q: Sorry, do you do that every day?

A: No, I change it once every three days. When it stunk. And, you know, I had to hire two nurses for the first 12 days. Because I had split. I had taken so much skin off and everything. And I had split the bone from the knee down to the ankle. Because it was a big 650-pound Harley. And these foreigners, they were from Denmark or Holland or something. And they weren't looking the right direction. And, you know, in Thailand you're going the same way as England. And these people walked right out in the street in front of me. So I had to bury the bike on top of my leg or I had to kill two of them. And I was only going like 18 miles an hour. But they walked right out in the street in front of me. So just crushed that leg and took all the skin off. So I was in a lot of pain with that. Where the femur—I forgot to turn that on, didn't I? Did I, did I, didn't I? Yeah. Where the femur sits on top of the tibia. The top of the tibia was all, all these fragments. It was fragmented, just broke off the top. So I had all those fragments up in there. And I went to a hospital. I laid on the street for 45 minutes waiting for the pain to subside. And my knee just kept getting larger and larger. The shape, so I thought it was out of place. So I just needed to have them put it back in place. And it was 10.30 at night after I had waited 45 minutes. So no chiropractor was open. And this was in Jomtien, Pattaya, Thailand. So, you know, I went back to the hotel, put all that stuff on. So, you know, waited for the temperature. So an hour and a half later I said, I got to go to the hospital. I have to have them put this knee back in place. So I went to the hospital. Intern was there and freaked out. Said, I'm not touching that. You need to have your skin grafted. You need to take the skin from your thigh over here and your buttocks. Put it all over here and all down here. He was freaked out. And I said, no, all I want you to do is put this knee back in place. He says, I'm not even touching you. So he called the osteosurgeon out of bed. It was probably 11.45 at night. So I waited an hour for the osteosurgeon to get there. And he took a long look at that. And I said, listen, all I want you to do is just put this back in place. 

I'm in a lot of pain right here. I'm not in pain here or here. I can take care of that. He's freaking out. You need transplants, grafting. And I said, no, no. He said, I'm not touching that leg without x-ray. I said, okay, you get one x-ray this way, and you take it from here to here. And you get one from the side, that's it. And I dial the x-ray machine. I put it on its settings. The radiologist was completely agreeable, all of it. So I let him take two photographs. Saw that the tibia was split from here down to here and all those fragments in the knee tibia. And he said, you will never walk again if you don't get surgery. And they wanted to cut me from here all the way down to there. They wanted to pin the bone together all the way down. Eight to 12 pins, eight to ten pins minimum. And then he wanted to clean out all of this. So I've been cut from here all the way up to here. Of course, they would have had to cut away a lot of muscle to get to it, to get in here to the joint. I've seen people who've had that surgery. This leg is like an inch to two inches shorter. The calf muscle is, you know, two-thirds the size it used to be. And they're crippled. They're walking around like this the rest of their lives. So I said, you know, when the x-rays came out, I looked at it and said, oh, it's in place. But what had happened was the tendon here had ripped and bubbled up here. This tendon had ripped and bubbled up here. So that's why I was having so much pain. But the knee was in place. But with all those fragments in that joint. And he said if he didn't clean at least those fragments out, I would never walk. They'd be stabbing the nerves in that joint constantly. And I'd never be able to walk in it. I walked on it in six and a half weeks. I said, I'll tell you what. I'll take your card, and if I, you know, if it gets infected and I start turning angry, I'll come and use your services. Just give me your card. I said, I'm on a good diet. He goes, you know, diet and health, you know, it'd send him crazy. Really, he went like that. So, you know, he gave me his card, and he knew I'd be back. I never went back. I didn't even have a cast put on. Because I didn't want a cast over, you know, those open wounds.

But what my body had done was build its own cast. All of my thighs went down to skin. Skin was hanging on my thighs within about a week. My buttock was, skin was just hanging. I had no butt. And I built a natural cast from here to here. It was like this thick, and you could knock on it, just like it was a regular cast. And then, after six and a half weeks, after the leg healed and I could walk on it again. I mean, I walked on it in the ocean. I went across the street to the ocean. And we'll walk where your body, you know, is only half the weight. And, of course, I got the owner of the hotel to stop putting chlorine in the pool for five days so I could do it in the pool. And then when the algae started growing, she freaked out. So I went across to the ocean. And I walked a mile a day in the ocean and in the pool, you know, once a day. Sometimes twice a day, half a mile each. You know, and it was barely, barely touching it, you know. And by six and a half weeks, I was off crutches and walking normally. Three months, I was on Antigua, and I ran a quarter of a mile in fast sprint. So, you know, the body can heal properly if you just know what to do. Then after six and a half weeks, all of a sudden, the cast started dissolving. My thighs got big again. My ass never got big as it used to be. But, you know, I used to have a big, cute ass. Now it's a cute, medium ass. So the body does phenomenal things. You just have to trust it and, of course, know what to do. Okay. This poor girl, whatever she did, she, you know, she... This girl, Valerie Mysick, she came to me when she was about nine years old and very sick. And she couldn't do much. Had allergies, you know, like, almost like she had asthma. And I put her on... She always had, when she discarded something, it always came out to her skin. So she constantly had dermatological problems, rashes like this all over her body. If she had a bruise in a particular area, that area would have these, have a rash, getting rid of the dead. You know, when you have a bruise, that means that you've ruptured veins or capillaries. And you've bled outside... You've got red blood cells in tissue that's not in the red blood cell in the bloodstream anymore. So what your body has to do is break those down with bacteria, which turns those cells black. And then as it breaks it down completely, it turns them yellow. And then that's where you go black and blue to yellow, or blue to black to yellow. And that's when it comes through the skin.

Well, every time it comes through the skin, it comes out in rashes for her. Now she's a very strong person. But in 2009, she was the number one female tennis champion in high school. And she was a very sick person as a child. It's funny, the same year, Walker Kieran was the number one male tennis champion. And when he came to me at eight years old, he had asthma so bad he could barely breathe. I have a video of him talking before the board of supervisors to get raw milk past him. He says, if I don't have my raw milk, I can't breathe. And then you see a picture of him in, that was 2001 or 2000. And then in 2009, you see him on the front page of the LA Times as the number one tennis champion for 2009. So both of these kids in 2009 were the number one high school tennis champions. And these kids couldn't even breathe as children. So pretty phenomenal. But she still, to this day, she was running. She's in college now. And she was running and hit one of those bulbs on a root. She was running at night and didn't see it. And it crushed the ligament tendons from her ankle to her heel cap. And, you know, it was pretty bad. But what happened? Comes out through the skin in heavy rash. Heavy, heavy rash. You see how she crushed? This is the other side. This is the other side she crushed it on. That's how her body is discarding it. There's where she crushed it. See how bad it is? Now, you know, I didn't quite know what was happening until they sent me the picture. So I asked them to send me pictures. So I thought she had either tore a ligament or a tendon from the heel cap and the ankle. And she was having so much pain, you know, it was throbbing all the time. And I said, then you had to have done worse. I need to see pictures. So I saw this. I could see she crushed. She didn't tear the ligaments or the tendons and or. She actually crushed them, which is worse than a break. A break is a, you know, a break is all you're going to do is mend the bone back together. But she actually crushed the tendons and the ligaments fastening her ankle to her heel cap, you know. And that, I said, that's five times worse, ten times worse. Going to take longer. You may not be able to walk on it for six weeks. I said, but do the diet and you have your better chance. So her father, her mother's heavy on the diet, so was her father. 

But when her father saw this and how her legs swelled in so much pain, that and the mother's sister and mother and father, the grandparents, all were freaking out. Go to a doctor, go to a doctor. So they went to a podiatrist and the podiatrist said, you didn't tear or, you know, tear the ligament or the tendon, you crushed them. That's worse. Exactly what I said. So the mother was vindicated, you know, that I was the right person to go to. But she was walking on in 14 days, only 14 days. Now she's pretty fine because this was only in February. It happened February, I think it was 7th and this is February 9th.

Q: You don't recommend ice, right?

A: Never. Just think about it. You have to have nutrients intensely to that area. You've got dead cells to remove. You've got to dissolve them. You need lots of nutrients to do that. Plus you need to heal. When you put ice on it, what happens? All the swelling goes down because you've constricted the veins and the capillaries, the veins, the network of lymphatic and neurological passages. All that shrinks and you scar. That's why all those athletes put ice on something and then they have to go in and have scar tissue, you know, surgery every year or every six months to scrape the scar tissue out because they keep putting ice on it.

Q: Do they say it's to avoid tissue damage?

A: Pardon?

Q: Do they say to put ice to avoid tissue damage?

A: That's a lie. Just remember I said 99% of what the pharmaceutical and medical industry say. You do the opposite and you're right. So she only put hot water bottles on this. I said you don't put cold on it just to numb the pain for two minutes at the most. Then you put heat on it again because you want to increase the circulation to heal the area quickly. She was walking in three weeks. I mean walking on it in three weeks, not just on the ball of her foot but actually flat in three weeks. So that's pretty amazing. I thought it could be up to six weeks, maybe even ten weeks before. But she's been on the diet a long time since she was nine years old. She's 22 now. I mean she's not 100%-er. When she went to college she went to 50%. This is when it was turned yellow and all the dead cells were passing through. This is the other foot. You see the rash over here, no rash over here. Very little swelling at this point. This was two weeks after. This is a case of impetigo. This is where it started. So she got impetigo. Impetigo is when your body's throwing off some heavy, heavy dental injections and it causes a yellow, crusty serum to come out. So it covered her whole face. I had it one time and it covered this part of my face. But hers, it went all over the whole face. She's one of my Thai partners on the land there. Because I can't let her own land unless I'm married, unless I have a corporation. So she's a partner in the corporation. And you can see all that yellow serum coming out everywhere. Dental anesthesia. See how it's yellowing, seeping out yellow?

Q: You mean from novocaine?

A: Yeah. Xylocaine will do the same. And that was on the shoulder. Happened right away. And this is as that serum came out. That's from a vaccine now. The impetigo also in the face caused a reaction on her arm, detox on her arm. And that was the worst her face got. So you just have to not panic through all these things. You have to trust your body to get through them. This is Fran Wilkinson. Oh, this is a very nice one. See this little girl? See she's holding and drinking on her own? When I saw her at 9 years old, this was her entire behavior. 24 hours a day. She didn't sleep. Well, she slept. She was sleeping like that. She may have been like the dolphins. They sleep and swim in circles while they're sleeping. Very interesting. But now she's holding things. She's drinking, you know, within a year and a half on the diet. Yeah, she's functional.

Q: What does she have?

A: Oh, mercury from vaccines. And her father is a chemist who works in the pharmaceutical industry. So he was really paranoid when she went on the diet. But they've not been to doctors ever since. You know, this happened when she was a year old. So for 9 years she had been under medical supervision. And then another woman, this was on Antigua Island, and the woman that I met who was an invalid and swollen up like this with steroids, unable to function as a wife. And, you know, she had a daughter that was, I don't know, when I met her probably 6 years old, 7 years old, unable to take care of anything. And within a year on the diet she was completely functional and beautiful. You know, so her experience showed a lot of other people on the island, and this was one of them, you know. The father was really paranoid at the interview, you know, when I saw her the first time. But then he saw her getting better every month, a change, a little change. And this was after 2 years, 12 years old or 11 years old, and completely functional, talking, reading, feeding herself, everything.

Q: She's tiny for her age.

A: Oh, you should have seen her when she was 9 years old. She looked 5, really skinny. I mean, her legs were as thick as her arms when I met her. So this diet isn't about me and what I believe. I developed my rationale about how it works from what I've seen, you know. It isn't about what I think will work. It's about what I watch and learn what works and then repeat that and see how often it will occur with other people. And I have quite a few children. I was brought a 9-month-old infant that was swollen all over and crying all the time, day and night. The parents drove from Phoenix, Arizona, you know, like the first time. And she'd been coming now for 3 years. And now the baby is developing, but that one's a very slow one because the mercury and the contamination that she got from her early vaccines completely destroyed the RNA in her body. So she was not developing. She's probably still a year and a half behind in growth development. But now she doesn't have all the swelling. She laughs most of the time. Only has seizures once every 6 months instead of 5 a day. And I kept telling her mother, I said, you cannot freak out when she has a seizure. On this diet, a seizure is just the brain flushing out a large, you know, congestion at the ganglia or axion. And you just have to let her go through that, you know, that seizure. Seizure isn't going to kill her unless you keep taking her to the doctor and putting chemicals in those spots. Then it's going to rupture one of these times and she's going to die very young. And that's usually a progression. So that little baby is now laughing almost all 24 hours a day, the mother says. When she's awake, she's laughing and playing all the time. Even though she's still retarded in her development. She's not crying all the time and swollen and bloated and ultra-sensitive. And anytime they used to feed her anything, she would swell up in the stomach and be constantly cramping and crying. Now she rarely has diarrhea and never vomits. 

So the progression in some people is slower. Because you have to understand, mercury and these other solutions, they can do some serious permanent damage. And you see the scarring on my body from those 3 injections. And I have them all over. I have huge scars. It looks like I've been hit by shrapnel. And I avoided the Vietnam War. But I'm in the medical war. Okay, let's talk about, we talked about what was good for, I'll just leave it open in case I think of something else to show you. We talked about what to put on open wounds. Lime juice. Oh, and what happened with that lime juice, when it was on that asphalt for the next year, I'd have these little warts come out. And I'd pick them off and they'd just come right off at the skin. And inside that would be just a little particle of asphalt, like a little piece of sand. And I was picking those off maybe 3, 5 a week. For a year, a year and a half, about a year and a half. A year and 3 months. A year and 4 months I was picking them off. And that's how the body was able to isolate them and bring them up. No pus, no serious reddening or infection. My body completely grew the skin over that in 12 days. And I talked about in the recipe book, another fellow who had wrecked his truck and flipped over on the Interstate 10 in Los Angeles. And, you know, he flipped over on the right side of the truck. And, of course, we drive on the left. So he flew over to the open window, took all the skin and part of the bone and muscle off of this arm. So he did the same thing. I told him to do that same thing. He did it before I did the motorcycle accident. And I told him to put it on. In 12 days, it was completely healed over. Barely any of those areas were pink. They were just normal skin down. 12 days. He did the same thing. Lime juice, honey, coconut cream, the meat. And keep it moist, leave it on. And he left his up to, you know, 3 days at a time until it really stunk.

Q: Does it stick to the skin?

A: No, it won't stick. For some reason it won't stick. I don't know why.

Q: Do you mix them together or apply them one by one?

A: One by one. I layered them. Lime juice first, honey over that, then coconut cream over that, then meat on top.

Q: Any kind of meat?

A: Well, I've tried chicken and pork and they don't work so well. Beef works excellently, yeah. Yeah, I got some scarring when I used pork. And when I used chicken, it stunk too much, too quickly. And I had to change it more frequently. I mean, if you're going to go out and work and be around people, you know, 2 days probably the most you want to do, maybe 3 days. Just keep your distance, you know, 2-3 feet away from people.

Q: No massages.

A: No massages.

Q: But you apply only a thin layer of that meat?

A: Yes, and it's probably, you're looking at probably an eighth of an inch thick. Cut it a little bit more than that because when you spread it out, it's going to get thinner. You just don't want that meat to dry. That's the problem. When the meat dries, it's going to contract everything. So you put butter on the outside and then a wet cloth over that, you know, like a t-shirt. You know, like an organic white t-shirt or off-white t-shirt or gauze or something that's wet. And then plastic over that and then wrap that with an ace bandage. You don't want that meat to dry because then it won't work. It won't act as skin. Now we're going to go over how to detox these things out of the body. And, you know, when you put hot water bottles on wherever you ache, you're causing a lot of circulation, whether it's neurological blood or lymphatic circulation to the injured area. And any time you have a problem area, just remember that you've got toxins stored in concentration in that area. It can cause abrasions, rashes when it comes out through the skin, if it comes out through the skin. Like I said earlier, if you eat small amounts of cheese, you can draw a lot of that poison to the stomach and intestines. Normally, that's not where toxins should go. They should be going out the skin 90%, maybe 10% out the sinuses and mucous membranes, intestinal tract and the urinary tract. But that's it, only 10%. But I've learned that if you use cheese, you can draw those poisons to the intestines without damage, as long as you have the cheese in there to absorb it. It has to be raw, no-salt cheese. If the cheese is salted, remember, it causes a fractionation and digestion of it. Anything that is dried, dehydrated, is indigestible. Your body has to borrow enzymes from inside the body or get them from somewhere to digest them. Because there's no bioactive enzymes in any dehydrated food. However, if you eat honey with cheese, you will digest it. And it's a wonderful mineral concentration, mineral supplement. And I've helped people, women, who have been in, let's say, 32% bone loss and osteoporosis, reverse that in a year, down to 10%. In just one year.

Medical profession, even with all their lies, never reduces anybody. They claim that there are tests that show they reduce at 1% a year. It's an absolute lie. You know, Fox, Amino Fosamix, whatever it is, that Sally Fields is promoting. It's been proved that even, it's questionable in those tests that even affected her by 1%. But in one year, able to take it from 32% to 10% is marvelous. But only by eating the cheese and the honey together. Because remember, honey, when the bee collects the nectar, the bee swallows it, pre-digests it, makes an insulin-like substance which converts 90% of the carbohydrate into enzymes for digesting fats and proteins. So, honey, as long as it's never heated over 93 degrees, where 93 degrees begins the destruction of that insulin-like substance, as long as it's below 93 degrees, it acts as an enzyme supplement to the cheese. The cheese is dehydrated and concentrated in minerals with a little fat. So, what happens, we digest that fat and the concentrated minerals. The amount of minerals that you have in a tablespoon of cheese is worth a whole quart of milk. And if you can digest it, wow. Now, you can also eat fruit with those minerals, but it'll be more minerals that can be used for detoxification and not necessarily building. And if you want to build your bones quicker, you have it, like, 25 minutes after you finish your meat meal, you have a piece of cheese, either one cube or two cubes. Each little sugar cube size is about a half a teaspoon. So, you have about a teaspoon. Then 10 minutes after that, you have one and a half to three tablespoons of cheese with one and a half to two and a half teaspoons of honey, small amount of honey with a lot of cheese. And that will remineralize the bones fast, remineralize the body fast. You have tooth pain, anything like that, and you only do that two, three times a day. If you're like the woman who had the 32% osteoporosis, 32% of her bones thinned, I had her have it after two meat meals and once in the middle of the night. I had her take two. She was only five foot one. So, I had her take two tablespoons of cheese with one and a half teaspoons of honey, two tablespoons of cheese with one and a half teaspoons of honey after each meat meal in the middle of the night. 

Q: After each what?

A: Pardon?

Q: After each what?

A: After each meat meal.

Q: Oh, you were having a meat meal in the middle of the night?

A: No, she wasn't. I said she had it after each meat meal, and one time she'd have the honey and cheese in the middle of the night, not with a meat meal. So, I suggested that she have the cheese and the honey and then two ounces of milk after that, right after she ate the cheese and honey together. So, she'd sleep well and remineralize in the night. One year, it went down to 10%. That's a 22% increase in bone density in one year. Now, I used to watch, you know, when I used to help, especially women with bone deterioration like that with ulcerative colitis, it used to take, you know, about every year I could increase the bone density by 3%. But when I started having people use the cheese and honey after meat meals and have the cheese and honey several times a day, it all changed fast. So, I'm still learning.

Q: Cow, goat, either way?

A: Doesn't matter with cheese, it does not matter. With milk, if you're thin, you do not want a goats milk. It's not just low fat, it's that the goat has a lot of adrenaline precursors. So, you're going to be more hyperactive, you're going to burn a lot more fat, and you're not going to get ahead. Only people overweight, and I mean a lot overweight, you're not overweight to me. You're perfect size. You're perfect size. You're a little thin. You're very thin. You're a perfect size. You're a perfect size. You're a little thin. So, I like people that have more fat on their body to deal with the poisons and to heal and to get strong faster. So, I like fat. Fat is important. So, what else can we talk about? Oh, detoxification. There are four items that help you detoxify quickly. And that's the cheese, eating the cheese frequently, pulling it out of the stomach wall and intestines. Now, when I've done all the irises and I look at the contamination in the body, I see that most of the contamination that I find is concentrated in the stomach lining. Now, the stomach lining is the most resilient cell in the body. The stomach cell forms hydrochloric acid, actually synthesizes hydrochloric acid that can dissolve bone, but it won't dissolve itself. The second most resilient tissue in the body, cells in the body, are cartilage. But in the stomach, the body will take a lot of your vaccine contamination and store it in the lining. However, what happens is every time you eat something, it dumps a little of that into your food. So, you'll be recycling your poisons as you digest your food, or you're going to have somebody like Jeff Slay, who was eating eight times a day, volumes of food and getting skinnier every day, because the body refused to absorb the poisons in the food. So, the food just passed through him. Not in diarrhea either. The body just refused to absorb any of the nutrients he was consuming. And I mean, he was eating like five times his normal amount of food and still losing weight, and went down to that small skinny rug. So, it all depends upon your body. But if you're eating the wrong no-salt cheese, it's going to absorb those poisons and pass out in the feces.

So, it takes the body's burden from those poisons, how it has to react. You don't want to have as many poisons going through the skin, out the ears, the eyes, the mouth. A lot of the stuff you see here, you may not have to go through if you have that cheese every 15, 20, 30, 45 minutes to an hour. It depends upon what you, you know. If you come to me and I can look at the iris, I definitely know how much you need to eat, and I'll suggest. My construction workers were always exposed to, you know, metal dust and, you know, asbestos and all that stuff in construction. I have them wearing a mask now. Plus, I have them to have a little extra pouch in their work belt, take a two-cup jar, and they have all these little cubes, sugar cube sizes of cheese there. And their watch goes off every 15 minutes. So, I have them doing four of those an hour. And it's pretty easy. It goes off, they go ahead, pop, back to work. So, it doesn't take 5, 10 seconds out of their process every 15 minutes. Nobody's going to complain about that, because they work even better. But, it starts clearing up the contamination. When they use the cheese, I find that the metal detoxification, on its own, without any of the other things I'm going to suggest, removes two times faster the amount of metals in the body. If you're doing the hot baths for 90 minutes, 105 degrees, on top of that, I've seen people remove three to five times more metal in one year than normal. The amount of speed... See, I went off of Dr. Howell and Dr. Pottenger's work with animals that were diseased. It took them five generations to get the optimal health from disease without the tricks that I've learned. And I was watching my progression. It was like for a human to regenerate five times the cells. It takes us seven and a half years to regenerate every cell in the body. So, you're looking at 40 years. Well, my progression was that, but then when I started using cheese and these other things, the process is going faster. Even the elimination of these injections from 2009 is sped up. And now I'm not having as much sores come out of my body, because I'm eating this little amount of cheese to absorb those poisons. So, my body is suffering less.

So, the cheese is an important way to move those poisons out without doing a lot of harm and quickly. Now, a lot of people talk about chelation, chelation of metals in the body. But they have, you know, that D-T-A, and they have all those other chemicals. They are chemicals. They're not food. And when I did feces tests and urine tests with subjects who took those things, it wasn't like the pig tests, but I found that only 24% of that chemical put into the body to draw out those metals, only 24% left the body, maximum, in 72 hours. Now, when they did those tests with pigs, the pigs were discarding 79% in 72, even 48 hours. But we aren't pigs. And I did it with eight different people, and the feces in urine was maximum 24%. That means you not only have those metals in your body from before, now you have this new chemical in there. 75% of it, minimum, is now, 76% of it, is now in your body with other poisons. A natural chelator, and I don't know why they don't have a lot of synths, but they don't. Natural therapists should be thinking, OK, what do we have in food that is similar to what they're creating in these chelation therapy treatments? Now, what I found was, it had the amino acids that were helping bind with these particular toxins were in raw apple cider vinegar. Easy. Cilantro has other properties it doesn't. Anybody can think of anything else?

Q: Parsley?

A: Parsley doesn't have the nutrients to actually draw heavy metals out of the body. Pineapple. Berries. Dark berries, light berries. Now, your light berries have a tendency to draw out iodine, oxidized iron, cadmium, some of the lighter metals, lighter in color. The dark heavy gray and black metals are pulled out with blueberries top, then blackberries second, mulberries third. I mean, boysenberries third, dark mulberries fourth, in that order of effectiveness. Blueberries on top. Blueberries, blackberries, boysenberries, dark mulberries. So, you've got five ways to chelate metals out of the body. Now, the vinegar, when it's taken with the cilantro, will actually draw a lot of loosed metals out of the liver, out of the organs and glands. The berries will help attach to those, so they're not reabsorbed into the blood and neurological system. And they'll pass mainly from the blood back into the intestinal tract.

Q: Is it cilantro juice?

A: Cilantro juice, always juice for vegetables. Remember, we're not herbivores. So, when you eat a salad, you have all this pulp going through that you're not digesting, that takes alkalinizing bacteria and enzymes to digest. We are an acid digestive tract. We are an acid digestive tract. So, what happens is you neutralize our digestive acids for meat and dairy and eggs. And therefore, you'll digest half of what you used to digest. Because the alkalinity is going to neutralize half of the acidity. And vice versa. So, you're not going to digest hardly any of the pulp from vegetation. And you're going to reduce by 50% any digestion of dairy, meat and eggs. However, some people love their salads. Not saying it's a bad thing, but it's the very last thing in the day you should eat. If you have your last meat meal, let's say at 6 o'clock, have your salad at 8 or 9 o'clock. And that's the last thing of the day you eat. And in the middle of the night, of course, have some cheese and some milk or egg or milkshake or something like that. So, you eat something in the night. Remember, don't go five hours without eating. You go five hours without eating, the blood proteins drop to nothing, even get negative. Then your red blood cells become cannibalistic and start eating other red blood cells. So, when people sleep 8 to 10 hours and they wake up not refreshed, still tired, it's because they're anemic. They've eaten 2 to 4 tablespoons of red blood cells. They are anemic. And the spleen is not going to kick that back in for 2 hours. So, you're going to go 2 hours lethargic in the morning unless you go for caffeine, nicotine or theobromine to pump you up artificially. Or cocaine or any one of those. Benzedrine, whatever it is, to give you your high. That's a false high. You've got anemia. Those are not remedies for anemia. Anemia means you need to eat protein, something to feed the red blood cells.

So, always don't sleep more than 5 hours. If you're a very hyperactive, energetic person, don't set the alarm for 5 hours. Set it for 3 hours. Wake and then sleep 5 hours after that so you get your 8 hours in. If you're a highly active, physically active person and you wake up after 5 hours and you eat, you may not be tired. You may have too much energy to go back to sleep. And then you don't want to sleep during the day because you're too active. And then you can get a little tired or exhausted. So, set an alarm for 3 hours. Wake, eat, go back to sleep for 5 hours. And you get your 8 hours. And when you awake, you'll be full of energy. You won't have that lethargy that's why you feel like you haven't slept although you've been in bed 8 to 10 hours. Okay? So, back to the chelation stuff. So, what I like to do, what I've been experimenting with for the last 3 years is having cilantro anywhere from 10 to 15% in your vegetable juice. If you have a lot of methyl in the body, you know, if you look at your irises and you see a lot of black spots and a lot of charcoal gray in there, you've got a lot of mercury in your body. You can have up to 15% cilantro and always have an egg in your vegetable juice because you need something to chelate with those metals, especially mercury when the cilantro is pulling it out. So, you put an egg in there, in your vegetable juice. And you put a teaspoon to a tablespoon of dairy cream to protect the nerves. And it's better not to have all these things at one time. So, the next thing I like to do is have a sport formula to help detoxify the body. Now, the sport formula can be made in different ways. There are five ingredients that can make up the three basic cups in a sport formula. A sport formula I usually make as a quart. Three cups of that is one of, or is two, at least two of these five food substances. Whey, tomato puree, cucumber puree, milk, and watermelon. So, you can take two or all five. You can take a half a cup of each. Then the rest of the ingredients, you want the lime juice in there to surround particles, to keep a lot of destruction from happening. So, you have two to three tablespoons of lime juice in that. Now, that is so antibacterial it's going to prevent proper fermentation of foods. So, you counter that by adding a tablespoon of lemon juice. One to two tablespoons of honey.

 So all those nutrients can be absorbed everywhere in the body. It provides enzymes that may be missing from anywhere in the system. Digestive, blood, neurological fluid, connective tissue. Two to three tablespoons of coconut cream. Two tablespoons of dairy cream. One to two ounces of pineapple puree. And two to three eggs to top it off, to bring it up to a quart. Depends upon your size of eggs. If you have very big eggs, it may only take two. If you have small eggs, it may take three eggs to get it up to the quart. You blend that all together. Blend it for 45 seconds. You can start off on that. Now, the watermelon, the tomato, and the cucumber are purees. You'll slice those objects and put those in there. So, it's going to be very thick if you have those in it. So, you chew your sport formula. Now, those two champions up there, they went on one quart of that for five hours of competition. Their competitors were drinking up to a gallon and a half of water, diluting their systems, getting weaker and weaker. And my two tennis players were not losing a beat, wiping them out. They didn't let either of them play the next year. They were just wiping everybody out. And, I mean, the politics in it, even in high school, is ridiculous. Neither of them were allowed to play. They played, but they were on the bench in competition. Why would you put your best players on the bench? They weren't for politics. Anyway, they were out there with just a quart of that, sipping on it the whole time, not guzzling anything. They sipped on it. Remember, if you guzzle anything, almost 90% of the H2O, whatever you're eating, is going to go to the kidney and out of the body. That means all those nutrients are not going to deliver H2O to the cells. And you've got a good bind between ions and the H2O. So you're supposed to be delivering H2O with your nutrients. When you have pure H2O, just water, it dilutes, dries out the whole body. The cell cannot absorb water that is not ionically bound to other nutrients, to fats, to proteins, to carbohydrates. A cell cannot absorb water like that. If it does, it will completely dry it out, and it will malfunction. So all this water that everybody is drinking is senseless. 

Q: Now, this is the sport formula that you'll go in a competition. How long do you have to take it before you go in?

A: I'd say start with a cup and then drink three cups through the match. It depends on how many hours you're going to be playing. You know, you can do it through a cup an hour. Yes?

Q: With the first five ingredients, it makes up approximately three cups, you said?

A: Yes, at least two of those substances make up three cups. So that's going to hydrate your body, hydrate your cells. It's going to give you lots of energy and nutrients, a lot of electrolytes. Now, those sport drinks like Gatorade, that's all chemical electricity. That's not healthful electricity. So it's short-lived. So you'll be sucking on that Gatorade all day long, and you'll never get anything sustainable out of it. But when you have my sport formula, you don't have all that issue as long as you're not gulping it. And if you've got lots of pulp, you chew it too. Take a mouthful, chew it, or half a mouthful, chew it, chew it, chew it, down it. Remember, the more bacteria you get into your food, especially with egg and cream in there, you're going to digest more of it. Also, let's see, if you're an athlete, I suggest one cup be whey, because whey has a lot of lactic acid in it, natural lactic acid. And it helps remove lactic acid as a byproduct of muscle metabolism. So it helps remove the waste lactic acid in your muscles, the lactic acid in the whey. Choose a cup of that. Use a cup of tomato puree to lower your temperature level if you're doing something in the sun or a high-sport thing where you're feeling feverish. That'll bring the body heat down a little bit.

Q: You have to make your puree.

A: Pardon?

Q: You have to make your puree with the Vitamix.

A: Yes. No, not with the Vitamix. I don't suggest anybody use the Vitamix.

Q: Oh, how do you make the puree?

A: You put it in a blender. Vitamix is too fast. It'll heat and damage the nutrients. It'll heat up so fast, you won't believe it. If you had that on for 10 seconds, you're going to heat that food up and destroy a lot of your nutrients. You're going to oxidize that food, too.

Q: Because of too much of the space in between?

A: All the air is going down right through everything you're putting through there, so it oxidizes about a third of your nutrients that are in it. When I blend, I put my whole ingredients, like my sport formula, in a quart jar. I put it in one of these. I use an osterizer blender where the cap screws right on to one of these normal, regular-sized jar lids. I get a different washer that comes with the osterizer. When I go to a hardware store, I'll ask for a Cuisinart blender washer, which is larger and thicker. 

Q: They sell it on Amazon, too.

A: Pardon?

Q: They sell it on Amazon?

A: Yeah. They might, yeah.

Q: No, I'm saying that's what I got.

A: And it's larger and thicker, so it won't get caught in the blades. The one that comes with it gets caught in the blades too often, and you have a mess going all over the place. One time it broke a jar. Only one time have I ever heard of anybody breaking a jar by blending in the glass. That's because he put it on high quickly, and the rubber got wrapped in the blade. Somehow, I think the jar must have been chipped at the lid or something for that to happen. He cut his hand pretty badly. He's a Malcolm Gold guitar player, so, you know, can't beat that. So he had a little trouble for a couple of weeks playing his guitar. But what you do is blend that, and you have all the oxygen, because you filled it up this high to the top. And when it's blending, it's going to swell a little bit, so no oxygen. So any of the blender bases that you're using, including the Vitamix, all that oxygen is going through your food and damaging your nutrients, oxidizing your nutrients. Not a good thing. So Vitamix oxidizes your food and heats them quickly. Cooks them too fast. Good, powerful things, but nothing that we eat that would be pulverized in there is suitable for us. And most people will blend vegetables into a liquid in those, completely destroyed, and you don't want all that cellulose in it, even though it's at a fragment size. You still have to break it down further, and we do not digest cellulose properly. We only digest 2-3% of it, even if it's in liquid form like that. That liquid you can, but all those alkaline food particles going through neutralizes the acidity of the intestines and stomach. Prevents you from digesting properly. Okay, so then when you have your fruit meal, you can compound that by having your blueberries, your blackberries, your boysenberries, raspberries, strawberries, a combination of them. If you have very little rust color in your eyes, and mostly they're dark with black and gray, you want the dark berries. If you've got a predominance of rusty color and orange color in the eye, then you want more of the light berries, the raspberries and strawberries, to help remove those particular metals. And when you have those, for your size you'd have a cup of berries, a cup and a quarter. Same with you. 

With you, put on a little bit more weight, you could have a cup and a half. Your size, a cup. Your size, a cup. Beverly, a cup. A cup for you. Maybe three quarters of a cup for you only. And you need about a cup and a half to build up. With those berries, you need three to four tablespoons of coconut cream. Coconut cream is the best detoxifier of all the fats. To protect the nerves, when you're drawing out those metals and attaching to them, from sipping that sport drink all day long, and having that particular fruit meal, you want the raw cream in it. So you've got to have two, three tablespoons of raw cream with the raw coconut cream. Now, to spice that up, to make a chelation therapy, you can put a quarter of a teaspoon of vinegar in it. Raw apple cider vinegar. One to two tablespoons of lime juice.

Q: With the berries?

A: Yes, with the berries. You can double your way of chelating these things out of the body. Now, what I did was I spent a year and a half working on just the berry formula and the sport formula. See how that did. Then I took a certain amount of people and I gave them the berry formula with the juices in it, the lime juice, the vinegar, and a little bit of lemon juice in there, with the coconut cream and dairy cream, to see how that did. Nobody had an overreaction, as long as they did all of those. They had a sport formula, as well as having the lime juice, the vinegar, and the lemon juice with their fruit meal. Nobody got too over-contaminated and detoxed so fast that they had a reaction from it. Of course, like I said, I had one guy that cleaned five times the amount than what we normally clean of metal in one year. He hardly had any symptoms that year. He had six weeks of a hard time in that year, but usually somebody has six weeks of a hard time if they have a lot of metal anyway. This is somebody who grew up on a farm with lots of pesticides and herbicides. His eyes were black with contamination. He took out what normally would take somebody five years, he did in one year, with only six weeks of a rough time where he was really fatigued and fibromyalgia, but that was only six weeks. He's the only one out of all the people, probably 30 people altogether, that I followed their progress through it. I tell everybody else, if you have a problem, make sure you document that problem and send it to me so I can see if I can catch it, and how to avoid it for that particular individual, that particular detoxification, or the symptoms of that detoxification. I've been able to detox heavily with less symptoms. That's what I'm aiming for. That's the way you can incorporate all of that stuff into a diet to get cleaner faster, to get healthier faster. So you don't have to wait 40 years on a perfect diet.

Q: I don't have 40 more years.

A: You might. You do this diet, you just might. I had a man who was 97 years old and two days away from death. He is now 102. His family can't believe it, because he went from one week of being completely bedridden to a week later being healthier than his 20-year-old grandchildren, running them around the house and yard and all over. He just needed the right nutrients. Of course, he was growing at a time where there was nothing but raw milk, and nothing but good, unadulterated, no chemicalized food, unless he got it from... Some of those dairy people used to put formaldehyde in milk. Benjamin Franklin rallied against that and stopped it, but then when he died, they started doing it again. Some would put arsenic in milk to make it last longer, give it a shelf life. People do crazy things for profit. It's better just to sell soured milk. Soured milk is better than fresh milk because it's pre-digested. The bacteria in it is already shit and urinated and perspired, and it's already nutrients to absorb. It doesn't take anything in the stomach or intestinal tract to absorb. Eggs are the easiest food to absorb and digest. It doesn't take any hydrochloric acid and takes very little bile, because eggs are the only thing where we have a cholesterol. Raw meats, there's no cholesterol. There's no cholesterol in butter or cream or dairy. We make cholesterol. The only place we get cholesterol is in eggs, and it's very little, and we convert that into a different cholesterol for us. But the egg is the most digestible food in the world. It has every nutrient on the planet, and it's the only food that has every nutrient on the planet. It digests in 27 minutes. Milk takes 6 to 10 hours to completely digest. Meat takes 19 to 24. So if you're in a weak period, you eat eggs, lots of eggs. Like in the recipe book, I talk about the woman who had emphysema. Her M.D. called me on a Thursday night. It must have been 12.30, 1 o'clock her time. And she said, I have an emphysema patient. She was diagnosed 7 years ago. She's been on machines and bedridden for the past 2 years. She's going to die this weekend. What should I do?

So you're calling me a little late, aren't you? She says, I'm an M.D., and we have to have our patients on the prescribed medical approach for 10 years. If it doesn't work after 10 years, we can suggest an alternative. Or if they're on their deathbed, we can suggest an alternative if the other hasn't worked for over a year. So she said, I can now do it. I said, well, that's your conscience. I said, but the only thing I can suggest that you do is get 10 to 15 dozen eggs, put them on her bed table and tell her to eat as many as she can, and there's no limit. So this is on Thursday night, so it's Friday morning her time, so who knows when she got the eggs to the patient. So on Monday morning, I got a call, a raspy voice woman saying, it worked, I'm out of bed, what else should I do? And I said, who are you? What did you do? And she said, well, my M.D. called you, she told me that you told her, told me that I could eat as many eggs as possible. And I said, well, how many did you eat? She said, well, I started on Saturday, because they were giving me Saturday morning. So I ate 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday, and this morning I was out of bed and off the machine. 66 eggs. You can take a life and turn it around in two days with emphysema. 

Q: These are raw eggs, right?

A: Yeah, of course. I don't talk about cooked foods here. No nutrient value in it. I mean, once in a while, I've got a patient who's heavily contaminated in Mexico City. I have him eat a little bit of cooked starch, you know, with his raw cheese and raw butter, but no honey with it. He wants to eat honey with it, and that helps pull out the poisons. He's an opera singer, so, and I mean, he, since he's been on the diet, he's gotten up to Pavarotti's level in six weeks, before he was very subdued, you know, and hitting ranges in the medium, and now he's hitting the top. I just talked to him yesterday, and he says, it's incredible what I can do. And he said, thanks for the cooked starch thing, because that keeps me from being nauseous all the time, because the cheese wasn't doing it enough for him. So I have him just eat a little bit of cooked starch with the cheese and butter to handle that. So it depends upon the individual. So eggs are your best foods to digest. That's why I say when you're going through a cold or a flu, load up on milkshakes with eggs in it. Lots of eggs. Things that are easy to digest. Cut down on your meats unless it's fish, you know, when you're going through heavy detoxification. Lots of eggs. These guys know how to do it. Now I suggest they do it a little differently. I suggest you suck the egg white out, mix it until it's no longer slimy, and swallow that, and then the egg yolk following that. What happens is, when the egg white gets in there, it's 90% protein. Some say it's 99% protein, but you've got a mineral concentration that's about 10%. So you've got all that protein there that goes right to the liver, and the liver makes a proper bile to digest the egg yolk, which is every vitamin on the planet. It's the only food that has every vitamin, all the B vitamin, all the A vitamin spectrum, all of the H spectrum, every vitamin. A little low on the K, but you can get that from some cabbage juice. So eggs contain every nutrient on the planet. If you eat it that way, you'll be digesting it in 16, 27 minutes. If you suck the egg white and egg yolk together, it's going to take 45 minutes to an hour to digest. Some people will get stomach cramps when they have them together.

Q: Do you have to do it white first?

A: Yeah. What I do is, when I make a hole in it, I'll hold it down like this, and I'll suck out the egg white slowly, mix that in saliva, and swallow it. Then when I get to the egg yolk, the egg yolk will bob as I'm sucking it, and I'll turn upside down, suck the egg yolk out, and then mix that around in the saliva, and then swallow that. And that works quicker. Sleep less, you have more energy. Anything that allows the body not to work hard will give you more energy for other things. I've worked 42 years at perfecting all this, and I'm still perfecting it. I can help you make your detoxifications, reduce the symptoms of detoxification, whether it's physical, emotional, mental, whatever it is. That's my goal, to reduce as much as possible. Yes, let's get into Q&A now.

Q: Okay. So this position here is what allows the white to come up first?

A: Right, because the white's very light. The yolk is one bubble in there, and it's very heavy. Now, sometimes the yolk is fastened to the white. So I'll just shake it a little bit, and free it up, and then suck the egg white out some more. Because I can feel it's really dense, and I haven't had much egg white, and it's not coming up, and the egg yolk's coming up to the hole.

Q: Right.

A: Then I know that the egg white is stuck to the egg yolk. So a little shaking like this frees it.

Q: Okay.

A: And did you ever see my eat a raw egg before, like that? Well, I'm ready to have one.

Q: I've seen Will do it all the time, too. And I just go, eww.

A: So I'm going to show you one egg. Does anybody want one? I have some on the plane just in case it breaks in my bag. I've had them go all over the place.

Q: What about security? I had trouble once taking them on a plane. They made me leave them with my husband.

A: Well, one time I tried to get security through my eggs, and I'm not a racist, of course, but for some reason the black people are more germ-phobic than others. So this particular, in the United Airlines, every one of the TSA inspectors this evening were all African-Americans. So I have a whole dozen eggs that are, you know, I have them. I have a letter from an M.D. that says my eggs, all of my food, and they're all named. What I have to carry with me have to be hand-checked, not run through the X-ray. So they saw the raw eggs, and they fucking freaked out, you know, salmonella poisoning and everything. Get those out of here. I said, wait a minute, if I can't take these on the plane with me, I'm going to eat them right here. They called the police department. The police department came, and I'm there eating the eggs, and they said, you can't do that here. I said, I'm not going to wait in line again for an hour to get through the security because I'll miss my plane. And if you arrest me, what do you think that a jury is going to do? Do you think they're going to convict me for eating a raw egg? Who's going to look silly, and who's going to pay a fortune for arresting me, kidnapping me, basically, because I ate raw eggs? The policeman walked away, and everybody, I mean, these TSA agents, backing away, and nobody would get near me until I finished the eggs. Until I finished the eggs. It was insane. Anyway, what you do is, there's a fat end and a thinner end. Now, this end, you don't want a hole in it. You just want to fracture the integrity of the shell because your egg is in a sac inside, a membrane. You want that membrane to move. It's attached here and attached here very solidly. So if you break its connection to the bottom of that, it's going to go up and down as you suck out the egg white and even the egg yolk. So when you get to the bottom, it's going to completely collapse in there. You get all the egg out. You don't do that. You're going to leave some egg yolk and egg white inside. So you hit it on the flat part of an eye tooth without going down. You do the side. Now, I poked a hole in it for some reason, so I will damage this side. This egg shell is very thin, so it poked a hole in both ends. That happens one out of 20 for me, or even less than that. So right now, I'm having to put my finger here because it's going to drain out the bottom. But I'm still going to try to suck the egg white out without getting the yolk. Not working because I got a hole in both sides. So you notice I'm putting it to the side, getting the egg white out.

Q: It doesn't hurt to put it in a cup, does it? I put mine in a cup, so I want to see what's in the egg. And then I suck the white.

A: That's fine. It just oxidizes more.

Q: I want to know, because there might be something in that egg.

A: If it's black, even better. It's a high egg. 

Q: Chinese eat century eggs, and they are old eggs.

Q: Someone told me that you have to insist they are unwashed when you buy them. Is that true?

A: It's better. I went through TSA yesterday, no, the day before yesterday. And I had manure, because I had just gotten them from an Amish farmer in Pennsylvania. So I had manure on them, and she was rubbing them to put them in. I was wondering if the nitrogen was going to set it off as nitroglycerin, but it didn't. Luckily, I've had that happen. Most often it happens with honey. So if you're taking honey on a plane with you, and they'll check it, a lot of nitrogen is in honey. So it will come off as nitroglycerin. So you make sure your honey jar is clean on the outside and along the rim and the cap. Because I've had honey set off TSA nitrogen at least 20 times in 10 years. 

Q: Are you going to put it in a handbag or a check bag?

A: A handbag. If you put it in a check bag, you've got 100 times the amount of radiation that's in an x-ray goes through your luggage. If it's your hand carry-on and you put it through that radiation, it's worth about an x-ray and a half. But I have a letter that says my food cannot be passed through radiation. You need to hand inspect it. So I write that kind of letter for my patients, and they use it. Yes.

Q: Okay. So don't get angry at this question, but what about the supplements like fermented cod liver oil?

A: That's not a supplement. That's a food.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: It's like butter from milk. You're just fermenting the meat of the fish to separate the oil, I mean the fat. Remember, cod liver oil is not oil. It's fat. You can only get oil from seeds and vegetables. In coconuts, you have 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrates. Of that 80% fat, 93% of that fat is water-soluble fat. Only 7% is oil, like an oil, but it's really fat. But that oil will block respiration of your skin. If you put oil on your skin, even if it's coconut oil, your skin is not going to breathe for many hours. So the fat in cod liver should be cod liver fat, not cod liver oil, because that's what it is, cod liver fat, not cod liver oil. Your cream is 80% to 85% water-soluble fat. That's why when you take your cream and you break it down into butter, all of a sudden you've got a butter that's maybe a thick butter that chills and hardens at a particular temperature. It's now about 50% water-soluble fat and 50% an oil-type fat. Cream is 80% to 85% water-soluble fat, with only 15% to 20% an oil-like soluble fat.

Q: Can you eat the butter when it gets all moldy?

A: It's pre-digested. That's what Roquefort cheese is. Roquefort dressing is made with mold. It's wonderful. I purposely mold mine because I love Roquefort dressing for my meats. I love stroganoff. Part of what I make stroganoff with is my moldy butter. So I'll take butter and I'll put it in a glass jar and I'll take a knife and spread it around so I've got a spiral of air going through it. And then within three months, I have blue cheese butter. 

Q: Do you leave it outside?

A: If you leave it outside, it doesn't mold.

Q: In the refrigerator?

A: Yeah. Mold's like coal. That's why they put cheeses in caves and butter in caves to get a mold. It's cold and damp in there. That's great for mold. You leave it out, room temperature, and you're not going to get maybe a white fungus on it, white mold. Now it's the same as a Roquefort. Now it won't be strong. That's going to be helpful.

Q: Looking for a green or blue color mold.

A: Yeah. Green, blue, or black.

Q: Wine cooler? 

A: Pardon?

Q: In a wine cooler.

A: Why? The butter?

Q: Because a regular refrigerator keeps it so cold and hard. Are these mine in a wine cooler?

A: That's great, yeah. I travel with my butter sometimes. It goes without refrigeration. I'm driving from plane to plane and hotel to hotel. Sometimes I'll go five days and my butter stays in temperatures from 80 to 90 degrees. Of course, on a plane it gets down to about 65, because they make planes cold. So for a few hours or an hour it may get cold, but I keep lots of stuff around it in the bag. I've got a towel to wrap it around, so I try to keep it warm. But I've gone up to two weeks without refrigerating butter. I don't like to keep it in plastic when I do that. I like it in glass.

Q: In your travel, do you use two-ounce little jars?

A: No, I use two-cup jars for my butter.

Q: Did you travel with big containers of honey and butter?

A: Yeah, I travel with a two-cup jar, a glass two-cup jar of meat. I only travel with maybe eight ounces of honey, because I can always get honey wherever I go. At my different houses I have huge supplies of honey. In L.A. I have six gallons of honey for backup.

Q: That's a lot of bee poop.

A: Pardon?

Q: That's a lot of bee poop.

A: Yeah? Bee vomit.

Q: Oh, bee vomit, no.

A: When the bee gets back to the hive, it vomits. That's honey. It goes from nectar to digestion to vomit, and the vomit's honey. Bee vomit, is that good?

Q: I'm not sure which is more palatable sounding.

A: Poop or vomit.

Q: Yeah, exactly.

A: Okay, any more questions?

Q: Oh, a few, yeah. What about Dr. Ron's freeze-dried supplements, his organ supplements and stuff like that? 

A: As I said in my book, it will stimulate some hormonal activity eating those freeze-dried glands. However, when I did my tests with animals, and I gave them frozen meat and frozen butter, as opposed to raw, fresh products, when I gave, I took equal amounts of cats and dogs, put them in two groups. I fed one, I had one side of beef, and I gave them the same cuts each day. They got the same cuts, but half of it, a quarter of it was frozen, the other quarter was unfrozen. And I cut the same parts out of each side, or of each quarter, gave that to those two groups. The animals that ate it frozen all developed skin disorders in six weeks. One developed scabies, so it was pretty bad, itching, drinking a lot of water. The group that got it raw, unfrozen, barely licked water, very calm, no skin disorders, nothing. They were fine. So then I knew that butter could correct any skin disorder, eat and consume. Because dogs and cats don't perspire except out their mucous membranes. They perspire out their eyes, their noses, their mouths, their tongues, their ears, and their anuses and urethra. The only place they perspire. So, I gave them the butter, I gave them frozen butter, I split that sick group up into two. And the one that was the sickest, I put in the group that got the unfrozen butter. And all of the ones that got the unfrozen butter healed five times faster than those that got the frozen butter. If I worked that out five times, that's 80% destruction of the butter.

Q: The meat can't be frozen either.

A: That's what I'm saying. Meat will cause a disease. Frozen meat causes disease. Frozen butter doesn't cause disease, but it restricts healing by five times. Any kind of frozen product, you're going to have problems with it. It won't be as contaminating as eating cooked. In fact, maybe cooked in dogs and cats would be less harmful than frozen meats. Something that happens when meat is frozen. That doesn't, that isn't fish, that's for beef. Okay, anybody else have questions?

Q: I've got two more.

A: You're the question boy, just keep it, nobody else is coming up with it.

Q: Cavities, you know, I heard you mention before about getting the plastic sealant. Would you ever leave a cavity open like you would a wound?

A: Yeah, I do now.

Q: Okay. 

A: Yeah, I leave mine open. I've had about six fissures gone from these teeth, and you see none of them are black.

Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: Most people's will turn black. I got to the point where my fissures were growing outward. My body was pushing it outwards as new tooth was growing under. So then that fissure would pop out. And then I go to the dentist and he'd drill down and put it right back where it was before. So I said, you cannot drill the tooth anymore. You just scrape some of the epoxy off from the last time, and you go over to the same place. So I can keep adding tooth. So that's what I've been doing for five years. And it is slowly. But this tooth right here was two-thirds capped. And it's one-fourth filled back in. But it took me 28 years to get to that point where my body started filling in tooth again without decaying. It's exposed to acids and everything. But they're the natural acids, there's not a lot of contamination. I did have some problem after the injections for a while. But that is toned again. My teeth seem to be recovering better again. 

Q: What do you recommend for people with root...

A: Oh, and notice I suck. I don't gulp anything. I suck it over my tongue and through my teeth. I get as much saliva in it as I can. So I just sip probably a tablespoon and a half, two tablespoons maximum just then. If I gulp, I used to drink up to a gallon and a half of milk a day when I gulped. Then when I started sucking, I go through two and a half quarts only a day. Again, what happens is I found that I was peeing all the time. Stuff would rush through the kidneys. So I started looking at other people, counting how much they urinated with gulping or sipping. Huge difference, like night and day. Like when I sip, like I'll sip this and take my time, suck it through. I also have a glass straw. It has a very small hole in it, so I have to really suck stuff through it.

Q: You said a glass straw?

A: Glass straw, yeah, like they use in chemistry laboratories. So they have different hole sizes. The really small ones, it's almost impossible to get anything out of it. So you have to get one with a little bit of larger hole inside. So I'll use those to suck through. But when I urinate, I'm only passing, like if I drink a gallon of milk, I'll only pass one and a quarter quarts. When I gulp, I'm passing, let's say if I drink a gallon, I'll pass three quarts of urine. That means I'm not absorbing all that water. I'm passing out to the kidney and going out. So I want to utilize my nutrients. It's freaking expensive. This diet's expensive. 

Q: I have a question. From what I understand is our body absorbs the B vitamins, especially I guess B12, through our intestines. Is that correct?

A: It also manufactures B12 if you're eating raw meats. And you're recycling B12. That's why the Hindus in India will drink their urine, because they recycle their B vitamins in their urine. And a lot of their proteins, because they don't get enough protein. If I go on an all-milk diet, let's say I went six days, just milk, no meat. I started to get very lethargic, listless, not interested in doing anything. As soon as I had a meat meal, right back. So they have that same problem, so they will drink their urine frequently to recycle their proteins and B12. So you're pissing out a lot. You're not utilizing those nutrients. So I found sipping reduces urination. And the urine should never be clear. It should be dark yellow to orange to brown.

Q: If it's clear?

A: If it's clear, you're in trouble. You're diluting everything in your body. That's a fallacy. Your urine should never be clear. No animal in nature has clear urine. It's anywhere from dark yellow to dark brown. And you'll hear the opposite from mainstream. Your urine should be clear.

Q: If it's yellow, you're peeing out your vitamins that you're taking.

Q: I had a urinalysis recently. They made me retake it because they said it looks kind of dark. Mine used to be really clear before the diet.

A: That's what I say. 99% of what the medical profession says is really the opposite. If you're out there diluting everything, pissing out everything, diluting and thinning it out, that shows you you don't have anything in your body. And all they'll do is check that little bit of clear urine. If you collect all of that urine that's clear, how much are you going to be pissing out? The nutrients that are in your blood are the same nutrients in the urine, except for the red and white blood cells. And the way that happens is the blood enters the kidney, but the ammonia that the kidney manufactures detracts, repels red and white blood cells from entering the kidney because we're trying to reduce the amount of fluid in the blood to regulate body temperature. That's what the kidneys do. If you're pissing out your red and white blood cells all the time, you're going to be anemic. So the kidney is a filter. The bladder is where you store enough urine until it's time to pee, or else you'll be peeing all over yourself all day long. Blackberry seed.

Q: Those are refreshing.

A: It got stuck in the gum there from yesterday.

Q: If you're not treating any sickness or you're just doing the maintenance of this raw food diet, how much of the milk and the honey and cheese...

A: It all depends upon your body. It's an individual thing. I have people that are doing 50% of the diet, and I look at their eyes every year, and they make progress. Very slow, minimal of what somebody who does it 100%. There's a minimal, but they're not getting sicker, most of them. Some of them have spots where they have troublesome spots. But still, if they do a 50%, they're getting better. They're not wasting away or getting more toward disease quicker. It's slowing the process.

Q: It depends on the individual, how they're going to take it.

A: How they eat, how they digest, depends upon the individual. That's why when I see somebody, I can tell how much they're digesting, what they're likely to digest, and what I recommend that they eat, and what they use as their primary...

Q: When you do the iridology.

A: So, I mean it. And if they come back a year later and they haven't done what I've said, or what I've said isn't working as well as I want it to, I can adjust it to help them. But everybody who does the diet, there are changes. I can just show you one to show you the greatest change that ever happened. This woman was a neighbor, and she became my girlfriend. So, she asked me to dictate what she ate, how much she ate, all day long. And so, it's the only one I've ever been able to do that with. And she liked it. So, that was a good thing. Are you going to turn on again, or do I have to turn you on? I think it shut itself off. Yep. See this eye? This is how dark it was when she came to me in 1998. This was already a year and three months on the diet. Now, her mother has blue eyes, her father has green. Two sisters, one blue and one green. She was born with black eyes. Now, when she came to me, when she moved next door to me, she had cancer of the hip bone, cancer of the right breast, and cancer of the kidney and adrenal gland, all on the right side. So, you can see the kidney cancer here, and you can't see the rest of the hip bone. And the kidneys over here on the other eye. You can see the movement toward cancer here. And you can barely see a little blue coming through here, but it's very little. But I could tell her eyes were supposed to be blue. So, that was when she first came to me. And this was eight years on the diet. She will have blue eyes eventually. Now, my eyes were this color 42 years ago. Now they're very clear blue. But where she had these mercury spots is where she had cancer. These are mercury spots from vaccines. I've had people who haven't been in their brains any spot. Anytime you see a spot like this, it's from a vaccine. So, I can tell by looking at that. She has all light blue fibers with dark blue in between all the way around. But you can only see spots of the blue coming through the light blue. But that's eventually what her eyes will be like if she continues on the diet 100%. Now, when she came to me with those black eyes, she was only able to work six hours a week. She had chronic fatigue, which happened at 14 years old.

Now, the reason she had black eyes was in 1969 when she was born, her mother was in college. Didn't know she was pregnant, kept having periods for the first five months. Drinking, smoking, doing lots of wild things, you know, and partying to the hilt. Damaged the placenta. She didn't start having periods until the fifth month. So, it completely distorted the placenta, which is the baby's liver, until it's born. Then the liver takes over. So, the placenta was so contaminated that it wasn't able to filter out all the mother's toxicity. So, all that went into that poor baby. So, she went chronically fatigued with fibromyalgia at 14 years old. I didn't meet her until she was 28. Only able to work six hours a week. She now sails boats for a living. You know, from Lake City, Minnesota, all the way down to Mississippi, all the way down to the Bahamas and, you know, all the islands, even to South America. You know, that's the kind of energy she had. We broke up because she has too much energy. Literally. She wanted me to go skiing, surfing. Now, I have no activity rings. Sex is the only exercise I'm interested in because it's the only one I enjoy. You know, and she wanted to do all this physical stuff. So, she wasn't happy being with me because I'm just happy having sex on my computer and that's it. And we used to have sex five, six hours a day, but she's too active now. You know, just couldn't do it anymore. She was too unhappy. So, we broke up because she was too unhappy. It just wasn't right for being with me when I'm not... See all of her activity lines here. She only has six and athletes have, you know, seven to 14. But when you're on this diet, a few activity rings can give you a powerful lot of energy. More than so on people who don't have a lot of activity. More than people who have activity lines and are not on this diet.

Q: Is there an inverse relationship between mental activity rings or physical activity rings?

A: No, you see she has two up here, two activity rings. Hillary Clinton has three, Bill Clinton has four. He's also got 181 IQ. When I first met him, it was at a Republican dinner for him. And I happened to be invited by, at the time, I was an artist doing very rich people's homes. Doing murals, motif, trompe l'oeil and stuff like that. And I used to make 100, 200 an hour doing that. More than I make as a nutritionist, a lot more. As an actor, I was making 13 grand for two hours work. So this is a great defamation for me, for being a nutritionist. But there's more gratification out of this. So anyway, I went to that dinner for Bill Clinton. And he went around meeting all these people there. And Kathy that I was with, he looked at her, he knew her name. Now he had no buzz in his ear. He knew her name, he knew her sisters, he knew basically her background. He's got that kind of memory. He meets you one time, he remembers everything. 181 IQ. Tremendous. Now I've met a lot of people with very high IQs. A lot of people in Mensa. I've met a few people on the diet who've been in Mensa. 134, 150 IQ. But Bill Clinton was the top. He went around, everybody in that room that he'd only met once before knew everybody's name and their families. And remembered every one of them. Could talk about them. The people he was meeting were lucky to remember his name. Very, very bright. He has four activity rings in his brain. She has two. She's one of these people who likes to know everything anyway. You know, likes to know everything. Most people have one activity ring in their brain. So they're inquisitive a little bit. Anybody that's got over two is anal retentive. And I'm anal retentive. So, you know, I've got three. So, you know, I want to know as much as possible. Okay, any more questions? You keep coming if you have them.

Q: You know, you said you looked at me and you knew right away I'm very thin. And I've got a consult with you anyway. So this might be for then. But do you, for somebody who needs to gain weight, do you concentrate at all on the extra detoxing things with the cilantro and all that? 

A: It depends on how toxic you are. If you are so toxic that we want to remove that stuff for you, start putting on cells. 

Q: Right.

A: Because you don't want to put on, divide a lot of contaminated cells. But I can put a lot of fat on you. Normally, if I'm going to body build somebody, I have one fellow who was 61 years old, went on a diet when he was 58 years old. And, no, he went on it, yeah, 58 years old. And he was on it for about two years. And he said, hey, can I body build in this diet? And I said, sure. Just eat, you know, he's 6'1", about 6'1". And he's always been very skinny from top to bottom. Always wanted to body build. And every time you start body building, you get sick. So, but he'd been on the diet for two years. And I said, certainly. But you need, you know, a year and a half. So I said, what you need to do is you need to eat a pound of meat twice daily. And a whole lubrication, moisturizing lubrication formula with each meat meal. And then you exercise and you build up. In six months, he put four inches on his arms and six and a half inches on his chest. He exercised for a little over one year. He hasn't exercised now in six years. And he retains all of it.

Q: Wow.

A: All of the muscle. And it's solid on him. Something for somebody who was thin before.

Q: Yeah. Wow.

A: His whole life. And he wanted to be big. Now he's this big, strong ox.

Q: That'd be my dream.

A: He doesn't have to work at it. But I've had many people do that. Only one man he gained 28 pounds. And that was the least anybody's ever gained. But that for him, I mean, he was half your weight. Very thin. But he would, you know, surf eight, nine hours a day without eating. You know, so even on the diet, I could only put 28 pounds on him. You know, with the diet. Because he just gets out there and surfs until he's burned up everything. Can't get ahead doing that except at 28 pounds. You've got to be willing to stop what you're doing and eat if you want to gain more or less.

Q: Sure. Sure.

Q: But I eat enormous amounts andI don't gain.

A: That means you're just not absorbing your food.

Q: It's just going through.

A: Yeah.

Q: That's what I'm doing now. Yeah.

A: But I told you why. You're having a salad with your meat meal.

Q: Well, yeah, I do. But even what I eat, no matter how I eat, I don't seem to gain.

A: You will gain weight if you stop eating your salad with your meat meal.

Q: Okay. Makes sense.

A: Yes.

Q: Have you had any progress? I remember from ‑‑ I've only read the book twice. And I remember we talked about epilepsy a little bit. But have you had success with epileptics? I gave your book to a friend of my family and, you know, trying to turn her on to ‑‑ 

A: I've had probably 13 epileptics. Only one of them has seizure once every two years. And it's a petite, you know, seizure. So it's nothing. And that child is basically that infant I told you about who is having five to ten, five to seven, five to eight epileptic seizures daily is now once every six months.

Q: Wow. That's great.

A: Big difference.

Q: I have one. One more.

A: Okay.

Q: When making my whey, I get pink mold in it.

A: No way.

Q: Yeah. I'm sure it could be many factors. I don't know. But have you ever had pink mold?

A: Yeah, absolutely.

Q: Okay.

A: You have pink mold in coconut cream. Helps ferment it, break that certain water-soluble fats. Pink mold breaks down water-soluble fats. And remember, a lot of your water-soluble fats are in the whey.

Q: Okay. And so it doesn't matter.

A: It's better.

Q: Okay. All right.

A: It means you predigested them.

Q: Perfect.

A: You got to do better.

Q: Well, I was throwing it away.

A: At least give it to your plants.

Q: Oh, I was doing that. I was diluting it like you said.

A: Well, you don't dilute it when you give whey to plants.

Q: Oh, no? Oh, okay.

A: You dilute urine when you're going to give it to plants.

Q: Interesting. Okay.

A: And you don't give indoor plants urine. It's too strong.

Q: Huh. I have to sign up for your newsletter. Too much information.

A: I just planted in my farm in Thailand. I had about 20 acres of rice paddy. So I'm gradually shifting them over. I took one area. I turned it into a pasture. That's about 3 acres for my cows. And I just had a baby cow.

Q: Aww.

A: January 11th, he was born. She was born. I had a female. Isn't that great? So, let me see. I have to close that. I have to find it. Where are you? Here you are. House of Lake, where is it? That's the construction of my house. That is a big garden, Hong Nam, toilet. I like my toilets outdoors in a garden.

Q: Nice.

A: I was digging at my lake. Where did you go? Okay, here's my baby calf.

Q: Aww.

A: That was 2 days old. That was January 13th.

Q: What kind of a cow is that?

A: It's a Brahmin. I see, I'm turning it. There you go. Here's mama.

Q: Look at those ears. 

A: See how big mama is? That mama is big. I mean, her head is higher than mine.

Q: I bet papa is bigger.

A: She's a big woman.

Q: Wow. What country?

A: That's Thailand. Now, I feed them corn and rice, so everything is very tasty. I'm not for that all grass fed. All grass fed meat is rank as far as I'm concerned.

Q: Interesting.

A: And cows will eat grain if they can get it. In fact, when I start feeding them some of my rice, I give them a bowl at night. These are big creatures. So a bowl of rice is about like this. Or a few ears of corn with a cob and all. And since I started them, I've got caretakers that take care of the animals on the property. I've got, like, 3 or 4 caretakers that are there at all times. So, I started feeding them in the couple weeks that I was there, I started feeding them the grains. They weren't feeding them grains. I said, what are you doing with this excess grain? You know, I said, because there, the price of grain won't pay for growing the grain.

Q: Oh, I see.

A: And that's how they do it in every country, to wipe the little farmer out so the big conglomerates can come and take over. So I said, listen, I'd rather feed my cows. You feed you guys and you feed my cows. You give them a bowl at night when it's time to go to bed. So, if I come on the property, even if I haven't been there for 5 or 6 months, they're right there with me. They'll follow me wherever I am. Except for my bull, he doesn't like me at all.

Q: I guess not.

A: If I get near her, he goes nuts. Very unhappy with me.

Q: He senses the sexual energy.

A: When I'm feeding the corn and the rice, he'll come around real quick. Where's my share? He's big. He's twice her size. He's huge.

Q: Genetic corn.

A: I grow corn. I grow corn and rice.

Q: Didn't they say now that all the corn everywhere is gone?

A: No, it isn't. Most of it. Everything that's sold is mainly genetically modified. But if you get heirloom corn, there are places. You can go to many seed places on the internet. 

Q: You can go to Homestead.

A: You can get organic, completely natural corn. I buy a lot of it there and here, and I take it to the Philippines and wherever. Because I know that it's the heirloom corn. They love it. The milk and everything stays sweet. Everything is more delicious. I'm not one of those who believes they have to be all grass-fed. Because if the food turns rank-tasting, they don't like it as much. And you give them that sweet stuff, and they digest it. And you don't give them enough to cause over-fermentation in their intestines. It's fine. It's when all they eat is grain. They're going to have a lot of fermentation. They're going to rot their own guts. But I only give them that bowl at night. And I've got a horse there that also, if I come on the property, he's right there with me. He loves that corn and rice. All of them do. 

Q: Raw corn and raw rice.

A: I grew it right there. There's a mountain right there. I'm at the foot of a mountain. And I dug a lake that's 100 meters by 80 meters. And it's only 12 feet deep. I wanted it 30 feet deep for catfish and all of that. I want to get big catfish. But they stopped me from digging it that big because it's right at the foot of a national forest, where there are lots of dinosaur remains and stuff like that. So it's a very protected site. So they came in and seized the backhoe and everything. But it's still half-dug. So it's a pretty big lake. And I go swimming in it every day. I thought it would take, like, three months to fill it. One three-hour range filled the whole thing. Because I'm at the foot of a mountain, so the whole wall of water came down and filled the lake in three hours. And I have three other reservoirs dug besides the lake. So this was a very drought year. Everybody had only 10% of the crops that they normally produce. I had 50%. I would have had more, but I drained the lake to have it dug. And then the government came and stopped me again. So I drained all my water. Otherwise, I would have had as big a crop as before. But what I started to tell you is I converted some into different areas. So now I don't have all this rice every year. So I have corn. I have a couple of acres of corn. I planted two new acres of bananas, a half acre of pineapple, and a half acre of king fruit, and probably about 50 coconuts and maybe 30 papaya palms. And when I planted the bananas, I collected my urine for the two weeks that I was here. So I had about three gallons of urine for that period of time. So I put it in one of the sprayers, you know, usually used for chemicals. And I diluted it with a little bit of the rainwater from my lake and put a tiny bit of honey, like a half a cup of honey for almost three gallons of fluid. And I sprayed it all around this much around the base of the bananas on two of the areas, and one of the areas I didn't. So when I went back three weeks later after two rains, that's where I had sprayed the urine. The leaves were very rich and full green, deep green, and stood straight out and full and strong. The field where I didn't spray the urine because I didn't have enough, they were still, they were greener, but not as strong and upright.

Q: Why?

A: Urine, you know, when you go buy urea fertilizer, that's cow urine that you're getting from a feedlot. And what they do is they pasteurize it and they treat it. So it doesn't last in the soil, it breaks down, and you have to buy it every year. When you use, you know, raw urine like that, it'll last for two or three seasons. They don't want that. They want you to buy every year. And when I did that with my ferns, my ferns were normal ferns, you know, about this high and full, doubled in size and full, just in one year. You know, urine, if you're a cooked fooder and you use your urine, you're going to burn the roots. 

Q: My son always pisses right near one section of our herb garden and it's beautiful. He's only four, but he's like maybe half raw.

A: For him, that's enough.

Q: Yeah, yeah, maybe.

A: He's not polluting it. He isn't so toxic for so long. You know, got lots of toxins that go into the soil and damage the roots, burn the roots. Let him eat soda pop and all that stuff and let him piss on them.

Q: Yeah.

A: And those plants will die and shrivel and die pretty quickly.

Q: Right.

A: Or get a fungus. Okay, are we set? Any more questions? All right. Thank you. We have a little intimate group here. And LEDs, they don't have space.

Q: But they're never spiral, right?

A: No.

Q: LED is a normal shape, but they can be fluorescent.

A: Well, they have different shapes. They can be fluorescent. No, well, I've never seen a LED fluorescent.

Q: Okay, well, you have.

A: Well, yes, I have. What they do is they have these little bitty pin lights on them and they give out, you know, a lot of...

Q: So, an LED, like...

A: Just LED bulbs.

Q: Well, some of the full spectrum, they look exactly, as Full Spectrum mentioned, exactly like fluorescent.

A: Yes. No, they look like regular incandescent.

Q: Yeah.

A: They do have some that look like these, fluorescent.

Q: Yeah, fluorescent.

A: Most of them are regular bulbs looking, those are incandescent.

Q: Most of them are these long white bulbs, like this, that are supposed to be full spectrum.

A: Right, they do have some of those, yes.

Q: And they're okay.

A: I said when I did experiments with them, they caused radioactive light coming off of them, like coconut pulp.

Q: So, they're not good?

A: I don't think they're so good.

Q: I don't know.

A: LED bulbs are the way to go.

Q: Yeah, but they're not the kind, those fluorescent ones, I mean, they're not the kind with their full spectrum. I can still keep them and use them, but they're not mercury. I have to worry about that.

A: They're not mercury, but they still may be causing your body and any substance, any food that they're near, to be slightly radioactive.

Q: Maybe eight hours to clean up the house.

A: No, to clean up that room.

Q: How do they get away with selling these? How come they're getting rid of the old ones? I think they're intending to kill people.

Q: Are we going to pay with the check or with cash?

Q: Cash.

Q: Okay.

Q: Cash is king.

A: [unintelligible] There won't be any 1776 again.
