A: So I'll get into how that happens in the future. And you can see the structure of inside a cell is very much like we have, they have organs, they have glands, they're called organelles and glandulas, and other names for them, but they basically have the same systems as we do. They have a nervous system, they have a lymphatic system, they have a bloodstream, they have everything, glands and organs, everything we have, just different shapes, like any creature, just a different shape. Now, our other system, the neurological system, is a web network just like the bloodstream. It's just as intricate as a bloodstream, only what that does is that transfers information to cells within an area and also to the brain. So that keeps the body in touch with the brain and brain in touch with the body in different areas of the body and touch with those different areas of the body. Then we have the lymphatic system, which is mainly that system, and that has two jobs to do. The lymphatic system is supposed to feed every cell in the body, except for the bloodstream, and is supposed to clean every bit of waste out of the body, including toxins. It's supposed to take it, let's say there are dead cells, except in the blood, we know the white blood cells, the white blood cells eat dead red blood cells. They eat each other if they die. So that system is encapsulated and takes care of its own. The rest of the body, the lymphatic system is endowed with the ability to take dead cells into the little bitty nodes and then the glands that can be as big as this. Most of your nodes are about the size of a pellet and most of your glands are about the size of a sugar cube. But as you notice, then your throat, they get very large and very big at times when it's time to clean waste out of the body. They absorb that waste, they have to neutralize it, they have to dissolve it and dump it under the skin to be perspired out of the body. 90% of the waste is supposed to leave through the skin. Most people's skin and lymphatic systems are jammed right now. So let's just take a look at it. This will give you an idea. Of course, this is a lot more intricate than... 

This is the skin, you see how complex the skin is? Many layers. And this is a... there are three layers to the skin. This is a shot of one layer of the skin. We have three of these on top of the other. And there are many layers to how it works, except for the hairs only on the top layer. Sometimes the follicle can come from a second and third layer. Like in gorillas and apes, but most humans, it's coming out of mainly the top layer of skin. But it's quite intricate. So you see the things that can go wrong in the skin. So you have to keep that very healthy to make sure the poisons leave through the skin. If they don't leave through the skin, where's the rest of the place that they can go? That's your digestive tract. If you have poisons going into your digestive tract, they're going to interfere with the digestion and the absorption of your food. And then you're going to start absorbing toxins into your food along with it. So the point is to keep that skin very alive and functional. Now this is three different shots of the lymphatic system. It's oversimplified. It's much more intricate than it shows here. Like here it shows the lymph glands going here. This is just one network, and they go all into the breast everywhere. Very complicated and complex. And you can see the little bitty bumps on the end of the nodes, and then the larger ones are the glands. And the major networks of glands are here, here, even from the back, going all the way down into the arms near the elbow, and then here, all the way from the in, all the way up in here and around the kidneys. That's your major network of lymph glands. That's why you get rashes here and here and here so much. Because that's where the glands are doing major work in dumping the poisons out your skin. And when you have a rash, that isn't a sign that you've got some bacteria damaging the skin, like the pharmaceutical and medical industry, wouldn't you believe? It's some poison leaving the body. The skin isn't protected enough. The skin isn't taken care of enough. 

So the only way you can help the skin and protect the skin is by providing butter for the skin or coconut cream or a combination of them to protect the skin. So that when the poisons leave through the skin, there's enough fat that don't damage the skin cells. When you get a rash inflammation, swelling in your skin like a hive, you have toxins that are so caustic they have damaged the cells that are irritating the cell walls. Hello Monica. Monica, go ahead. 

Q: I went out to boat last night and I forgot that my daughter had her last class this morning, so I promised to be here at 12, but sorry about that. 

A: It's okay. We're just getting started with the workshop. 

Q: Thank you. Hi. 

A: So keeping the skin protected so it's not damaged as much when those poisons leave is part of the object of preserving your health. You're going to have rashes. You're going to have pimples. You're going to have burns. If you read my newsletters, you know, saw that burn that was in one newsletter. This woman had 30 degree burns. She thought it was the hot water bottle. Yeah, it wasn't. The hot water was never over 110 degrees. You can't burn skin like that from hot water bottles. So this is a, those were chemicals coming out. She had had some injections in the buttock. It went up into the back and stored in this spinal cord here. So then when she got on, I had only died for about four years, the body was able to discard it. Didn't want to send it to the intestines. Imagine what it had done if those toxins had gone to the intestines. We've got peritonitis, and she could have died from it. Instead it came out of her skin and burned, third degree burns in her skin. And all the skin opened up and peeled away and left scarring. But because she did what I suggested, putting lime juice on it, putting a honey and coconut cream and meat over it, she didn't scar, she scarred a tenth of what she wouldn't normally have scarred if she hadn't had those substances to soothe the tissue after it had already been destroyed. You're going to have some skin damage if you've ever had a vaccine or any injection from the medical profession, and you've eaten donuts or french fries. You're going to have some of that toxicity. If you're a supplement taker, expect a lot. If you've been a supplement taker your whole lifetime, expect a lot of skin damage. Because all supplements, all supplements, I don't care how natural they are, use kerosene to dissolve the substance from which they will extract the nutrient. Would you take your food, soak that from 22 to 76 hours in kerosene, rinse it for two minutes and eat it? You think you're not going to get kerosene in it? It permeates everything, every molecule of that food. So people when they get high from supplements are getting high on an adrenaline rush because of the kerosene poisoning. It's not a good healthy thing. It's not a healthy high. You do less damage by snorting cocaine. I'm serious. You do less damage by snorting cocaine than you would by eating kerosene. 

So if you've taken supplements, any form, natural supplement, you have kerosene to deal with in your body. A lot of it. If you've had unnatural vitamin supplements like one a day, they use gasoline to dissolve their substance to extract. Vitamin D is never even natural. Vitamin B's are never extracted from a food. They are chemically created. The way you create vitamin D, you take vegetable oil, hydrogenated vegetable oil, which is the same molecular structure as plastic. That's how you make plastic. If you want it to be an oil type, you just don't expose it to hydrogenation for very long, but enough to make it a plastic molecule. Then you expose it to radioactive material. Expose it to uranium or charged barium. Some form of nuclear waste is what they're using to make your vitamin D.  So all of your milk that's fortified with vitamin D, your cereal's fortified with vitamin D, you're eating plastic oil, expose the radiation. It has no relationship to true vitamin D. But the sun's radiation hits the skin, the fats in the skin transform into vitamin D. And that's the principle they're saying that creates vitamin D, which is the truth. But just any old radiation doesn't do what the sun does. Uranium doesn't do that. An isotope doesn't do that. It creates a whole different spectrum, and it will damage the oil even more after hydrogenation. They hydrogenate. If you want to make an oil into a plastic, it has an infinite shelf life. It won't rot. There are no bacteria that can infiltrate it. It will, it's forever. But that's not healthy. We need nutrients. We need good butter, good cream, even some avocado. And that mixing in our skin with the sun, we create the bacteria in our skin, they create the vitamin D. Now, everything that happens in your body, 99% of everything that happens in your body is by the virtue of bacteria. We have 150 bacterial genes to every one human gene. That means we are 99.5% bacteria and only a half or percent human. 

So when the medical profession says the bacteria is to blame, and that a few little bacteria somewhere are going to take over our whole body, it is a Hollywood B horror film crap. It can't happen. Oh, but you've got a little cut there. And then some poison is going to get in there, some bacteria is going to get in there. Take over your whole body. It's nonsense. What creates toxicity and disease in the body is industrial pollution coming into the food, coming into your air and your water. And mainly injected into you from the pharmaceutical industry, medical industry. They create 70% of all present diseases. Their vaccines are the worst. There is not one nutrient, not one food in a vaccine. When they create a disease in a vaccine, they use a solvent, usually gasoline, not even kerosene, to dissolve that substance. Like let's say they use a raw egg to create their bacteria, or they use tissue from a pig or a monkey. They'll dissolve it in that solution, gasoline. They'll extract the so-called diseased cells, and then they'll put them in a vaccine with what? The basic five ingredients are liquid mercury and aluminum, formaldehyde, ether and detergent. Does that sound like a good diet? Those are the five main ingredients. Then you have 26 to 63, but mainly it's 56 other ingredients. All of them are toxic on their own merit. In the soup of toxins, you can have up to 63 toxic substances in a vaccine. They are called inert. Well, if they're inert, what the hell are they doing in there? Now, it is a poison. They are all poisonous. There is nothing beneficial about a vaccine ever. And they tell people, and they browbeat parents that they're bad parents, if they don't poison them. 

And the way you can get around that is you educate them. I've got a flyer. You can get her off the website wewant2live.com. The TO is the numeral two, so it's who wewant2live.com. Go to there and look for the vaccine waiver, vaccine release form, or acceptance of responsibility form. I don't remember what they finally called it. And it is a six-page document that tells you what's in the vaccine. And you hand it out to somebody and say, "Okay, if you believe this vaccine is good, you will take full responsibility." To $1 million for each vaccine. And here's the ingredients in the vaccine. If you can prove this to be of any benefit. You're talking about me being immune, or my child being immune to a disease from this thing that you're giving it. Look what else is in this vaccine. And you've only got maybe a pinhead full of disease in it. Diseased cells. How's that going to alter anything? You've got all these whole list of poisons which are 98% of the vaccine? You take the responsibility. You owe me a million dollars to take care of my child if anything happens to that child. You won't see anybody ever sign it. And they will say, "Okay, fine, okay, you have it. You're free, you're okay." Every case. Even when you go abroad. And let's say you're going from Peru to Brazil. And they want you to take a yellow fever vaccine. You pull out my document, you give it to them, and you explain it to them. And say, "You take the responsibility." If I die, or if I get very sick, you're responsible up to a million dollars. They'll hold you for 24 hours at the most. Make sure you're not coughing and spewing. And then they'll let you go right into the country. Because it's part of the Geneva Convention law that everybody, every country signed into. After World War II. Nobody can be forced to take any medication that can be dangerous and does not have a proven record of no harm done. 

Q: Wow. I didn't know that. 

Q: Yeah, I didn't know that either. 

A: It's part of that document. It's in there. It's quoted. 

Q: So where do I find it on your website? 

A: Just, I don't build the website. I have contract with somebody to produce it, but it's on there. It's on there. 

Q: Because I know it's cool. My doctor is not vaccinated, and I had to go through this whole lawyer stuff. 

A: All you have to do is take that document. 

Q: My family is so afraid that I'm killing my kids, like everybody. 

A: Yeah, they're trained to think that way. 

Q: Every time I come to my doctor, he's trying to tell me it's safe now. 

A: No, you had them that document, and you say, "Justify this." And take one million dollar responsibility. Bush made a law, an executive order, that relieves the pharmaceutical industry all responsibility of vaccine damage. So now you can't sue the vaccine company. 

Q: Yeah. 

Q: But you know what? Even when I immigrated here to Canada, they had to vaccinate me for every damn thing. I wasn't allowed to come in, and it made me really sick. I was in Africa before. I had to do the same thing, and they went, "Okay, what do we have here?" My doctor didn't even know. She went, "Okay, let's do Cholera too, and let's do whatever." And I was really, really sick. And so I don't want my daughter to do it. But there's the fear of that. 

A: Well, you take that document, and you put it in your doctor's face. And you have him sign it. And say, "If he won't sign it, let me tell you, you don't have to have your child vaccinated." 

Q: But the immigration, what about the immigration? If I would go across the border? 

A: You gave that to an immigration nation to be the same thing. Oh, yeah? They're not going to sign it. They're not going to be responsible, I guarantee you. And then you get an attorney who understands my document, and they can sue the hell out of them if they keep you from immigrating. 

Q: Fantastic. Because you couldn't even study in the states. So if I wanted to do a master's, they didn't let me study unless I do the whole thing again. 

A: You don't have to do them again. All you have to do is show them you had it once. But you have to keep a record of having them. But if you show that document, then you don't have to have any ever. Because it's against the Geneva Convention that all countries signed into. 

Q: So nobody knows? 

Q: Oh, maybe. I didn't know that. 

A: Well, when I do studying, I do a lot of studying. My whole life's a study on it. So any kind of information I come along that's helpful. And keeping us healthy, I use it. 

Q: I thought I was hyper-vigilant until I met you. And then I thought, "This man is so thorough."

A: That's my whole life. I don't have a family. I have research. Kind of like Ralph Nader. No family. You don't have time for a family. Who's going to tolerate it. Did you shut off? Okay. See, I have electromagnetic energy with machines. If I touch them directly, they'll start getting static and crazy. So I have to use a mouse. I can't even use the keyboard on it. When I was an actor, I used to shut down movie cameras, especially video cameras. 

Q: What's this thing that was before? Like, how the poison runs in the lymphatic system? 

Q: Basically, he was saying where the lymph glands are, that's where the rashes come out, because they're spewing the toxins. 

A: Most of your lymph glands start from here and go all the way up, all around here, back around the kidneys, and here, all the way up around in here, in the neck, and then starting from here, you made your gland a little bit more, all around in here, even more so in women than men in this area. But under here, same, and then to the back here. So that's where you have most of your rashes, here and there.  Some people get them on the feet, like fungus on the feet, but that's different, that's not lymphatic detoxification, that's fungal detoxification. When the lymphatic system can do it, we have bacteria, parasites, and fungus to help us detox. Break down the dead cells. The fungus can eat it. Gangrene is a fungus that breaks down a lot of cells that are damaged at one time in a particular area, because the lymphatic system isn't working there properly, and a lot of cells are dying quickly, usually from diabetics suffer more of that than anybody else, because they're constantly injecting themselves one to three times a day with insulin, whether it's in the stomach or in the thighs, they're getting these chemical poisons all the time, without going through the digestive tract, damaging their system. So they have a lot of chemicals that are stored in their legs and in their limbs, and what happens is they get into their 50s, late 40s, early 50s, and they start turning gangrene, their whole cells are just starting to disintegrate and disrupt, and they'll chop off the toes, and they'll chop off the foot, and chop off the leg, to the knee, and they get all the way up to the hip. You know, I've seen many diabetics go through that. My family's full of diabetics. I have eight cousins who are diabetic by the time they were eight years old. I was diabetic at 15 and a half after my third polio vaccine, and that caused it. It also caused angina pectoris, which are basically heart attacks, muscle spasms in and around the heart. So I had 300 heart attacks from the age of 15 and a half to the age of 22, when I started eating the care juice and raw milk together at 22 years old, the heart attacks stopped. 

And I only had one after that. But I had 300 from the age of 15 and a half to the age of 22, and 50 of them made me unconscious. But because I was autistic, I didn't have a problem with it, because I wasn't indoctrinated to be in fear, I didn't understand language. So I knew that when I went into pain, the best thing is to ignore the pain. And you do that by just going inside and going into, like, you see, it's autistic, you go off in another state, that's that state. They're just doing it with their eyes closed. I mean, eyes open. And so when I used to go into it, my parents would slap me. My mother would slap me on the back, my mother would slap me on the back of the head and say, "Stop doing that, you look like an idiot." Well I freaking was an idiot. I was autistic, part of my brain was damaged from a tetanus shot at 18 months old. So, and that's when I went autistic. And I understood language, and I understood no language, I understood language up to 18 months, and then after that, it was like somebody just turned off the light, and it wasn't there anymore. Until I started drinking the carrot juice and raw milk after about 12 days, all of a sudden the light was on again. Oh, that's language. And there was a whole different experience. So, toxins in the body cause disease, not microbes, not some bacteria, not virus. Those are just activities of the body trying to get well. And they're janitors. Oh, salmonella and raw milk will cause disease. Salmonella and food will cause disease. What was salmonella? What is salmonella? Where do you find salmonella naturally in your body? Take a cotton swab and go through your nose. Take a cotton, another cotton swab and go through your eye. Another cotton swab in your ear. Go under your nails. The amount, you'll find, 1,600 varieties of salmonella just in those places. 100 years ago, when we took a bath in June, we go from October or late September all the way to June without a bath, what do you think ate the dead cells on the skin? Salmonella. We had 2,300 varieties of salmonella. And a lot of those lived on the skin. They ate up the dead cells. 

Otherwise, you'd feel like a snake. Every 6 months, every 3 and a half months. You had salmonella working on your body. Your salmonella still works on mucous membranes where you had cells dying all the time. Unless you could be up there with soap and water cleaning your nose all day long, you're going to have salmonella to help you. Get rid of those dead cells. That is natural. But the pharmaceutical industry says, "Look, we see them eating animal cells. We see them eating human cells. See, bad guys." And they say, "Oh, that's pathogenic, creating disease." How is them eating dead cells creating disease? There's the janitors. Some industrial chemical had to have injured the body and damaged cells in the body. That's disease. Over a long term, it collects in a certain organ or body part. You have a diseased area in your body. You have a malfunctioning kidney or a malfunctioning gallbladder or pancreas. And then the pharmaceutical industry says, "Oh, let's take insulin for that bad." Instead of repairing the pancreas, instead of making it well and healthy and nurturing it, because it's not making proper insulin anymore, not making any at all, let's shoot you with some insulin. You pay us $1,300, $1,600 a month for your insulin. We'll make a bundle and you'll stay under for life. And then when your feet and toes and everything start rotting, we get $10,000 every time we do an amputation. Sounds really nice. 

Q: Sounds perfect. Sounds way perfect. So clean and... 

A: This is perfect for them. They don't make money if you're healthy. They do not make money. 

Q: Do you need a blanket? 

A: 90%, 99% of your politicians own pharmaceutical stock. It's their major investment. And the rest of them are in agriculture. So they have no interest in you being healthy. They have every interest in you buying the foods they produce from their big agri-business companies that they have investments in. So it's all about the money, always all about the money. So when your body is trying to clean itself and it can't, what can be blocking the lymphatic system? You remember I talked about the trans fatty acids, the fat that they used to make vitamin D, the hydrogenated oils. What do you think all of your fried foods are cooked in? Serials, packaged cereals. Even if they're healthy packaged cereals, so-called health food organic, and that's a lie. All the organics are a lie because they're using all of these altered chemicals which are not organic. Sure, the beans that they take the oil from or the flour, the safflower that they take the oil from the safflower seeds, they take the oil from. Sure, it was great, it could have been raised organically, but once they finished processing it's no longer organic, but the FDA lets them, allows them to say it's still organic. Take for example, you have organic chicken. What are chickens mainly fed? Soy. Soy, processed soy protein. If you feed raw soybeans to a chicken, what happens? Any bird, they die. It poisons them. If a human eats a raw soybean, what will happen? You will get very sick and probably die. You will have stomach cramps, you would not believe. You will be vomiting, you will go into diarrhea, and there is a chemical enzyme in there that will destroy your intestines and possibly kill your liver. So, anytime that somebody tells you something is organic and has soy in it that's for human consumption or bird consumption, it is an absolute lie. Because they have to process it with kerosene. They have to dissolve it, make it into a protein powder or a tablet, and feed it to the bird or the human as a cereal or something. 

So you have all this chemical in it. Nothing organic and natural about it, but the FDA says that's okay. Because if you didn't, if you knew it was in it and you were allowed to call it organic, then somebody would be buying it. This wouldn't be so. That's why they don't want GMOs labeled. That's why they want radioactive, leek-exposed food, radioactive, leek-treated food with the label on it, the radiation label on it. Because people aren't stupid. So they want to keep them misinformed. The fattig system has been jammed with plastic fats, trans fatty acids. Now, in my research with autopsies on 32 humans, when I analyzed the lymph glands, I only analyzed a few lymph nodes because they were identical, just tiny waystations for the lymph glands where the body would hold up some of the worst toxins and slightly neutralize them before putting it into the lymph glands to be fully denatured. Or try to resolve and diminish the caustic effect of those chemicals. And then try to put them into a solution to be dumped under the skin, to be perspired from the skin. Remember I said 90% of all the waste and toxins are supposed to be expelled from the body, secreted from the body through the skin. Remember the only other place is mucous membranes and intestines. What damage could they do to your sense of smell? To your intestines, to your digestive tract. You damage those, there's no recovery. You can't eat and heal yourself with food, there's no recovery. Of course, pharmaceutical and medical industry loves that, because then you'll always be going to some chemical for help. And that's what they like, money, money, money. So how do you get this lymphatic system to dissolve? So I've taken those lymphatic glands and I put them in different temperatures of water. And the only thing that would melt them was 105 degrees, for at least 90 minutes. And when you take the gland and you put it in warm water, it would dissolve quicker than an hour and a half. But I found that if you exposed, like if I amputated an arm and put it in warm water, it took 60 minutes to get the heat into the deepest lymphatic gland, and then 30 minutes in that same temperature to actually start the melting of that hydrogenated vegetable oil. 

So imagine this, you've got a cold stick of butter in the middle of a two cup jelly jar. So you've got a cold stick of butter broadcasting cold into the air space around it. Then you've got a 105 degree temperature to 10 degree temperature that has to get through the glass to warm the air in the space around to get it to slightly melt the butter. 90 minutes. 90 minutes. Of course, we're not as cold as the butter coming out of the refrigerator, which is about 48, 50 degrees. But we have also an air conditioning system naturally in the body that keeps the body from getting too hot too fast, keeps trying to lower it and lower it. So getting the body up to 105 degrees is not an easy thing. It takes time and many times of doing it, but the benefits are astounding. Now I used to tell people to do them two days a week, 90 minutes, two days a week, minimum, do that at least. So I had thousands of people who did it for many years. Progress increased the cleansing of the lymphatic system and it was helpful. Then I went to five days a week. Three to five days a week and people reported how many times they were doing it. I looked at their irises and saw what happened. Then I went to every day, 90 minutes for people who were really sick. And let me tell you what happened. This last year when I got enough people to do it, I had one woman with rheumatoid arthritis that came to me in 2006 who was really actually crippled in a wheelchair. Her knees were this big, as big as basketballs. Her joints and her hips were large, her elbows, you know, big, you know, the size of a soft ball on those sides. And the wrists, all of her hands were buckled up. She couldn't feed herself, she couldn't dress. Her husband had to do absolutely everything for her. So she's been on the diet from 2006 up until last year. She was back to playing cards and stopped playing cards and playing cards for ten years with her friends. And when she told them that, you know, with a phone, a speaker phone, that she was on the diet, they said, "Oh, dangerous diet is going to kill you." She says, "No, it's making me feel better. That's why I'm doing it." So last year when she came, the knees were just slightly swollen. She was back to feeding herself, preparing her foods, not walking yet by herself. She had to walk, she'd have to use a walker. And still in some pain in her knees and some of the, and the elbow and a little bit, one on the shoulders. 

And I said, this next year, and I thought I was telling her, talking to her husband, I said, "Put her in that bath. I know it's a big chore and it's a lot of work." Because he'd have to lift her into the bathtub, lift her out of the bathtub, dress her, undress her, everything. But at this point, she was now even going to dress herself, do a lot of things. So I said, "Now take her in the bath every night." Because that's what she couldn't do. She couldn't get out of the wheelchair into the bath and out of the bath on her own. So her husband, she could undress herself and he'd have to take her in the bath. So he agreed. I said, "You do it every night, 90 minutes. And next year, she'll be running in here." And I know that was a huge promise and I'm not God, so I really couldn't tell that, but I could tell it the progress she was going. If we could just get that lymph system to do the finally cleaning fast, then she could function almost normal. So she came in in April and so on April 2nd, she walked in. Walked into the room. You know, there's a woman, [voice breaking] she was not functional. And she and her husband had gone on a cruise for the first time in ten years. And she said, "I went down the ship's plank on my own. I needed a little help for getting back up the plank." But she says, "I did the whole thing on my own." So it's great. 

Q: Do we ask questions? Can we ask questions? 

A: No. If you have a question, write it. Because when I, yeah, I have a questions and answers session. When I've done that before, we've gone to two o'clock in the morning. So it's a bit of a... You have a question, I usually will answer it with a brief, but if you ask me a direct question, I expound on it too much. And then we get out of the framework of it. And if you're doing it in the process of the workshop, you'll understand the answer even if it's more simplified. But if I have to answer directly, you know, it's too much. So those hot baths are imperative. Another thing that I've been using for the last three years is because I find so many toxins in the body. So many toxins in the stomach. And that's where your hydrochloric acid is made to dissolve larger particles of food. Now your digestive juices are to reduce larger particles of food into smaller molecules so that bacteria and the intestines, which is 90% of digestion, eat your food. That's the way it works. So if you have to break it down into smaller, you use digestive juices. Well, if your stomach lining is full of formaldehyde, mercury, aluminum, and all the toxins from vaccines in the stomach lining, what's going to get into your food every time you secrete hydrochloric acid? Those compounds. So you're poisoning your food every time you eat. So I was suggesting that people, depending upon the amount of toxins in the stomach and in the intestines, that they eat a little cube, sugar cube, sized amount of cheese, which is a half a teaspoon of cheese, every 15 to 45 or even 60 minutes. Now if I have people who have a massive amount of mercury in their body, I'll suggest that they have a piece of that cheese every 15 to 20 minutes. That means three to four an hour. And it'll act like just a train of cheese going through just collecting poisons. So that was my theory three years ago. So I had people doing it, mainly once an hour. It was working very well. So then I took, like my construction workers, full of metal poisoning and radiation because now they allow 22% spent uranium from old bombs to military getting rid of and making new ones to make more money for the industrial complex. 

The government allows them to use 20% in building materials, building metals. 7% in jewelry. You see any jewelry on me? I don't want radioactive material on my body. I don't care, spent uranium doesn't mean a thing. It just means it was used once for something else before. It doesn't mean it's inactive. It's just as active. 

Q: I think it's in utensils too. 

A: Yeah, it's in utensils. 

Q: Oh my God. 

A: I use wood utensils. 99% of the time. They break easier, but still I'm not poisoning myself. 

Q: So how often are you saying to take the half teaspoon of cheese now? 

A: Up to the individual. I mean, you know, when I look at the irises, I can tell the toxic stomach and intestines are. And then I'll say, I think you need every 15 minutes, every 20 minutes, every 30 minutes, or 45 minutes, or every hour to help. So this woman also did that. So she was getting twice the amount of nutrients because she was eating a piece of cheese every 20 minutes. So the hot baths were taking care of the lymphatic system. The cheese was pulling the poisons out of the stomach and intestines. So she wasn't recycling any of those poisons from the stomach and intestines. So she was able to make huge progress in that one year. And I knew she would if she would just stick to it. But she's 100%er. Absolutely 100%er. Her husband isn't 100%er because he's not well. He's not sick. But she does it 100%. And now she's got a normal functioning life. Knees look normal. A hand that--she has only one knuckle and one hand that's still a little large and the fingers are in a crooked right there. But the rest of her body looks normal now. And she's not in all that pain and she can have a normal life. So those things work. Now let's go to the digestive tract. Starts in the mouth. What's in the saliva? That's where, you know, when you chew, you create saliva. What's in the human saliva? Bacteria. More bacteria than dogs and cats. Don't bite anybody. You'll start digesting them. But our saliva isn't like a fly's. When a fly spits its bacteria on something, it's like muriatic acid. It will dissolve it right there before it even eats it and sucks it up. Dissolves it outside the animal--the fly's body. But our saliva starts breaking down with the bacteria infiltrating the food, getting into deep crevices of meat and breaking it down so that we dissolve it so the bacteria--so it gets to the stomach we don't need as much hydrochloric acid. But we still need it for the larger particles to break it down so bacteria can infiltrate it. So 90% of bacteria is supposed to be-- 90% of digestion is supposed to be bacterial. Entirely bacterial. You can even make it less than that if you want. Or more bacteria. If you take your meats, cut them into cubes, put it in a food processor, and make a mince out of it. You prevent your body from having to work so hard to make hydrochloric acid and a lot of the other digestive juices. 

ou free up that molecule so you don't have to create-- your liver doesn't have to create as much bile to break down the fats. So when the food goes from the mouth, it goes with full bacteria. There's only the ptyalin enzyme in the mouth, and there's very little of that, and that helps break down sugars. And that's about 5% of your saliva. Only 5%. So we're allowed to eat 5% carbohydrates because ptyalin helps break down carbohydrates. So if you measure-- wait a minute. If we follow the body's structure and we say that we have bacteria here in the saliva, let's put that bacteria on vegetables, leaf stalks and roots. Let's put it on fruit. See what happens? Let's put it on meat. See what happens? Let's put it on dairy. See what happens? Put it on eggs and see what happens. Put it on coconut and see what happens. Let's put it on avocado and see what happens. The bacteria from the mouth almost has no relationship to any of them but meat and dairy. 

Q: Wow. 

A: So when a vegetarian tells you that we're supposed to be vegans, they don't know what the frick they're talking about. They've never done any research to prove anything. I have. So I've taken all of the-- in the autopsies of the 32 humans that I've taken, I've taken the hydrochloric acid from the stomach and put it on all those foods. Guess which one it works on? Works a little bit on the coconut, works on the avocado, and it works on all the meats and the dairy. Does it affect the fruit and the vegetables? Etches it by 2% only. 

Q: And the eggs? 

A: And the eggs. 

Q: What's with eggs? 

A: We don't need hydrochloric acid for eggs. They're already liquid. It's the quickest-digesting food in the world. You can digest an egg in 27 minutes. Even milk has to be broken down heavily. Take 6 to 10 hours to digest milk. Eggs, 27 minutes. Milk, 10 to 16 hours. Raw milk. Eggs, 27 minutes. 

Q: 6 to 10 hours is not just the stomach, right? It's the whole-- 

A: That's the whole. Now, it takes 24 hours to move to the human body. 

Q: But is there stomach and small intestines? 

A: Stomach, small intestines, and bowel. 24-hour period, you go all the way through. 

Q: But the 6 to 10 hours you talk about as well? 

A: No, that's all in the small intestines. Very little milk ever gets to the bowel. If it did, children would be smart, very young. Because the bowel is the area where E. coli breaks down the final stage protein and fats to the finite molecule to feed the brain and the nervous system. If you were to put a suppository of milk into a baby's colon, that baby would become smart much faster. But then get into more trouble. A lot more trouble. Because they'd be making decisions very early in life that parents don't want them to make. So, the small intestines take care of feeding almost every day. Breaking down the nutrients to feed the whole body. Except for the brain and nervous system, most of that comes in the colon. It's a short passage to the colon. Depression always comes from a low bacterial count in your colon. If you're depressed, eat high meat. Why does high meat work? Because the natural bacteria in the meat is breaking down the molecules of fat and protein just like your bowel would. Like the bacteria in your bowel. So that's why when people eat raw rotten meat, they get silly and happy within 10-20 minutes after eating it. Like, I don't know how many people saw me on Ripley's Believe It or Not. And those two patients of mine, that were eating it with me, the woman and the man, they'd both been depressed all of their lives. The woman was taking 27 psychotropic medications daily. Seven different ones, 27 doses daily. For 18 years. No, it was 22 years on medication. She was like 14 years old, 12 years old. And I tried to get her to eat the high meat. I'm already on this crazy diet, with social eating all this raw meat and hung up on me. Finally after a year and a half, I said, "Listen, she's a famous yoga instructor, video-tasting everything. She's teaching yoga and she's depressed, on all kinds of medications." So I said, "Listen, I'm not going to help you anymore. You're creating a basket case out of me." She's still going on and off the diet with her mood. And I said, "Listen, you try the high meat. Just try it one time. If it doesn't work for you, I will still work with you or if it doesn't work for you. But if you don't try it, please don't call me anymore." 

I said, "I need to resolve this. You're taking too much of my time, too much of my energy, and you keep asking the same questions." I asked you to record them so you don't have to keep calling me, and asking the same questions and getting the same answers. You've got to record them. But I need to communicate, I need to touch with a person, that I understand. I said, "But I can't afford that time for you. Sure, I can take all of your money, and sure, that will make my life a little happier. But if I can't help you and you won't help yourself, you don't make my life happier in that way." And money, I can go back to acting, making $13,000 every two hours. Now I have to work three, four weeks to make $13,000. So it's just not worth it, right? So she says, "But I'm on this day, and I'm going to hang up, slam the phone down." So she calls about three hours later and says, "Okay, how do I make this high meat?" I said, "Let's cut up, chop it up, put it in a jar, leave half of the airspace, and then put it in your cupboard. If you want it to go fast, put it in your cupboard, just take it out every day to two days and open it. If you're doing it in your refrigerator, it's going to take a lot longer. Take it out every three to four days, you put new air in. Put it back in your house in your refrigerator." I don't have that kind of time. I could commit suicide tonight. I said, "That's your choice." So I say, "But I have a patient, the man who was on Ripley's with me, he ate it all the time and had batches of it going all the time." Because he was happy all the time, because he just golfball size amount every day. He was happy as could be. So I said, "I'll give him your number. If he has any extra to sell you, you go see him." So I got a call about, it must have been 11.45 at night, and I don't answer the phone at that time. I screened the call first. If it's an emergency I want to handle, I do. If it's to me not real emergency, I don't answer. You can call me at 7/9 in the morning. So I was on the phone. I ate the high meat. I got it from James. I got the high meat. I ate it. I'm really nervous. I'm scared to death that something's going to happen to me. The bacteria is going to take me over. I'm going to get very sick and I'll be dead in the morning. 

No way I'm answering that phone, because I'd have to babysit her all the way through the night to assure her that she was not going to melt. You know, or dissolve or die. So it wasn't like the Wicked Witches, you're gonna disintegrate. So that's what people think when they think eating high meat, that they're just going to dissolve and melt. So every 45 minutes to an hour she called me through the night. "You better answer this phone. I've already spent two hours and I think that I'm having a problem." And she's getting funny. And this woman never said anything funny in the year and a half that I knew her. And so all through the night she called, and at like 4.30 in the morning she's making a joke. She says, "If you don't answer this phone, I'm just going to stay here and run your tape out, and we're going to keep calling, and you're going to hear the phone ring, and then she whistles some happy tunes. She whistles a happy tune, waiting for me to answer, and making jokes and laughing." So I said, "It's time for me to answer." So I got on the phone and said, "Hi." She said, "Why didn't you answer the phone?" I said, "Because if I had babysat you, you would think that it was my babysitting with you that protected you and give me some magical, you know, talent that I don't have." You know, so you need to know that you can get through it on your own and listen to you. You're whistling a happy tune and you're making jokes. "Oh, I am." I said, "Do you have any stomach pain? Are you vomiting? Do you have any nausea? Or do you have any diarrhea?" "No, I feel pretty good." "Then why the frick are you calling me?" "Go to sleep." And I hung up on her. She eats it every day. I have one guy that doesn't eat any fresh meat. He eats -- he's 6'2". He's a landscape artist. He became a landscape artist because he was chronically depressed all his life. He hated people. So he dealt with trees and plants and grasses and stuff like that. That's how he made his living and lived his life. So he was the same thing, on and off the diet until I got him to eat the high meat. I didn't have to threaten him with not helping him. He finally just did it. And now he won't eat any fresh meat. He eats 2 pounds of rotten meat a day. He has two refrigerators to handle it. And they're outdoors. 

So he keeps it going. It goes 2-3 weeks old before he will even consider eating it. The next time I went to see him, he never called me again. I said, "Oh, he's going well." I came back to Nevada City to do the next workshop there about 6 months after this. Here he is in the workshop with three girlfriends. This guy never had a girlfriend in his life. He's only about a 5-1/2 in looks, but he was so charming. Funny. One of the funniest guys I ever met. He could make a joke out of something that didn't deserve a joke. And he had over 3 10 women, 10+ looking women, at the workshop together dating all three of them. And at the same workshop. That's charming. What it can do to the body is enormous. It is not bad stuff. It is the bacteria in the meat, predigesting itself. It's like milk can predigest itself. It will be sour and nasty smelling and tasting. That's why they make a cultured yogurt and kefir. So it doesn't taste nasty and smell nasty. But it doesn't break it down the way the body does. So, if you vomit, what's it smell like? Nasty. That's digesting. That's the way it's going through your system. Your body makes it stink, makes it rot, makes it foul. And the bacteria in the colon, and finish that, take away the odor, except that that's in the feces. The discard. The stuff it could not thoroughly digest is what's discarded. A lot of people get on this diet and they stop having bowel movements. But this diet constipates me. Oh, it doesn't constipate you. You're digesting every particle. You don't have any waste. So some people will go five to seven days without a bowel movement. But when it comes out, it's like a brick. Because the body is sucking everything it can out of it. Digesting and sucking everything it can. That's not constipation. That's incredible, happy digestion. What can you do to resolve the hard matter and getting that out without splitting your rectum, without, you know, without agony, is what you need to consider. Not eating laxatives and, you know, all kinds of crap that prevents you from digesting your food properly. And that's what people do. They'll run to herbal formulas or regular, over-the-counter laxatives or something like that, which destroy the bacteria in your digestive tract. Then you're not digesting your food. Sure, you got a bowel movement because you're not digesting the food anymore.

So what I tell people to do is your colon is starved for fats. When fats, food finally gets to the colon, and that's about 19 hours. Then it's got five hours to move through the colon. Almost all of your good fats are already gone. They're already absorbed. Especially if you've been on a bad diet all your life. So how much colon does the colon get, fresh fats, do the colon get? Does the colon get? Very little. So of course, if you're going to hold that raw food up, keep trying to break down more fats and to absorb the fats. Would it can? If you take three tablespoons each of butter, coconut cream and dairy cream, one quarter teaspoon, about the size of the bean of honey, and you put it together in a four ounce jelly jar, put a lid on it, tight lid on it, shake it, immerse it in a bowl of hot water, not hot enough to burn your hand, but to make it uncomfortable by holding your hand there for about ten seconds. And then letting it bring all of that fat to a little above body temperature. Cows body temperature, hottest, 105 degrees. It went from 105. So you can heat it that high without a problem. And then you take a bulb syringe, you just before you go to sleep. So you can hold that in the intestines without, you walk around, of course, it's going to come out. It's fat. It takes a long time to digest it. A lot of people say, "Well, wait a minute, wait a minute, it takes bile to digest those fats." Well, your body dumps bile all throughout the intestines, not just here in the stomach from the gallbladder. The body is distributing bile all throughout the small and large intestines. I've done autopsies on bowels and small intestine. I've found bile in the tissue. So it goes either from the liver or the gallbladder through a network of tissue to the intestinal tract, to the lacteal system. I'm theorizing it's the lacteal system. I couldn't find how it was delivered. When you're dealing with dead people, it's usually old people. I only had one of the 32 cadavers that was a teenager, died from leukemia. But, you know, I was not able to get healthy people to study. Some of them died in their sleep, so you could say they were old. 

But they were old. So everything I wanted to find from those was not -- I would need more samples of people, of the human race, to make other conclusions or discover other things. But anyway, bile's dumping into the system. And so it's hydrochloric acid, not just in the stomach. Hydrochloric acid is dumping and being made within the intestinal wall. If there's food particles that are too big. 

Q: Sorry, did you say to eat it? 

A: Pardon? 

Q: Did you say to eat it? 

A: Eat rotten meat. 

Q: No. No, insert it. 

A: No, you insert it in the rectum. So what you do is you, you know, you -- it's bedtime. You take a bulb syringe, suck it up in there. Maybe get the bulb syringe warm first, because it will cool your ingredients down very quickly. So while your food is warming, the fat is warming, you also warm your bulb. And then, you know, put it up in there and get on all -- all fours. And, you know, this way or this way, whichever comfortable, squirt it up in there. Then go down on your hand -- face on your hands and roll your stomach like a belly dancer. And get it to move up the descending colon. Do that for about three, four minutes. Then roll on your right side, lift your left leg, and roll your stomach again. And get it to move from the -- at descending colon over the transverse and down the ascending colon. So what's going to happen? Your E. coli and colon bacteria are going to be ecstatic. And the first time they've had fresh raw fats in their whole life. You think they're going to worry about all that food that's in that sigmoid colon and holding on to it? They're going to let it go. The body's going to let it go. And then all night you'll be feeding your brain a nervous system like it's never been fed before. Because it's actually going to have fresh, pure, wholesome fat that it will never have had. It's going to be impossible to be depressed if you do that. You don't get the protein from it though. I've tried this though. Inserting an egg in the bowel usually causes diarrhea. So that didn't work. Maybe you took a teaspoon of the egg white and a teaspoon of the egg yolk. You don't need the egg yolk except there are a lot of vitamins in the egg yolk that are only in the egg yolk. It's got B12.  It has every vitamin on the planet. Egg has everything except the nutrients to allow cells to divide fast. Only meat has that. But eggs can help regenerate and bring back to life any cell that's already alive. But meat, eating raw meat will actually cause cells to divide faster. 

So you become more alive as you're eating raw meat. No other food does that in the human body in my experiment. I mean you have all these David Wolfe and all these people saying we've got the superfoods. Well you know what the superfoods that David really eats? Raw milk and raw meat. I told him, well in 1998 when he got a raw diet I said David, you've only been eating raw foods for a little while. Seven years you're going to hit a wall and it's not going to do it for you. You don't have the system of the eight people that I knew that could be vegetarians almost their whole life. You aren't built that way. And oh you don't know what you're talking about. So what happened seven years I get a report from a couple that works for him. He started drinking raw milk and we're not allowed to tell anybody because we have our contracts. We can never tell. He devolved anything about David's life. Nobody can say they're contracted to that. Why would they contract? Why would he have them contracted to that? Two years ago there was a German couple that worked for him for a year. They came out to my workshop. They heard about me through him. What he was doing. He started eating raw meat. So now you see him. You see he's all plump and all white. You know he used to be all sunburned and all shriveled and dry. Now he's all full and white and plump. Like I like people to be. So he's eating all this raw dairy and raw meat and not telling us all. David Wolfe. 

Q: David Wolfe. 

Q: He's a vegetarian, raw food person. 

Q: Oh that's the guy that all the Dousers are going to hear rather than coming to you. Wow. 

A: He makes about 30 million a year selling his superfoods. 30 million a year with superfoods. 30 million a year. With the superfoods. See he has everybody believing these superfoods. You won't have to eat meat. You won't have to eat dairy and yet that's what he eats now. To me it's a sad reflection on his spirituality. He thinks he's doing good by getting people, even though it's a bad raw diet, he thinks it's good by getting people at least on a raw diet. But it causes other complications. They're just as bad as eating a cooked diet. Descend great your bones. Deteriorate your spinal cord. Rot your teeth out of your mouth. All of that. And he knows it doesn't work. Now it's all about the money. So, if you understand that bacteria is the main digester in your body and you realize what the food is we absorb, you'll get rid of any squeaminess that you have. We basically eat the feces, the shit, the urine, and the sweat of bacteria. They eat the foods that we eat, their excrement, their secretions are our food. It gets absorbed into the lacteal system through the intestines. The lacteal system is a web network, a very complex web network, where every food that you eat, even if it's blueberries or blackberries, gets inferred into milk. It's exactly like this. Milk. Just off-white milk. I mean, off-white. That's why they call it the lacteal system. No matter what color it is you eat, it will turn into milk. Again, why women produce, mammals produce milk. It's the same thing like the body creates in the digestive tract. Well, the mammary glands create it from the lacteals absorb into the food and goes there and it's purely milk. You don't create the milk in your breast. That's a fallacy. You absorb it and it's pulled up into the breast from the lacteal system. So this is not a milk producer. It's a milk gatherer. It pulls the lacteal together from the foods that you eat, from the secretions of the bacteria, and just holds it there to nurse the baby. So milk, it's a fallacy that you produce milk. It's drawn in from what you eat and it's held there in the mammary glands for secretion. If you really understood everything about the body, an animal's body, you wouldn't listen to anything the pharmaceutical industry and medical industry have to say about the body because it's all wrong. 

It's meant for you to lack trust in your body and get you to believe your body is always attacking itself. And you have to control the body attacking itself and you have to protect your body from itself. That's absolute crap. If that were true, we'd all be dead many, many thousands of millions of years ago. So our food is urine, feces, and sweat of bacteria. Guess you won't be squeamish anymore. And when you discharge, your waste products, sweat, urine, and feces, it's not supposed to be toxic. It's just supposed to be, "Okay, I've had these dead cells. I've got to get rid of this waste." What will break down and digest that waste? There are insects and ground organisms that digest that waste, right? So we just put it into the earth and give it to some creature that does eat it. So it breaks down. So their secretions are not supposed to be toxic. They're to feed other organisms in nature, to go back as fertilizer into the ground, to help plants grow. So it's a big ecological cycle. But because we put 60,000 chemicals in food and we take all these medications and injections, our waste products are now toxic and will damage creatures, will damage our environment. But it's not supposed to be that way. There are tribes which eat fecal matter from vegetarians because they don't have, from herbivores, because they don't have money. They're just serfs or slaves working on farms where they have no access to their own proteins. They don't have chickens or anything like that. It's like in North Africa. The British government and the Queen and all of our peanut farms have destroyed the land. It only takes ten years of growing peanuts to completely devastate a land where you can't grow anything in it. And they know this and they keep doing it. And they promise these tribes, "Oh, you'll get instead of chicken every three chickens a week, you'll be able to have a chicken every day." And that's what they tell these people. And then when ten years is over, they're not even able to have one chicken. Because the lands won't support anything. They won't grow an animal, they won't grow a plant, they won't grow anything. That's what happens when we use chemicals in the body. We discard it when it starts killing things rather than helping them. 

They were eating feces from cattle as their protein. Why? Because when it goes through herbivore, the food goes through an herbivore, if it's fresh grass, fresh leaves, they will digest anywhere from 52% to 67% of the food. If it's dried hay, they will digest 25% to 52%. That's a lot of waste product that's coming out. But it's predigested for people because it takes 24 hours to go through our system. It takes 48 to go through an herbivore. They have twice the digestive tract. They have 60,000 times the more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule. So if they've done that to a lot of that food, but it hasn't been in their system long enough because it's not made to be there longer, then when they discard it, it's like yogurt or kefir. Other animals eat it, including humans, and guess what? They get to be partial vegetarians because now they're eating predigested vegetable matter and able to break it down and utilize it because it's already been in through a 48-hour process in an herbivore, not a great tasty smelling diet unless you like fecal matter, buffalo fecal matter. But that's what it is. And when you eat that fecal matter, it just tastes like overcooked vegetables, which make me vomit. So I certainly can't eat feces. I mean, I've done it to improve my health, but it's not something I want to base my diet on. Even... Unless I were starving, I would do it, absolutely. I've seen what it does to people. It makes them incredibly healthy and strong. The first time I saw it was on National Geographic. It was on a Disney program produced by National Geographic in the late, early '70s. And it was the only time it ever aired. It only aired one time. And this was in Georgia, Russia, and they had the close-up on this woman's face with these big, beautiful blue eyes and black hair and beautiful dark red, brownish skin. And you see her, you know, little bit of brown on her lips and pull back and her hands got this, it looks like chocolate. There's maybe some green cast to it. And pull back farther and there's this buffalo water, buffalo tail, swishing in the background. You pull away and there she is, a diminutive woman, probably 5'1".  In front of this big cow patty, about this big, mushy still, and she's eating from it. It's healthy as can be. 

And these people averaged 132 years old. They, in National Geographic Magazine, did an article and only published once and almost all of the issues are off, destroyed. You can't even find one. I think it was February, between February and June of 1971 issue. And they interview a couple that had been married for 128 years. Can you imagine being married with somebody 5 years, 128, and still adoring each other? Another couple was 112 or 113 years old, somewhere around there, another couple, 90 years. Man that was 128 years old, out riding the horse, bringing the cattle in. That's health. They don't want you to know about it. So they wipe it out of the records. 

Q: But they're doing it in cults, actually. 

A: Yeah. 

Q: That just went on in my head. They're doing lots of raw meat. 

A: Well, I met a tribe in the Philippines. Three years ago, I was going to the Philippines for the first time, because I heard, you know, they have 7,107 islands. And only half of them have ever seen a white man. So I wanted to get off to these remote islands and see what people were eating. They knew that they were eating very primitively. They didn't have motors, they didn't have machines. All they had was their primitive tools. So I was on Mindanao at this time. I knew there were some in Luzon, but I knew they had been visited by various people. There was a filming crew that was with those films that are just almost all pictures and music. [unintelligible] does music for them, like Baraka. And another film, I forgot what it was called. Anyway, I know the producer of those shows. And he was there in Luzon, and I said, "Let him have those. I'll go to Mindanao." And so I went to Mindanao to look around there, and the government would not give me a permit. I was on their ass like a pocket for 3 weeks. I said, "Listen, I'm just a nutritionist, PhD. I just want to study. I'm not going to take any pictures. I just want to see what they eat. I want to observe them. I'm not going to infiltrate them. I'm not going to tell them to eat this. I'm not going to tell them to eat anything. I just want to observe what they do. They still wouldn't do it. No, they're cannibals. They'll eat you." They were telling me that if it were real, that it was bullshit. I knew that it was only happening on the islands farther down like Borneo, places like that. Maybe you still have some of the tribes back in the woods doing that. But not here in the Philippines, I didn't believe it anyway. It could have been pretty close to each other. I thought about maybe, then maybe, maybe, maybe after I thought about it for a while. But I still wanted to go there. I swam with alligators because I would rather die than not swim in this lake. I swam with them every day for 18 months and never got bit once. I mean, first time, that was scary. I went into the lake and all these alligators on the side came in with me. At the same time, they were anywhere from 9 feet to 14 feet. They would come up, you know, their eyeballs and their nose. That's all you see. 

All of a sudden, they got certain dents. They would go under and you say, "Where did they go?" And I would say, "Well, if I die, I die. This feels good." It was, you know, Jekyll Island, Georgia. Sun felt good. It was warm water. It was all full of algae. And I could drink water because I didn't drink any water. It was full of algae. And, you know, I had a good time. It didn't bite me once. They would go under 20 feet from me. Then it got to be 10 feet. And then one female, she would go along with, after about six months, she would come up and swim alongside me. We'd go across the lake, the lake. The longest part of the lake was more narrow and longer. And she would go back and forth with me three times and then she would stop. And that went on for a year. So, you know, I have very little fear. So, I wanted to see these tribes. I wanted to see how they were. Because there are very few remote tribes anymore. And the Amazon jungle is just a little... You can get lost there. And I didn't want to get lost. I keep my bearings pretty well on the islands. You know, even if they're 100 miles wide, I can still find my way. So, they refused to let me go. After three weeks, they even banned the called budget rental car. And said, "You can't even rent." They said, "You cannot rent a vehicle to this person." Because I was just going to go get a four-wheel drive and go do it myself. You know, go into remote areas. So, I went to the budget and I said, "What do you mean you don't want to rent?" And I got a credit card over. It had been renting to me for years. Well, we can't. The government said, "What do you mean the government said you can't rent me a vehicle?" No, because you've threatened to go into areas where you can get killed. And we can't do that with our cars. We can't take that risk. So, I was really furious. I mean, I was fuming. So, I went to the spa to get a massage. And it was a regular kind of, you know, doctor spa where they do dermatological stuff. It was in a mall.

So, I asked how much, you know, do they do massages and how much and stuff like that? What kind of massages? And what do they do with my coconut cream? So, oh yes, everything. And the girl receptionist sitting behind was pretty dark skinned. Not black, but very dark skinned. Filipina. And she had a baby and it cribbed behind her. White as a ghost. She was like white as your shirt. She's dark. I looked down on the desk and she has a picture of her husband and baby together. He's black. I mean, not that black, but pretty close. Black. And here's this white baby. I thought, "Well, she's been fooling around." And no, the genetic thing, you know, because I asked. I said, "Is that your husband's baby?" She said, "Yeah, we had a test and I said, 'It's anemic. It barely is breathing. What are you feeding that poor baby?'" And she said, "Oh, the hospital told us, the doctors at the hospital told us to feed it powdered milk in boiling water." In Pottengers work with animals and Howells work with animals, they found that the worst diseases were created by powdered milk. All of the extreme chronic serious diseases were created by powdered milk. So I explained to her, "You can believe the doctors at the hospital would tell her that." I said, "I'll prove it to you." So I went to an island off of Mindanao where I had rented a house. It was $200 a month, but it got me a four bedroom house on the beach of an island. Can you imagine that? Four bedroom house on an island, $200 a month. So I made a connection with a dairy that happened to be on the island. So I was able to get my raw milk there warm every day. So I got her five liters, five or six liters, took them back, took the ferry across over there, took them to the spa at the mall and gave them to her. And I said, "You feed your baby this. You'll see the difference." Three days the baby was dark. Making noise, moving around, kicking, moving and everything. The grandfather was so happy he had to meet me. 

So I said, "I'll be in for a massage in another day or so." But she said, "No, please wait. You have to have a massage with me. My father's coming from work, so he just wants to meet you." And he thanked me and thanked me. He was great. Another great experience. And he said, "If there's anything I can do for you, let me know." And I said, "Well, I'm trying to get to a remote tribe." And he said, "I'm from a remote tribe. I left it 30 years ago and I work for the government as a layperson between the government and tribes." He said, "I'll get you a permit." They wouldn't even let him get one for me. 

Q: From the Mindanao.  

A: Right. Well, the islands off of Mindanao. Outside of Mindanao. Where they hadn't seen white people. Because I wanted to go where no white people, they didn't have any machines or any kind of mechanical, industrial society except for their own making of tools. Primitive making. He didn't call me, you know, went by and went to the spa and said, "What's going on?" He said, "They wouldn't let me give you a permit. They wouldn't let me issue a permit for you." And he said, "I'm taking you anyway. I just had to arrange it." So he had friend with a four-wheel drive. All terrain four-wheel drive. So we spent a day going four-wheeling to one particular peninsula from Mindanao. It was pretty remote. So it took us about 16 hours to drive there and I slept on the beach. They slept. They wouldn't sleep. They slept. They kept awake sitting around me, sleeping. I was afraid I was going to get hurt. I'd been living outdoors so much all night. I lived off my bicycle in the Yucatan, everywhere in the jungles. And they were worried about me. It was raining and they thought they came over and said, "Do you like that? I like the rain. It's a warm rain." They weren't used to a civilized man living like a primitive. So they, you know, in cycles, stayed awake and protected me through the night from who knows what. So then the next day we took a boat, a whole day on a boat, 10 hours on the boat. Some of it rowing, actually had to row through certain areas. And then a whole day swimming. We swam over a mile to get to this island. And we had picked his cousin up on the way who had left the tribe only seven years before. So he still was very in touch with them and had visited twice in that seven years. So we got to the island and of course, you know, I had to vegetate because this is my exercise normally on my computer. You know, I don't walk, I don't do anything. I carry my groceries once a week and that's my exercise. Or I stand up and do this, you know, 15 times a year. You know, that's my exercise. 

So I was pretty wiped out after a day of swimming. And, you know, I floated and went like this a lot on my back. My arms weren't used to it. So, but we got there. It was probably about mile and a quarter of swimming. And got to the island. I slept most of that day and night, just rarer for me because I only slept about two and a half to four hours a day. And then they took me to the tribes. When they got to the tribes, the elders would not let me... They didn't want everybody seeing a white man. But some of the tribe members who had been out and gone to the inland and seen civilization as it was and came back to the tribe, they're not allowed to talk about civilization. So they allowed those people to come out and talk with me. I didn't speak the language. So the language had to be interpreted from English to Tagalog, which is the main language in the Philippines, and then to the native of that island. So it was a while getting all this through. And I said, okay, I'm basically here because I want to know what you guys eat and how you guys live. So what do you eat? Coconut and fish. And I said, that is it, coconut and fish. Yeah. Once in a while we eat a banana or mango. And maybe once every few months we'll get a wild pig. And I said, okay, how do you prepare these foods? What do you mean prepare? What do you do to the foods before you eat them? Nothing. You just eat them raw. You don't do anything. They just eat them raw. So they eat, their diet is two foods basically. Raw fish and raw coconut. And they eat the meat, the mature meat. The men will eat about one whole coconut a day and the women eat about a half a coconut. The rest of their diet is one to two pounds of fish fresh raw daily. And they're all thick and full and strong. You know, when I eat fish I get hungry in a flash. And I expected anybody who eats fish to be really skinny. But they weren't. These were huge, thick muscled people. 

And then I had to say, where's my mind? That's why I'm just going off of my own experience. I get hungry. That could be because of the vagotomy, it could be because of the way I process my food. But take a look at the Maasai. They live on nothing but milk and red meat. And they're skinny and tall. Tallest skinnies tribe in the world. And you know, like eight foot two inches. A couple of them have been up to nine feet. The guy who played Harry and Anderson and also the alien in the predator. Kevin Peter Hall was a friend of mine. I hired him when I worked at a health food store. Because he walked in the door and he had to go like this. And the door was seven feet. He had to been down to walk in. And we had in our aisles, we had all these plants between the aisles. So we had to put up a ladder once a week, pull down all of the plants that were hanging, put them in the back room, water them and then put them back up. So I hired this guy right away because he could just go take them off. Then he watered them to put them back up. And that was Kevin Peter Hall from the Maasai tribe. And tall and strong. He and his family were painters in this country, I mean in America. And they never used ladders. They didn't need ladders. And he was the shortest one in his family. And he was seven three. Seven foot three inches. Anyway, he was from a tribe that eats red meat and dairy, raw dairy, raw red meat. And blood three months a year because the calves are suckling so they can't get all the milk that they want. So they bleed the bulls. They take a bamboo shoot about this long, cut a long, you know, make a long cut into it. They have a huge sling shot made out of actual rubber from the rubber trees there. And they take that long sling shot, the base of the sling shot is like this. And the arms of it, horseshoe is like this. And they take that thing and they shoot that bamboo shoot right into the jugular vein of the bowl. And you know, I saw it. And the bull goes right back to grazing. It was just like a mosquito bite. And then they cork it and then they take a bladder sack from a cow. It's pretty big like this. Fill it with half milk and then they bleed the bowl. So it's half blood, half milk. And they shake it up and they drink more of that. 

Because normally they drink about, each member drinks about a gallon of milk a day. And 30 to 35 percent of their diet is raw meat. The healthiest, strongest, before the 12 year drought. Now the 12 year drought has decimated their cattle. Now they're accepting, you know, commercial food, cereals, powdered milk, all stuff like that. But they were considered the smartest, happiest, strongest, most intelligent tribe in the world. And they no fruit there. No fruit. The Filipino tribe, two foods, it shoots the hell out of the USDA's food pyramid, doesn't it? You got to have starches, you got to have this, you got to have that. That's to feed the agricultural industry. Not to feed us properly. So in the Fulani tribe, they ate 90 percent raw milk and 10 percent, less than 10 percent, 5 percent cooked meat. They cooked meat that they could at very low temperatures, 5 feet under the ground. Very low temperature. Very slowly. And they could control the fire to be very low. Heat deep under the ground. They would do it that way. And they were thicker and fuller, because they lived mainly on the milk. And they were broad. 

Q: Does it matter what our ancestors kind of ate? Or like our, because if they ate a different diet, aren't we used to that? 

A: No, no, no. That's a fallacy. Nothing to do with all that. Any human can eat that diet. Without any problem. All of that is to trap you into thinking that you need a certain kind of food in multiple foods. It's nonsense. 

Q: So the blood type thing is... 

A: Nonsense. I've had over 100 people come to me from deodamas that were type A's and not supposed to eat red meat. And they were anemic. Two of them were leukemic from doing his diet. I put them on red meat. Everyone responded. We're talking about 102 people. So nonsense. Chemistry nonsense. It's all to confuse you. So, remember, our food comes from the waste. The waste of bacteria, their waste is our food. So nothing to be squeamish about anymore. Now let's take a look at the glandular system. 

Q: [unintelligible] 

A: Oh yes, let's do it. See, I've been carried away. Somebody watched the clock again. 

[break]
 
A: So the glandular system, endocrine glands first. Endocrine glands means the glands that secrete hormones directly into the blood. Pituitary, pineal, thyroid, parathyroid, thymus, adrenal glands, and testes. Or testes and gonads, any of the gonads, ovaries. Dump hormones right into the blood. So it's the top of the pituitary. Now the pituitary secrete hormones that help growth. Also speeds up healing, where a lot of cells were massively destroyed. It helps cells divide rapidly, more rapidly than normal. The pineal gland is supposed to be the seat of consciousness. It's where we're supposed to chemically be linked with our dream state, and then this state, and bounce back and forth. And it helps create the chemicals that turn a dream into something that we can remember, that is identified even though it could be completely bizarre, and outside of this physical experience on this plane, unrelatable in normal terms to what we do on this planet. So you can't remember those dreams without a chemical change, and a perspective on it. That's what is claimed, there's no way to prove it, that I know of yet. So we'll just leave that one in theory land. In the pituitary, why would a body, if it's being fed healthy, need a growth hormone? If your cells are naturally dividing properly. When people eat poorly, of course they don't produce hormones, they don't divide cells properly. So in an emergency situation, let's say there's a forest fire, that went 30, 40 miles. There would be humans and animals that would not have their normal food, available for months or even years, because that part of the forest is destroyed. You've lost squirrels, you've lost the pigs, you've lost everything that would feed a human, and those animals, also their food chain is gone, burned, destroyed. In a situation like that, we'd say the human is eating, you know, burned leaves, or eating grass, which isn't normal, not going to get enough protein and fats from that. So how is a baby going to grow during a diet like that for one or two years? Or until they go somewhere, they travel somewhere, to where there is food still available that's on their normal diet. 

The pituitary will secrete hormones that, based on, it doesn't matter what diet, will allow rapid cellular production. That doesn't mean the cells are going to be healthy, but it allows for rapid cellular production and growth. Always the cells will be healthy according to the diet. So we go down to the thyroid gland. Now here's the most unusual place in the body. We've got left thyroid, we have the right thyroid, parathyroid, parathyroid, parathyroid, parathyroid. We have five backups for one gland. What is so important in the human body that you have five backups for one gland? The heart and the lungs. If you don't breathe, you don't live, if your heart doesn't beat, you don't live. Absolutely without a doubt. So, you know, the pharmaceutical industry traps people with their vanity into believing bullshit. They say, "Oh, it controls hair growth, if your hair's not growing, you have to take thyroxins." If you're fat, your thyroid isn't working, you have to take these. If you're skinny, your thyroid isn't working, you need to take this, for this, in this quantity. It's a racket. When I was proving what the thyroid did, I thought, you know, the only thing that's that important are the lungs and heart. How can I prove that it does? I said, "Well, I have to knock somebody out, punch him in the stomach, stop breathing or the heart." My brother used to do that to me three or four days a week, and I would actually black out because I'd stopped breathing, and my heart stopped pumping. I mean, he would come up and sucker punch me so hard right in the gut, right in the diaphragm. And I'd just pass out. After, you know, two minutes of trying to breathe, nothing would happen. I couldn't get any air. And my heart would stop and I'd black out. So I said, "I need to get a coach on a football team to let me on the field once these guys get hit." So I spent a season, you know, a college football team out on the field with five hypodermics. One for each minute. If the guy doesn't wake up after six minutes, he's dead. So I'd need just five. So I waited for, you know, five or six or ten guys to hit. You know, the quarterback or, you know, an end or somebody that has the ball and knock them out. 

So there were three knockouts that year that lasted about five minutes before they revived. And I, everybody agreed that I would only take, you know, a quarter of a centimeter of, I mean, quarter of a CC. I mean, of blood in each hypodermic. Because when they take those three whole vials out of your body to do tests, they use that much of each one. And throw the rest away. But it's in case the lab makes a mistake and has to redo it. Redo it fifty times? It's all nonsense. It's to make you think that they have to go through a hell of a lot with a lot of your fluids to go through it. And I've been in a laboratory that used this lot to do a test. Every test. That much. So all you would do is you're going to have eight tests done, you would need about half a teaspoon. So in the future, if you go and lab work done, for whatever reason I don't know, don't let them take much blood. Let them have just a little bit and two, you know, two vials. No, how do you know? Have you been into a laboratory? Tell the doctor. Do you know? The nurse says no. Do you know? Have you been into a laboratory? Well, I know somebody who works in a laboratory that's all they use. Per test. So don't let them take that much blood from you if you're going to do their tests anyway. Their measurements are all rigged to get you to take medication. Just like going after your vanity, hair loss and weight gain, weight loss. With the thyroid, that's all nonsense. So each time one of these guys got hit, I took every minute I would take just a quarter of a teaspoon of blood. And I had it analyzed for thyroxin levels. Each minute that the person was in breathing and the heart wasn't beating, the thyroxin was doubled. Then at the fourth or fifth minute, all of a sudden it was like, "Ah, ah, ah!" It was just working. And it was the thyroxins building up to produce that trauma to bring the breathing and the heartbeat, to return it. And it was normal. And that was the only hormone that changed. That was the only blood change, chemistry change, besides a low oxygen level, of course. So these glands, all six of them here in the thyroid gland, are for the heart and lung. Emergency purposes again. 

Then we go down to, now I have to count the pancreas as being an endocrine gland as well as a normal gland because it makes insulin that goes right into the blood. Now, we'll get into the pancreas later because I'm not going to count as just an endocrine gland. Because it's majorly not an endocrine gland. It's only something we developed. And then we go to the adrenal glands. And what are the adrenal glands for? Fight or flight? If you're eating healthy food, healthy fats, you wouldn't need adrenaline to give you energy. But since you're so toxic and ill and your blood is so labored on distributing nutrients to cells in the body, and your lymphatic system is so jammed, you need energy to do it. So your body is pumping adrenaline into your system as an emergency circumstance. Then you have the gonads. 

Q: So the adrenals have to do with not having enough fat? 

A: Not having proper kinds of fat to utilize them to generate energy. Or your red blood cells aren't healthy enough to bring in the oxygen to alter the fat into energy. So the body will use adrenaline to give you a high and a boost. What happens when people become adrenal fatigued? All of a sudden they can't even function at all. Because the body is relying upon that hormone to function because they're not eating properly. They're not digesting properly. They're not doing anything properly. And they were living off of their adrenal production, the adrenal production. Now they can't anymore. Even the adrenal glands are shot. So the gonads, therefore the only thing we know is absolutely for pleasure and procreation. You can say procreation is an emergency situation, or we become extinct. So to me all of the endocrine glands are for emergency purposes only. When I tested healthy animals for hormonal levels, only trace amounts. Except when they were being run down by another animal then there was high adrenaline. Sometimes high testosterone. Or when two got together and got sexually excited then there was testosterone and a lot of estrogen. And that's for procreation. Emergency of extinction so to speak. I'm stretching that one of course. You know, growth only times I found is when you feed dogs and cats. You look at their offspring, their kittens and pups, will be high in pituitary hormone. When they're fed kibble and canned and garbage food. When they're fed raw meats, with raw bone and raw milk, that pituitary hormone does not exist. Even in trace amounts. In dogs and cats. So endocrine glands are for emergency purposes only. Now let's go over the other glands. I mean, yeah, the other glands and organs. Start with the brain. We know the brain keeps the body in touch with the brain. The brain touch with the body so you can do things like I'm doing. You know, my body, my brain talks to you through my body. And I use my body to do that express with move the lips, all brain activity. But it's natural. It's not something I have to think... I have to open my mouth this loud, this wide for the word "the". And for "whey", I open a little wider and a little farther back in the throat and hit a certain pitch. I don't have to do all that. Bacteria does all of that. And it's like a chain reaction. The bacteria already knows all automatically what to do. Its way of thinking is fast compared to us. 

So let's say they're thinking, oh this and this and this. For us, that's less than a split second. So they are doing all of it for us in a split second. And it comes out of us easily and naturally. It didn't happen when I had autism, when I had brain damage. And brain congestion from the mercury, formaldehyde, ether and detergent from that tetanus shot. It jammed that center up. So what did it do? It destroyed the bacteria in that area of my brain. What do you think mercurochrome and methylate are? Those are antiseptics, right? Mercurochrome and methylate are liquid mercury. Liquid mercury. You're putting liquid mercury on something to poison the bacteria in the area you will scar from it. Because you killed the cells. You killed the body's ability to heal naturally. And plus you poisoned yourself by putting mercury into the body. Because it will absorb into the body. Now if you want to go online and see what mercury does to the neurological system. Put in Alberta University, mercury neurons. And you come up with a video that they show you when you introduce mercury into a Petri dish of growing neurons. That just all of a sudden just dissolves them. Almost instantly. And you can see them over a whole 2 minutes fast motion growing. Same time speed. All of that growth that took 24-48 hours has now gone in seconds. From putting mercury in the Petri dish. Not only that. You see that. Let's say the fibril is this big. And the actin on the fibril is this big. It's got a tentacle that comes out. And this is the sensory end. And let's say it's this big right here. They drop the mercury in at that wall. That far away from all of the neurons. And it disintegrates them from that distance. And you see it right there in the Petri dish. You see where the drop of mercury falls into the Petri dish. Away from the neurons. And it automatically, as soon as it touches the Petri dish, they start disappearing dissolving. Mercury is a very toxic substance. And they're injecting that into any time you have any kind of an injection. Almost any type of injection. Not only vaccines. They put it in almost every one of them. As they preserve the tail. 

Preserve what? Well, with mercury in it, there's no bacteria that can live in the vaccine. So that's good. That's their thinking. And people accept it. Well, bacteria causes disease. The germ theory, of course. Nonsense. Bacteria theory has never been proved. And it's been disproved thousands of times. Every time you drink raw milk and eat raw meat, especially rotten. And you don't get sick. And don't get a disease. And you get healthier, complete evidence that it's nonsense. But people believe it every day. And they go and fear from it. And that's where they catch you. They put you in fear and terror. And they get your brain to just melt and say, "I guess it's true. I guess I could do what the doctor says." And people just become dumb. Stupid. And they make very stupid decisions. They can, with fear, they can wipe out your logic and sensibility. I'm here in this workshop to dispel all that, so you're never going to fear again. Understand how the body works and you take care of it. You nurture it, you don't attack it. So, we go from the brain down to the tonsils. Now, the tonsils are identical to the lymphatic system. They are just very large lymph glands. And they protect your brain from any contamination in the food that you're chewing. Now, when did tonsillitis start hitting the medical market? 

Q: I know. Mine were taken out. It was widespread in the '50s. 

A: The '50s. What happened before that? 

Q: I don't know. 

A: World War II. What happened in World War II? What was the king and queen of England and all the messages on the news, TV and all that, all the radio? Support your troops, eat canned foods. What the frick did eating canned foods have to do with the troops? Well, they're out there eating canned foods and rations. So, what does me having to eat garbage food have to do with them eating garbage food? So, I'm going to make myself sick? That was the consciousness. And the king and queen of England owned 70% of all food production in the world. And they were the ones that started World War II to bring in food processing. Very long shelf lives. Because they knew that in their manufacturing and their ways at that time, more than 30% of their food had a shelf life and they lost 30% of their food. They knew that they had to trap people in to buying canned foods. Two ways. Convenience and support your troops. So, king and queen of England helped create World War II. Funded, helped fund it. Along with the Catholic Church and the Bush family in the United States. Prescott Bush ran a bank that was funding, here in America, that was funding Hitler. Attorney General found out about it. Seized all the assets of that bank. Prescott Bush went bananas and said, "Never gonna happen again, I will run this country." In 30 years, his son was a voted president. His son was running CIA for 10 years. In the CIA for 30 years. Still a CIA agent. And so was George Bush Jr. They just do the, you know, do all the acts, puppet acts that they're told to do. So, king and queen of England, owned 35% of the land mass in the world. The wealthiest family. Yet they say in their newspapers that they own, that the richest monarch in the world is the monarch of Thailand. He is worth $30 billion. That isn't even a speck with the king and queen of England own, that family. They own 90 times that. They own trillions and trillions of dollars worth of land and food product. They owned almost all the salt production in the world. 

Gandhi put a halt to that in '47. You know, to go out and make your own salt from the ocean in India was a death sentence. You died. If you took the king and queen, king and queen owned all the salt in the ocean. That was the way it was. If you went out and made your own salt from the ocean, you were stealing the king and queen's property. And it was death. And Gandhi went out there in 1947, had millions of people on the beaches making their own salt. Many deaths, many people were beaten to death for doing it. But the world was watching. And finally, the king and queen of England had to do an under door policy. Well, we'll let them give, we'll let them think we're giving them their independence. But we'll own anything, everything anyway. So they still have the production. So they'll own the salt production in there. They just don't let the little guy, the little pauper who doesn't buy it, they let him make it. But they still own the salt mines. The salt production pools and areas in India. So anyway, the canned food, what did it do? What did it have in it? Tin, mercury, thallium, all the stuff that was getting into the canned food. The tonsils were trying to prevent those potent poisons to get into the brain. So all of a sudden we had these tonsils that were full of this metal and these chemicals, the chlorine and the formaldehyde that they were using in the food as a preservative. They had something like, you know, 10,000 chemicals at that time. Now we have 60,000 that go into food. So the tonsils were exploding with toxins, dissolving, disintegrating. Kids were constantly getting sore throats, constantly pussing out the mouth from it. What else happened in that time? Polio. Polio. What is polio? Polio is metal contamination of the spinal cord. Also the result of canned food, the metal getting in the system, getting in the spinal cord. Metal dissolves the spinal cord tissue. You get polio, poliomyelitis is the way that the body cleans the metals out and the dead spinal cord tissue. Yet they're saying the polio is the disease, causes the disease. Now it's secure. 

Q: Why did kids cripple them? I've had crippled kids all around me because of polio. 

A: The canned food was poisoning their spinal cord. 

Q: It was from the food, not the polio. 

A: Was the canned food, it wasn't poliomyelitis. It was the canned food deteriorating the spinal cord. Then they would go and inject you with antibiotics and put you in a hot chamber. And what would happen? You start dissolving your neurological tissue more. So you have all these people crippled going around with different types of paralysis, it's been about where that damage was done in their spinal cord. 

Q: Is that rebuildable, people who've had that? 

A: Yeah. It depends on how much medical treatment they've had for it. Remember my book, when I observed people who had polio, the more myelitis that was active in the body, the more they healed. When they were given antibiotics and it was lowered, they stopped healing. And they would become... They would become paralyzed, become paralyzed. So, again, the cure is the disease that the medical profession is attacking that's saying causes a disease. It is not. It is industrial chemicals that always cause a disease. Even cooking food is an industrial process. It alters the chemistry of your food and produces 32 toxins, which I named in the last part of the recipe book. I named all 32 of them. The three most notorious are acknowledged being heterocyclic amines, lipid peroxides, and acrylamides. Acrylamides is the most known one. So all disease comes from industrial chemicals. So, the canned food industry and the processed food industry created all the tonsillitis and the spinal degeneration polio. So, of course, in the 60s and the late 50s, King, Queen were aware of it and all their technicians were aware of it. So what did they do? They invented plastic, coated the cans with plastic. So, you got rid of the metal poisoning, but what do you have now?  You have phthalates and BPAs. What do they do? They alter the chemistry in the body. They still act like a fat, but when they're used as a fat to make hormones, they make the opposite of what they're supposed to make. So if you're supposed to make testosterone, you make estrogen. When you're supposed to make estrogen, you make testosterone. So women become men and men become women. So now we have this very little change between men and women in civilized cultures that are subjected to plastic molecules. So it would be like frogs. It would be both, man and female. Like some worms. They don't need to have sex with anybody else. They can breed on their own.

So then we go down to the thymus, which I didn't talk about before. The thymus is right here. Now they say, the doctors, medical professors say, the thymus protects the lungs and the heart. No proof, no evidence of that. I prove that the thyroid does, lungs and heart. But whenever the stomach is poisoned by something or goes through an inundation of chemical toxicity where the body is storing toxins like from a vaccine or injections into the stomach lining, the thymus sends out all of its hormones like white blood cells, fatty cells going around and binding with those poisons. So the thymus protects the stomach and digestion. It doesn't have anything to do with the heart or lungs, even though it's right at the heart. And then we look at the liver. The liver is an unusual organ. It has one job in the body, to produce bile to digest fats. It's the only job. Yeah, what is it doing today because it's so toxic? The body's storing toxins in it, like it stores toxins everywhere else in the body. But the body knows that that bile is going to meet fat in its existence. That's its purpose. So the body starts storing a lot of toxins in the liver and making those toxins, building them into the bile that it makes. Because when it meets with the fat, that fat instead of being used as an energy producer is going to be used to bind to that toxin and pass out of the body. So the body weakens, doesn't have much energy, but yet it's freeing itself of the toxic substance. However, we're not eating the proper fats. If you're not eating the proper fats, what's going to happen? The fats that are toxic are going to receive this toxic substance and not move out of the body. It's going to get clogged in the lymphatic system or in the digestive tract. It's going to get built into the intestinal walls.

Now the stomach lining is the most resilient tissue in the body. It produces hydrochloric acid that can dissolve bone, but yet it doesn't dissolve itself. The next most resilient tissue in the body is the joints, the cartilage. It can also take on a massive amount of toxicity and not be heavily damaged. To give an example of that, if you have leaky gut, let's say Crohn's disease, where you've got leaky gut. In other words, you don't produce a lot of mucus to protect the intestinal walls. And your digestive acids and bacteria begin eating your intestinal walls, and they become thinner and thinner and thinner. Then all of a sudden, if you eat a little too much it's going to tear. Undigested food is going to move into your gut. What's your body going to do with it? It has to dissolve it. The body is incredibly intelligent. So what the body does is it will take it to a joint. Usually the biggest joints, the knees are the biggest in the body. Produce like 50% of the red and white blood cells are produced out of the knees from the bone marrow. Remember, the bone marrow is where the red-white blood cells divide, mature, and once they mature they enter the bloodstream. That can be a 45 to 60 day process. If they're contaminated, if your bone marrow is contaminated, it affects their reproduction or their strength and ability to carry oxygen to other cells in the body. So your blood can be hindered just in their production cycle. If a lot of the toxins go and the bone marrow is like 70 to 80% fat, if you eat bone marrow, it's all fat. Mostly fat. The toxins love fat. Our bodies store toxins and neutralize toxins with fat. So that's why the body is sending toxins to the liver when fats aren't available. So when the bile goes to find its destination, it will be a fat molecule or a fat cell to break it down to become smaller fat molecules to alter it into different cholesterols.

We have 60 varieties of cholesterols. A third of them feed the body, a third of them strengthen and protect the body, and a third of them clean the body. So give energy, protection, energy. I mean energy, protection, and strength. Energy is strength. So energy, strength, protection, and cleansing. Three things. Cholesterols are good. But be on a cholesterol free diet. Don't eat anything with cholesterol. The only thing you can eat with cholesterol are eggs. That's the only thing you can eat with advanced cholesterol. But that cholesterol cleans the body beautifully. If you've read my recipe book, remember that incident there where that doctor, MD called me, said I have an emphysemic patient diagnosed with emphysema seven years ago. She's on her deathbed. She's going to die this weekend. She's been on machines and bedridden for about two years. And I said, well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? And she says, well, I have to protect my practice. My whole family depends upon the livelihood. I said, well, that's your consciousness. What do you mean? She says, well, an MD cannot suggest alternatives until a person has failed with the medical professions, restrictions, and cures, which there are none, methods, treatment methods, for ten years. If they fail for ten years, an MD can suggest alternatives. Or the person is on their deathbed, and they're going to die. There's no question they will die. So I said, well, that's your conscience. So all I can do is suggest that you get 10 to 15 dozen raw eggs, put them at her bed table in the hospital, and tell her to eat one as often as she can, and there's no limit. So this was on a Thursday night, about 9.30 my time, so it must have been at 12.30, 1 o'clock her time, somewhere between 9.30 and 10.30 for me. So it would be between 12.30 and 1.30 her time. So this is a concerned woman, concerned MD. So I get a call on Monday morning, and I knew that she couldn't have got the eggs to her, probably by late Friday. So I said, I don't know if the woman's going to make it. So on Monday morning, I get a call from a raspy-voiced woman, and she says, it worked. What else do I do?

And I said, well, who are you, and what worked? You know, well, you told my doctor to tell me to eat as many eggs, as raw eggs as I could, and it worked. I'm out of bed. I'm off the machines. What else do I do? And I said, well, how many eggs did you eat? She said, I ate 33 on Saturday and 33 on Sunday. And I woke this morning, and I was off the machines. I pulled them away. I was breathing okay. Got out of the bed, and I'm walking around. I dressed myself, and everything is good. And I said, just keep eating the eggs. And eventually, I started eating raw meat from the mall, raw meat, raw milk. So eggs are phenomenal substances that can be digested in 27 minutes. Whenever I have somebody in critical condition, eggs is the main diet. Eggs, eggs, eggs, and there's no limit to it. I've eaten up to 50 in one day and never had a biotin deficiency or any chemistry nonsense that goes out there to scare you from eating these good raw foods. And that's all it is.

Q: So if somebody is in any emergency, kind of life-threatening, eggs?

A: Eggs, eggs, yeah, eggs, eggs, eggs.

Q: Even heart attacks?

A: Pardon?

Q: Heart disease, heart attack?

A: Anything.

Q: Wow.

A: Anything, absolutely anything. Anything. Okay. If you've got dementia, you may want some rotten eggs.

Q: And you don't have to worry that, like, I can just walk in any shop and drink and eat. I don't have to worry about...

A: Of course, you have to know where your eggs, what your eggs were fed and built with in the chicken.

Q: Not any... So it's the organic eggs.

A: Yeah, they should be pastured chickens. Not eating any soy whatsoever. Those are the best, of course.

Q: Because I emailed an egg person who at the party, they don't feed animal by-products to their eggs or whatever. What they say they all do, give them powder.

A: Yeah, but the powder probably has soy in it as a protein. Soy can't be fed to chickens, like I said, any bird. It will kill them if it's raw. So it has to be dissolved in kerosene if it's natural.

Q: But the problem is to get like a good egg, to find like a good egg that's...

A: Well, even a medium good egg will still help, incredibly, raw, medium, you know, medium good.

Q: It will still work for the time of the emergency, right?

A: And that woman had eggs that were fed 25% soy, and she still made it through. Imagine if she had pure best eggs.

Q: Sure.

Q: So farm eggs of the chicken, just eats like regular on the farm, somebody who has like a little...

A: Depends. Your farmers are wanting to produce eggs fast, so they're feeding them meals, commercial meals. You have to find somebody who's not feeding their chickens commercial meals.

Q: Just what they're allowed to eat, like just like...

A: Chickens are vultures. Chickens are...

Q: Grains, worms...

A: Chickens are vultures. They mainly eat rotten meat, they eat dead carcasses, like vultures. If they don't have that, they'll eat bugs. On the farmers that grow my food, and like the Amish in Pennsylvania, all my farmers all over the United States, I tell them to take any food byproduct, you know, when they're butchering, anything that they don't use, guts, intestines, anything, bones, crush them, put them on a pallet, put it out there for the chickens. And every time I go visit, I see a pallet out there, of course in the spring and summer and fall, they'll have maggots growing all over it, so the chickens will be eating the maggots as well as bone fragments and the meat scraps, rotten meat, and they come up and rub up against you like a cat. There's no pecking order, they don't attack each other, because they're getting all the protein they need. I mean, if you've been in a field with regular grain-fed chickens, they're always pecking each other, they have feather problems unless they're giving antibiotics or poisoning them, and of course the body builds those poisons into the feathers, so it doesn't want to get rid of the feathers. It'll hold the feathers, because it's trying to get rid of the toxins, and other certain toxins get rid of the feathers because it damages the follicle, where the feather is produced. So it's a rat race out there with chickens, and there's a pecking order that's tremendous, you know, but when they get exactly everything they want, there's no difference between any of them. They're all happy together. I mean, can you imagine a chicken coming up against you and rubbing you like a cat? It's like, you know, a whole different reality. It's a bizarre reality. I grew up with my grandparents feeding their chickens grains, and there was always a pecking order. But, you know, they would crush bones, though, and feed that to them for minerals, and that was a good thing. So they didn't lose their hair, I mean, their feathers, like a lot of the other chicken farmers do. So they did something right there.

But when I realized the chickens were vultures, because I dropped, you know, some rotten meat that I picked up from a different pasture, and I dropped around the chickens, the chickens went nuts over it. And then they were very calm and happy afterwards. So that's how I realized it, by accident. Everything usually I realized by accident. Like going to kill myself by eating the raw rabbit, you know, did just the opposite. All of the things that I found by going in the opposite direction and stumbling onto the truth. We are trained to be idiots. We are trained to be idiots. We're trained to believe the opposite of reality. And I tell everybody, whether I'm on a radio show, TV, anywhere, anybody says one thing you have to tell people, what would it be? And I all the time say 99 times out of 100, whatever the pharmaceutical and medical industry tell you to do, do the very opposite and you will be right. You'll only be right 1%, wrong 1% of the time. They said really? I said yeah. They said put ice or cold chill something, put heat on it. They tell you not to eat it, you eat it. But they tell you to eat, you don't eat. And really it's true. It's absolutely true. They tell you to take this medication, which is 99% of what they say is take medication. Don't do it. Do the opposite. Don't take it. Find a way to nurture your body rather than attacking it or controlling it with some kind of chemical that isn't healthy for the body. So the liver produces bile to digest fats. Now we have a gallbladder that sits on top of it. Now the gallbladder doesn't produce anything. The gallbladder is a storage for bile. You have enough bile storage to digest 20 pounds of fat. Why the hell do we need to digest 20 pounds of fat? Because when we were out there as hunters, you'd kill an animal and the first thing you ate was fat. Because it went the fastest and every animal was out to get it. So you had to eat it fast. So if you ate 10, 12 pounds of fat in one sitting in a several hour period, what would happen? You'd have vomit and you'd have diarrhea. 

But if you have enough bile, that won't happen. It'll break down the fats. Your body then will make it into various cholesterols and store it if it can't use it all at that time. So it stores the fat on you. Good cholesterols. And they're good cholesterols unless you're eating a fat that is very toxic, like trans-fatty acids, hydrogenated vegetables. Margarine is the biggest of them. Any fried food, any packaged food that's been fried, it's been fried in plastic fats. Period. That's not healthy. It just jams the body up. But that makes you sicker and then they make more money. Because you keep running to them, giving them money on false hope.

Q: But it seems so against... I always believed that people are good, that you have a good heart and you're good people. That whole thing that the government, instead of taking good care of its own people, would take bad care.

A: Like I said earlier, all in government officials, all your congressmen, senators, your prefects here, what do you call them?

Q: Prime minister.

A: Prime ministers. They all have major investment in pharmaceuticals and food production. Their interest is in their profits. Nothing to do with you.

Q: It's hard to believe that now because they already make lots of money.

A: It doesn't matter, they're greedy. They want ten homes, ten swimming pools, ten cars. There's no end to the greed. It's so sad. You and I aren't like that. 99% of the people aren't like that. They are. That 1% that run government and run the world, they wouldn't get into office if they didn't do that. They wouldn't be supported. They wouldn't get the money to run campaigns. Wouldn't happen. Unless you and I send out our money like we do for Ron Paul in our country. They do not want, they ignore Ron Paul like crazy. They ignore him and they don't acknowledge that he's won almost all of the delegates in every state. Now on Friday in California, I mean on next Tuesday in California, we're going to watch him win California. And if he does, that's the end of the road for the Democratic and the Republican Party, because Ron Paul is for the people. He was, when I lobbied for raw milk in 2007 with five and six people, we rented a townhouse in Washington, D.C. We visited the senators and representatives every day for three months. We had pamphlets we had printed. We did my milk report with Dr. Douglas, handed out all the information and talked with 98 senators and representatives, actually met with us out of 535. Ninety-nine percent of them, that means 97 of them, believed that raw milk was dangerous because of the publicity. We had to reeducate them. The other office that we went into, we gave them my milk report and a quick synopsis that said the FDA is lying about raw milk. I put the FDA's, you know, their logo up there and said FDA response. It said response to FDA. So automatically you're thinking this came from the FDA, so I knew I could get people to read it. It said response to FDA, and I put their logo there. So I got a lot of people to read it. But when I went into Ron Paul's office, and he's an MD, he's a doctor, and I walked into his office and I said this is what we need. He said okay, let's write the bill. Not a second beat, he was the only one.

I had 60 of them, well 58, who said that they would sponsor, co-sponsor any bill that if I could get any Senator or Representative to write it, they would co-sponsor it. When I got Ron Paul to write it, we wrote it together, not one of them came forth and co-sponsored it. They're all a fricking bunch of liars. They're just into it for the money. Except Ron Paul. And the only reason he's making it this far is because we're paying for his, and there's millions of people who are sending in money. So, I mean, he's the only person who gained $10 million in one day from individuals. Citizens, not corporations. All the others are fed by corporations. That's the only way we're going to get the change in there. It's the only way we're going to be able to trust people. You get elected. Because you have a conscience. You have a heart. Those people up there don't. They're married to money and power. So, the gallbladder has a lot of bile to handle a way to eat fat fast. A lot of it. If you've had your gallbladder removed, guess what's going to happen if you eat ice cream? You're going to get nausea, you're going to vomit, you're going to have diarrhea. So, you can only eat like an ounce of fat an hour, an ounce of fat every two hours. Because that's all your liver can produce enough to digest about an ounce every one to two hours, depending on how well your liver is. If you still have your gallbladder, then you can pig out on ice cream.

Q: I still have my gallbladder, and I still get these problems.

A: Then your liver isn't forming proper bile. So you have to get your liver well. Then we have the pancreas. Now the pancreas is a phenomenal organ and gland. Four million years ago with Lucy, and then five million years ago with the recent findings of the five million year old humanoids, their pancreas was two and a half times smaller than ours. They did not eat any carbohydrates or fruit. They lived on meat, and some of them lived on meat and dairy. We only have a swollen pancreas because we went to eating grains and high carbohydrate. So over the last about 20,000 years, the pancreas has been swelling to handle carbohydrates, which is not meant to do. The pancreas, what it does is when you eat something, the enzymes send signals to the pancreas. The pancreas analyzes what's in that food, and what to do with it. The pancreas is the architect of the body. It knows how to design fats to be used as energy, how to design end nutrients to be used for reproducing cells, building cells, whether it's bone, heart, blood, cells. The pancreas has to send the plans out, and it has to know how to alter it. Let's say if I'm eating a tomato from this side of the vine, and there's more roots and nutrients in this side, it gets to that tomato. In this side, the roots aren't embedded in as good dirt, as good soil, I'll produce an inferior tomato here. So, the pancreas decides how that will be used. If it's not complete enough, it will be used as energy, as a cleaning substance. If it's a good, strong one, it will be used as a building block as well, to accompany whatever else it is we're trying to eat. Even a grape on the same vine will have different nutrient value, depending on what it's been fed, through the shaft and through the root. So, the pancreas is endowed with that responsibility, to decide how that food will be used, and if there's enzymes and something missing, how to draw it out of somewhere else in the body to supplement it. It sends out little hormones to do that.

Then we have the carbohydrate mania, which causes the pancreas to swell, and have to make all this insulin we never did. So, now there has to be an insulin production to handle, to take this excess sugar, to make it into a storable glycogen. Now, what happens with that storable glycogen? According to Columbia University and New York State, the laboratory in the Millhouse found that the body retains the by-product of glycogen that is built from a carbohydrate as advanced glycation end product. It stores in the body at a rate of 70-90%. That means that every time you eat a carbohydrate, whether it's fruit, whether it's grain, no matter what it is, you will store 70-90% of that by-product in your body. If your body makes the glycogen from pyruvate, which is from protein, like egg white, your body makes a lot of pyruvate from egg white, there's no advanced glycation end product. There's no garbage left that bogs the body down. What happens if the body is bogged down with advanced glycation end product? It's just like carbohydrate that's formed, it's sticky and thick, like syrup, like molasses. So what happens? Those by-products get into the blood, neurological fluid, lymphatic system, cells start sticking together, synapse don't fire properly, you're not thinking properly, you're not functioning properly, you don't have the proper energy, all kinds of problems with those by-products stored. So we were not designed to eat lots of carbohydrates. It starts with the signal in the mouth. We only have the ptyalin enzyme here, only the horse has it, and it's a carbohydrate digester. It's the only place where we find a carbohydrate digester in the body. Is that 5%. That's your clue right there. No more than 5% fruit if you're going to have it of your diet. I recommend a little bit more because people are very toxic and your body can make some very good alcohols with it. As long as you eat it with fat, it will be made into a cleansing substance to clean the body. So you can have more than 5% fat. No more than 10% fruit as long as you're eating enough fat with it. Not an equal amount of fat. By carbohydrate value, you'll be eating more fat than the fruit, than the carbohydrate. So the pancreas has a lot of extra work to do that it doesn't normally do. 

Then we have the spleen right next to the gallbladder. I mean right next to the pancreas. What does the spleen do? The spleen holds red blood cells, sometimes white blood cells. Why does it hold it? Well, let's say you fell out of a tree and you hit a branch in a slitch of jugular vein and you bled three cups of blood. What would happen? You'd be anemic. And if you had big tigers and dogs and cats around, you'd be lunch, dinner, snack, a candy bar or something. Because you wouldn't be able to run, you wouldn't be able to climb a tree. You wouldn't have enough red blood cells to deliver oxygen to all of the muscles that would need to work for you. So as soon as the blood clot area would clot and stop bleeding, what does the pancreas do? I mean, what does the spleen do? It has over, sometimes up to three pints of blood, holding three pints of blood. It puts back into your bloodstream exactly what you lost, unless you bled over, then you're dead. So, you know, an hour later, you can run, you can climb a tree again, that quickly. Without that spleen, that reserve of red blood cells, you wouldn't have that. You'd be dead from one bleed. If it were just a cup, you know, one cup loss of blood and you're weak, you're anemic. Most people just from one to four tablespoons blood loss, they're anemic. That's proof. You wake up in the morning after eight to ten hours sleep and you're groggy and say, why am I sleepy and tired? Because you're anemic. You go five hours without eating, the blood in your, the protein in the blood level drops to zero. So the red blood cells start eating each other. Fasting is a very bad thing to do. Red blood cells eat each other. In an eight to ten hour period, you'll lose one to four tablespoons of red blood cells. That's up to two ounces of red blood cells in a ten hour sleep. No wonder you're anemic when you awaken. And most people go for caffeine or nicotine or theobromine, chocolate, something to give them a boost. That doesn't treat anemia. Eating treats anemia.

I have to suck an egg, folks, I'll show you how to do it. I've got a fat end and a little bit more pointed end. This one is a little funny. It's almost like you can't tell, but I can because this is basically the circumference all over the bottom is rounded, but this usually has a little sharper point on it. But anyway, what you want to do is you want to fracture the integrity of the shell at the fat end. You don't want to break a hole because it will run out. But there's a membrane inside. Everybody's opened an egg and seen the membrane inside that holds the egg so it doesn't touch the shell and protects it. That has to collapse or you're not going to get everything out of the egg shell. So you break it, I break it on my eye tooth. You can take a round surface like this and do it. You see it's fractured without a hole. The membrane is not broken so it's not going to run out. Then on this end, I hit it on the eye tooth downward to make a hole. Now I have a little face there. So now I can suck the egg out of the hole and this membrane will move as I'm sucking it and draw the egg up to the surface. Now if you eat the egg white first, the egg white is digested very rapidly and gets to the liver. It helps the liver build a better quality of bile to digest the egg yolk. Remember I said earlier that the egg yolk is the only food in the world that contains vitamin B12... Every nutrient in the world, an egg yolk contains it. You have to find elements in meat and other things to get other nutrients. But the egg yolk contains every nutrient in the world except that it will not help you divide cells. It will not increase cellular division like pituitary hormone and meat will. So they will deliver everything. That's why I use them. They're fast in digestion and they have everything in it to help people regenerate cells that are already alive. Like the woman with emphysema. Now let's say that 90 or 80 percent of the cells in her lung were dead. Eggs wouldn't have done it. Eggs wouldn't have worked. She would have had to eat a lot of raw meat. But usually only when somebody is 70 to 90 years old do they only have 22 percent of their cells alive. Usually when you get 22 percent only, that 22 percent can't carry the 100 percent for very long. So the person dies. 

You see those old people walking across the street like this. Let me tell you, they don't have many cells alive. Maybe 24, 25 percent. And that's it. You can't expect them to go faster because 22 percent of your cells, 25 percent of your cells, can't move a whole weight of a body that fast. So you have to be patient. That's all they can do. So you have to swallow your frustration about having to wait for them to cross the street. But if you look at that and say, gosh, I never want to be like that, and I know how not to be. You know, stop taking industrial chemicals. Stop breaking down and killing the cells in my body. So if you suck the egg white out first, feed the liver. The liver will make better bile to digest the egg yolk, which has B12, every one of the A vitamins, both water and fat-soluble fats. I mean, oil-soluble fats, both water and oil-soluble fats. They have everything in them. So the way you do that is, if I go like this, the yolk is heavier. It's going to fall in and start coming out. I'm going to suck that out, break the yolk, and that's going to come out. But if I hold it down like this and suck upward, gently, only egg white comes out. And sometimes at first it's very, very wet, and then it starts getting thicker. The thicker it is, the little bit more mature it is. Sometimes, if it's too thick and it's not moving, you shake it like this until the yolk and the egg white have separated, and then you begin sucking in. And what I'm doing is mixing all that bacteria in the saliva with the egg white so it will digest like that and go to the liver quickly. It doesn't need hydrochloric acid, it's already a liquid. All it needs is the bacteria. So I put enough in it to handle it.

Q: Good for adrenal fatigue, too?

A: Mhm. Almost have the egg white out. Now, when I get to the egg yolk, I just...

Q: He's chewing it. 

Q: ...and everyone comes around, what are you doing? And then I do my pitch.

A: You see, it collapsed. By breaking the integrity, the whole thing collapsed, so I won't find any egg in there at all.

Q: On the outside, too.

A: When I sucked it through, the whole membrane collapsed. So I got everything out of the egg. There's not a drop of egg inside.

Q: Oh, that's good.

A: If I hadn't have done this, I could have sucked all day and not getting everything out of it. I may have left half of the egg in there. It's an experiment to do. If you like soft-boiled eggs, or runny eggs, you'll love that egg yolk. 

Q: Don't you eat the shells sometimes?

A: Well, the shell's very difficult to digest. If you put the egg shells, grind them into a powder, like in a blender, and they're not washed. I will only do that with non-washed. If there's fecal matter on the egg, I know it hasn't been washed with a soap, or a water full of fluoride, because that will just demineralize you. It won't help you.

Q: What's this one?

A: Fluoride. Put fluoride in drinking water. You see, it's good for your teeth. That's another big lie. The test they're pointing to was done in Massachusetts. And what they did was, they took two cities near each other. One got fluoride, and the other got no fluoride in their water. They examined how many cavities each town had in a two-year period. I think it was a two-year period. So the town who had no fluoride in their water had more cavities, a little bit more. So they said, see, if they had fluoride in their water, they'd have less cavities. But what they didn't do, they didn't tell you that those people who had the fluoride in the water lost a lot of teeth. So they had less cavities because they had less teeth. People drinking the fluoride were losing teeth, whole teeth. Not just getting cavities, they were losing whole teeth. So that is the fallacy and lie. So you can't listen to these people. They're just total liars. Okay, so the spleen delivers blood back into the system. Also, it helps you change body temperatures as long as you haven't been invaded with a lot of drugs. What happens when you get cold? You urinate a lot to get your blood thicker. Plus, your spleen will dump more red blood cells into your bloodstream to thicken it, to get warmer. With your spleen dumping red blood cells into your body, you can stand 30 degree temperature changes in an hour. Without that, you would not be able to. You would die with a 5 degree temperature change. The kidney assists that, and we're going to kidneys next. The kidney assists that by removing water from the blood to thicken the bloodstream. So, what happens when you get cold? You pee a lot. When you get hot, you don't pee as much. The body will, during a hot spell, the spleen will draw red blood cells out of the bloodstream, thin the blood, so you can cool the body. Same with the kidney. The kidney will remove fluids from the bloodstream to thicken the blood.

So, two ways that it can be done. Normally, the kidney should not be working to do that. We should not be drinking a lot of water, only a tiny amount, and we should be eating all the foods raw, and not be exposed to industrial toxins. Then the kidney wouldn't be involved in that. It would just be the spleen adding and removing red blood cells to the bloodstream to keep us warm and cool. Be that simple. But, we've contaminated the body so much, the kidney is getting involved in that. And, what does the kidney do? The kidney produces ammonia. Why does it produce ammonia? Because that is the way the body prevents red and white blood cells from getting into your urine. If you urinated your red and white blood cells every time you urinated, you'd be anemic. You only produce about two ounces of red blood cells a day. Two ounces a day. It takes a lot of time to replace blood, to build blood. And, if you're pissing it out every minute, you're going to have a problem. You're going to be anemic. Then, we have the bladder. So, the ammonia, what the ammonia does, is the ammonia does not allow the red and white blood cells to enter through the kidney wall. It repulses them, so they don't enter the kidney. Some toxins are bound in ammonia, and it's like a chelator of certain kinds of toxins. So, with ammonia, the body can reject and get rid of a lot of toxins. Now, what animal in the world produces the most, I mean, the most... I just sucked an egg, so I wouldn't lose my train of thought. I didn't eat. I was, I got two hours sleep last night, working, working, working.

Q: Well, last year you said the spleen holds all the information in the body, too, so you don't have to keep remembering.

A: No, that's the appendix.

Q: The appendix. Thank you. Okay, that's...

A: The appendix. Thank you for [unintelligible]. I have one, so I forget about it all the time. So the ammonia, the ammonia is a chelator of certain toxins. It keeps it from getting into the bloodstream. Ammonia can't get into the bloodstream easily, very difficult. So if you've got a toxin attached to ammonia, it won't make it into the bloodstream. So if you've been poisoned, it's good to eat shark, or if you find horse piss, you can drink that, or you can drink shark or stingray. Because once they're dead, as their tissue decays, those particular animals produce a phenomenal amount of ammonia. 

Q: Like in Iceland, the Harkal shark is called the rotten shark.

A: That's six months old, six to nine months old.

Q: Have you tried that?

A: Yeah, it's a little nasty.

Q: Is it?

A: Well, it can make you very dizzy, because too much ammonia can kill you. Because if you have too much and it gets into the blood, your red blood cells can't absorb, and take oxygen and carry it to the rest of the body. So you'll die. Brain death. No oxygen to the brain, that's the first place you die. And you can't recover from six minutes of brain death.

Q: So you can have a piece.

A: Huh?

Q: You can have a piece.

A: A piece of brain?

Q: No, a piece of fish.

A: Fish, and that'll help, yeah. Just have small amounts. When it gets to the point where you start getting lightheaded and dizzy, you've had enough. Don't have any more. But if you've been poisoned, that's a good way to restrict the amount of poisons getting in and damaging the bloodstream. Also help in the intestines quite a bit, preventing those poisons going through your digestive tract. You want them to come out through the skin, no matter how much damage they do to the skin. Anybody read about that? When I was kidnapped in a hotel room two years ago in April and given three injections, I went out and got a stingray and ate the stingray for the ammonia to keep from dying. So that time they were coming out with a swine flu vaccine. This was April 2009. And they were pitching it heavily, they were making 226 million doses. And we had paid 8 billion dollars for them. I went on a radio show, international radio show, I was just on an international radio show yesterday, a day before yesterday, at a hospital in the UK, broadcast from a hospital in the UK talking about all this stuff. So we're going to see what happens in the Queen's own land. Anyway, I put out that information about the swine flu hoax of 1976. I was 29 years old and very aware of it. I got involved with Ida Honorof and Dr. McBean, who had both sued the federal government for the swine flu vaccine, saying it was a hoax, no such thing. And Ida Honorof was a consumer advocate that was syndicated on 3,200 radio stations in the world, one of the better-known radio advocates, consumer advocates. And I had all of that information from 1976. I have the document showing that 2,323 people died from a direct result of getting the swine flu vaccine, yet the CDC now says only 46 people died as a direct result of the vaccine. So I had all the contradictory evidence. And I said the only way you can get swine flu is to get the swine flu vaccine, period. I got death threats for five weeks. I still did two other radio shows about it.

And while I was there, I went to Philippines on the sixth week. And I was subdued in a hotel room. I woke, and there were two American-looking idiots next to me, CIA-looking guys. And I had a hypodermic hanging from my arm, cloth moving down my stomach. I'm halfway sitting up, and two more hypodermics on the bed. And they were both shocked that I was awake and sitting up. And the guy on my right grabbed the cloth, put it up over my face. I was out in a split second. It didn't smell like ether, and the ether takes 12 to 17 seconds to put me under. Had it many times as a child. This, I was out in a split second. So I just thought it was a bad dream when I awakened. And I turned over to get out of bed, and I was sick, sick. Started to vomit in the bed. I had three bubbles here with a hole, you know, in it, just like an injection where they put, you know, fluid right under the skin like those Montauk TB tests put under the skin just like one of those. But what they had done was put a whole hypodermic in each one of fluid, like three and a half cc's. Could have been four cc's. So I was all bubbled up. I still have some nasty scars from it. You can see this one, this one, and this one.

Q: I remember you showed us one right after that, and you were covered with...

A: Sores. Broken out all over the place. Yeah, it looked like I had... My skin just started exploding within about 14 hours after that, 12, 14 hours. And one of the biggest ones was this one. Exploded the whole area, all the explosions.

Q: So that's a good sign that it came out.

A: Oh, that it came out, yeah. Can you imagine if it came out of my heart? I'd be dead.

Q: And you still don't know what it was that they put in you, right?

A: I imagine it was a swine flu vaccine, three doses of it. You know, to say, see, he died of swine flu. But see, I was heptam, I woke up, and I realized what had happened. So I immediately called a driver, because I knew I couldn't drive. I couldn't even stand. I was passing out, getting dizzy. Actually hitting the floor, I had to crawl to get somewhere. And I would get dizzy even crawling. So we had to find a wharf and find either a shark or a stingray. I found a stingray that had been caught, I think it was almost two days before. So it was ripe in ammonia. So I chopped it up and ate like a quarter of a cup at a time at first. Went up to a half a cup, got too sick with that one, started dry heaving. So I went back to a quarter of a cup at a time. Consumed a quarter of a cup of that for about 36 hours. And then I knew I was out of danger. But I was still unable to drive myself for another three or four days. But within 12, 14 hours, all these things were exploding through my skin. I mean, it looked like I got hit by shrapnel. It still does. I get scars all over the place. Arms, legs, everywhere. Feet. And then every April I go through a detox. Now that detoxification where I was blistering out all over went from the first week in April when they had the injections all the way through August, end of August, first year. Last year it came on in April by detoxification. All of a sudden in the chest and back and all over the left leg. Most of it happened on the right leg initially. And this happened on the left.The foot almost all completely deteriorated. Almost gone. And sores and scabs and the muscle was going. Some of the bone was starting to, and here was the worst area right here. And when I got it to stop finally, carposi sarcoma formed here, which is a skin cancer. And it was about this big. And I put vinegar on it and lime juice and it shrunk it up and dissolved it. So now I don't have the tumor. But the tumor is nothing other than a collection of dead cells because the body can't dissolve the dead cells.

And all that chemical was killing so many cells at one time. Couldn't dissolve them and get rid of them. All those layers of my skin was going with pus. And not so much pus, but serum. Like a plastic, clear, yellowish serum. Sometimes brown like rust or bright orange like iodine. You know, as it was flaking off. And I mean all of it went up to about here. A couple around here, but most of it stayed from the knee down. And I thought I might lose my foot on that one. But I kept putting lime juice on it. Kept putting honey and some coconut cream and then wrapping it in raw meat. And that prevented me from losing it. So that's what ammonia can do for you. Then we talked about the adrenal glands. So we talked about the intestines. Then we have the muscles. You have the bones. You know what that's all of. If we didn't have bones, we'd be like worms on the floor. Now with bones we can do flips, back flips. We can make tools. We can use tools. We can do all of the stuff because we have bones. And then the muscles are attached to the bones so we can contort the bones and the whole body in different ways to do different things. So that's basically the body. Don't be afraid of it anymore. Forget the medical profession. Your body never ever attacks itself. It attacks poisons and industrial chemicals in the body. It tries to harness them, neutralize them and get them out of the body. Acne, rashes, skin cancer. No matter what it is, those are the poisons, caustic poisons leaving the insides of your body where they can do grave harm. And by grave I mean deadly harm. So, trust your body.

Q: Do you ever get colds?

A: Colds are great detoxification just through the mucous membranes.

Q: So you welcome a cold then?

A: I welcome... I pray for three a year. Before the injections I was getting only one a year and I was lucky if it lasted twelve hours. Sometimes it only lasts one hour. I was getting disappointed but after the shots I went back to getting heavy colds and flus again. Not the way I wanted to do it. I didn't want to get colds and flus to get rid of the new stuff, I wanted to get rid of the old stuff. But as long as you're having colds and flus you know you're detoxifying. Not the best way. I prefer people going to a hot tub and spending 90 minutes in a hot tub every day so they don't have to reject those poisons to the mucous membranes. Because that's taxing. If you have diarrhea it's dumping it out through the intestinal tract. You're going to lose a lot of nutrients. You're going to destroy a lot of bacteria. I prefer you're sweating it out of the body. But your body is going to use the only channel it has. If your lymph system isn't working, lymphatic system isn't working, you're not going to neutralize those poisons. The lymph system is going to put them under the skin and you're not even going to move them out of the body. Your skin has to be healthy. Your lymph glands have to be healthy. Everything has to be working properly. A lot of people don't perspire. Their skin is so damaged and their lymphatic system is so congested they can't perspire. Those are always the sickest people I get. They're usually skinny and have been skinny all their lives, had no fat to bind with poisons so the bodies just store all the poisons in their body. And then when they get sick they really get deadly ill. Some of them find my diet and it takes them the longest to get well because all those poisons have permeated every cell in their body, no fat.

Q: Why don't people perspire?

A: The skin is damaged. The follicles aren't open. The picture of the skin I showed you, you've got like six layers with one layer of skin. And all the different channels have to be open to make it up to the follicle to perspire out of that pore. And that pore isn't open. It could be clogged with trans fatty acids, you know, plastic fat that will never melt until you get the body to 105 degrees, right in your skin. It only takes 45 minutes in a hot tub at 40 degrees, 40.5 degrees centigrade to dissolve those compounds in the skin. But to get deeper into the lymphatic system, it takes at least 40.5 degrees for 90 minutes to get in deep into the lymphatic system to get it to melt a little bit.

Q: So you increased that amount, because I think you were saying 40 minutes before, or 45 minutes?

A: It was 35 to 40. Different people with different amounts. So 35 to 45 minutes, the skin can break that down and free up the skin. Then the skin can perspire. But is the lymphatic system moving? Do you even dump the stuff under the skin? 

Q: So in the water, you put anything in, or just put salt in?

A: If you look in my book, we want to live under health modalities, under lymphatic baths. It tells you what I suggest to put in the water and the amounts.

Q: So 45 minutes, you're not actually going to start really moving the lymphatic system enough?

A: No. That's just your skin.

Q: So literally an hour and a half?

A: Yeah, for the lymphatic system. You can get rid of some of the lymphatic waste under the skin, get that melted and moving. But you're not going to get the lymphatic, the congestion of the lymphatic nodes and glands moving. You're going to get some of the veins and arteries of the lymphatic system moving without an hour, 90 minute bath.

Q: Can you replace that with the sauna?

A: Pardon?

Q: The sauna, going into the sauna.

A: The sauna is too hot. The sauna is 137 degrees minimum, all the way up to 168 degrees. You will damage the vitamins, enzymes in your skin at over 110 degrees.

Q: So the temperature you said is what, 110?

A: Well, that's 110 Fahrenheit.

Q: Yeah, but is that like, does it have to be really precise?

A: Yes, it's pretty precise. It's 43.3 degrees centigrade. It's too hot.

Q: What's the temperature we start getting really uncomfortable in?

A: It depends. Some people get uncomfortable at 102 degrees Fahrenheit, which is about 40 degrees centigrade. Some people it takes 45 degrees centigrade for them to be uncomfortable.

Q: So it's always around that temperature.

A: Pardon?

Q: It's always around that temperature, the 110 degrees. That's pretty much as much we can take heat.

A: No, that was when you start doing damage to the skin. I've been in a 140 degrees Fahrenheit desert.

Q: Yeah.

A: You know, debilitating, but it didn't kill me.

Q; In the water?

A: In the water it's different. You could kill yourself at 100, probably 120 degrees for a long enough. It would kill you.

Q: I mean, my question I guess is if we go over 110, is it better? Is it worse?

A: No, you shouldn't go over 110. You will kill the vitamins and enzymes in your skin. 

Q: Even if you're sweating a lot at a certain temperature, if you let the bath go down a bit in temperature because you're sweating like crazy?

A: No, it has to melt those plastics.

Q: So you have to keep the temperature...

A: Yeah, that's the best thing. So you have to get a hot tub to be consistent, or right now I'm working on inventing a filter with a pump with a heater. Tube goes into the tub at your feet, tube goes into the tub right about here, so it sucks the cold water out, goes in here, filters it, heats it, pumps it back into the tub at the feet. Every once in a while you just have to move it around. That way you can keep a steady temperature in the bath and fall asleep in it. Because what you'll do is turn your bath into a hot tub. So, trying to do it safely. I've looked at over 72 pumps for ponds, for aquariums, for everything. They all broadcast an EMF field that is longer than three feet. You can't have, unless you have a remote control, you can't control it. You know, being too close to you. So, I'm still trying to work on it. And when I do that, instead of spending $4,000 to $6,000 for a hot tub, you know, you can just spend $1,000 to do it. And then you can use your own bathtub in your home.

Q: And then you can have this thermometer and throw up some water, put some water down and keep it hot.

A: Keep it as hot as you can. The steam bath is way too hot. Listen, anybody can eat what they want. This is a workshop about food. So eat. If you're hungry, eat.

Q: She's like, I've got to go out, I've got to open this.

Q: And now little chunky things here. Because I don't eat eggs, I couldn't find anything.

A: That's up to you. I'm not eating it. Okay, so that lymphatic flow is so important. Your skin being able to perspire is so important. Like I said, when I talked about the woman who had rheumatoid arthritis, and after ten years the first time she could go on a cruise with her husband. I mean, that's a virtual miracle. Because in the medical model, they say that nobody ever recovers from rheumatoid arthritis that's that advanced. She was crippled. She couldn't do anything herself. Not even button her own blouses. Not even put them on. Husband had to do everything. Now she does it all on her own.

Q: Was it mostly the detox that did it, or was it the combination, getting the junk out and the good stuff in?

A: Well, I would say she didn't heal much in that time. In that whole six years that she'd been on the diet, I saw little healing. It was cleaning that garbage out in the waste products that were causing all the blown out joints. You know, like 75 to 80% of arthritis and rheumatism and rheumatoid arthritis is from leaky gut. You know, there's tears in the stomach. You have undigested foods go down and turn your joints into digestive tracts. And then eventually the acids there start deteriorating the cartilage. And then you have swelling from that. And then you produce bacteria to eat the dead, damaged cartilage cells. And then they say, see, it's the bacteria, you know, that's causing arthritis and rheumatism. And they're just the freaking janitors.

Q: In Canada they say it's the cold weather.

Q: That's true.

Q: Yeah.

A: Well, the cold weather certainly makes the joints uncomfortable.

Q: Was she using tap water?

A: Pardon?

Q: Was she using tap water in the bath?

A: Yeah, but she put the ingredients that I instructed her to put in. That's what she asked, how much of what do you put in the water? So that's in my book. In my first book, big book. Okay, so let's get into... What time is it?

Q: Break time.

A: Break time. Okay. We're going to get into food then.

[break]

A: All those elements that we produce on the foods that I mentioned, and the only ones they properly digested was the milk, meats, and the dairy, meats, and eggs. The only ones, anywhere from 70 to 92% digestible. So those are the foods that we have to concentrate on. Nuts, as I said in the book, they have an advantage if you're somebody who's hyperactive. Type A, which means you've got all this energy and you can't slow down, means you've got a lot of adrenaline, low fat levels, and a lot of problems. Then you can eat a nut formula that I have in the book, which is taking soft nuts, not almonds, not any of the hard nuts. You take the soft nuts like walnuts and pecans and pine nuts. You blend them like in a coffee maker or something like that until it is like a flour. Then you mix egg, butter, and honey with it and eat that. Let's say you're doing two ounces of nut flour and then like a tablespoon of honey, one egg, and two ounces of butter. That will make a nice nut butter. It will taste really delicious and that will help lower hormonal levels. That's the only time I suggest it if you have a tendency of hyperactivity or overproducing some hormone. Mostly you're overproducing hormones to deal with toxins. So eating, if your body is producing excess hormones to deal with toxins, you don't really want to rest it very much, just enough to calm down so you can deal with life sanely. Because we all know when we get crazy we make stupid, say stupid things and do stupid things and make really bad decisions that we pay for for many, many years. Some things you can't even reverse. It cuts to the quick so much in somebody and they can never heal from it.

Q: This is from hormones overproducing and running amok.

A: Yes, running amok. So that helps, also drinking raw cream helps, eating ice cream helps those conditions. Exercise is the best way to get rid of them. Whenever you have anxiety, you need to exercise. If you're very fatigued and can't, then you go for the nut formula. Or you sing and or you sing. Singing is the most strenuous exercise there is. You have to control the muscles to the lung, how much air goes out, how fast, how it goes through the vocal cords, how broad or small your mouth opening is to get the right pitch. All of that goes into a note, singing a note. Only part of the body that works that hard in any exercise. So singing is a great way to release anxiety if you do not have the physical energy to exercise, do some other form of exercise. So always anxiety is producing a lot of hormones for physical activity and not spending them in physical activity. Then you will spend them in anxiety. And in anxiety you have a tendency to project it on the whole world around you. So relationships are not good, even with yourself. So better to sing, better to do some kind of physical activity to get rid of those hormones. Now some people produce a lot. Those are your type A athletic individuals. I tell by the activity rings I see in the eye. For each activity ring that tells me that you are producing an hour of hormones for physical activity a day for each hour. I mean for each activity ring, it is one hour. Athletes have 7-14. They need to be physically, that's why they do it for a living. Now one child was brought to me, she was about 14 years old. And the parents didn't, I tell people don't tell me why you are here. Don't prejudice my thinking. Let me analyze your eyes, your hands, your skin. And then I'll tell you what I see. And then you tell me what I've missed. I rarely miss anything. I mean I miss, I hit 99 out of 100 things. And this one little girl, she came in, I had no idea why they were bringing her. Photographed her eyes, color, you know fixed the color, color corrected. And cropped the irises and had them up there. 

I'm talking to the parents, little girl sitting behind in a chair behind, observing. Because the parents, they want to know. They want to, you know, they want her up there, right there. Because I'm pointing everything out. And I said, and it's always at the end I read the activity rings. I say, this is the amount of activity that this person needs a day. You need to be active this many hours. Or you need to be, you need to exercise and do this amount of activity. So if you're doing exercise, you can reduce the amount of just natural activity. Your body just doing things, making the bed, making foods, walking to your car, walking around the office, whatever you do, lifting a chair. All the things we do in a day, that's physical activity. If you're exercising, that doubles the activity. So if you exercise, let's say you have seven activity rings, and you exercise an hour, you only have to have five hours of activity a day. An hour of exercise, now you need five hours of activity. So you've eliminated an hour of just plain activity. So I got to the end of it to see what kind of meat that she needed to eat, and I said, oh my gosh, she has 14 activity rings. I had only seen 11 in my life, and I've seen 20,000 eyes, at least 20,000 eyes, and irises. 20,000 pairs of irises, so I've seen 40,000 eyes. And 11 is the most I've seen, and these were professional athletes. Hall of Famers, people who lived activity. And this little girl had 14, and I said, oh my gosh. I said, you can't put this girl in regular school. You know, she'll be crazy. She has to exercise 10 minutes every hour, or else her brain won't function. If she doesn't, they're going to diagnose her as ADD, ADHD, and want to put her on drugs. And they said that's why we're here. And I look back at the little girl, and the little girl's sitting on the chair like this. Sitting there for an hour and 15 minutes with me. She can't sit still. She has too many hormones for physical activity.

I said, see? And I said, you can't put her in a regular school. You have to put her in a sports school where they understand that. And she says, oh my God, we're going to put her on drugs, and we're hoping that you can solve that. I can't stop that. That's her body's creation. She will produce that much for the rest of her life. And I said, she needs to get into some kind of sport, tennis, basketball, something heavy duty. And she says, I hate those. I said, oh, shit. And I'm thinking, you know, swimming? That's okay, but I don't love it. I said, well, what do you like? And she says, I love baseball. And I said, I hope you're the pitcher. And she said, that's what I love. Pitchers out there throwing that ball constantly. Moving around and, you know, doing the ball stuff. Throwing the ball. You know, perfect for her. Perfect sport for her. I'm afraid I'm going to hit those. It would be a bad mess. So, you know, if you have anxiety, you need to exercise. If you don't have the energy, sing. You know, how fast you're singing. How all of a sudden you're yawning and saying, oh, my God. You know, I'm so relaxed. That's what singing does. So do it. Depression is always low bacteria in the intestines or some damage to the nervous system from some chemical. So you know what to do to that? High rotten eggs or meat or do the suppository. You're feeding the fresh fats to the E. coli that feed the brain and the nervous system. Okay? So we really don't need to eat any other foods. Over the years, I've experimented with a lot of things, telling people to eat salads here at the end of the day because they have a very impacted intestinal tract. I found that that may help them have a bowel movement, but what I really need to do is educate you like I did earlier. When you're on a raw food diet like this, getting the foods that you can digest, your body's going to digest every bit of it, and there's not going to be waste. And what it can't digest will get very hard in the sigmoid colon. Your body doesn't want to release it. It just wants to keep pulling it out. The only way you can stop that is to give the bowel fresh, raw fats, period.

Because as I said earlier, your body is taking all the fats in from the mouth to the stomach. The small intestine is going to take it all, all the good fats, and everything it can digest properly, it's going to leave just waste for the bowel. So if you feed it directly, the bowel's very happy. Of course, if you eat ice cream like you do, there's going to be quite a bit of good stuff that gets to the bowel. Good stuff gets to the bowel if you eat that much. That's fine. But most people don't eat that much, that much fat. Just for me, when I come back from Asia, I go down to a 30-inch waist. And when I'm here, you can see this is a 34-inch waist, and I'm already over it. I go from 160 pounds to 190 pounds, right now I'm at 180. And next month before I leave for my abroad tour, I will be 190 pounds. I'll gain 10 more pounds in this month. But I'll eat a cup of cream a day. And I'm eating at least a stick of butter a day, sometimes two sticks of butter a day, to gain it. So we need all that fat on us to buffer any poisons that get in the system and to remove all those that are already in the body.

Q: Undigested fat that goes into the gut is not damaging the gut?

A: No.

Q: They say that.

A: It'll still be protective. That's a lie. I mean, the worst you could have is diarrhea.

Q: Yeah. You say you eat two sticks of butter a day. I mean, if I eat a lot of fat, then I'll get nauseous. I mean, I might be dizzy. You know, I'm almost passing out. So...

A: That's... your liver is very toxic.

Q: Yeah, but I mean...

A: You're forcing it to produce a lot of bile quickly.

Q: Yeah. But why don't you just stop to do it and just leave the fat go through? Why don't you just let the fat...

A: Because the body wants the fat. You're so thin.

Q: Yeah.

A: The body wants the fat.

Q: Yeah.

A: So it's saying to the liver... Just like you read my book with the poison mushroom. I destroyed 90% of my liver. My living... you know, my ability to live. I was on a thin line. And I knew the only way I could do it was suffer the agonizing pain of eating a pound to a pound and a half of butter a day. Going through the agonizing nausea and the pain and the dry heaves from eating it. I vomited only a few times, basically dry heaving. But that kicked my liver back in. Started producing the bile to digest it. But I always mixed butter with the fat. So I knew that the liver could digest it better.

Q: Butter with the honey.

A: I mean butter with honey. Butter and honey. So always have, for you, always have honey with your butter. Maybe, you know, two-thirds butter to one-third honey. And then eat a teaspoon every hour. So your liver gets stronger. Don't eat a lot at one time if you have that problem. But eat a teaspoon an hour. So let's say you're awake 16 hours in a day. So that's 32 teaspoons. And 3 teaspoons to a tablespoon. So that's 10 tablespoons. That's over a stick of butter. So start with that. So we don't need a lot of complex foods. Like I said earlier, that tribe that lives average is 132 years old. People have lived as long as that, up to 152. I think they had one person who had done it in 56 years. They live on two foods. Coconut meat, fresh coconut meat, and raw fish. And that was it. 

Q: The hard coconuts or the young ones.

A: The hard.

Q: The hard, the old ones.

A: A lot of chewing. But the women would eat half of one and then would eat a whole one. Every day. And then eat only fish. And maybe a barely ripe banana or a mango maybe once, twice a week. That wasn't really a big part of their diet. I don't know why they ate it, probably just for novelty. But we certainly need it because we're very toxic. We need that fruit, that alcohol with the fats. And to have a balanced diet, because we're not high-carbohydrate eaters, we have all that advanced glycation end product that will make the blood and the neurological fluids sticky. For those first six to seven hours of the day, you don't want to eat anything high in carbohydrates unless it's heavily diluted with some kind of fat and with egg. So wake in the morning. Wake in the morning, you're going to have poisons to dump from the stomach into the stomach, stomach lining into the stomach. Always eat about one to, depending upon your size, one to three tablespoons of cheese. If your intestines are starving for fat, so you don't get too constipated with it, eat a half a teaspoon to a teaspoon of butter with that cheese. That's going to arrest the poisons that are dumping from the stomach lining into the stomach and also the intestinal walls into the intestines. So vacuum that up before you start eating. Then ten minutes later, to get the brain and the nervous system going well, remember the egg white will produce a great non-waste-producing glycogen to feed the brain and the nervous system. So suck an egg. Five minutes after that, suck another egg. If you're a larger person, five minutes after that, suck another egg. If you're a very large person, five minutes after that, suck another egg. If you have a cramping with any of those eggs after having only five minutes in between, you place ten minutes between an egg. One egg and another egg.

Then about twenty minutes after that, add a little sugar cube-sized amount of cheese, which is about a half a teaspoon. So whenever I say cube, I mean a sugar cube amount, which is a half a teaspoon. Then about ten minutes after that, you have an option of having a vegetable juice or a meat meal. If you have a vegetable juice, I suggest putting an egg in it and one teaspoon to one tablespoon of raw cream, depending upon your size. It doesn't matter how much juice you're having. If you only have a cup to twenty-four ounces at a time, only have one egg in it. Unless you have diabetes, then you might put two eggs in it. Or if you have a sugar problem, you can put two eggs in it. The vegetable juice I'm going to recommend, a general vegetable juice, is one-third carrot, one-third celery, one-third cucumber puree, and ten percent cilantro or parsley. Or five percent parsley, five percent beet. If you have a problem digesting proteins, then have a five percent beet. Beets have a lot of nutrients that help stimulate hydrochloric acid. Chlorine is very involved in hydrochloric acid formation. Beets contain a lot of natural chlorine. Also remove toxic chlorine from the body. But you have to limit it. No more than five percent of your juice can be beet. I can't tolerate more than two and a half percent of my juice being beet. My urine turns red and I taste it forever. 

Q: They say it's because there's not enough hydrochloric acid and it's called the beet test. Is that real?

A: I didn't know that.

Q: You don't have enough hydrochloric acid so you do the beet test. If your urine comes out pink that means you don't have enough hydrochloric acid.

A: Well, they severed the vagus nerve to my stomach so I don't produce much hydrochloric acid. In my stomach, I still produce a little bit throughout the small and large intestine but not in the stomach. So yeah, my urine is very, very pink if I'm drinking beet juice.

Q: I was surprised to hear that most people actually don't have red color in their urine when they eat beet.

A: You have it.

Q: The first time it happened I thought I was bleeding bad. It's happened over time but I was very surprised to notice that most people don't experience that.

A: It means they produce a lot of hydrochloric acid and you don't. Nor do you produce good bile. So your intestines are in a problem.

Q: Well you know I think it started when I started the raw meat. Before that I don't remember that happening.

A: You started the raw diet?

Q: Yeah.

A: But what raw diet did you start?

Q: This one. It's the only one I know.

A: There's many vegan raw dieters.

Q: Yeah, but I don't know the diet. I've never tried it.

A: Well then you've got a lot of waste product in your stomach. You must have a lot of vaccine toxicity in your stomach lining. And some of it's gone to your liver. So now you're detoxifying. So eat that cheese. For you I suggest eating a little piece of cheese every 15 minutes. So that's four an hour. So that's a teaspoon, two teaspoons of cheese every hour. You notice I suck. I don't drink. I suck. It's like a baby when they suck. They pull all that bacteria, all the saliva into the milk. If you just drink, you're not getting any saliva in your milk. You're not filling it full of bacteria and pre-digesting it. So you need to suck. I suck it through my teeth. I'm not sucking it from anything. So that's helpful for digestion. So after you have either, well, if you have the vegetable juice, oh, and the cucumber, you peel and slice. All the other vegetables, well, the others are vegetables. That's not a vegetable. That's a bland fruit. So you take all the vegetables. It's juice, vegetable juice. And you put the slices in that and blend it all together. So you've got cucumber pulp. The reason for that is all the years that I didn't do it, I found that a lot of people were putting their toxins in their connective tissue, and they were losing collagen. Well, cucumber has a lot of collagen precursors. So it helps replace it. I had a few people, not every diet, just only a few, that developed lupus or MS on the diet. Those are the only people that ever developed a disease on the diet. So after I realized that the waste that went under the skin wasn't being cleaned, it was also dissolving the connective tissue, causing either lupus, which is the dissolution of the connective tissue, or MS, hardening of the nerves. So it could cause either. But there were only two cases of it. But I could see that if they added the cucumber pulp in there, it would prevent that. It definitely does. So you never have to worry about disintegrating your connective tissue. As your body discharges the poisons through your skin.

So if you have the vegetable juice at that time, you need to wait about, you have the egg in it, a teaspoon to a tablespoon of cream, and you sip it. You suck it. You do not gulp it. Whenever you gulp any food, a great amount of the water, the H2O in it, will rush to the kidneys. Too much water at one time. So then when the nutrients need to carry H2O, when the cells need to carry H2O with the nutrients, it cannot, it will not happen. So you have lost a lot of your H2O. 100% of your H2O in food can be absorbed and digested, unless it's not with the nutrients. If you have water without nutrients, you can't absorb and utilize that either. So when people suck on water, all they're doing is diluting their body and making themselves even more dehydrated. The only way water can get into a cell is with a vehicle of ions, minerals and nutrients, vitamins, enzymes, proteins. It all goes together. 

Q: So what do you do when you're in the Arizona desert then? You don't drink water?

A: No. Aborigines don't either. They go pull a plant out of the ground, they'll grate it and wring it. Of course, they're used to doing it. Everyone with a cup of vegetable juice, they'll go a hundred miles in a hot desert that's 140, 150 degrees. But that's the way they were raised. They know that they can't drink water. The more water you drink, especially in the desert, the more you're going to dehydrate. So the idea in the desert is not to perspire. So you only have little bits of fluid at a time and have it as vegetable juice where you have nutrients so the cells can actually consume it. If you have water, you're going to hydrate your system but not the cells. So what's going to happen, your cells are going to dehydrate, you're going to be even more thirsty. So not a good thing to do. Milk is 86% minimum water. Meat's 55-70% water. Fruits are anywhere from 90-92% water. That's a lot of water.When you cook something, you fracture the ion bond with the H2O. It won't carry to the cells properly. People are dehydrating because they're eating cooked food. And they eat water, and they'll never hydrate properly. It's better if you keep your questions to the end, because we're getting late. So if you have a question, write it. And if I don't answer it, then I'll have a Q&A period. So after you have the vegetable juice, let about 45 minutes to 50 minutes pass. After you finish the vegetable juice, you finish sipping, sucking it, whatever you're going to do. And then have a piece of cheese. You can have a piece of cheese every 15-20 minutes in that time, or every 30 minutes, just to keep collecting poisons after the vegetable juice. Then have a piece of cheese again at that hour. Then about 10 minutes after that, you can have a meat meal, your first meat meal. If you do not have a vegetable juice, instead of a vegetable juice, after that 20 minutes after you've had the last egg, then have that cheese 10 minutes after that, have your first meat meal. And it should be at least a cup of meat.

And if you want to gain a lot of weight, I suggest you do a cup and a half with a lubrication formula, a moisturizing lubrication formula, which will allow you to digest the butter better. If you have the lemon and honey with the butter and eggs with the butter also, you will digest the butter better, quicker.

Q: Are you talking about the meat meal?

A: With the meat meal.

Q: So you eat butter with your meat?

A: Always.

Q: Always?

A: Always.

Q: Even when the meat is fatty?

A: Even when the meat is fatty.

Q: Why is that?

A: Because the body will use the proteins in the meat as an energy producer, as a fuel, rather than as a building block. And I want fats to be used as my energy, fats produce two and a half times more energy than protein or carbohydrate.

Q: Yeah, but the fat from the meat will be...

A: Fat from the meat is usually used as a cleanser. When the body makes the fat into an energy producing substance, let me tell you, the body utilizes it pretty quickly. It doesn't store it. Only fats that aren't made into energy producing fats are stored. 

Q: But I'm not talking about fat that's in the meat. I'm talking about big pieces of meat fat around.

A: That's storage fat for detoxification.

Q: Even that, that's not enough.

A: That will not produce energy and won't give you weight. I've done it with hundreds of patients. It just does not work. Butter is the main important thing. Even after all the years that I've been doing this diet, if I eat the meat fat, I won't gain an ounce. Not an ounce. I won't gain any weight whatsoever. I sure enjoy it though.

Q: It's not a good thing to put on weight?

A: It doesn't put on weight for me. The meat fat won't put on weight for me. Butter does.

Q: Why is that a good thing to put on weight? In terms of extra fat? Are you talking about muscle weight?

A: No, I'm talking about fat anywhere, especially on the intestines. We all have toxins. 

Q: If you have the right amount from the meat fat, why do you need extra?

A: You don't. We are so toxic in the toxic world, that we need an enormous, we need more fat than we need anything else. Calorically, we need double the fat that we do of anything else. Almost two and a half times more fat than anything else. Right now, you have no extra fat in your body. And all the poisons will go right into your cells. I want the poisons that enter my body to go into fat deposits, to fat tissue. I don't want it to go into my live cells. And that's what will happen in yours. That's what is happening. So then, about, have two, one and a half if you're a small person, have one and a half tablespoons of butter with your cup of meat. Three quarters to a cup of meat. If you're a bigger person, then you can have three tablespoons of butter with your one and a half cups of meat. If you want to lose some weight, you have more meat, like two cups of meat, and only one and a half tablespoons of butter. Remember, meat and protein will break down fats, will utilize them as energy, break them down. Then twenty-five minutes after you finish your meat meal, have another little cube of cheese. Then ten minutes after that, could be as much as fifteen minutes after that, you have cheese. Two to three tablespoons of cheese, with two teaspoons of honey. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I don't do it while I'm lecturing, but I'm doing it while I'm doing readings. I'm always keeping up with it. But trying to break down the cheese and talk at the same time, not easy because you have to get a lot of saliva mixed with it. Very difficult to do, to do that whole routine. If you really want to make this diet work, you prepare the foods for the whole day in that first hour in the morning. Already ready, you take it with you. You got no excuse. I didn't get to run to the store, so I went to McDonald's. I didn't have time to wait, I couldn't get to Whole Foods. There are thousands of excuses. But if you prepare your foods for the whole day and you have it with you, you have extra time in the day. You're not going into the kitchen and prepare it. It's already finished. You've done the dishes. All you have to do is clean the jars or the bowls that you're carrying the food in at the end of the day. That's it. So easy. And you have extra time. You're not running to the store. You're not waiting in a line to pay at a cashier. It's so easy. You get so much more time out of your day when you prepare your own foods. It's very quick. Raw foods are so quick. And if you get my new recipe DVD, you'll see how quickly I make sauces, two to three minutes. And that's sauces you can make for the whole week or two weeks or a month. Just pull them out of the fridge and put them with your meat and there it is. And I can do a whole elaborate dish, meat dish, all embellished with different kinds of food for color. Even though you may not eat them, still you can make a nice presentation. And I'll show you how to do it in minutes. I'll show you how to make a cheesecake in 20 minutes. Who can make a cooked cheesecake in 20 minutes? You can't do it. So I'm going to teach you how to make a blueberry cheesecake. I'll also show you how to make coconut cream fast. There's no way to make coconut cream real fast. But I'll show you how to choose the coconut. I'll show you how to crack it. I'll show you how to pry it out easily. And I'll show you how to use the juicer. I'll show you how to take the meat and what to do with it to make it go through the juicer easily without jamming your juicer.

So I'll show you how to make juice. I'll show you where to stand with the juicer so you're not broadcasting the EMF field into you. Most people sit, stand with the juicer right here, and it's lengthwise, and they've got the juice coming out here, pulp coming out the end, and they're standing there jamming in. You've got the motor right here broadcasting the EMF field into you. I don't do that. I turn the back end around, and it points at me. So the pulp's coming out toward me, and I'm over here pushing the stuff in this way. The motor's back here. So my whole torso here does not get affected by the EMFs, only my arms and hands. So I show you how to do everything to take care of yourself, how to handle the blender, how to handle the food processor when you're using it. I show you how to use the machinery. Two hours and 14 minutes of showing you how. And it's very, very simple and very easy. So if you get that and watch it, you'll know the keys of how I'm doing it. A lot of people, they read my, you know, it's detailed and understandable in my book, but people have to see it to understand how simple it is. A lot of people got these mechanisms going in their minds, you know, when I'm describing it in the recipe book. But it's all so simple once you see me do it. So I'm encouraging everybody that doesn't have the recipe DVD to get it. It's normally $67, and I'm selling it for $50. First time anybody's heard me ever pitch.

Q: Wow.

A: Ever pitch. But I'm here in Toronto, going to lose money this time. After you have the cheese and honey together, cheese and honey together allow you to digest the cheese. When milk is dehydrated like that, anything's dehydrated, you have no active bacteria and no active enzymes, bioactive enzymes. Everything that's dehydrated will have very little digestibility. Adding honey to it or eating fruit with cheese will allow it to digest. Honey with it will allow it to digest almost completely. And that is the mineral supplement we need. Everybody needs a mineral supplement because we use mostly calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, and potassium, which are alkalinizing minerals to bind with acidic and caustic minerals in the body. And when you cook your food and have eaten a lot of processed food, you have a lot of those stored in the body. And to neutralize one acidic, caustic compound, you may need 12 minerals, 12 alkalinizing minerals. The ratio is very great when you're toxic in the need for those alkalinizing minerals. And the only place you can get them in concentrations like that is in cheese with the honey with it. So that's your mineral supplement. Then after that, for the next four or five hours, have little pieces of cheese. I usually wear between one and four pieces an hour in the meantime, how toxic you are. If you have frequent nausea, you need to eat it every 15 minutes. Nausea is an indication that poisons are dumping from the stomach lining into the stomach in your body. Nausea will promote production of hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid neutralizes poisons as well as breaking down food particles into smaller food particles.

Q: So what's creating the hydrochloric acid? The cubes of cheese?

A: No, that's absorbing the poisons. When poisons get into the stomach lining and your body is dumping them into the stomach to be dealt with, the hydrochloric acid is produced by the stomach with nausea. And if the poisons in the stomach can be neutralized with the hydrochloric acid, it will neutralize it. But you still need to absorb it into something. Or you can eat the cheese to absorb those poisons so your body doesn't have to secrete hydrochloric, doesn't have to manufacture and secrete the hydrochloric acid. So when you get nauseous, the first thing you can do is eat a piece of cheese, absorb the poisons. If it continues, you can keep eating cheese every 15 minutes to arrest the poisons. But if the body feels it still needs hydrochloric acid, then you will continue the nausea. But most often, I'd say 85% of the time, it stops the nausea, the cheese. Absorb it, just eliminate it with the body, so you don't have to deal with it. You don't have to exhaust the body's nutrients and time and energy producing hydrochloric acid. So, you're eating the cheese frequently to absorb the poisons that are in those stomach lining and intestinal lining. Pull it out as it goes through. And like I said, if you have a tendency to, you know, the body's saying, oh, there's all this fat in this cheese, which we don't digest very much, huh? And we don't digest any of it unless there's honey with it or fruit with it, then the body's going to try to hold on still, try to get as much fat out as it can. And if they can't spare it, it's not chelated with the poisons that have been absorbed in the cheese. So, you will have what's called constipation, which isn't true constipation. True constipation is when you have a block in the intestines and food's not moving at all, anywhere. And your stomach just keeps getting larger and larger and larger. Of course, the sigmoid colon getting larger and larger with harder fecal matter is like a block, but it's not a disease block. It's a starving block where the bacteria in the body wants all that fat to feed the nervous system.

So, eat a little honey. Spread the honey on the cheese. It's like, like I said, it's one-third cheese minimum, I mean maximum, to two-thirds cheese. So, there's three teaspoons in a tablespoon, so if you're having a tablespoon of cheese, it's only a teaspoon of honey. Or less, it could be a half a teaspoon of honey. You have to explore and experiment with what helps you most and the way it helps you. Right now I'm at probably eight to one, eight butter to one honey of cheese. That's all the honey I need with my cheese. And I digest it perfectly and I do well with it. It adds that extra minerals, the extra minerals that I need to neutralize the poisons, especially after those forced injections. So for the next four to five hours or so, you eat cheese and sip on milk and a sport formula. Now a sport formula is a little complex, so since there are so few people here, I'm going to email it to you, so everybody make sure I have your email address. Anybody who doesn't receive my emails, here. Two, okay? My email address, I need your email addresses with your names. If I'm going to see you for a consult, I will get your names and email addresses then. But if I'm not going to see you personally, write down your email address and your name, please. And I will email that sport formula for you. Or if you get my newsletters, you already have it. Wait a minute, I think Jim put it up on the website. I said just post it outside the newsletter. So I think you can just go on wewant2live.com and look for the sport formula. Not sport drink, sport formula. Sport drink is the garbage that Gatorade puts out, Coca-Cola and those guys. There's nothing but chemical, all chemical, not food. So you sip on the milk and the sport formula. You can even drink one on top of the other, that's fine. But don't guzzle them. Sip them in between the cheeses. Then, so you do four or five hours of that. So fifth or sixth hour after that, have your fruit meal. 

Also in there, if you get a little brain fatigue, you start losing, you look for a word like I am once in a while, and you see me get up and have a second egg or a little bit of milk. That's just my brain low in glycogen. Not stupid, I'm just low on fuel. Expecting your brain to work is like expecting a car that's out of gas to run. It's not going to work. So you beat yourself up about it, you feed the brain. Give yourself some food to feed. Egg will do it the fastest of course. But if I'm too hungry, ice cream makes me incredibly hungry for some reason. So I want more and more of it. I'm a little low today for the ice cream. But I only got a cup of it. If I had my normal quart at a time when I do have ice cream, I'd be okay today. But I'm very hungry today. Very hungry for more of that cream. And I haven't had my fruit meal with a cup of cream yet today. And I won't until I finish here. So have your fruit meal with coconut cream. Now coconut cream is your best cleansing fat. Coconuts are 80% fat, 15% protein. That's a mature coconut. And 5% carbohydrate. What's the ratio of the body's energy system?

Q: Same.

A: Exactly the same. 80% fat in the citric acid cycle of utilizing fat as energy. The greatest energy that you can produce. 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate. And the ratio of oil is almost the same in vegetation. Only 7% of the fat is oil. 7% of that 80% of the fat of a coconut, only 7% of that 80% is oil. That means it's 93% water-soluble fats. Nobody talks about water-soluble fats. They started to in the early 1960s and late 1960s. And then they stopped in the late 1960s and early 70s. Why? Because it went against the whole paradigm of no cholesterol, stop eating meat. So they just threw that science out the window. But your water-soluble fats you need the most of in your meat, in your food, in your dairy, in your milk. Most of the fats that are in there are water-soluble fats, not oil-soluble fats. Most of your B vitamins are in water-soluble fats. Most of your A vitamin, structures of vitamin A are water-soluble fats. Easily absorbed, easily digested. Oil-soluble fats are not easily digested. So in the coconut cream you have, even though it's a fruit and higher in alkaline, it allows for cleansing. When you're eating animal fats, you have the same kind of ratio, but it's highly acidic, so it builds the body. The alkalinizing, the slightly alkalinizing of the coconut cream helps cleanse the body more, especially if you're eating it with a fruit that produces alcohol. But you don't want to irritate and damage the nervous system, so you need to drink a little bit of dairy cream with it. People don't digest butter easily. You don't digest cream easily, you get nauseous with it. Then you add a little butter with the coconut cream, with the fruit. And one of the fruits that cleanses the lymphatic congestion and the intestinal toxicity the best are pineapples. Medium to green pineapples. Medium ripe to green pineapples. 

Q: So why do you add the dairy cream to the coconut cream?

A: To protect the nervous system.

Q: When you said that you need to eat fruit because you're looking for your words and your mental well-being.

A: When you're looking for, when you have fruit you need the alcohol in it.

Q: Oh, it's the alcohol you're looking for?

A: The alcohol, yeah.

Q: I thought you said something like nitrogen?

A: No.

Q: You're low on alcohol, that's why you're looking for words?

A: How you use a cleanser in the body is you produce alcohol from your fruit.

Q: So alcohol is good for you?

A: Alcohol from fruit. Fresh alcohol.

Q: Like wine?

A: No, that's the highly long-fermented. It will damage your nervous system. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, it will definitely feed your brain, but it will also deteriorate your brain cells.

Q: And liver.

A: Yeah, and liver. But you know, if you do like the French did, you know, they would eat lots of cream and butter sauces and they would have, you know, like cheese, you know, on top of cream cheese, on top of crackers, while they drank all their wine.

Q: A little bit of everything.

A: So the wine went into the fat and made it into either a fuel or a cleanser. So they didn't gain a lot of weight from it. And they didn't get damaged from the alcohol. And now, even in France, everybody's on a fatless diet. You know, it's ridiculous. When I lived there from 92 to 93, several months a year, you know, I went to look for dairy because I couldn't find it anywhere. So I'd go to the farmer's markets, the outdoor farmer's markets, and I'd ask for sweet cream. And they said, what do you mean sweet cream? Why do you want sweet cream? All they had was sour cream. All cream was sour. Their fresh cream was sour. You know, they said, you don't digest 50% of it if you have sweet cream. I thought about that. I said, yeah, that's true. You know, your feces will float and they'll be all creamy looking. When you eat sour cream and sour butter, your poops don't float. Very little of them. I mean, they won't bob up. They may still go up near the surface of the water, but when you don't digest them, they're up there above water level, hanging out, floating like chips. But when you digest it, even though it may stay up near the top of the water level, you've digested most of that fat. So it was like, are you insane to eat fresh? That's what they were saying. Are you insane to eat fresh cream?

Q: Because you don't digest it?

A: You don't digest it. You only digest 50% of sweet cream. It's not pre-digested. It's also, like I say in the books, it's the hardest fat to digest.

Q: So isn't it better that we eat sour cream then?

A: Correct.

Q: Oh, I thought you were saying no sour cream.

A: No, I'm saying sour cream's better. I'm saying we're idiots for thinking that sweet cream is better. And we don't digest half of it, and it's very freaking expensive and hard to get.

Q: What is this sweet cream? The one that comes out of the cow?

A: Well, cream is the taking the fat off the top of the milk. That's cream. And sweet, when you take it fresh off and eat it, doesn't digest very easily. Only 50%. It takes a lot of good bile to do that. I'm getting a little chilly.

Q: Are you? Are you kidding?

A: No, I'm a little chilly. Yes, now.

Q: I've been freezing.

Q: Okay, sorry, because it got kind of warm in here.

A: Oh, yeah, but it was, yeah, that was okay. I like warm.

Q: Just keep telling me because I'm doing the hot flash thing.

A: Oh, you are?

Q: Oh, you're a bad indication of where the temperature is.

A: I love heat. That's why I bought my farms in the tropics. I love heat. I live in California for that reason, too.

Q: But you're an ordinary, isn't your blood, you were born in Missouri.

A: I was born in Denver, Colorado in 14 feet of snow. That year with 14 feet of snow.

Q: But you grew up in the north.

A: Yeah, I grew up in Cincinnati. Well, until the age of seven, from the age of three to seven, I even grew up in Tennessee, all near, just near the, you know, near Georgia. I mean, Alabama. I was at Oak Ridge, it was right in there at the lower south end of Tennessee. And then when we moved, I was very sickly, so I hated the cold. Now I can tolerate it, but I don't enjoy it very long.

Q: Cincinnati was not very the same weather. It was just the same.

A: I don't like it. I hated it. I had, you know, all kinds of bone problems. I hated getting up. I was in pain in my joints. Now I get uncomfortable in this knee. You know, this knee still hasn't repaired very well from all that last year of the toxicity before I got those injections, before the detox in this leg. I didn't have any problems. I could handle the cold. And now I'm back to that state of less health. So I don't like to go, to go. So, we'll give you some ice to chew on. Take care of the hot flashes. You can snort some ice chips. That will cool you off. Or ice water, ice milk. So for that four to five hours you do that, you have the fruit, you have the fruit with the fat. If you have a lot of metals in the body, berries are the best thing to remove them. If you have iron and iodine, if you have a lot of orange and rust color in your eyes, strawberries and raspberries are the best. If you have a lot of black in your eyes, tin, gray and black, then you have a lot of tin and mercury, cadmium and lead and other minerals, your dark berries are the best for that, especially blueberries. So you eat the dark berries with the coconut cream and the dairy cream. And you have the coconut cream and the dairy cream with the light berries for the other metals. And also to harness those poisons, have two to three tablespoons of lime juice in that. Very tasty.

Q: What did you say? To cleanse from the heavy metals?

A: No. You're cleansing the berry meal with the coconut cream and dairy cream. Helps remove toxic metals from the body.

Q: And what does the lime juice do?

A: The lime surrounds them so you don't have to use so many fats. Because sometimes people discharge so many poisons and they get very nauseous if they eat too much coconut cream. Or they'll start leaking coconut cream out their eyes. I've seen all sorts of things. So I found that if you put lime juice with the coconut cream, it magnifies the ability to harness metals with less fat. Because remember, like in the book, the recipe book, before I used to say two to four ounces of coconut cream with your fruit. Now I've taken it down to two to three, two and a half to three, maybe four tablespoons at the most. So that's half the coconut cream. But in order to do that, I needed some agent in there that would help handle the heavy metals. Cilantro is not delicious. It's an option. But it's not delicious with fruit. But lime juice is. 

Q: I have a question about cilantro and parsley. When you say to eat these things, which part of it actually? Because I find that cilantro, the leaf, doesn't have any juice or anything, right? It doesn't taste good if it's raw. It's really the steam that's...

A: You need the whole thing.

Q: You put the... wait, you just...

A: No, what you do is on the recipe DVD, I show you how to put the foods in there in what order to get the most of the juice from them.

Q: Because the leaf won't make any juice.

A: Oh, yes they will. If you know how to put it through the juicer. What foods to put through. How to even put it in the juicer. So what else? Let's say you have a back problem. You have back pain, back problem. Papaya is good to help the back cleanse. If you have poor intestines, poor digestions, papaya is very helpful for digesting, building digestive enzymes. So that can help. If you're very toxic in your intestines and you have a lot of hardening in the intestines, then pineapple is good for that, along with the cleaning out of lymphatic congestion. And you can also put a couple of tablespoons of lime juice with the pineapple mixture. I do it. I'm going to surround and bind with as many poisons as possible. And then after your fruit meal, you go four, five, six hours. Again, eating the cheese frequently and drinking, sipping on the milk and the sport formula. Then after that, wait ten minutes. If you need another vegetable juice, if you're feeling very dry and your skin maybe feels dry, time to have another vegetable oil.

Q: Vegetable juice.

A: If not, then don't. Go right to another meat meal. Go from cheese to, ten minutes after that, have another meat meal. Have your butter with the meat meal. Now the butter can be a part of a sauce. And in the recipe book, I have eighty-two sauces for meat that can be made three to five different ways each. So that's over four hundred sauces. Choose the ones you like and make big batches of them and put them in the refrigerator. But for the first at least three, four years on the diet, I suggest that ninety percent of the time, you have butter with your meat meals. Don't have dairy cream with your meat meals unless they're part of a sauce that will help you digest. If there's onion in that sauce, you'll digest the cream. If there's papaya in it, you'll digest the cream. If there isn't, or pineapple with that meat meal, you're not going to digest the cream. If it's sour cream, you'll digest the cream because it's already pre-digested. It'll absorb it fairly easily. Then again, twenty-five minutes after you finish the meat meal, you have a piece of cheese, and then ten minutes after that, you have your cheese and honey together. So you're getting your mineral supplement, concentrated minerals, twice daily, and you're going to need them. And you'll find the muscles will be stronger, you'll be stronger, you'll have more stamina. Everything will be much better. Then in the evening, go back to eating little pieces of cheese with your support formula and milk, all the way up until it's time to go to bed. Now if you have allergies, if you're, you know, have irritation and dryness in your throat or sinuses, you need a milkshake. You need to produce mucus. You're not producing enough mucus. So you need milk, eggs, and cream together, and honey. And even take a little bit of ginger root, and grate a little bit of ginger root in it, just enough to flavor it. Ginger helps stimulate digestion and circulation.

So it's helpful to digest cream. So you have the, you know, the milkshake, have half of it there. Like if you're making, you know, if you're a larger guy, you can have two eggs in it with, you know, an ounce of cream, three ounces of milk, and two eggs, and a tablespoon of honey. Blend that together. You drink a half of it before you go to sleep and a half during the night. Because you do not want to go five hours without eating. If you do, like I said earlier, your red blood cells will eat each other. And then you'll wake exhausted. Because you have anemia. Only way to resolve that is to eat at least every five hours. So wake during the night, eat and go back to sleep. If you're a hyperactive individual that has, let's say, seven to nine or fourteen activity rings, don't wake up after five hours and eat, because you're not going to go back to sleep. It's going to give you too much energy. So you set the alarm for three hours, wake, go back to sleep for five after you eat. And then you'll feel good. I remember one fellow that was a long-term vegetarian. I think he was sixteen years as a vegetarian. He was only forty-six or forty-seven years old, and this was his body. He walked like this. And, you know, he channels an entity called Hilarion. And Hilarion said, there's a diet out there that's raw meat and raw dairy. Go find it and go on that diet before you die. So he found the primal diet, and his entity said, yes, that's the diet. And to this day, seventeen years later, Hilarion still tells everybody to go on the primal diet. He says it's the only perfect diet for the human body and the human spirit. Because your body is your temple. If your temple doesn't work, your spirit is not going to be happy in that temple. The only way to be truly spiritual is to take care of your temple. It even says that in every Bible and whatever it is.

So anyway, he got onto the primal diet, and within two years, popped out strong. It was like he got his age again. So instead of him looking like he was sixty-two, he went down to looking like he was in his mid-forties. But he said to me, and this was at the third time I was going there to Nevada City to do a workshop, and he said, Aajonus, this diet is so great. He said, but I can't, I don't have any energy till like ten o'clock in the morning or noon. And I said, John, are you hearing what I said in each workshop about you can't go five hours without eating? You're obviously going through the night without eating. He said, yes. He said, well, sometimes, you know, there's so much information in a workshop, you can't digest it all. I said, but we've already been to it two times, and that's one of your problems. Why don't you hear that one? I said, try it tonight. Set your arm for three hours or four hours or five hours. Wait, eat, and go back to sleep. He did it. He woke at eight o'clock in the morning and was charged with energy. That was all it took. But he was eating his red blood cells every night. He was anemic. You can't replace red blood cells without the spleen giving them up. And the spleen doesn't give them up unless you're cold or you bled too much. So the spleen isn't just going to be handing out four tablespoons of blood every day because you're an idiot not eating. Your body isn't that stupid.

Q: Is it best to do eggs in the middle of the night or what?

A: That's good. Eggs, meat, whatever works. Just remember eggs alone make you very hungry. It's hard to gain weight eating just eggs, raw eggs. Milkshakes are better if you want to gain weight. But if you suck an egg, you know, you better only sleep about three hours after that. Because you're going to be starved for protein again very quickly. Remember an egg digests in twenty-seven minutes. Milk still takes ten to sixteen hours even if you're only having a half a cup. If you're having a half a milkshake, you're going to be feeding yourself longer for five hours and that's a good thing. 

Q: I was just thinking you don't want to wake up too much so if you can throw a few things in there quickly.

A: Well if you make a milkshake, you know, in the morning and you have half of it before you go to sleep and half of it during the night, that's going to be a good milkshake. Because bacteria is already growing in it, breaking it down, pre-digesting it.

Q: So you make it and leave it at room temperature?

A: I make all of my food for the day first thing in the morning. 

Q: And you don't refrigerate it?

A: I refrigerate the things that need refrigeration. But that's usually very little. My vegetable juices I will keep refrigerated until the time I'm going to use them. Sometimes I won't take the meat out until six hours before I'm going to use it. Sometimes I'll leave it out for days before I use it. And I usually take milk out twelve hours before I'm going to use it. Milkshake, of course, I can be out twenty hours, twenty-four hours before I will drink it. Okay? That's the whole diet. Questions? Oh, wait a minute, still talking about bacteria, parasites, and all that. I did say that they are janitors. I explained how the body works so you understand that. But the difference between parasites, bacteria, fungus, and virus are remarkably different. If you understand them, nobody's going to hoodwink you about what they really do and what they are. Parasites consume one hundred percent of their weight, I mean a hundred times their weight, in twenty-four hours. They only have a one to five percent waste from that. That's an excellent janitor. I want that janitor because that means my body only has to deal with one to five percent of that waste product. That's like somebody coming in and reducing your trash from a hundred pounds to one to five pounds. What do you want to deal with? You want to deal with a hundred pounds of waste or you want to deal with two to five pounds of waste? Give me a parasite. Not easy to get. I've tried thousands of times and only got one once. Literally, I tried thousands of times and only got one once. And then the next are bacteria. They consume 50 times their weight in 24 hours. They have the same ratio of waste, two to five percent only. Again, great, but they can only consume 50 percent of their weight whereas a parasite can consume more. 

Fungus consume about, I think it's 40 times their weight in 24 hours, but their waste is very, very caustic. They don't break it down like bacteria and parasites do. So you notice when you have a fungus, you have a lot of deterioration of the skin. You have itches, you have rashes, you have peeling of the skin. So when you have a fungus working, it's a good thing, but you need to apply a mixture of like half bone marrow, half butter on that area to penetrate and strengthen those skin cells so when those toxins come through as a waste product from the fungus, it won't damage your skin as much. Then we have virus. Virus are not alive. They knew that 30 years ago. Between 30 and 60 years ago, the pharmaceutical and medical industry acknowledged that virus are not alive. No point in giving an antibiotic. You have to let a flu run its course. They found that with several diseases that were viral in nature, you can't do anything about them. You have to let them run their course and they will. Virus is the body making solvents. Cells make soaps. Soaps that are so caustic like muriatic acid that will dissolve organic dead tissue. If they're so toxic that parasites, bacteria and fungus can't eat them, how are you going to get rid of and dissolve that tissue? Are you going to call a laboratory and give yourself some kerosene and gasoline? Are you going to drink it? No. Your cells have to make a similar compound that is natural. It's a solvent and it dissolves cells. Hydrochloric acid is something you can make. You can make an alcohol that's very similar to kerosene and break it down, but it is a natural one formed in the body, not the natural one from the earth, which is very poisonous.

So the body takes the solvent, dissolves dead cells or particles of dead cells, and then what you have is a soup of toxic organic waste. Viruses are not alive, so the waste is not reduced. It's like taking muriatic acid and cleaning the grease off of your garage floor. You add water to it to help dissolve it, right? Water is a solvent. It's not a nutrient, it's a solvent. It dissolves rocks so plants can eat. It rots anything in the ocean. It dissolves stuff. It's a solvent. So you put one solvent with another solvent and it disperses easily in the solvent water. So it makes it much more potent. If you tried to clean your clothes with pure detergent, what's going to happen? You're not going to get the dirt out of it. You're just going to saturate it with soap. Your clothes with soap. You're not going to get it out. You're going to wash it 50, 60 times to get all the soap out of it. When you use a little soap in water, it permeates and breaks down fat molecules and dirt molecules, breaks it down so you can get rid of it. Water is the main solvent. So what happens after you've cleaned your garage floor of grease? You have this muriatic acid in a solution of water. Now you've got all this 2.5 gallons of contaminated water. It hasn't been reduced to 2 to 5% anymore, or to about 10% like fungus did. You have a complete toxic liquid mess, pollutant. How do you deal with it? You try to bury it. It won't get into a well system. You try to put it in sand. Best thing to do, you put it in sand. In the human body, you have solvents that are made called virus. It dissolves the compound, whatever it is, but you have a very thick amount of toxic water, fluids in the body. Take the difference between bacterial meningitis and viral meningitis. What happens in bacterial meningitis? The bacteria eats the meninges of the brain, whether it's cerebral or spinal, eats the lining of the nerves or the brain, eats the dead cells there, and reduces the toxicity. No swelling.

When you have a virus, you have this tremendous swelling with meningitis, so you have paralysis frequently, especially the pharmaceutical industry, medical industry, shooting you up with antibiotics. They should be giving an antibiotic for a virus, for meningitis. Even the IV that you inject into you, even if they're only doing that, you're going to be swelling. All of a sudden, you rupture the spinal cord or the brain, and you have a stroke, and you're paralyzed. That doesn't happen with bacterial meningitis. Only with viral meningitis. So, under the stand between the difference. You get a virus, you're going to have a lot of fluid waste that's very toxic. You get into a hot bath many times a day to get that stuff out of the system, so it doesn't start dissolving healthy tissue in your body. If you can't get into a tub, you don't have a tub, and you only have a shower, you get seven hot water bottles. Everybody should have seven hot water bottles. If you don't have a hot tub, and you want to sleep, and you don't have time to take a bath, a 90-minute bath, you take those seven hot water bottles, and you make your bed a hot chamber. You take those hot water bottles, and you fill them to about 130, 537 degrees. You put that in a flannel pillowcase. That lowers the temperature of broadcast, it lowers the broadcast temperature to about 110, but it will keep the hot water bottle warm and hot during the night two to three hours longer. If the hot water is exposed on its own, the heat evaporates fast from it. It isn't thermally isolated and hermetically sealed. The hot water bottle will last two, two and a half hours under the covers. Wrapped in a hot water bottle, that's five to seven hours. Still warm.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No no. What you do... everyone likes to jump ahead. First of all, you put three beach towels underneath you on the bed so you don't perspire and make molds grow in your mattress. I had that happen. Very awful. Stinks. I had to throw the darn thing away. It was so bad. Moldy, so bad. The molds are terrible. Every time you go to sleep, the mold, you're smelling stinky. So you put three beach towels down. Then you take one hot water bottle in the flannel pillowcase. You can use a regular pillowcase, but it isn't going to heat as long. Half as long as regular sheet pillowcases. You put one hot water bottle between the calves, one between the thighs, one in each hip, one under each arm, all where the lymph glands are. You notice that most of these are where the lymph glands are. Since you have a lot of lymph networks going down the legs and you have narrower circulation, you need the heat down in that area. Then the neck is the next area. You only put one on the neck area, unless you want headaches and all kinds of problems. So you just put one on the face and neck, on one side. The next night you put it on the other side of your neck and face. And then you just melt away your lymphatic congestion. You perspire out your viral detoxification. And that's the way to do it. I like water. I like feeling buoyant. When I'm in a bed with all these heavy water bottles and I can't move much, it doesn't make me feel free. It certainly makes you healthy, but it's not as free feeling. You know that song, Free Falling? So I get into a bath. I like my steady, hot bath. But right now, I'm in a place where I have no bath tub. So I have my seven hot water bottles. And then you put a towel over that or a silk blanket or cloth. The reason silk, because silk doesn't hold fluid. It evaporates. It allows the moisture to go away.

So that's what's not dripping down to the three beach towels below you is going to be evaporating up out of your bed. If you have, let's say, a cotton towel or cotton sheets above you, they are going to be wet. You're going to have to dry them the next day, like you're going to have to dry your towels. Or you put another beach towel over you and let that absorb the fluids. If it's cold, I will put long johns on, long underwear and let that absorb it, as well as having towels underneath me and over me. I want to stay a little warmer if it's cold. You can still do the same if it's very hot, but the body sometimes feels a little bit less claustrophobic when it's warm, if you're naked underneath. That's up to you. Now, water is a solvent, like I said. Not a good idea to have much water. You will need a little water to help dissolve certain chemicals, compounds in your body. So usually, you should have more than three quarters of a cup of water a day, you should have no more than probably half a cup of water a day. And sip it, a tablespoon at a time, no more than two tablespoons at a time. Or you have it in the sport formula. If you use water in your sport formula, then that's an option. But no more than three quarters of a cup for you, no more than half a cup for you, in the sport formula. So that's sipping your water, pure water, a little at a time. Now, salt is the second worst thing to cooking your food. Salt is an explosive. It's more explosive than nitroglycerin when sodium is isolated. The U.S. military and the NSA paid General Electric two billion dollars to make sodium into a weapon. My father... That was one of the projects they worked on for the military, working for General Electric. They spent two billion dollars, found that they cannot harness it because a pure crystal of sodium will ignite with only a one-and-a-half degree temperature change. Much more volatile than nitroglycerin.

They also found that a crystal this big, the size of a football, would take out all of New York City, all of the buildings, one. So about fifty times more powerful than a hydrogen bomb, but they can't harness it. When it gets into your body, your body isolates, separates the sodium from the potassium bond, if it's table salt or if you're adding potassium, sodium-potassium combination, which is salt peter, which they use in water systems to make the water softer. Different ways that the body can take in sodium, and when it gets into the blood, it isolates it. It will isolate a lot in the intestinal tract, so you have all these explosions going on in your blood and intestines. So what happens to food in the blood? You've got a smorgasbord of nutrients, anywhere from 96 to 117 nutrients that a cell will eat. You've got vitamins, enzymes, proteins, carbohydrates, very little of them, carbohydrates. All of the nutrients, all of the vitamins, any nutrient that we can have, the cells have it available in the blood. If you have sodium ion, concentrated sodium ions, ions even though it's only five, it explodes near a cell, it kills the cell. It explodes near these smorgasbord of nutrients, fragments it into smaller particles. So if a cell opens to eat, draw in the nutrients, it's going to get fifth, third, half, three-quarters of the nutrients that would be a balanced diet for it. A complete balanced diet for it. So all of the cells will start becoming malnourished. And that's what salt does. Salt screws with the brain terribly. People who don't focus, who go off, a lot of the people who go off of this diet, although they've been on it for ten to twelve years, always when they start eating salt. But it's sea salt. Somebody talks them into thinking that they need sea salt. And it's the biggest hoax in the world, produced by the King and Queen of England when they caught people doing it in India.

Oh, man, that changes the flavor of your food. And you know, most people like cooked food, and cooked foods are pretty bland and nasty unless you have many spices in them. And you can't see anybody putting more spices in their foods other than Indians from India. I mean, they've got, what, eighty different spices that they put in their food, and salt was one of them. Salt was easy to make. You didn't have to grow anything. You just go to the ocean, separate the salt water. You keep brushing it out, brushing it out, and then you dry it, and there you have salt. It's pretty simple. You have salt in two days. Not much sunshine, let's say five days a week to a week to make it. But it's fast, very fast.

Q: So what do you do for salt cravings, then?

A: Well, you have plenty of foods which are high in sodium. You've got tomatoes, you've got avocados, watermelon, celery. So, juice.

Q: What about eggs? Eggs work pretty good.

A: Well, eggs are high in sulfur, not really high in that much high in sodium.

Q: Tastes salty.

A: I know, but a lot of your minerals taste salty. It doesn't have to be just sodium.

Q: Yeah, but that's what the craving is. It's like a taste for something salty.

A: No, you're craving minerals. Most people go for salt because that's what's been isolated and separated for them. Even if it's sea salt, they say, we have all other minerals in it, but not in concentration. Your sodium is the thing that's concentrated and not healthfully. 

A: Well, if you have a craving for something salty, something that tastes salty would do, right?

A: Yeah. Mineral, cheese, best way to get rid of it. Cheese and honey, you want minerals. Oysters, if you want protein with it. So, salt is a very dangerous substance. It also causes dehydration in cells. Because when sodium ions come, the cell goes to open, it's got only one or two ions inside it. And it magnetizes that group of very light weight ions that has all the nutrients inside. So, let's say your cell is this big and this morgue is full of 117 nutrients, it's about the size of a marble. That's what it takes in, that feeds the whole cell. Sometimes the nutrients will be as big as my fist, but the cell is this big. It takes in those nutrients and doesn't eat for maybe another five hours. And so it eats like every five hours or so. Sometimes it only has a small amount of nutrients or it has sodium concentration in the blood when the cell goes to open up to eat. The sodium ions are bound. The magnetism is greater outside. Pulling the sodium ions have a great deal of magnetism. So, they will pull the ions outside of the cell, out of the cell. The gut of the cell and the cell can never eat again, anything. So, it shrivels like a grape to a raisin and that's the end of the cell. So, one little bitty grain of salt can destroy one million red blood cells. Sodium is a very, very bad thing when it's outside of a living food. Living means not cooked and not dehydrated. 

Q: So, why do animals go to salt licks then?

A: Well, that's only unnatural ones. Out in the wild they don't. Once in a while they might. Animals out in the wild may go five, six months without ever drinking water. Maybe they'll run across a salt rock or an area where rain has caused minerals to cluster. They'll go over and lick that, but maybe it's mostly calcium or phosphorus or magnesium. And that's what they lick, or clay. That's what they're licking. They're not going for sodium, they're going for minerals. And it's usually in a drought season that they'll go for that. Normally they won't. Domesticated animals will go for all the time because they're fed only cooked, processed food. No water bound to it, to the ions in it. Everything's denatured and they're starving and dehydrating. So, you know, a processed, domesticated food eater will crave all kinds of bad things, and eat all kinds of bad things, because their instincts are messed up. Okay, questions?

Q: I have a pile. A simple one first. You don't recommend eating vegetables, but a lot of your recipes have vegetables in them, like onions, for example. It's a vegetable, yes?

A: Like I said in my book, if you only use two tablespoons per meat meal, it's not going to be a problem. You're only using enough to flavor it. When I make a meat meal for myself and I use onion, I use less than a teaspoon. And I chop it very finely because it's too powerful for me. It'll make me hungry quickly. I'll digest the meat so fast that I'm too hungry. So I can't eat a lot. The gorillas, when they eat meat, they'll eat whole onions, but they eat 13 to 14 pounds of meat at one time. It's like their periods, they will only eat meat once every 28 days. 

Q: And fruit, the rest?

A: They eat green bananas and leaves. They'll chew the leaves and spit out the pulp. They don't digest it. They only drink the juice of the leaves. But they'll eat the whole peel and everything of the green bananas. It's so alamine. I can't get enough saliva to do that, but they salivate tremendously. But, you know, some of those, like the silverback gorillas, may eat 20 pounds of meat in 48 hours.

Q: You never eat salads, then? Green salads?

A: I never eat salads. Never.

Q: But fruit salads like tomato, cucumber, red pepper, you would eat?

A: Well, those are bland fruits. I might eat that. I don't. But I may eat that once in a while.

Q: But regular green salads you would never eat?

A: Never.

Q: Even with cheese added to it?

A: No. You've got highly alkalinizing substances in there. It takes an herbivore with an alkalinizing digestive tract to digest it. Ours is entirely acidic. Our bile is very acidic. Our hydrochloric acid is acidic. Our intestinal bacteria is 92% acidic bacteria. We only have 8% alkalinizing bacteria. So we can handle 5% fruits and maybe a little vegetable juice. That's about it. If you put that pulp in there, it's going to destroy, neutralize some of the acidic digestive juices and neutralize the acidic bacteria. So you're going to digest half of your milk, half of your meat? Not a good thing. You drink your vegetable juices. The things you can digest that won't turn the digestive tract by continuing all the way through. If you're drinking your vegetable juice and you have a green bowel movement, that means you're not doing well. It's alkalinizing. You're not even having the small amount of pulp, you know, digesting the small amount of pulp in the vegetable juice. You need to strain it, like through a cheesecloth or a t-shirt like that, organic. Strain it through. It can make it colorful and interesting. But just strain it through and get that pulp out of there. Because you're not digesting it, it'll interfere with the digestion of the animal cell food that you're eating, whether it's egg, milk, or dairy, or meat. It'll lower the digestibility. Now some people who have really dark brown around their, they're not supposed to have brown eyes, dark brown around the pupil. The salad every night's not going to hurt them, but it cannot be preceding meat. It has to be way after meat. The last meal of the day, the salad, the green vegetable salad. Because no acid, acidic food is going to fall behind it, except in the middle of the night when you have an egg, or some milk, or a milkshake during the middle of the night to provide some protein. It's mostly if you're doing eggs and milk and milkshake, it's not going to catch up with that salad. You've had at least five hours.

If you have it, let's say, two hours before you go to sleep or an hour before you go to sleep, it's going to be six hours, maybe seven hours that that vegetation has gone through, and it goes through slowly. Before that, that food will be far enough long that when you eat the egg, the milk, or the milkshake during the middle of the night, it's not going to catch up with the alkalinizing food. And you will have restored the natural acidic environment of your intestinal tract and stomach. Because we are supposed to have 5.5 acidic level blood, urine, and saliva.

Q: So why do naturopaths say seven?

A: Because they're full of shit. Because they've got this concept that the body will heal itself by alkalinizing itself. But that's herbivore. Those are animals that eat vegetation, not humans.

Q: So you don't recommend naturopaths then?

A: No, not at all. They're just chemical animals.

Q: They prescribe digestive enzymes, right?

A: Yeah, digestive enzymes that have been treated with kerosene. If they've taken, let's say, bromelain or papain from papaya or pineapple, what did they do? They dissolved it in kerosene first. Two to four days. Extract the bromelain and papain out of it. So what's in the papain and bromelain? Kerosene.

Q: And what does that do to your body?

A: Poisons it. It attacks the adrenal glands. Gives you a high.

Q: Is it like a heavy metal?

A: No, it's a solvent that eats your tissue away. Put gasoline or kerosene on your hand and see if it just dries it out and dissolves it. Kills the cells, like burns it.

Q: So same thing with the probiotics that they offer?

A: Absolutely.

Q: All that acidophilus?

A: All of it's treated.

Q: So you were saying earlier about the, you know, we're in fight or flight most of the time, and we all get excess adrenaline, we should work out. Are we all in that kind of mode, where we're pumping a lot of adrenaline into our system? No, somebody is lethargic, has chronic fatigue. And you said that now that they can't digest anything and it totally burns out.

A: Well, I said some people. Some people wouldn't get like that, yeah.

Q: So at that state, can they rebuild on this diet?

A: Well, if they can digest the eggs at least, yeah.

Q: And then eventually add papaya?

A: Eventually what?

Q: Add papaya and cultured foods?

A: Yeah. Well let me give you an example. Now I suck, I don't drink, but listen. 

Q: Like a baby.

A: I'm usually not that noisy, but I wanted to demonstrate. I'm sucking it through my teeth. Get that saliva. See, my saliva keeps pouring and pouring into my mouth, even after I'd stopped sucking. That's why you see me once in a while drooling a little bit after I sucked an egg. You know, I'm talking when my mouth is still salivating, getting more of that bacteria down. If I gulp, that'll never happen. I won't salivate. Do you notice that when you gulp, you don't salivate? But when you suck, you'll salivate. It's like chewing. If you just swallow your food, you're not going to salivate. If you chew your food, you're going to salivate. So about ten years ago, my mother stopped eating. And my brother, younger brother, called me and said, you should come. Mom's going to die in the next few days. She stopped eating. And I said, she's got to have some meat. No, she stopped eating three months ago. Okay, why the fuck didn't anybody call me? Why are you waiting until now to call me and tell me that she hasn't been eating for three months? You know this is my work. I said, you know, now I've got her in a state where she's only skin on bones and her flesh is hanging down and you don't call me? So I flew back there and I fed her my custard. Papaya, eggs, butter, and honey. So, and just a tiny bit of ginger to stimulate digestion circulation. So I fed her one of those in the morning. She ate four meals that day. The next day I fed her another one. She ate four meals that day. The next day she wouldn't eat another custard. So I gave her a half a cup of just papaya. Ripe papaya. She ate four meals that day. So I stayed there 12 days. She put on 10 pounds in 12 days. And everything was okay. And I said to my father, I said, now you have to feed her for a whole 30 days this papaya. And if she stops eating again, you have to get the papaya and feed it to her. And it can't be, you know, fermented ripe, but just barely soft ripe, and it'll be fine. And he said, okay, okay. I get a call three weeks later, well, mom stopped eating again. I said, are you feeding her the papaya? No.

Feed her to go to the jungle gyms and get the fricking ripe papaya. And feed her just a half a cup of that the first thing in the morning. She lived another 10 years. She just died last year, last February, you know. And the reason she died? The doctors told her that she had breast cancer, that she had one lymph gland that was swollen and hardened and was cancerous because they did a biopsy on her. I said, mom, you're a nurse. They want to do a lymphectomy on you? They want to take out 11 lymph nodes, I mean lymph glands, around your breast. The lymph gland is responsible for cleaning dead cells out of the body and waste. You remove 11 lymph glands, where is your body going to go when you breathe in something toxic? Where is it going to go? Is it going to go under your arms? Is it going to go into your neck? You won't have them there to prevent cancer. What if you get cancer in your mammary gland because you don't have ability to clean the dead cells because you're missing your lymph glands there? Oh, well, the doctors know what they're doing. I said, Mom, you've been around the doctors all your life. You know what they did to me. Oh, yeah, but they're better nowadays. They've got better science. They've got pinpoint radiation. I say, you mean you're going to do radiation too? Yeah, I'm going to have 11 lymph glands taken out, a lumpectomy they call it, and then I'm going to have pinpoint radiation. I said, what's behind your breasts? And she said, my lungs. And I said, your lungs are going to get irradiated, just like when they irradiated my stomach, they cauterized my spine and freaked me out for 15 years, or 30 some years I was in pain.

Finally stopped when I started eating the cheese and honey, and I put that together. I mean, I didn't have to deal with it for 24 hours a day, but when I was using my arms like juicing, I had a lot of pain in my back, and that's the point where the pivoted, because they were going like this. So there was a point in my back that was always getting the same amount of radiation as the machine would go over it. So my mom says, no, they have pinpoint radiation now. It doesn't go any deeper. I said, okay, mom, you know, it's your life. I had to get sick, too. I had to do stupid, crazy things. Well, respect it. I said, okay, I'll respect it. Okay. She was on oxygen for eight years. Pinpoint radiation. They're so full of shit. I wish they were full of shit. They'd be smarter. They're so full of toxic chemicals. They don't have a clue. They lie to people about everything. Lie, lie, lie. And then she got an ear infection. She had a colloquial, whatever they call it, implant for hearing aid into her skull attached to the brain, directly to the brain. Well, she got a little infection there. All you had to do was put lime juice on it. They gave her antibiotics. Nine months of antibiotics. Nine months of antibiotics. She stopped digesting again. Couldn't pull her out of it. She died. That's how she died, on oxygen and unable to eat. One time I said that to a doctor and he said, oh, well, we don't swear on the Bible or anything. Hello? The thinking. I mean, it's like, okay. Belong in front of a firing squad. All the murdering these people do. Okay, other questions? Anybody over here?

Q: So, you gave a schedule for eating and I was wondering if you have any suggestions for where's the best place to put a hot bath within that schedule?

A: Well, I used to believe it was in the afternoon because when I experimented with some people, they had it in the morning. They had no energy for the rest of the day to be active. Then it was in the afternoon. It was good because they could, you know, catnap in the bath and then they'd have their working day behind them and then be able to relax in the evening. I found that people weren't able to do the afternoon bath unless they were retired. So, I said, well, go to sleep. First hour and a half of your sleep if you have a hot tub. Put it in, you know, 40.5 degrees, 40.5 centigrade, which is 105 degrees Fahrenheit, and let them go to sleep in it for 90 minutes. Settle down, get out, go to bed. Or stay in it all night if you want.

Q: Can I ask a related question about hot tubs? So, I've been doing some research into buying one and most of them offer some kind of toxic chemical like chlorine or bromine to clean it. So, obviously, I don't want that. But then...

A: All it takes is sand.

Q: Sand. But I'm thinking, so if I'm perspiring toxins into that water on a regular basis, then would I have to change that water?

A: Sand. Yeah, you have to change the water. On my outdoor hot tub when I was at the house, when I built it, I built a huge one that held about 12, 13 people. I was going to have parties and friends over and get well together. But I was so far out in Malibu, nobody wanted to spend an hour going out 45 minutes to an hour coming out of L.A. So that lasted a few weeks only. But what I did was I built, I got a huge 300-pound sand filter that goes to a swimming pool. And you put the sand in there, it makes the water crystal clear. It filters every toxin out of it, every waste product out of it. So the water is crystal clear. But it will allow the algae to grow in the hot tub. So what does the algae do? The algae grows long tentacles and you lie on it, it's so soft, and it draws metals out of your body because that's what algae does. Algae eats rock. So you can have crystal clear water, it doesn't stink with the sand. And I had it for 12 years and never changed the sand once. And I would put coconut cream in it because I bathed in coconut cream, washed my hair with fermented foul-smelling coconut cream, and I put vinegar in it, everything. The sand is a miraculous cleaner. You can go on the internet and look up sand filters, you know, demonstration, like video of. And there's this one India guy who has a plastic container of sand and he fills it with water and then takes oil, old car oil, used car oil from a car, black, thick with carbon and stuff, dumps it in there and the water, you see the water is just all murky and terrible. And then he's got the way the water passes through the sand and out, crystal clear, and he drinks it. And you watch him do the whole freaking thing right there. And let me tell you, working with that sand filter for twelve years and watching that water, no matter what I put in that water, sometimes I'd pick sage and put it in the water and let it rot for a week or two in there and keep that water crystal clear.

Q: Can you talk about pregnant women and sushi and raw dairy?

A: That's all. Raw meat doesn't create any diseases. Let me give you an example. In 2007, I was giving, I was going to give a workshop in Cincinnati, Ohio. And there was these three couples there that had to personally thank me when I got there. They were waiting, you know, like, you know, like I had droopies or something. And, you know, these are mature individuals, mature couples. Each one of them had a baby in a crib. The oldest couple there, they were in their late, he was in his early 40s, she was in her late 30s. They tried to have a baby for 7, 16 years. Spent over 200 and some thousand dollars at fertility clinics. No baby. Another couple that had tried for 8 years, no baby. And spent almost 100 grand. Another couple that had tried for 5 years, spent 50 grand, no baby. One of them heard about my diet that, you know, she was on the diet and she had a baby almost instantly. So they went on the diet and started with milkshakes. The couple was pregnant in one month, one month, just on the milkshakes, the raw eggs and the raw milk. So they went to their fertility clinic to tell these two couples that they had become friends with over those years, that maybe this diet would do it. Each couple got pregnant only a month on the diet, eating mainly milkshakes.

Q: So what about parasites and raw fish?

A: That's all fallacy. I've eaten chicken, I've eaten chicken with parasites, I've eaten meat with parasites, beef with parasites, lamb with parasites, lamb's brain with parasites, pig's brain with parasites, and never got one parasite. I was trying to induce parasites in me, because I knew they cleaned up toxicity in dead cells quicker. I couldn't get one. I've had thousands of people try. It's all a propaganda, it's all a lie. They want you eating cooked foods. They want you sick and going to the doctors, and taking medication. They want you eating and eating foods that don't gratify you, so you'll keep eating. It's all bull crap. You have people on this diet who are bulimic, and always starting to get on this diet, and all of a sudden, oh my God, they're not hungry all the time, they're satisfied. They can go a day sometimes without eating, I don't recommend it, but they can go a day without eating, when they used to eat all day long, until they vomited. When I was a fruitarian, I was bulimic. I would eat sometimes, you know, 27 pounds of food a day, and be vomiting and still hungry. You have to get rid of all that nonsense. Like I said, 99% of what you hear from the medical profession, the pharmaceutical industry, is exactly the opposite of what they say. Do the opposite, all the time. You'll only be wrong one out of a hundred times.

Q: I think part of the problem with sushi, is people are getting it in restaurants, and it's very low quality. It's coming out of farms, it's not clean.

A: And they have ammonia and bleaches cleaning the surfaces, they're not rinsed properly, so you get that into it. I stopped going to sushi bars because of that. If I go to a sushi bar, I will go to a so-called non-affluent area, where they're doing it just bacterial style, the old way, where you know there's full of bacteria on it. And when I go to Asia, I only buy the meat out in the market, if I see insects on it, that's the meat I want. I won't go in a grocery store, because I know they put formaldehyde, they put ammonia, they put bleach in that food. I shop where there's bugs, there's rats, there's everything. I've got big ones at my farm in Thailand and they eat them, they eat the big ones, they don't eat the small ones, but they eat the big ones. I haven't eaten them.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, no, no, these are forest rats, they're not eating pollution, they're eating whatever's out there, bugs.

Q: What's the grossest animal you ate?

A: Tarantula. Pop the poison gland off of it. Scorpion was the next. Next probably snake, but I've eaten a lot of snake.

Q: What about appendix, because I had my appendix removed, or they removed it because it was safe.

A: Thank you for reminding me, I forgot all that.

Q: He was saying something before, but now what happened.

A: The appendix is a library of every foreign object that's been in the body. So if you've had a bacteria that's foreign to you, like a poison mushroom or anything like that, the body analyzes it, knows what to do about it, it records it in the appendix. So if it ever enters the body again, your body knows what to do about it in minutes. If you don't have an appendix, your body may take 36 hours to analyze what to do about it again. So if you don't have an appendix, you're in grave danger.

Q: Because you know what's actually happening? I went on, well, not the raw food, but like trying, what's his name, Marcus Raffquanz, he's doing, he's relaxing, have everything in a blender and to like, you know, so you can digest the stuff. And I was trying to do that and eat like raw as much as I could, but I got kind of really weak. And also my appendix, whenever I eat certain things, I'm not quite sure what, I feel that pain where the scar was. And I'm not sure should I worry, is there like something growing there, but I don't know.

A: Well, your appendix may be trying to regrow. At 50 years to the week that I got my tonsils removed, I grew half of one back. I got my tonsils removed at three years old and to that week, 50 years later, I grew a half of one back. I had a sore throat and all kinds of nasty taste. I went to look at my throat. It was a shiny flashlight. I looked in the mirror and there was a half a tonsil, a half a healthy tonsil. I said, whoa, this is great. So who knows, maybe your appendix is starting to grow back a little bit.

Q: That would be amazing.

A: But the body has another, mine's grown back and I was unaware of it. Last year, I had the house built in Thailand and I had down pillows and my sheets, old organic cotton sheets in a box ready to pull out. I got the organic cotton sheets from Turkey. They make very good quality weavings of organic fibers and very nice. I wanted them for my new home. And I opened the box after the house was built, put the bed in, the wood bed in, and put my futon down that I had made futons there, all cotton futon, and then was going to put the sheets on with my pillows. And I grabbed the pillows which were on top, grabbed one out like this, and then I felt this sting in my arm. I thought, oh crap, so I pulled the pillow away and there's this tiny scorpion about an inch long that had stung me, and those are the deadly ones. They say because the older it gets, the more diluted the venom gets, but in the infants there's no dilution. So those are the ones that will kill you. So I said, oh crap. I didn't think it was going to kill me, I just didn't know what I was in for. So the sensation, numbing, swelling, went down the hand, back up the arm, and down the side. This was over a 24 hour period, but no real great swelling and no pussing, no breaking out of the skin or anything. It was mainly internal nerve feeling, the arm was real heavy, tingling, that kind of thing, and hot. And it was gone in about 24 hours. So I said, wow, that's cool. You know, I did put some lime juice on the area and around there, because I knew that would help neutralize some of the poisons. So five days later, I'm going to do some work, so I put my gloves on, my leather gloves, and I feel a sting here. Pull it up, sure enough, another one, even smaller than an inch, had stung me right there. I thought, oh, crap, another 24 hours. And I'm thinking, well, if it doesn't on top of the same arm, maybe it will be more worse. It lasted only three hours. It didn't go all the way up my arm, it just stayed localized here. Then five days later, I get stung again. So I shake my clothes out, I shake my shoes out, everything gets shaken before I put anything on in Thailand. And it stung me here, same arm. And ten minutes, sensation was gone. And again, it was a little one. So even though I may not have an appendix still, my body is responding quicker. Because that's the first time I've ever been stung by a scorpion.

Q: How about comfort food? Is it all right once in a while to have a baked potato or a baked sweet potato with lots of butter?

A: Yeah, that's up to you. Just know that any time you consume cooked food, you've got 32 toxins that you put in your body that your body has to deal with. So you've got to train up some energy for the comfort. You have to weigh it. I stopped doing that in 74. I committed to all raw foods in February of 72. But I just decided, you know, every time I cheated, which wasn't frequently, probably cheated 10 times in that two years. But I noticed that when I cheated, I slept more that night. I had less energy for the next one or two days, three days even. I thought for a freaking 10, 20 minute meal, even if I eat it slowly, it takes me 20 minutes. I'm going to take 20 minutes of enjoyment for a loss of energy, time, and productivity in my life. Screw that. I'm not that dumb. But that was my choice for me. I don't think it's dumb for other people because other people value their taste buds more than I do. It's not dumb for them, but it would be dumb for me. So I'm not judging other people. I'm just saying for me, that was my analysis about me. But there's other people that I say, go do it. You'd make yourself crazy if you don't do it. And then you go off on a binge. So have it when you want it. Just make sure you're eating something to help protect you from those toxins that they produce. And it's up to each individual how healthy you want to be. Just remember that every time you eat a raw food, easy to digest. You're not spending your body's a lot of energy on it. And it'll give you energy. When you eat a cooked food, it's going to take energy away from you. And it's going to be difficult to digest. And we won't feel as comforted here, you know, in the long run. So you have to decide what your comfort level is. There are people that only enjoy doing this diet 50%. But they like that gained health. And it is gained health. Better than just the donuts.

Like, I lived on donuts and RC Cola and Sprite. And I put them in a blender. I had all of my gums, you know, my bones rotted after the radiation therapy. I had to blend everything. And donuts were my favorite. Donuts and rice and sugar crisp. And I put two to three tablespoons of sugar on top of that. And had it in skim milk. Or in Sprite. Or RC Cola. So then I blended it in a blender and sucked that out. Because any time I bought a bit on my own teeth after the radiation therapy, I bled. I was getting one to two transfusions a week. So I had to blend my food. And that was my diet until that young African American boy, 18-year-old black guy, 18 years old, turned me on to raw carrot juice and raw milk. How the hell does he know this? You know, it changed my life. Took me out of autism, put me on the right path to getting well. After a year of drinking mainly milk with, let's say, one-third carrot juice to two-thirds milk, my bone drew back around my teeth. They wanted to pull all my teeth. Three weeks before they were going to put me in the grave. Well, let's remove all the teeth so you stop bleeding. Wait a minute, I'm going to suffer extraction of all the freaking teeth in my mouth.  And then you're going to bury me? Are you stupid? Are you completely insane? No, they are. They are completely insane.

Q: Do you ever have, you know, like people with young kids who did that? Like families with young children?

A: Oh, many. Many families with children. And they, you know, it depends on their upbringing and their taste buds and what they will eat. But most of the children born on the diet stay on the diet. Very bright children. I have several children who grew up on a vegan diet and they don't like the raw meat diet, the raw food diet. They like the milkshakes, but they don't like the raw meat because their body never developed. I mean, they were born vegetarian, vegan. The mother was a, you know, six foot tall bean pole. Now she's been a raw fooder for, what, 15 years? 12 to 15 years. And she's a bear of a woman. And she takes care of five children, her five children. She takes care of a big house. She takes care of a co-op with 400 members every week. She goes to the farm and she gets the product. She makes it available. She puts it all out. She takes their orders. She sends the orders in. When she gets the product, she separates it into bags for the people. And she makes all these delicious gourmet foods from my recipe book. Strawberry cheesecake, you know, cherry pies, all these elaborate, you know, chocolate parfaits, you know, chocolate fudge. But she does it all the way I instruct to do it. And she does all of this and sleeps only five hours a day. And she's like 170 pounds overweight. But she's got all that fat protecting her from being this skinny vegan that couldn't do hardly anything. Was very, very sick. And now she's on this diet. I mean, her three oldest kids that were vegetarians have problems with eating this diet because they were brought up not to have the natural human bacteria. They still drink the raw milk. They drink the raw milkshakes. But getting them to eat the raw meat, they won't do it. The babies do. The three, the two babies, well, one's five now and one's seven. They'll eat all the meat in the world. All the raw eggs and all the raw milk. And of course, they're the healthiest.

Q: I have a few questions. Like you said, to eat just a cube of cheese. I've tried that before. I find that I can't do it because I end up eating the whole block of cheese.

A: But you do it throughout the day.

Q: No, I can while I start eating. Same thing with milk or any dairy product. When I start, I can't stop. So I can drink this thing.

A: That's because you're so freaking skinny at the start.

Q: Sure, but it doesn't seem to change if I do it for many days after. I mean, even many months. I mean, it's like always milk.

A: Well, I haven't put you on a diet. If I put you on a diet, it would be different.

Q: Yeah, but I'm saying that if you do that, what's the problem then? What's the danger really?

A: Well, it'll just take all your digestive juices and acids and dry you out quite a bit.

Q: Does that mean that it won't work?

A: Well, no, you'll still work, but you're just filling yourself all at one time. So, you're going to pull only so many toxins out of the stomach and intestines with one bowl of cheese going through there. And you need it going through often because it's always sloughing off dead cells with toxins that have been built into the intestinal walls and in the mucous. So, it's going to take care of one bowl going through, and you're really not going to digest it unless you're eating it with honey. If you sit down and eat a block of cheese with honey, you're going to digest it and you'll do good. But when you eat the honey, the cheese without honey to remove poisons, that's the object of that. But if you're starved for minerals, you're starved for any food. If I were you, I would sit down. I had a model from New Zealand, six foot tall, as skinny as a bean pole, like Twiggy. And I dated her one night, and I never called her again. You know, I took her to Butterflies Are Free, the opening. And, you know, we were walking out the back of the theater, because I was still very ill at that time. This was 1970, what was it, 1972. And I was still ill with my cancer. I was recovering, but still pretty ill. And I didn't want to go out with all the paparazzis, because all the flashing gave me a headache. So I took her out to the back way of this new theater. It was the first multiple theater in the world. And it was a Cineplex from Canada, Cineplex Corporation from Canada that built this triplex theater. So this was the first multiplex. Only three, now they have 24 and 27 and all kinds of numbers of theaters. And it was just being built, so only the main theater was open for the opening of this Butterflies Are Free film. And I didn't want to go. So we went out the back way, and there was all this construction material in the back. And then the door was shutting down. Justin, her manager, and my publicity agent, the head of MGM, was with us. And I said, don't let the door close, just in case we can't get out of here. Twiggy freaking panicked, screaming at the top of her lungs.

We couldn't get her to stop. She had no fat on her body, nothing to buffer the information going to her brain. And that's a problem with very thin people. They have buttons that are easy to push, and they overreact, because there's no fats to buffer the information in the system. Also, people will have appetites out of this world. So what I got this New Zealand model to do that was as thin and as volatile as Twiggy, I let her sit down with a whole brick of cheese and eat it with a half a cup of honey. She did it again five hours later. She did it again five hours later. She did it for 30 days, mainly ate cheese and honey. She gained 50 pounds and it took her 30 days to calm down and get fine and gain enough weight.

Q: I really don't get the honey part because I really don't like it. I've tried it with dairy before and it's not working at all. I like dairy. I can drink a lot. I can eat a lot. I don't see any problem digesting any of it.

A: You don't digest the cheese. If you eat that much cheese you gain weight. You can't digest cheese, it's dehydrated. There are no, as I said earlier, there are no bioactive enzymes and there are no bioactive bacteria in cheese.

Q: Yeah, but honey is really the worst.

A: What happens with honey?

Q: You're doing raw honey?

A: Unheated honey.

Q: All that stuff.

A: Yeah, okay. What brands of honey were you using?

Q: Well, Pacifica.

A: Honey Pacifica?

Q: Yeah. I've been to this and, you know, I don't, it doesn't work for me.

A: How much honey are you using?

Q: Doesn't taste good.

A: Huh?

Q: Doesn't taste good.

A: Can you imagine honey not tasting good? Yeah. 1% of a billion.

Q: Maybe just a brand of honey.

Q: No, I've tried like a hundred different.

A: A hundred different flavors. Did you try making it into a cheesecake?

Q: No, I just mix it. Mix it.

A: Yeah, but make it as a cheesecake. All the difference in the world. Because you don't taste the honey there. But the honey's already into the cheese.

Q: I can't understand. I cannot digest the cheese if I want to eat so much.

A: Well, if you eat so much, you don't gain weight. You're not digesting it.

Q: I'm obviously digesting some of it.

A: If you didn't gain any weight, well, you didn't gain any weight. If you didn't gain any weight, well, you ate it, that much cheese, oh, you did, okay.

Q: Oh, yeah. I'm not saying it's not working. No, no, I'm not saying that the raw dairy is not working. No, no, raw dairy, cheese or milk works. I gain weight, muscle weight, not fat weight, muscle weight. That's the only thing that came. I've been eating raw meat for five years, never gained any weight on that. But the raw dairy, as soon as I start, one week, I can see a difference. But, like I say, I can't stop myself. I cannot eat one cube at a time, so that's why I'm saying it.

A: You're starving, it's okay. You're not even digesting it.

Q: No, no, but even after, I feel better after a month or so. I still just can't stop it.

A: When you gain 20 more pounds, you're going to level off.

Q: Because you're saying you eat just one piece, that's why I'm asking.

A: I'm talking about for people who don't have, who aren't skinny like you.

Q: Okay. Because I was trying, I couldn't do it.

A: No, what I tell people as thin as you to eat as much as you can, eat until your next bite's going to make you vomit. That's when you stop.

Q: Okay, I do that all the time.

A: Good. Vomit?

Q: No. Until I get noxious.

A: Good, good.

Q: Like when I was talking to you earlier about fat. Like I would eat until I get noxious. But then after that I get so dizzy I almost pass out. So I cannot stop eating. I start.

A: Terrific.

Q: Okay, so that's good.

A: Good, excellent. I say it in my books. I say when you're skinny, you have to eat until you're ready to vomit. When that next bite will make you vomit, that's the one you don't eat and you stop at that point. You don't let yourself get hungry.

Q: Yeah, you always come up with these rations and I don't... It doesn't feel...

A: Once you gain the weight and you're balanced, you'll reach that level of how much. But right now you're starving. Like I said, when I was skinny, skinnier than you, I would go through a gallon of ice cream in a day. But you stop eating it.

Q: I was doing that before I started the diet.

A: But it wasn't raw ice cream.

Q: No, no, it wasn't raw. It was the other time, but obviously I was craving...

A: Yeah, fats.

Q: Eggs, when I eat more than one, my stomach kind of slacks up, like my belly. I'm getting cramps from just walking or doing exercise. I don't have any force, any strength anymore around the area. Is that normal?

A: Well, for someone so skinny, I don't tell you to eat raw eggs by themselves. Always in milkshakes. Because eggs by themselves will cause weight loss. Fat burn. Fat utilization is energy. So I only use that for people who need to lose weight.

Q: But you were using it on people who were sick. I was expecting them to be thin.

A: But no, they're eating that. If I eat 27 a day, I won't lose weight. But I have to eat that much. If I'm eating only eggs, I have to eat 27 a day to not lose weight. But I've done it. I've eaten up to 50 a day.

Q: But I don't just eat that. I eat that much. I eat a couple, and I feel not too bad. And two hours later, of course, I'm hungry, so I eat some meat.

A: Good. Just keep eating, eating, eating, eating. Don't let yourself get hungry.

Q: I was thinking eggs, that was a problem, because I'm losing strength, and I don't...

A: There's not fat that will stay on your body. That fat in the egg yolk, they say, oh, it's full of cholesterol, all this. Let me tell you, you cannot store egg yolk on the body. You can raw cream. That's why I say milkshakes, milkshakes, milkshakes, if you want to gain weight.

Q: Dairy, when I eat a lot of dairy, I'm getting cramps. I'm thinking it's because of the calcium, too much calcium.

A: No, because you've got toxins that are being pulled out, and as they're coming out of your intestines, it has to, it's like an earthquake, shakes it up to move it, and it causes burning of the tissue, and that will cause a muscle cramp. It's like you get lactic acid buildup in your muscles.

Q: Lactic acid is not calcium.

A: No, but it's like lactic acid, it's just a toxin.

Q: It needs to get out.

A: It needs to be removed, yeah.

Q: What more does it need to get out?

A: Well, the cheese, a little bit of cheese.

Q: Oh, the cheese, what causes the cramps?

A: Yeah, the cheese will absorb that poison and pass it out.

Q: So I need to eat a lot?

A: Well, you need to eat some besides, you know, you can eat a lot at one time, fine, but also eat your little chips. Pig out on it, and then eat little chips for the rest of the day.

Q: At one point the cramps will stop.

A: Yeah, it could be a while. Usually when you're as thin as you are, you collect a lot of poisons inside the cells. For a lifetime.

Q: I eat a lot of fat, though.

A: You're that thin, you've got no protection. Well, now you're taking care of the toxins that you may be creating in this time. And you may be eating fats enough, but the old toxins are stored in your cells. You need tremendous amounts of fat. As they come out and bind with it, then you won't have cramps. 

Q: Okay.

A: Okay?

Q: I have a question about green pasture.

A: Uh-huh?

Q: Do you know if [unintelligible]?

A: Oh, you mean for the ex-butter? Uh, it's, it's the Jersey gowns. Yeah. But I don't buy that. It's expensive. I experimented on probably 20, I guess, well, only the ones that reported back to me were about 22 people out of 30. And it didn't give any extra benefits on this diet. That's for people who eat cooked foods.

Q: The butter oil?

A: The butter oil only improves people's lives if they're eating cooked foods. Yeah. Yeah. What else is just an extra expense? Because we get it in our butter. We get what's extracted in our butter. We don't need it in that high a concentration because we're not poisoning our bodies. Same with vitamin D. You don't need all that vitamin D that they're saying you need if you're on a raw diet. You're not putting that many poisons in your body. We don't need all those supplements because we don't eat those poisons.

Q: You consider this thing only as a supplement?

A: Pardon?

Q: You consider this product only as a supplement?

A: You mean those products? Yeah, those are supplements. Absolutely, yeah. Even the cod liver oil is a supplement. I haven't found any change on it. Only with people who cook food. And I help them make the cod liver oil.

Q: The thing with that, apparently here people can find a lot of fat, dairy fat easily, but I couldn't find that before, so that's why we're using that, right? But I always just wanted to know if it was true.

A: Okay, do you have a question?

Q: Well, I have a question about cheese. So there's many different kinds of ways to make cheese, and you can make cheese that is still quite wet if you just let milk separate and strain it through.

A: Yep, that's fine. Any of them will work. Because anytime you've taken it to that point, you've dehydrated the bacteria. Once it dries, the bacteria is gone. The bacteria is no longer active. It takes moisture to keep bacteria going.

Q: But if I make this white cheese...

A: Soft?

Q: Yeah, so just let milk separate, strain it through a cheesecloth, and it's not dry. I mean, it's still quite moist.

A: Then it still has some active bacteria. Probably not much active enzymes, but it will have some. But if you let that sit for maybe a couple of days, you know, at room temperature, exposed to the air, then it will cease that. But if you're eating cheese, wet cheese like that, you're going to digest it. And it will collect the poisons and re-digest the poisons.

Q: So that kind of cheese is not good?

A: That does not work for absorbing toxins. Dry cottage cheese will. But that's on the dry side.

Q: I had one other question. So he brought up cod liver oil. And I recently learned about this company called Rosita in Norway. And they claim that they do something very similar to green pastures, but they use rat fish instead of cod. And they claim that they don't use any kind of industrial chemicals or any kind of heat, and that they don't even...

A: They use fermentation.

Q: Well, they say they don't even ferment it. But they somehow manage to extract the oil. And I was just wondering if you heard of it.

A: No, they'd have to show me that process. Because we went over every process there was. The only way we could get it out was fermentation. So they have to use heat or some chemical extraction.

Q: They claim they don't.

A: They don't use heat or chemical.

Q: That's what they claim.

A: Well, I don't believe them. They'd have to show me.

Q: But they're willing to show people.

A: Okay. Well, good. Put it on a video and send it to me.

Q: So, Aajonus, for those of us who live in Toronto and don't have the luxury of going down south in the winter, you're saying we don't need supplemental vitamin D in the wintertime?

A: No, you don't. No. Only if you get yourself highly poisoned do you need it. And you can even go out in the sunshine. Even on a cloudy day and get some vitamin D. 

Q: So during the winter, the sun is so far away that we're not...

A: No, you still get it. As long as you have light, you're getting some sun radiation that will cause the production of vitamin D. And you don't need all that. But if you want it, eat more fish. Get the green pastures, cod liver oil. Nasty tasting and bitter, it will burn your throat, but that's a good vitamin D. It's the only good vitamin D. If you want a supplement.

Q: But if I have liver, would that be my vitamin D or not?

A: Yeah, it would.

Q: Can I ask about the shark meat? If you ferment it, the ammonia becomes more concentrated?

A: In ammonia, yeah.

Q: So any time you ferment that type of stingray or shark, it would be much...

A: Only the shark that I know of. Only the shark and stingray. Incrementally, all fish are producing ammonia. But incrementally, the shark and stingray produce, after the first, I don't know, 30 or 40 hours after death, it starts doubling. Every three to four hours, the ammonia doubles. And other fish, it only, you know, it takes like two, three days to double. Four days to double.

Q: And is it helpful, then, to really speed up detoxification to help neutralize those radical toxins?

A: It depends on what you... Let's say you're detoxing some vaccine toxicity. Yeah, it's helpful. Some chemical inundation. Let's say there was an oil spill or a gasoline spill in your house. [unintelligible] is spilled then you're full of toxins. Then it would be very helpful.

Q: Okay. Thank you.

A: You're welcome. Let's say you're hot again.

Q: Are you getting cold?

A: I'm getting cold. You're going to have to get a cold water bottle, too.

Q: I know. I'm rolling up [unintelligible] and everything.

Q: Speaking of getting hot, I just wanted to ask about something that I have experienced. So I've been doing the hot baths on a regular basis. And I find that...

A: How many minutes?

Q: Usually at least an hour.

A: Okay.

Q: Between one or two hours. And what I find is, say, one day I do a hot bath, and the next day when I'm at work, I start sweating like crazy and I'm really hot. And it's as if I've trained my body to crank up its temperature.

A: No. Well, when your body can finally perspire, it will get rid of toxins whenever it needs to. However, if while you're perspiring without the bath, if you're getting some plastic fats that block the pores, and you stop perspiring again until you get into the hot bath. It's not just a one-time break loose of the dam. You have to keep breaking the dam frequently because it will get jammed.

Q: I've gotten quite sluggish. Now, you put me on the Crohn's. Excuse me. Well, I don't know if I... I started reintroducing the juice just because my circulation really slowed down and I got very sluggish. Was that because we were doing almost all fats and all?

A: Were you doing mainly eggs?

Q: Um, it was, yeah, kind of eggs, cheese...

A: Milkshake and...

Q: Yeah, milkshake, a bit of like meat, yeah.

A: Well, it's not...

Q: I mean, it worked. It totally worked. Yeah. It was like, you know, I feel like my circulation got cut in half and I started having like chest pains. I started worrying about my heart.

A: Well, am I going to see you?

Q: Yes, yeah, I was waiting for...

A: I'll tell you then, because you look good to me. You know, your circulation is not blocked. A block, you wouldn't have that pink and you have pink everywhere.

Q: Okay.

A: You know, so your circulation is not blocked. Your heart's not a problem because I can see it in your face. You know, so you're just going through some kind of a detoxification. And I just have to see where it's coming from and what it is.

Q: Okay.

A: You know, we'll be able to help you with that then if I can see it.

Q: Sure. And teeth, I'm losing teeth. I know the toxins come down, right? And they start...

A: Out the gums, yeah.

Q: Yeah.

A: Who knows what kind of toxins are leaving the brain to damage your teeth. But they may be damaging the nerves pretty heavily. Do you have any amalgam filling?

Q: Yeah. And some of the really bad ones were the ones that came out. Those teeth were in bad shape. And I've gotten kind of puffy under the eyes and stuff. So it feels like I'm doing a kidney.

A: That's kidney. Yeah. Well, did you go online and see the video on the gas from amalgam filling?

Q: No.

A: Go online and put Alberta University, amalgams. I think it was Alberta that did this. Well, just put amalgams, mercury, outgas, phosphorescent screen, and you'll come up with the right one. And you see this tooth that had this filling in it for 25 years, and you just see it outgassing. When they put it in water, the temperature of the human body, about 98 to 100 degrees, and you just watch the gas from the mercury vapors streaming. And then they take an eraser and rub it, like when you're chewing, and then it just pours out. Brush your teeth, pours out. So, that's what would destroy your teeth. All that mercury gas going up into your jaw and gums and brain, and then detoxing again out the gums. 

Q: I was sick for six months after that dental stuff? Just, I think, probably from the injections?

A: Yep.

Q: Oh, God, it was just brutal.

A: Those dental injections are responsible for 80% of the mouth, tongue, and neck cancers. It is solidified.

Q: I mean, I could tell it was coming out of me like crazy, but it was really uncomfortable. 

A: It was damaging cells on its way out.

Q: Can you preventably do clay before the injections, if you have to go in for something? Is there anything you can do?

A: No. The thing to do is go to a dentist that uses a water jet with a drill or is using a laser drill. No pain, no anesthetic.

Q: But for extractions and things like that?

A: I've had four of them done without a... In fact, last month, I went to my dentist in Mexico, because he doesn't require x-rays or anything. He does exactly how I want it. And since I got those injections, I've lost 70.

Q: Oh, my God.

A: Seventy. So, I had one back here that was causing the others to loosen at the bone. And it was an okay molar. It was still my tooth, never a cavity or anything. And it was just rocking, causing pain every time I was eating. So, I had to grind my meat. I couldn't eat. I couldn't sit there and chew on meat. So, I went to him, and he was closed that day, all the way down to Mexico. I was doing a lecture in my workshop and a potluck and Q&A in San Diego. So, it was only an extra hour trip. But I got down there, and he's closed. The guy's never closed. He was closed this Monday. So, I said, screw it. So, I went to a hardware store, got some kite string, wrapped it around the sucker twice. So, I had the string on both sides, put it in my mouth, yank. Popped it right out, and that was that. Yeah, you really don't need it. Once you get the Novocaine, or Novocaine or Xylocaine, it causes swelling in the gums and bones. So, a brief moment of pain will last because it causes swelling. So, now you've got a toothache that's going to go days or weeks instead of a split second. So, you have to weigh your options. Do I want to suffer for a day or a week, two weeks, or do I want this to be in a few seconds of pain? And that's what it is, a few seconds of pain.

Q: What kind of dentistry do you recommend? Laser jet?

A: Laser. Laser drilling or a drill with a water jet on it. See, the tooth will only get frightfully painful when it's being drilled if the bit gets hot. The bit gets hot, the tooth gets hot, the nerve burns. And then you've got a burn on the nerve and you've got that swelling in the nerve. You've got all these dead nerve cells that have been burned and the body has to take all this fluid in there to dissolve these dead cells and remove it. You don't have space like that in a tooth. The tooth wasn't meant to receive that kind of heat deep in it. So if you've got a water jet on it, it's a cold jet. It keeps the bit cool so it never gets hot.

Q: And it's not painful?

A: No. I mean, if he hits the nerve directly, it's going to be an instant of pain, but that pain's going to be gone away in 15, 20 seconds.

Q: So you never have anesthetic?

A: No, it isn't.

Q: You've never had anesthetic for dental work?

A: Not since 1970. 1972. I had 16 amalgams in my mouth, and I had them all removed in 1978. He removed all the ones on the bottom on one morning, four hours of drilling, and four hours of drilling on the next day. I didn't have one drop of anything. Well, I did take some clove oil that I had made. I take the cloves, I put them in water, soak them in water for a couple of weeks, and then juice them. And then I took that cream and then put it on my teeth to numb them a little bit. And that's all I did.

Q: I have 12 amalgam fillings. You know, my biggest teeth are really big and deep. And I got them removed in India a few years ago. They never used anything to, you know, grease me or anything. They just did it like that. And they made me jump once or twice. But apart from that, I didn't feel anything. And I have to tell you that all these 12 fillings that I had on my baby teeth also before that, all the work that had been done with the product, it hurt me more when he did it. 

A: With injections. So I'm saying the swelling causes pain to linger. Usually the pain is gone. Yeah. 15, 20 seconds at the most.

Q: Also, I don't think if they hit the nerve, I don't think the fluid changes. It must be loose.

Q: You don't have a cavity and you don't want to have a root canal. That's what I had back here. I had it extracted.

A: Why did you have a root canal?

Q: No, I didn't. I just had it extracted instead.

A: Why?

Q: The tooth. Because the cavity went so deep that it was hitting the nerve and it was intensely painful.

A: Well, then you just have a cap put over it with biocalix, some kind of a calcium thing that dries the surface of the nerve.

Q: But the cavity was already in the nerve, but the nerve was already infected.

A: That's usually a lie that a dentist will tell you. I've had it several times. Well, I'm going to do a root canal in this tooth because the nerve's already dead. I said, poke it and see if it bleeds. A poke, you know, and I felt it bleed and I said, see, it's not dead. You're not going to pull my freaking tooth and you're not going to do a root canal on it. So they lie a lot.

Q: This was live, and instead of having a root canal, I just decided to...

A: If you had pain, it was alive.

Q: Yeah, yeah. So I just opted for an extraction instead of having a root canal.

A: That's up to you.

Q: But they had to take, like, you know, a pair of, like a wrench.

A: Yeah, because it was in the bone.

Q: Yeah, yeah.

A: Don't have those removed. If it's in the bone...

Q: So what do you do for the pain? The pain was...

A: As I said, you take the filling out that was already in there.

Q: There was no filling. Yeah.

A: Okay, then you just put BioCalix in it and put a filling over it.

Q: What's BioCalix?

A: It's a calcium that helps dry out the nerve so it's not so sensitive.

Q: Oh, okay.

A: So when you put a fill... Because a lot of people, a lot of dentists will put a filling right on top of the nerve and you'll have pain forever.

Q: Yeah. Right, yeah.

A: And if you put the BioCalix, you know, like a calcium powder on it and then put the filling over that, no pain. 

Q: So even if you have an infected nerve, you put BioCalix, it will dry the nerve out?

A: The only way you can infect a nerve is if you drill it and hit it or poison it with mercury.

Q: Yeah.

A: Is it filled?

Q: No.

A: With the mercury? Then it was not a nerve that was damaged.

Q: There's a big wall in the tooth.

A: Yeah, you just kept collecting food in there and food kept jabbing it.

Q: Leaking. After I started the diet, so.

A: No, it would be the food getting stuck on that nerve. Put the powder over it, put the filling on it, and there you'll have it. You have your tooth.

Q: Okay.

A: In the future, don't do that. When a tooth is attached to the bone, it does not need extracting.

Q: What if it's so bad?

Q: The pain was just...

A: Like I said, I told the guy the pain was. If your nerve's exposed, you have to put some kind of powder on it, calcium powder on it, to stop it from swelling. And the calcium will absorb the excess moisture, and that swelling will stop.

Q: God, I wish you could train the dentists of the world, man.

A: Yeah, but they're taught to damage teeth, so you keep going back to the dentist. It's a rat trap. All the medical profession is a rat trap. It's to keep you sick and coming back to them.

Q: I had to put implants, because I had the root canal, and I had problems in the tooth forever, and everything was done. And then I had the implant put in, and then I had pain down here. And now they told me I have, the nerves in my neck are like arthritis. I'm not sure if it's connected to the nerve.

A: Could be. They're saying they're having a lot of trouble with metal implants. So now you're using a different substance, it's like bone.

Q: They say it's very good, it's not like the body doesn't reject it upon me.

A: Well, still, it leaches metals.

Q: Because I'm super sensitive, and it's like, I, yeah.

A: Well, any metal still degenerates in the acids in the body. Whether it's stainless steel, or what are they called, are they putting those posts in? Kind of metal?

Q: Titanium.

A: Titanium. Just in the last two, year and a half, last year, a year and a half ago, they came out with a report showing the bad side of titanium. And it was not a safe product to use. Although they said it for 20 years that it was a safe product. They lie. They lie anything. They spend a lot of money to produce a product. They want to make money back on it. They don't care what it does to you. They just want their money. 

Q: So, can you actually find out if, because every tooth is connected to a vertebra, to nerves or organs, can you actually see in the iris what it's connected to, or if it's from the teeth? 

A: No, I can just look in your mouth and see that. You've got a problem there in that tooth, or that part of your mouth that's causing problems here. The teeth don't show up easily in the eye. And that nonsense about the nerves are connected to a certain part of the body from the tooth, it's overblown and exaggerated. If you're going to have a bad tooth that'll cause a bad organ, that's absolute bullshit. Absolute bullshit. Because I've seen plenty of people with bad teeth and good organs.

Q: With bad teeth and good organs?

A: Yes, bad teeth and good organs. And then they're always saying, all of a sudden they find a bad organ and saying, oh, it's causing this bad tooth in the same area. I've seen in Thailand, in Asia, they eat so much rice, 80% of their diet is rice. They only maybe 5-10% of their diet is meat. That's not a diet for humans. So their teeth decay very early in life. And they have great organs and great physical strength and everything, and their teeth are just rotting out of their heads. If the teeth were causing a disease, every Asian would have a glandular body part problem.

Q: All these bad teeth, they cause them... because you don't see them complaining.

A: Well, they don't eat a lot of chemicals. Most of the ones that I fraternize with and that work for me don't eat packaged food. 

Q: Because it seems like your teeth can get really, really bad, but still the nerve doesn't get attacked. Because some people have... my dentist showed me pictures, it's amazing how a tooth can degenerate to a point that it's getting really small, all yellow, black, and the person still has it in his mouth and it goes around his face. So, if the nerve is not attacked, it's just the tooth. I mean, why would it cause any problem to his organ?

A: It wouldn't, unless you got injections.

Q: Yes, that's what I'm saying. If it's someone with really bad teeth, it doesn't mean that his organ will be attacked. But if the nerve is touched, then maybe the organ will be...

A: Yes, and if they go, all of a sudden they have dental work done, they change their mouth and they get injections, then every one of those teeth is going to have a nerve problem. Because it goes right into the nerves. These nerves run down, all the way up into the brain everywhere.

Q: Because I had a filling, not a feeling but a cavity, well, yeah, a filling. They dig up to the nerve and then they fill it. The filling was always touching the nerve. But from there, I developed pain in my belly. So, from my point of view, it's really true that if your nerve in the tooth is attacked, it's touched, then you'll develop a problem in your organ. I'm not any, no scientific would say yes to that. But I think, before saying it completely, I wouldn't be so sure.

A: I've seen it thousands of times. Now, if you had, just because you had an ache there and you had an ache here, they were probably just coincidental.

Q: Yeah, that's what doctors say most of the time.

A: Coincidental. But, you know, I've seen plenty of people with tooth, teeth that were to certain organs, and, you know, and people who don't even have teeth. Yeah. How can, then, according to a dentist, if you don't have a tooth, you shouldn't have an organ, operating organ.

Q: No, dentists don't say that.

A: No, but they're saying if the nerve that normally goes from that tooth to that organ, if that tooth is not impulsed by chewing, and a lot of them say that, you don't stimulate that organ. I've had a lot of dentists, alternative dentists say that. Say, oh, if you lose that tooth, it's better we put an implant in there, because you'll still have pressure in that area, and it'll stimulate that gland. I said I know a lot of people who are toothless. My mother was toothless since she was 27 years old, and her glands worked. You know, so they have all this crap that really bothers them.

Q: It's not about having your tooth or not, it's about having an infection to the nerve. You know, your nerve is touched in some way.

A: No, but the one to the stomach isn't here. You identified this one as being the one to the stomach. That isn't the one to the stomach. According to their... You said that this tooth...

Q: I was just pointing out.

A: Okay, which tooth did you have a problem with that caused the stomach?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It doesn't go to the stomach.

Q: Not the stomach, the belly.

A: Pardon?

Q: I said the belly.

A: Belly. You mean the abdominal region.

Q: Yes.

A: Where in the abdominal region?

Q: In the same side, on the left side.

A: Probably purely coincidental.

Q: That BioCalix, can you buy it somewhere and just do it yourself?

A: No, only dentists can order it.

Q: Only they have it.

A: I mean, if you've got friends with a dentist, or with somebody who sells dental equipment, then you can get it.

Q: And you can see that yourself, that if you get an infected nerve from a cavity or something that's been untreated, just plug it into that?

A: Sometimes I've got all kinds of dental stuff and medical stuff. I'd say I'm in school, I'm doing research in a laboratory, I need something that's going to buy them. Not without even seeing a student ID or anything, they'd tell me. You just have to be clever.

Q: Aajonus, have things improved since that other idiotic article in the New Yorker, regarding the raw food in your area?

A: Well, we still have our other co-ops. She talked about, in that article, she talked about the Dairy Fairy. That's one woman, but we've got now five different people who are getting the foods and supplying to the 1,500 people that were part of Rawesome. So everybody is being supplied, but not in just one place anymore. So, yeah, we're doing okay.

Q: Can I ask one more thing? So I've read a lot of books about PCBs and other fat-soluble toxins, and one thing that they all mention is that research has been done on wildlife and animals living in the wild, eating a raw diet, and they basically saw that these toxins accumulate as you go further up the food chain, and they also found that they are causing reproductive problems, and really troubling problems like both female and male sex glands in the same animal.

A: That's what I said earlier when I was talking about the plastic that went into canned foods, and lining any kind of processed food item now has plastic lining in it. 

Q: But the thing that's troubling to me is that these are predators eating an all-raw diet with plenty of raw fat. So I was thinking, why doesn't that raw fat protect them?

A: Because it's a plastic fat. It is not normally absorbed and broken down in the body. You can't dissolve that fat. It's a plastic. The body temperature, the body heat, the body chemistry can't break it down. The only way I've found to be able to break it down is at hot temperatures. By the use of vinegar and pineapple. Oh, and if you have congestion in the body, you've got calcium build-ups, anywhere in your system, vinegar, raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar is the way to dissolve it. And that's in the sport formula. You've got about a tablespoon in the sport formula. You could have a tablespoon in some raw milk, like two ounces of raw milk. That's the way to get your vinegar in every day to help clean. Now, when I was fourteen, no, fifteen and a half when I started having heart attacks, they checked me for congested carotid arteries, and they checked me for EKG, EEG of the heart, to make sure it was okay. They couldn't find anything wrong with it, but I was passing out with chest pain. And I was autistic, so I couldn't really explain anything properly. You know, I just pointed to my chest, and my mother would see me pass out. But the doctor said, because they looked for congenital congestion, I mean, congenital malformation, or congestive plaque in there, that's the only thing they looked for. They don't blame toxins that get into a muscle and cause spasms. Yet they know that lactic acid buildup can cause a charley horse, but they totally discredit anything other than those two reasons for a heart attack. Unless you've had a blood clot somewhere, and the blood clot is gone, and it caused the heart to lose oxygen and go into a cramp because it's locked out of oxygen. But that's congestion again, so only those two reasons. So the doctors, the cardiologists told my mother that my heart condition, my pain and passing out was all in my head. So at least they didn't give me any medication for it. Had they given me medication, I'd have been in worse shape. I probably would have died if I had gotten that into the heart and it had gone into a cramp and not let loose and stopped.

And when they checked, I had some congestion in my carotid artery on the right side. And it was about, I don't know, a 30% congestion in there. And they said that I was too young to go in and clean it out. It might break up and move, but it wasn't hard enough to cause a heart attack or get into. It might cause some kind of a brain stroke or something like that later. But they didn't think it was such a problem. So I carried that all these years. And every two to three years or four years, I'll go to lifeline screening. And they do ultrasound to check for different problems, bone density and all of that. So it's all on non-invasive testing, ultrasound. So every year, every time that I went to get it, this was still that congestive artery. So I said, I'm going to try to remove it. I'm going to take vinegar and have it maybe 30 times over a year. One tablespoon only at a time, 30 times over the next year. And I did that and I went back for my screening and it was completely gone.

Q: What kind of vinegar again?

A: Raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar.

Q: Wow.

A: Pardon?

Q: Wow.

A: Of course, raw. Yeah. Raw apple cider.

Q: No, I said wow.

A: Oh, yeah, wow.

Q: Of course, yeah.

A: Yeah, 30 times in a year. Gone. I had it since I was 14 years old. And this was only two years ago that I did it.

Q: Did you mix it with anything or just take it straight?

A: No, I mixed it in either two ounces of raw milk, followed with two ounces of raw milk, or I put it in my sport formula. I'm so clean to an extent, if I have vinegar, it's likely to demineralize me. So I have it in milk or in something else that has eggs. So the sport formula has eggs and so many things in it that it's not going to cause... it's so diluted in that it's not going to cause a mineral deficiency, a mineral imbalance.

Q: How can you remove tumors, or does it depend where it is, or is it like one thing for...

A: Well, you're getting into a whole big subject of cancer, and we don't have time to go into that. But vinegar and pineapple, those are very helpful. Just remember that cancer is nothing other than the body's inability to dissolve dead cells, dead body cells. The dead cells in the red blood stream are eaten by the phagocytes, the white blood cells. So those are never a problem. If you have a red blood cell problem in your bone marrow, that's a problem. If you have cells that do not dissolve in the whole body because the lymphatic system is not working, that will build up into a tumor, whether it's benign or malignant. It depends upon your body. If you have malignant tumors, much better, because you have circulation into it, and you can dissolve a tumor. But a benign tumor has no blood, lymphatic, or neurological circulation into a benign tumor. It's just a rock in your body. The body won't dissolve it. It won't go away.

Q: So you can't really work with it then?

A: No, usually. Well, you can work with it, but the body has to work on it from the outside in. It's a very slow process, getting nutrients in a little at a time. But if you can get the lymphatic system working with a hot bath, eat the cheese frequently so the poisons don't get recycled in your body, the lymphatic system will dissolve dead cells and it will stop building tumors.

Q: The lymphatic system has to be clean, right? It's very important that the lymphs work.

A: The lymphatic system is all important. And the lymphatic system depends upon the liver making the bile. The lymphatic system depends upon fat to make solvents to dissolve the dead cells if your bacteria is not normally eating it, eating dead cells. Usually it's the bacteria in the lymphatic system along with fats that break down cells, dissolve them. But when that's impaired and not flowing, then they collect. The liver isn't working to make the fats for the lymphatic system, so the lymphatic system can fail just by failure of fats, even if the lymphatic system isn't jammed. 

Q: So they connect the [unintelligible], right? It's amazing.

A: And the doctors misrepresent, misdiagnose how the body works, so everybody will be confused. They don't even know their butts are all on the ground. So they don't really know anything about the human body properly. Only a few do, let me put it that way. But they're not doing regular medical stuff. Okay, guys. We're finished? Pardon?

Q: What about a bag of chips? Like, what happens? I know it's bizarre, we're eating so healthy here now, but just say, can you comment on what you think of a bag of chips?

A: Bag of chips are the worst things you can eat.

Q: Why?

A: Because they're boiled in vegetable oil.

Q: Okay.

A: And anything that's fried, boiled in vegetable oil.

Q: The acrylamides, right?

A: Yeah, well, not just the acrylamides. You've got plastic fats.

Q: Okay. So the chips are plastic.

A: Yeah.

Q: Essentially, right?

A: Yeah.

Q: And there's salt.

Q: Okay.

A: You've got salt, you've got acrylamides.

Q: Are you trying to break yourself with that?

Q: No, it helps, because sometimes after I get healthy and real good, and I think, you know, four weeks or something, I deserve a bag of ketchup chips. And I'm a healthy person on the diet when I'm super healthy, you know? And then...

A: You put plastic fats in it? Okay. How do you think you're going to get beyond that?

Q: Thank you. That's why I asked. Perfect. Plastic fats turn me off.

A: You can't digest them. They just clog your system.

Q: Oh.

A: Get into your nervous system, they'll make you crazy.

Q: Some hot air popcorn with lots of butter, on occasion, we could do that.

A: Yeah. Yeah.

Q: Because it's not fried in oil.

Q: Chips are the worst thing. Cookies are even worse, too. Cookies are bad. You know, because Americans have nice Twinkies.

A: Twinkies. There's nothing food in Twinkies. They mine that. That's actually rock that's mined. They make it out of all rock. They dissolve it in solutions. They put all these chemicals in it. And most of it's petroleum. It's completely manufactured food. It's not, I can't, it's manufactured rock. It's not a food.

Q: Or all those pastries that are already comfortably packaged and bought, right?

A: Oh, that's all garbage. It's mined. Mined, yeah.

Q: Plastic, too, or just...

A: Oh, yeah. That's what the fats they'll use because there's no shelf life on it. I mean, there's all the shelf life in the world.

Q: And if the chips are fried like in a duck fat instead of a vegetable fat?

A: Well, they're not as bad, but...

Q: Yeah, but still very bad.

A: You still have the lipid peroxide that the form. But you don't have the plastic.

Q: Okay, but thank you very much.

Q: It's like French fries made in duck fat.

A: You'd have to make them yourself.

Q: For a man at 40, you look wonderful.

A: Okay.

Q: Thank you so much.

A: It's so good to see some of you tomorrow.

Q: Yes. That was a marathon. Congratulations.

A: Thank you. Oh, it didn't stop.

Q: It's okay.
