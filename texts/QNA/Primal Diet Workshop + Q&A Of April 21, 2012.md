Q: I was very close to 400. I was lucky because my mother was sick first during 30 years and I was an electronic engineer doing field service engineer for CT scanners and I was looking what doctors, the way of doctors interpret the way the scanner gives the information of the body. So I was thinking, well, maybe they are doing something wrong, but I was very young, recently came out from the university and I didn't have a criteria to say if that was right or wrong. But my mother was coming on to being almost a vegetable in 30 years, so I decided not to take medicines. So...

Q: Excuse me, is there any way they could close the kitchen door? Because I can hardly hear you.

A: There's no door up there.

Q: What?

A: There's no door up there, I know.

Q: Oh, there's no door there? No problem. Well, maybe they could manage not screaming at each other.

A: I wish.

Q: Okay, could you scream, please?

Q: Yes, okay. I'm sorry, I apologize my English. I speak Spanish. I'm a Spaniard. I live in South America. I was very, very sick. My first strong illness was when I was two years old. Unfortunately, my mother took me to the doctors and a lot of vaccination, a lot of antibiotics that destroyed all my capacity to digest food. Then I ended up when I was 40 years old, I was very, very sick. When I keep walking, keep working, I have strong pains in my chest. When I began the diet, the strong pains in my chest disappeared in two weeks. My cholesterol dropped from 250, I was able to drop the cholesterol up to 250 doing the wrong things, using almonds that produced me more strong pain in the chest. But the cholesterol dropped 70 points in a week. That is the wrong way to do it. But when I began the diet, in three weeks the cholesterol dropped from 250 to 185. And I was not doing the diet in the correct way because in Venezuela it is not possible to get butter. And I was very weak, my stomach was very weak to digest daily. So only with a couple of sardines, blue fish, the green vegetables that I don't like very much but I took it. And my beloved coconut cream because in Venezuela it is easy to get coconut. It takes time to do it and I cannot get the wonderful juice extractor there. And I use an old oyster centrifugal that is not recommended by Dr. Vonderplanitz but it is what I had over there. And with that in three weeks I improved a lot. Then I got diarrheas but after the diarrheas I get better. Ok? And I was able to walk.

Q: So the diet was based on the book, on the recipe book?

Q: Not 100% but 100% raw. I began 7th of April 2010 and I never went back. Only once that I had diarrhea for six days. Every two hours I was very, very, very weak three months ago. But thanks to Jeremy... He is not here. Well, he told me don't do anything to stop the diarrhea. That time I only eat pasta once. Ah! Awful. I couldn't eat more than once. Now I cannot go back to cooked food. Ok? So I can walk, before I used the cane. I was in another diet that made me lose so much weight that I was able to walk. But then I was so weak, 56 kilograms, my feet barely sustained me. So when I began this diet I began slowly to increase weight and strength. Unfortunately my job is in front of the computer about 15 hours a day and studying a lot and I don't have much to exercise. But when I begin to exercise and do this diet I get strong. And I run and I am 55 years old and I run even though I still have some pain in my knee, I am able to run faster than my kids that are 14 years old and 17 years old. And I run much faster and run the upstairs much faster than them. Twice as much fast.

A: Why don't you get them to do the diet?

Q: No, they said they don't like it and the donuts and chocolates are very nice.

A: That's the problem. I was that way too as a kid.

Q: Well and I want to thank Vonderplanitz to give us this information because what I see is more difficult for people is to erase the false data that we have before and to accommodate to this new data because it's incredible that bacteria is good. But for me that I'm used to try to find the truth, I remember my grandfather that was a poor farmer in the north of Spain. He wake up in the morning with almost a liter of milk. He by himself has only two cows and he by himself has the bees and everything. What I apologize is I was a very young engineer and I didn't understood what my grandfather told me one day that the people who have land will eat. Jesus Christ, when I read the book that words of my grandfather came to my mind and I cried because he was right. He didn't have education and he was telling me, you are dying because you don't eat. But he was so smart that he didn't invalidate my status of engineer and he said in that way, who has land will eat. I would try to get land from you. Thank you very much.

A: Ok, well this first hour is about how I got to where I am today with the diet. I was born into a very violent household, very sickly. I had a brother who was 18 months older than I and still in diapers when I was born. He was very upset that I took mother's attention away, getting home from the hospital. He made sure that I suffered every day. He pinched me, pulled my hair, bruised me. My mother thought I was just kind of reckless or careless, bruising myself in the crib. When he found out that... He pushed me on a rake one day, a rusty rake, when I was about six months old, my mother freaked. She's a nurse. Of course, the idea of locked jaw, her son getting locked jaw and not being able to eat and dying at six months old was not appealing to her, so she rushed me to the doctor and the doctor gave me a head shot. Very sick, very sick after that. Then at a year old, my brother pushed me on a nail of wood that had two rusty nails in it. Of course, it punctured me twice. Another tetanus shot. Although, tetanus shots back then were supposed to last five years.  I got another one six months later, and then my brother pushed me on another rusty object, a hoe, rusty hoe, and I got my third tetanus shot at 18 months old. That one went to my brain, my communication center, and I became autistic. So, it was like somebody took the switch off, turned the switch off, on my center that communicates. I was unable to understand sound had meaning, that you could form sound into meaning, that you could construct words with symbols, completely foreign to my brain. I could no longer do it. So, I went through life like that, and wasn't able to talk or say much, and when I said something, they weren't really words. So, I mean, I thought they were words. I thought I was giving back the same kind of sounds everybody else was, and to me, they were just sounds. They weren't any form of communication. I had hoped that they were, but I never got the results that everybody else did when they spoke.

At eight years old, by the time I was eight years old, I had accumulated enough sound bites to mimic what people said like a parrot. So, the things that I heard at home were, shut up, sit down, you're an idiot, things like that. So, when I took those words to school and sent them to nuns and priests, because I went to a Catholic school, I got beat a lot. I mean, the nuns would take a comb and hit me on the back until I bled in spots, or take the ruler with the blade edge, the metal edge, and hit me with it until it cut me on the palm. So, you know, the nuns and priests were supposed to be Christian, but I don't know anybody who was as unmerciful. Anybody as unmerciful and violent as they were. And they were not loving like Christ was. So, that put me off to religions in general, put me off to people in general, because these were the people I was supposed to follow and admire. And my parents, and all parents do this, all parents want their children to believe what they have inside them, what they believe, whether it's right or wrong. So they lie, they lie all the time. So, of course, as an autistic child, a child knows when you're lying. And just lets it go, lets it go until you're about seven years old and then they say, oh, lying is a part of life. You lie, that's what everybody does, you lie and that's part of life, you're on this planet. I didn't adopt that. To me it was always truth was important. But since I couldn't communicate, I could never tell my truth, which probably saved my life, not being able to communicate. So I would mimic these and it was very difficult getting through school. I was sick three to five months a year, I mean two to three months a year. And then when I hit 12 years old I got a case of peritonitis right after my first polio vaccine. And that peritonitis is a perforated bleeding intestine. And they thought it was an appendicitis, so they went in and cut out the appendix, found it in good shape, and said well we took it out just in case it caused some problems in the future.

And that's the medical profession's thinking. They don't realize that the appendix developed for a reason. Just because you don't know what the reason was doesn't mean you pull it out of the body. And what I found in autopsies with human bodies was the appendix had a registry of every element that exists that ever went into that body. Whether it was a form of venom from an insect, a spider, a scorpion, or a food, or metals from canned foods, no matter what it was that ever entered the body went into that appendix. Also, what to do about it. And I put electrodes at the appendix and fed people different things. And if it was something that was poisonous that I put on their tongue, not directly the poison, but through a piece of beeswax, the body registered appendix would automatically start generating energy and would become reactive at that particular substance that went into the mouth. And if I put a bee, even though its stinger was gone, on the person, the appendix would react. The appendix is your library to let you know that something is wrong in the body and what to do about it. If you don't have an appendix, your body has to re-register everything every time. So, I don't have an appendix. So, it used to be, after I had my appendix, any time I got a bee sting, it would take 48 hours. And normally, if you get a bee sting after the first one, your body will react in 20 minutes maximum. It only takes 20 minutes. But if your body has to re-analyze it and what to do about it, it can take up to 48 hours, 36 to 48 hours. Now, on this diet, I've been on this diet, eating raw meat, since September of 1976. I don't have an appendix yet. Two years ago, I had an experience that showed me that my body could make up for my not having an appendix. I was building a house in Thailand, in a farm there, and I had some pillows and blankets and sheets in a box. They were inside the house as it was being built, around it. Then it was time to bring out my... It was time that I could sleep there. I had the bed and all this. 

So I took the pillow out first that was on top, and I held one like this to get the other, and I felt a sting in my arm right here. I pulled the pillow away, and there was this tiny scorpion. Those are the deadly ones because their venom is not diluted. So one sting from those can kill you within two hours. Of course, I know that I'm healthy, so I wasn't going to do anything about it other than getting some lime juice and putting it on the area because I know that lime helps to neutralize bacteria. Another way to do it, which I did, was one person who got bitten by a rattlesnake was I vomited. So I got them to vomit from the hydrochloric acid. Now, I don't have a lot of hydrochloric acid, which we'll find out soon, because I had a vagotomy when I was 20 years old with stomach ulcers. So anyway, I just put lime juice on it, and after 24 hours of the arm going numb, very little swelling, but the burn and the sting went all the way down the hand, back up the arm, down the shoulder, down into about the chest, and there it stopped. That lasted about 24 hours of the movement, and then after 48 hours, no sensation, no problem. But the arm felt very heavy, and I put a 30-pound weight in it from that. Then, three days later, as soon as it's all worn off and I know I'm okay, I put some gloves on to do some work, and a scorpion was inside that, and I got stung again right here on the wrist, and it was another tiny one. So I learned to shake off everything before I touch it again, and that one didn't do anything. I had no sensation, no burning, except for that very spot, and that lasted maybe an hour, just on that spot. Then a week later, about 10 days later, I got stung again. One fell from a doorway and on my arm, and did it again. Again, nothing. So my body had learned another way to develop that kind of sensory analysis and direction to handle those poisons, even though I don't have an appendix.

But if you have an appendix, it's easy. Your body won't have to relearn how to do that in order to store it. Now where it stores my body, I don't have a clue, but at least I know that my body's handling it. Before, when I'd get a bee sting like 20 years ago, having no appendix, I mean it would last for a week, something like that, or 25 years ago, when I got stung once. I was taking care of hives and a bee got under my beard and stung me on the neck. The effects were about a week. A bee is not a serious, deadly thing unless you're highly allergic to it. So having the scorpions, all three of them, the highest concentration of venom and deadly, and here I am, I've just had sensations through the arm, that's a testimony to how my body had developed from being very sick. So after that bout with the hospital and the peritonitis, they were injecting me every two to three hours. Once they let it go four hours, but it was mainly two to three hours. So I was swollen everywhere they injected me, I mean my legs, my buttocks, my arms, I was bruised, swollen, in severe pain, I was running temperatures up to a hundred and seven, so they were packing me and actually put plastic underneath me and actually packed ice all over my body. It was traumatic, headaches, headaches all the time for me. So I just refused, they brought in a tray of, you know, injections for me, hypodermics, I just knocked it out of their hands, there was no way I was going to get another shot. And when the nurse came in while I was sleeping and injected me, let me tell you, the next time she came back in that room I told her, you do it again and I'm going to come out of this bed and I'm going to beat you. So they didn't do it anymore. So within 24 hours I was out of the hospital very sickly, after that I was sick three to five months a year, bedridden at least two months a year. Then I hit 15 and a half, I had my third polio vaccine. They spaced it out far from me because I was so ill. And if you know what's in a vaccine, you say, why would I ever give that to myself or my children?

Every vaccine is full of poisons, there's not one positive thing in it. You have 26 to 63 toxic ingredients in every vaccine. The basic ingredients are liquid mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether and detergent. If you put all those in a blender and gave it to somebody, would you drink it as a flu vaccine or any other kind of a vaccine? Oh, and they take a rotten egg, that's usually what they make for diseases. They grow disease in these eggs that are deteriorating. And they are treated eggs, they're slightly heated to destroy the defensive bacteria in them. So the disease will grow in it, which is a testimony to raw again, if you don't heat your food, the toxic bacteria can't form from it. So these bacteria. So after that shot, within 10 days I had diabetes, juvenile diabetes, which means my liver completely shut down, and I had angina pectoris. I had heart attacks. I had 300 heart attacks from the age of 15 and a half to the age of 22. 50 of them put me unconscious. But because I was autistic, I didn't fall into the trap that most people do when they have, you know, any kind of a cramping. And what heart attack is, is the cramping of the muscles. So it's like a charley horse. You know, most people go to try to rub it out, and the more you rub it, the more you tense, the worse it gets. Well, that's the way a heart attack is. So I would just fall, because I knew I was in so much pain all my life, I knew that the best way to get rid of pain was to ignore it. So I would just go into a limp state and just let the pain pass through me, even though it was still excruciating. And if I came back in a form of consciousness with that pain, it was never mild. So it was a way that I just kind of went into a self-hypnosis to get through it. So that's how I survived all of those heart attacks, because I didn't tense up with it and make the heart stay cramped. A lot of people who have heart attacks will tense about them, and then they lock the muscle into that cramp. And if it happens for over six minutes, you're dead. You're brain dead. So, and that's what happens. 

If you have any kind of chest pain, just relax. Breathe slowly, not deeply, because you'll put pressure on the heart, again, and you cause the muscle to cramp more. But you just breathe slowly, and you'll inhale slowly at about half your normal intake of air, and then hold it the same amount of time, and then exhale to the same amount of time. So let's say you do it to a count of four. Inhale to a count of four slow, you hold to a four, and then exhale to a count of four. And then you will find that the heart starts relaxing, and then you will suffer death from a heart attack. And it's very simple when you do that. Don't focus on the pain or the cramping of the muscles. You just focus on breathing in and counting to four. One ohm, two ohm, three ohm, four ohm. Hold it one ohm, two ohm, three ohm, four ohm. Exhale to the same count. You won't be filling your lungs up to put pressure on your heart, and it will relieve the heart attack. I've helped hundreds of people through it just by doing that. I had one woman that had three heart bypasses. She's been on the diet now nine years. Plus she had nine other health problems that were severe, including rheumatoid arthritis. She doesn't have any symptoms today. And every time she gets that little heart pain, she does that little breathing exercise, and it's gone in a minute and a half. So, it works. So you can't panic when you have heart pain. It's easy. You get your work done. Then you have to run to the doctor and then get injections of this and that, x-rays and all that other stuff. They always damage the body. So, I was shooting insulin from the age of 15 and a half to the age of 22, because of the diabetes, the shutting down of the pancreas. You know, as I told you when I got the tetanus shot, tetanus shot is the same as a vaccine. Has all that mercury and aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, detergent, and rotten substance, which is the tetanus bacteria. And it went to my brain.

When I had the polio, it went to my heart the third time. The first time it went to, you know, my intestines, and that's why I had peritonitis. So, vaccines, no matter if they tell you you're a bad parent or what it is, you're a bad parent and you give a soup of poison, each one of the ingredients are known toxins, and they're toxins on their own account. Then you put it all in this toxic soup, how can that be good? It's like algebra, you know, a negative times a negative makes a positive. You put that soup of poisons together, it can do no good, period, and it can do a lot of harm. So, I had to deal with the, um, the diabetes, injecting myself many times daily, and then, um, dealing with the heart attacks after that. Now the way I got through school, because I was autistic, couldn't communicate, I always picked the smartest, most sensitive girl in the class to cheat off, you know, for tests. So I would copy her hieroglyphs. I got to be so good at it, that by the time I was 16 years old, the two papers looked identical. It was like, wait a minute, you did this paper for him? You know, no, I didn't. He was sitting next to me. So, obviously, you know, I was an artist, became an artist by that. Um, they could see that I was copying everything. And they thought I was very smart. Why did they think I was smart? Because my parents didn't allow me to look autistic. When I'd go off into my stares, my mother would slap me on the back and my father would slap me on the back of the head and say, stop that, you look like an idiot. I was an idiot, you know, that's part of being autistic. So, I learned not to do the stare while other people were around. Now, that stare isn't a child going stupid. It is a break away from the tension and the anxiety of not being able to communicate. It is a great stress.

Always the thoughts are, and it's not in words, it's in a whole psychic emotional language that doesn't even relate to a spoken word. All animals communicate that way. So, I was in that state of wondering, why can't I do what everybody else is doing? And anytime anybody would look at me, I was like, am I going to have to say something? I can't say anything. I can't respond the way they do. So, I was in constant turmoil. And my brother would come in and beat me up at night, punch me in the stomach, knock the wind out of me. So, I was in constant terror. And then there was the TV that came out when I was about ten years old. It was a black and white thing like this with all the snow on it many times or most of the time. And they had horror shows on it. Cowboy horror show. And then at the movies, you would spend ten cents at the movies to see the matinee. And there were horror shows. And then I was worried about sleeping at night because my brother and the monsters under the bed. So, one time when I was about ten years old, I took a saw in my father's hand saw, cut the legs off of it so no monster could be under the bed. And I couldn't explain why I did it. And then I got beat pretty badly. But there were no monsters for a week until my father glued the legs back on. He put the dowels. He did the two-way screws, screwed it in there. So then I had to worry about the monsters again until I got old enough to know that there weren't any monsters under it. Because I slept under the bed. And I said, well, if I'm under there, they're not going to come under. So that's what I did. I started sleeping under the bed at about 15 years old. So to deal with all that. When I was also 8 years old, I realized that the reason I couldn't get out of bed and I was aching in pain was because I lacked coffee like my parents.

You know, they didn't have the aches and pains. If I lifted my arm for 30 seconds like this, I'd be aching in these muscles. All those injections all those years made every part of my body ache. And if I lifted my leg from all the injections here and here, I was always in constant pain. I had fibromyalgia from that, from all those injections, all that medication. And I had no energy. You know, I couldn't sleep at night and then to get up in the morning when I finally fell asleep when the sun was coming up. Well now within an hour after that, I was supposed to get up and get ready to go to school. And I was always freezing to death. No matter how warm I was, I was always cold and always in pain. So my mother and father had to come in with a belt and get me out of bed to really stimulate the adrenaline in my body. And they don't think, you know, well all of a sudden he has energy. Why didn't he have energy before the belt came, you know, a few times. They didn't take time to think about that. They didn't take time to think that I was an autistic person. And part of my being not, people not realizing my autism was because I learned to strike poses of the cool guys that people admired. So was Elvis Presley, Paul Newman and James Dean of those days. So I learned to strike poses, you know. If I were going into my autistic stare, I would do it in a Paul Newman's stare. Like this, you know. So people really didn't know I was autistic because I had to hide it. And I also had a talent for math. Give me a complex problem, I just write the answer. I didn't have to go through the formula. You know, just like in the Rain man movie. And just like he wasn't conscious of how he came up with the answer, he just knew the answer.

And they put me in a room sometimes, a couple of times, to test me. Because I didn't write a formula out, I just write the answers. They thought I was copying answers like they copied everybody else's answers on everything else. But when they put me in a room with a test that they'd just made and I could, and I just wrote the answers, they realized they thought I was genius and that I was a wise guy and just refused to talk normally. You know, I still said, you know, shut up, sit down, stuff like that. But I also learned a repertoire from James Dean and Paul Newman and Elvis Presley what to say to girls. They liked to hear what made them smile or swoon, you know. So I had all those words down like, you know, you're really pretty and I like your smile. Although I didn't know what I was saying, I got those down and I listened over and over and over again to get those words down because I wanted to be liked. So I was expelled the first day of my sophomore year in the Catholic high school because I had a disciplinarian problem because you can't talk to priests that way. So I went to a public school for the first time and they were wonderful. It was like they asked me, you know, they had an interview with me and they realized there was a learning disorder, a communication disorder. They put me in the right classrooms with the right teachers and it was a whole different experience. Still, I couldn't communicate and I didn't understand, but at least they put me in classes where I could learn some things. And they mainly focused me in art because I was excellent in art. Of course, you'd cheat on somebody's paper and you're that good at, you know, copying their handwriting and not being able to know the difference. That's a good piece of, you know, art.

So, when I graduated, I graduated of course by cheating and this one girl who was a year older than I and a senior and I was a sophomore, I mean a junior, we fell in love. I mean, we didn't have to communicate with language at that time. And then she got pregnant. She graduated from high school six months pregnant. Nobody knew it. She hid it. You know, married students weren't allowed to go to school there. They couldn't participate in the school at all, especially a pregnant woman. You know, a father, if you were married, was not supposed to participate in extracurricular activity. They could still go to that school but not a pregnant woman. So, and it was kind of a preppy school. So, when I graduated from there, or when she graduated, then we started living together that summer. So I was going to go into my senior year. And then she realized she had married an idiot. Because, you know, there were chores to do, there were things to be done, and communication was not there. Because I still didn't understand language. So if she wanted me to do something, and I didn't think first to do it, I didn't know what she was talking about. You know, she would have to physically show me. So we ended up getting divorced shortly after the baby was born. And I mean, it was off and on. I left them and came back and left them. She didn't let me touch her after that. I mean, I'm sure, you know, she had a lot of problems with not relating to who she had been with and married and thought she would know me completely without language. It was something different. So I resorted to just going to work at night. What I did was go to school in the morning, take care of the baby until she got home from work, and then I would go to work and get home, like, supposed to get home around 1 o'clock in the morning, because the restaurants I worked in closed at 12, sometimes 11 o'clock depending on what day it was.

So I started going out with the guys after work. And it's easy with guys who just drink and smoke. You know, they just say, shit, cool, stuff like that, and that's all you have to say, and you're accepted and everything's funny and they laugh and they drink. So I became a pretty terrific alcoholic. But going back to when I was 8 years old, I had so much fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue that I saw my parents drinking coffee and them getting a buzz and high and more charge from it. And I thought, that's what I need. So one morning I poured myself a cup of coffee and they went bananas, you know. I'm thinking to myself, wait a minute, they're drinking it, why can't I drink it? Another hypocrisy. So I had to go in the middle of the night. They always left about three quarters to a half a cup of coffee in the pot. One would come out in the morning, dump it, and make a new pot. My mother and father, depending on who got it first. So I go in the middle of the night after everybody's asleep, maybe 11 o'clock, 12 o'clock at night, pour that coffee into a jar, put a lid on it, put it under my bed. So when they came and woke me in the morning, I'd drink it, get a charge, you know, adrenaline high and hyper and I'd still be sore and in pain, but at least I could move. And then after I was moving for a while, it wouldn't be so bad, I lifted something too high and then I was in excruciating pain. So I was never able to play sports. I learned to cook and sew with my mother and my brothers went out and did sports and hunted and stuff like that and I did not do any of it. So here I was, you know, drinking alcohol because I got smoking too. I'd take the coffee in the morning and while at recess at school I'd smoke cigarettes to get the energy and nicotine high. So at night I never slept anyway, I would sleep in the classroom, trying to do it with my eyes open and stuff like that, trying to keep awake or look like I was awake and sleep at the same time.

By the time I was 16 years old I was consuming 11 cups of coffee a day and two packs of non-filtered Lucky Strike cigarettes, two packs. And then I had to start drinking alcohol at night to sleep because I had to stay awake and be functional with the baby and at work, so I had no options. And when I graduated from high school, by the time I was already divorced, my mother took me to this new technical school that taught how to program. At that time you put your program on punch cards and they ran to the computer to get the program. It was nothing sophisticated like it is today. And you had to wire these panels to make sure that it operated the way you wanted it to. So she took me to this school and, to my benefit, they gave no comprehension tests. There was nothing about English on it. It was math, geometry, and flow charts. And they were easy. I did everything. So I got the highest score of anybody that ever had taken a test. And then they interviewed me and realized they had an autistic kid. And all of the people who were in this institute, the oldest who was the dean and principal, he was only 53 years old. The youngest professor was 27 years old. So they were much more in the know and understanding. So they helped me and they realized that I could write a program in about two hours a day, take them six months a year to write. Pretty much flawless. So they farmed me out to IBM, to Cart Blanche Corporation, and IMBC, the third largest trucking company in the world, as assistant analyst. And they always had somebody go with me who could write and understand. Look at, I just knew what I was writing. He would write all the manuals in the English and I would do all the flowcharts in the math and write out the programs in a language.

So it was good. I was making first $40,000 the first year, $60,000, $80,000 the third year. And my uncle, one of my uncles, my mother is one of 13, so there's a lot of uncles and cousins there. And 8 of her brothers and sisters were diabetic. My cousins, 8 of them were diabetic by the time they were 6 years old. That are the kind of terrible diets we were on. And that was it, it was diets. Because of all 13 of them got degrees in college. How could they afford it? And they all worked hard and were smart. And they had better brains. They were fed raw milk when they were kids, growing up. We weren't fed that. I wasn't fed that. I was fed pasteurized 2% milk, no nutrition in that. We lived on donuts and cereals, basic bread. That's what we were fed. And that's what I liked. And I would put sugar, I would put sugar, like 2 to 4 tablespoons of sugar on my sugar crisps. Those were already very sweet with sugar. So my uncle, who was matriculating for his doctorate at UCLA, said, maybe we can help him. We're doing a lot of new psychology tests at UCLA in Los Angeles. Let's bring him out here. He was a TA in the psychology department, a teaching assistant. So he had a lot of good friends. He graduated, he went in the military first and then went to college. So he graduated at 30 years old with cum laude in 6th grade. So he got a high position as he matriculated for his doctorate at UCLA. So he got me into all these programs there. They gave me LSD, 732 milligrams in 3 hours and it didn't even get me high. But they gave me shock therapy. They did everything. They treated me. Nothing worked. Nothing helped. And by all the alcohol, I was drinking like a fifth of gin or bourbon a night to sleep. When I transferred out there, I transferred with Time DC. So I stayed as an analyst for them and a dispatcher.

And working with truck drivers, who do you think you have access to? Bennys. Keep you awake. Give you energy. Because they can't sleep while they're driving. So I got all these Benneys and I was smoking two packs of, sometimes more, two packs of Lucky Strike non-filters, smoking 11, 12 cups of coffee a day, taking all these Benneys and then drinking a quart of alcohol a night. Fifth of gin or bourbon. And that's the way I lived. That's the way I functioned until I was 19 years old, 19 and a half. No, I was 20 years old when I vomited. First started vomiting. And I vomited two cups of blood. So all that bad stuff had eaten a hole in my stomach. So I had an ulcer. So they gave me tons of Maalox and, you know, drink this stuff. And what is Maalox? It's mined dolomite, which is rock with a high degree of, a high percentage of calcium in it. And it's just rock. Absorbs all the hydrochloric acids. So you're not going to digest anything anymore. It'll absorb your bacteria and neutralize them because it's highly alkaline. And all of our digestive bacteria, or 98% of it, is acidic. So I stopped digesting when taking all this stuff. Sure, it stopped the vomit, but it didn't, it made me worse. So I ended up with a tumor, a cancerous tumor, a malignant tumor, right alongside, attached to the ulcer. So they said, oh, well, we're going to go in and cut that out. So they went in and gave me a vagotomy, which means they severed all of the vagus nerves to my stomach so I'd never secrete hydrochloric acid again. And, of course, there would be no acid to eat away at the ulcer, so of course I'd never have an ulcer again, right? And they stretched the duodenum three times its normal size.

So you take a piece of tissue and stretch it three times its size, what do you think's going to happen? I'm stretching the skin, let's say, two times right there. Imagine if I stretched it three times, I'd have scar tissue in here. Well, that's what they did to my stomach. They turned it into scar tissue. But that was to hold it up in there because now I had no hydrochloric acid, so I had to have all this bacteria do it. So I had to wait for the bacteria to accumulate to digest the food without hydrochloric acid. And everything had to be liquefied, supposed to be liquefied. So after they did the surgery, within three months, well January, two months after they did the surgery, the whole incision became tumorous. It was up to an inch and a half wide and three quarters of an inch high. So they said, well, we have to irradiate him. Now, talking to my uncle, of course, I did everything everybody said all the time, if I understood them. And of course, they took me to the doctors and is what the doctors did to me, just let them do whatever they want to do. So they irradiated me. They took a radiation beam machine and they did this ten times for ten weeks. Once a week for ten weeks. And that was intense radiation therapy. Such high levels, they cauterized my spine. It's like taking malleable clay and firing it in a kiln. And what do you have? You have rock or you have clay or pottery. It's a solid substance. It's no longer mobile. It's no longer permeable by anything biological in the body. So if I tried to move, I was in excruciating pain. Now when you have radiation that causes that, you radioactively charge some of the minerals in the bone. So it doesn't happen overnight. That rigidity didn't happen right away. But each week, it got worse and worse until three months after the radiation therapy, I was completely paralyzed with pain. I could move very little.

If I went to sit down, sometimes it would take me five to ten minutes to sit. If I were in a position where it spasmed in pain in my back again, I had to stand and start all over. So it was pretty excruciating, the whole experience. So then that gave me also blood and bone cancer. Of course radiation, we know that gives you blood and bone cancer. But they gave it to me anyway. Also what it did was it deteriorated all the bone around my teeth. So my teeth dangled in my gums. So if I bit on my own teeth, if I tried to chew anything, I bled profusely. I was getting one to two transfusions a week, up to two quarts a week of blood loss from my gums. So I couldn't eat, I couldn't chew anything. Every bad thing had to be completely liquefied and I drank out of these big fat straws. So what was my intake of food? Like I said, I ate a lot of powdered donuts and Sprite. I would put those together in the blender and that was a meal. I put Rice Krispies in there or Sugar Crisp, lots of sugar in it, and a RC Cola. I loved RC Cola. And that's what I ate. I continued a bad diet because no one exposed me to anything healthy. And they told me that after they did the vagotomy, I could never eat any raw food. So if I ate an apple or a peach or a banana, all of them had to be steamed because I would be in danger of death and would absolutely die if I ate a week of raw food. No question, I would die. I would die. No question, no debate, I would die. So my uncle showed me what I had to do with all my foods that were raw. Apple, banana, all of them had to be steamed. Let's let this little bit of crowd go through.

Q: Hi, how are you? Sorry, the meeting's ended upstairs, so if you're under your first hour, you guys can all move upstairs if you'd like.

A: Okay, I'll be there in 10 more minutes.

Q: No problem, I'm just making sure because a lot of people are coming out, they're going to want juices and stuff, so I don't want to interrupt. Sorry, terrific, thank you.

A: So, that's the way I was living under those circumstances. Then they gave me chemotherapy for the blood and bone cancer. Now wait a minute, this is a medically induced cancer from the gut, you get it in the stomach and all the malar. It causes a hardening of the tissue and it cements, so it causes a lot of dead tissue to form, and that's what a tumor is. It's a conglomeration of dead cells, with some cancer cells around and dispersed. To keep blood circulation into a tumor, if you have a malignant tumor, that means that you have good blood circulation, neurological circulation into it, so your body can address that tumor at some time. If you have a benign tumor, there's no circulation of any kind into it, lymph or anything. So if your body wants to remove that tumor at any time, it has to do it from the outside in. In a malignant tumor, you've got all this circulation. It can take the whole thing apart all at one time if it wants. If it can't, if it has a nutrient. So I was sucking everything out of a straw after chemotherapy. I was a complete worm on the floor. I couldn't move. I had no hair, except a few strangling gray hairs. I was vomiting, defecating, urinating all over myself. I couldn't even hold a bowl or a pan or a pot to urinate in, so I was just going all over myself. Fortunately at the time, because I was making enough money, I had a two-bedroom, one-level house in Beverly Hills. A nice little area, so I could die in my house. So they ripped all the furniture out because I would stink up the whole house. Drapes everything, put up shower curtains, plastic shower curtains on my drapes. And I lived in my living room, which was probably about, well, you know, maybe a third longer than this room. It was all wood.

So I would crawl, you know, like this, all around the floor, urinating, defecating all over myself. They took me to a hospice, I mean a hospice, to die there. And of course, I was still autistic, 21 years old at this point, still autistic. Didn't want to be in a place where people were there to die and all depressed. And everything I said would not help anybody. And I didn't have much to say or talk to. I usually didn't talk. I didn't say much. And people would think I was arrogant or whatever because I didn't talk. So two volunteers at the hospice volunteered to come to my house to help me there and make it more comfortable for me. So they went shopping for my doughnuts and my cereals and my skim milk and all of that. And the honey, I mean the sugar. And they'd bring it to me and then they would clean me up in the house. And I mean it was a mess. They were incredible angels to do that. And they would prepare my food. One of them was an 18-year-old African-American boy who grew up brought up in Watts. And he had some idea about nutrition.

Q: Brought up where?

A: Pardon?

Q: Where did you say brought up?

A: In Watts. Watts is the slums of East LA, you know, or it was back in those days. And you wonder how a kid can be so bright. He was a singer with the Going Thing group, which were backed by the Fifth Dimensions at the time. And they worked for the Ford Motor Company, pushing the new Mach 1. So he was making 80 grand a year at 18 years old. And he was this good-hearted kid that was 6'1, 6'2 or something like that. And he just wanted to help. So he turned me on to raw carrot juice and raw milk. And I didn't know what he was talking about. But he was handing me raw carrot juice and raw milk and offering them to me. Carrots, you know, any vegetable would make me projectile vomit. So the smell, I'd never had raw carrot juice before, so I had no idea what it tasted like. But I had some. Now after you've had chemo and radiation and surgeries and all the medication, any food, any food, tastes like postage stamp glue or cardboard. You ever chewed on cardboard or paper? Not very appetizing. So when I sipped this carrot juice and raw milk, they were delicious and rich. So I decided, ah, that's good, finally something I can enjoy in all my pain. So I drank and drank and drank and I stopped eating anything else but that. In about 12 days, all of a sudden I woke and said, oh, language, words, oh, preposition. And in high school, my junior year, I had a teacher who taught English by diagrams. That's the first time I understood that there was some way to communicate with, you know, with me. But I still didn't understand words, but I understood. I could look at a word and knew where it would go within the structure of a diagram, sentence.

So I always got those 100% right. And they thought, God, you know, you cheat on everything, you aren't smart. They were just befuddled. Because nobody took the time to understand that often in those days, in the 50s and early 60s. So, you know, I was trying to, you know, survive. And with that, all of a sudden, the new language that morning when I awakened, I said, oh, preposition, you know, description, verb, action. I just understood it all in that moment. So I called my uncle and had a conversation with him. And he thought I was a comedian friend of his who did voices. So for about 20, 25 minutes, they were having conversations. And it was me having a conversation with my uncle. And he said, okay, Bill, this is enough. This is enough. You know, I know it's you, da, da, da. And I said, no, Lanny, it's really me. And I told him about an incident. When I arrived from Cincinnati, I drove all the way out in three days. I barely stopped. I just plowed it on through and got there. And there was an experience that happened that we both just laughed about it. And I knew he hadn't told anybody because it was slightly embarrassing to him because of my autism. So I told him about that experience. He said, oh, my God, Bill, you know, I said, it's this raw carrot juice and milk. And he said, oh, that nutrition has nothing to do with health. He was indoctrinated into the medical, you know. Finally, all that stuff we did for you is working, turning your mind around. It only took a year, but it worked. I said, no, no, no. I know it's the raw milk and raw carrot juice. Oh, you don't know what you're talking about. I know. He was still a great guy, but that was the only time he got obnoxious. So, I called Steve, the volunteer, the young man, getting cold from the air. Yeah, it was pretty cold. We're going to leave in a minute. We'll go upstairs.

I called Steve and I said, listen, Steve, you turned me on to... Turned me on was a word, one of the first slang terms that I understood. Turned me on to diet as being a way of achieving health. I want to go to a bookstore and I want to get as many books as you can directly toward to study nutrition. And my uncle said, well, I want you to... It'll be about ten more minutes. Then he said, I want you, you know, you're a diehard Republican asshole. So I want you to read this book on Siddhartha, which is about this guy, that young boy who grows up in a fluid society and home, has everything, but goes off and becomes a thief, a murderer, a drug user, a drug dealer, a pimp, a whore. He does everything wrong, even a murderer, and then by the end of his life he becomes a sage, a very wise man, that helps many, many people. I thought, God, somebody can be that? You can do all those things in one life? I thought you could only be the devil or the angel. And even though I knew that everybody was a liar, you know, I knew that everybody was mostly the devil, according to that concept of, you know, good and evil. And what Christianity was, or even Hebrew, because my father was Jewish and his parents were, of course, Jewish. So I got indoctrinated into all the guilt in the world I had involved. You know, I had to go see my accountant before I could go see a priest or a rabbi. So I was getting a little better. I went to the store, got $110 worth of books. In 1968, that was a lot of books, because you could buy a softback book for 15 cents, 25 cents, hardcover with pictures in it for $1.95, $1.65. And I got the book Siddhartha. That was the first book I read. It took me a week to read it. It was only about 80-some pages.

Because I had to go into a dictionary to read the definitions of the words in the definition of the words in the definitions of the words in the definition. So I spent 90% of that time in the dictionary trying to figure out the words. Now I had an idea of what words meant by that time. I had heard a lot of words, and I gave them a meaning that I thought they meant, although I couldn't communicate it, by the way they made me feel. If it was a good sounding word to my ear, it was a good word. And like ludicrous. I thought ludicrous meant happy, funny. I didn't know it meant ridiculously funny. I just liked the word. Lugubrious. I thought it meant somebody had to toil, toil, and work real hard, not morose emotions. So I had all these malaprops that I had said. So I had to relearn everything that I thought when I could finally speak. So I got better and better over the years, drinking more milk and more carrot juice. Got into more raw foods. And just continued with it, exploring them. I tried, you know, mind over matter, like my uncle said should happen. Because he was a psychologist, of course mind was the ultimate to him. So, yeah, I went off the raw foods, went back to drinking RC Cola and Sugar Crisp and doing all of that. Oh, my teeth, my gum, my bone around my teeth grew back in a year, drinking lots of raw milk. It only took a year, all the bone grew back around my teeth. So I was able to start chewing again. And, of course, all the raw stuff didn't kill me. I was eating the raw milk, which was supposed to be one of the most dangerous things on the planet. And eating all kinds of cottage cheese and raw dairy of all sorts. And I was getting better every day. And not dying, not getting sick, not having diarrhea from it, none of that. My hair grew back. Of course, it grew back great when it came back to look like his hair. And it took me about eight years for it to come back to its natural color.

And mine goes in and out when I detox certain things out of my skull. I'll go gray again, then my hair comes back. This is the only area where it stays all gray. That doesn't ever change. So, as I got better, you know, I got stronger. I never got into the raw meat. And then I went out and lived outdoors with the animals. Because I said, if I'm going to find a way, I'm not going to find it in society that pumps out nutritionists that are fed garbage information. And nobody has any wisdom. Nobody experiments or tests anything. They just fly out with this information. And they're taught now, and back then, nutrition is about supplements, vitamins, enzymes. It's about chemistry, not about food. It's about chemistry. It's nonsense. So I knew I wasn't going to learn anything, because everything I tried that was a vitamin supplement made me sick. I didn't know that every vitamin supplement, even the natural ones, were what? Were cleaned and made with kerosene. How many of you would soak your food for 22 hours in kerosene, rinse it for two minutes, and eat it, and expect not to have kerosene in your food? I don't care who's supplement it is. They are all made that way. Unless it's non-natural. If they're non-natural, they use gasoline, hexane, to do it. To dissolve that substance and extract what they want out of it. It is all contaminated with either gasoline or kerosene. There is no supplement that does not use that. I don't care who it is. I gave a lecture about three years ago at a big convention. I made that statement. There was two top sales people from the most known natural vitamin supplement maker in the audience. They went back to their corporate office on Monday and reported what I had said.

Their lawyers called me and said, You've got to put an ad in the New York Times, the Chicago Times, it's got to be in the front section. You have to pay for it and a retraction of that. I said, a retraction of what? They said that we use kerosene to derive our supplements. I said, well you do. They said, no we don't, it's all natural. I said, kerosene is natural, that's what a laboratory uses when somebody wants them to make a natural supplement. Because the FDA and the USDA count kerosene as natural. So that's the solvent that you use. Go check with your lab and if you have something else that you do it, come back and I'll gladly put those ads in the paper. That would have been about $60,000 for me to put that ad in, in each paper. So I said, but I'd gladly pay for it, even if I have to borrow the money. And never we got a call back, because that's it. I had five laboratory technicians on this diet, one that runs the laboratory. And he said, I have been everywhere in every lab, in every chemistry, and I know every chemical that's on the market. And there is no other way for a natural one to be made except with kerosene. So I knew it.  So of course, I didn't have to put any ads in, I didn't spend all that money, because that is a fact. So when you think that you're getting a high from a supplement, you're getting a high because you're poisoning yourself with kerosene, and your adrenaline is rushing. Just like my father and mother would come to the belt and get the adrenaline going in my body from the slap of the belt. And of course, I have damaged cells, and the body generates adrenaline to help heal and take care of that damaged area. Let's go ahead and go upstairs.

[audio cut]

A: The FDA says it has to be completely bacteria-free, no bacteria can grow in it.

Q: [unintelligible] 

A: Then how do they get it to a powder? They probably grind it really fine. You have to look at it. How do they get it into, is it a big piece of meat that they're freeze-drying, or are they slicing it first? How are they doing it? Are they dissolving it and then freeze-drying it?

Q: The fact that it's frozen makes it easier to get the powder. That's what I'm getting at, the process.

A: If you freeze something and you show me how you get it into a powder.

Q: So are there any supplements that you like? [unintelligible]

A: All of it. Proteins are the worst.

Q: People ask me to show them the supplements.

A: Food.

Q: And those cod liver oils, those fermented foods?

A: There's one cod liver oil I helped them process, and that's Green Pasture.

Q: They got it downstairs.

A: But it's non-flavored.

Q: That's the best one.

A: The stinky one that burns your throat, that's the only one that's any good. And that's entirely fermented. And you know it's good because it's rotten and nasty, stinks bad, tastes bad.

Q: Which one's this?

A: Green Pasture. Non-flavored cod liver oil. However, my experience with people who are on the diet 90% and more, it has no effect, no benefit at all. For people who eat a lot of cooked food, it might be helpful. Okay, we've got a recording table over here if you want to record. Okay, so I was traveling all around on my bicycle. All over the United States, all the way from Mexico down to Yucatan, all the way up through Canada to Alaska. Now I didn't travel across Alaska, I mean across Canada. I went from U.S. on the west coast up through Canada to Alaska. But I went to a lot of places in Mexico all the way down to Yucatan with my bicycle, living off the land, living with animals, you know, alligators, chipmunks, coyotes, you name it. I lived with any creature that could teach me what I needed to know about health. I lived with four different Indian tribes, down in the Mayans in the Yucatan. I lived with the Yaquis in northern Mexico, and I lived with the Sioux Indians, which I have relatives who are Sioux, one-sixteenth Sioux Indian, and then with the Inuit in Alaska. And all of them told me that what I was missing was raw meat, that's what I need. And I thought, oh, they really want to kill the white boy, you know, taking over their land and all this. And each one of them told me that, and I thought, what they have a smoke signal that they send up from South America all the way up to follow me up to Alaska? So I completely, you know, my mind was that you can eat anything raw but meat. Meat would give you parasites to make you brain-dead and stupid, or kill you. So I completely denied raw meat and all of this. So I was a raw food fruitarian vegetarian. When I started out on the bicycle, I was not a total fruitarian. I was a lacto-ovo. I ate raw eggs and I ate raw milk. 

But when I got out there, I got involved with other vegetarians who said that the raw eggs and the raw milk were bad because we were subjecting animals and we were supposed to be fruitarians. I accepted all that nonsense and I did that for about six and a half years. At the end of it, I found myself very skinny. At one point I was down to 98 pounds. But I hovered around 118, 118, 123. Right now I'm 185. You can imagine what I looked like at 118. So, when I got to that state, I was in Alaska, two and a half years living outdoors. Eskimos, you know, weren't helping me. I wanted to find out some herbal formula that would remedy it or some special fruit or plants or whatever it was that would bring me back to health. As a fruitarian, I started losing my teeth, my teeth started rotting out, my bones, I had blood and bone cancer again. And I was in pain, excruciating pain. I was in Alaska at this time, and this was the end of August, the first of September at the time that I was there. And it was already getting cold. Their summer is two days. Their spring is three months. They have no, you know, everything else is fall and winter, basically is what they have nine months a year. So I was, yes?

Q: So you're saying you had blood and bone cancer before, so what they did to you, it actually went away?

A: It went away, and then I got it again.

Q: And then it reoccurred how long later?

A: Probably three years. So I was aching. My joints were aching all over. So I was going to leave Alaska and go back to the California desert. And I was deciding whether I was going to kill myself again or not. And let me tell you, probably every other day of my childhood, I thought of suicide. And then at this time, I thought, well, I haven't found the answer. I'm going back into that state again, very painful state. I've looked everywhere for the answers. I'm not going to find them, so I'll just go fast myself to death in the California desert. So as I'm packing up my saddlebags on my sleeping bag, I mean on my bicycle, the Indians dug this hide out of the ground, about this far into the ground. And it was a hide rolled about like this. They unrolled it, and the stinky stuff was in it. And I mean it reeked, it stunk terribly. So, you know, it smelled like somebody had deserted a slaughterhouse and not cleaned it before they left. And I smelled that. It was all, when I looked at it, it was green, it was patina, it was green, it was black, it was white, it had brown. All these different molds in it. And I thought, some kind of herbal formula, but it smelled like rotten carcass. So I just thought, you know, I didn't know that meat had mold. I knew it had gangrene, but outside of a living body you can have gangrene. So, when they wrapped it up and reburied it, when they heard this bird call coming from downwind, I said, what are you guys doing? The kids were, they smelled it and they were jumping up and down and happy to smell it. And it just made me want to vomit. And they said, well it didn't stink a half mile downwind, we have to rebury it. So I had to stick around for this and see what happened and what this was. I wanted to find out why everyone was so excited to eat it when they would eat it. So I waited for a few more days and they dug it up and it smelled so bad that if I got within five feet of it, I would vomit. I would just vomit at the idea of the smell of it.

So they started eating it. They portioned it out to the kids. For 36 hours, they ate that area. From here to that wall back there and here. A bunch of them, all of them. There were only about 60 of the Eskimos and some of them were children. The children were eating like a pound, infants were eating like a pound in that 36 hours. Young adults were eating a pound and a half. Adults were eating two to three pounds each. This stunk terribly. They got me to eat just a ping-pong ball-sized amount. How they did that is I had some cotton balls, because still my gums would bleed once in a while, so I put cotton in a clay packet to keep it from bleeding. I took some cotton, put some musk oil on them, put them up my nose, and then ate one little piece. At that time, when the temperature got below 50 degrees, I was frozen in pain in every joint. So I went back to my sleeping bag. The sun doesn't go down at that time of the year. It's up 22 hours a day. And it gets dark a little bit. And it's not really hot though, because you're still in an environment with ice all around everywhere. And it's still cold, very cold there.

Q: [unintelligible] Now I can only hear them.

A: You're going to have to sit over here.

Q: Maybe I'll sit over there.

A: Yeah, sit over here.

Q: Okay. We could go back where we were.

A: They don't want us down there, because that's a juice bar.

Q: Do you want this next to you?

Q: No, no, it's alright. I just want to hear.

A: Okay. So after eating that, I went back to my campsite, got in my sleeping bag, you know, when it was getting the coldest and I was going into pain. And usually what I do is I'd wake and let the sunlight beat on my sleeping bag until it warmed me enough. That'd be about two hours. Then I'd get out of the sleeping bag and stay in the sun naked for anywhere from 30, 45 minutes. And then I could function with the pain, but function. After having that high meat, which I still didn't know was high meat, I didn't accept it was meat. I got out of the sleeping bag in about 30 minutes. I only had to bake in the sun and get naked about 10 minutes, and I was functioning. I had a little bit more energy. So I went back to the chief, and we're still eating this stuff. And I said, you know, what is this herbal formula? He said, no, no, this is caribou, and it was in a whale or seal blood that was mixed in. And I said, no, no, no, this is mold all in it, meat doesn't have mold like that. Well, yes, I didn't accept it. I was closed-minded, and I just didn't accept it. So I figured, well, they weren't going to help the white boy, so they said, well, we can eat rotten meat and eat raw meat and kill myself. And it wasn't going to happen that way. So I got on my bicycle and went back to Los Angeles. I was pretty weak at that time. So I started throwing my bikes on empty freight cars and riding those down. I got down to Southern California, picked an old Indian burial ground to die. And I was going to fast myself. I knew it would take anywhere from 50 to 65 days to die by just drinking water.  And then coyotes would come down at night. Every night wake me up about midnight playing this little game. And when you're dying, you know, fasting, you start having wild thoughts and maybe having psychic perceptions. You know, I got to the point where after about 10 days of this, 11 days with the coyotes, I was able to feel where they were.

And if I looked where I felt they were, I always caught one. So there were 11 of them by this one night. And the next night, there were 11 of them. They all came together and came up to me and invited me to go hunting with them. Of course, I didn't know that's what they would take me to do. But they were calling me to go with them, to follow them. And they caught a jackrabbit. And they ripped it open and put it on my feet. And I hadn't eaten meat six and a half years at this point. And I had some dairy, some, you know, just to survive. I had some raw dairy. And here was the Easter bunny. I think one reason I became vegetarian was I was so locked into it because I loved animals and didn't want to hurt them. I didn't want to desert them for their milk or anything. So, you know, I looked at coyotes and said, you guys eat this, okay? And he said, we're not going to touch it. And all of a sudden this dialogue that my uncle had with my cousins and brothers when I was a kid went through my head at that moment. And they were going rabbit hunting. And my uncle told them that if you kill a rabbit, if you shoot a rabbit, you need to cook it all the way through and put a stick through it. And you roll it all over the fire for five or six hours until it's dark inside, burned inside. Because rabbits, wild rabbits, have a toxin in them, I don't remember if he said it was a microbe or just a toxin, that would take over the intestines within 24 hours and you'd be dead within 48. And I thought, oh my God, the coyotes want to help me die quickly. I said, this is it. I can take excruciating pain for 48 hours and die quickly. That's easy. Rather than having to spend another 45 to 50 days fasting. And that's miserable if you're fasting in the desert. Very cold at night, hot in the day. And dehydrating, having to end up drinking tons of water so you don't have headaches and all kinds of other problems.

So I ate the rabbit, started eating the rabbit, started coming right back up. It was difficult to eat it. But I forced myself to eat it. After a few bites of swallowing and chewing it, it became pretty tasty. I ate three and a half pounds in one sitting. Jackrabbit's about seven and a half pounds, a double jackrabbit. So they shared the rest of it. I went back to my tent, my sleeping area, my campsite to die. And I knew I was dying because I felt good. And the only time that I felt that good was in a near-death experience where they taught me to let my consciousness leave my body. So that's why I felt like I was dying, but I felt good. Went back to my sleeping bag, got in my sleeping bag, woke the next morning and was able to get out of the sleeping bag in about 30 minutes. And then only had to stay in the sun for about 10 minutes. And then I was mobile again. But this time I had a lot of energy. I went on for 24 hours. No pain, no diarrhea, no vomit, no nausea. Just felt energy. I felt good and positive. And then another day went by and I said, felt good, no problems. Another 24 hours went by. 72 hours I was alive, still feeling energetic. More energy than I had in my whole life because I never felt good in my whole life. Even as a vegan as I got healthier I never felt energetic. And with the back pain, I always had to get off my bicycle every hour to hour and a half and get in yoga postures to stretch out my back because my back was still in excruciating pain all the time from the medical therapies. So three days went by and I realized those Indians were telling me the truth. That whole time raw meat was the answer. So I started dealing with rabbits, eggs, scorpions, whatever I could get out there. Not very profitable.

So I got on my bicycle and went to visit farmers, made deals to work on the farm in exchange for all kinds of meat, eggs, dairy, whatever I could eat off the farm. And I ate tons. As a fruitarian, I would eat 14 to 25 pounds of food a day with 7 pounds of nuts in a day. I may have 14 pounds of nuts in a day, still woke up 2 ounces lighter the next day. So I ate and vomited. I ate so much sometimes. So I was not forcing myself to vomit. It would just come back up. And I was never satisfied. This, I could eat all day long and be satisfied. And I forced myself to eat, eat, eat. And in two and a half months, I gained 53 pounds. I looked like a scaled down Arnold Schwarzenegger. And I thought, I'm going back to Los Angeles. I found the answer, raw meat, with other raw foods. And when I got to Los Angeles, they said, are you nuts? You're going to get a brain fluke and you'll be an idiot. And I said, well, I've been there, done that. And this is the only thing that's working for me. So I'm going to continue eating the raw meat. And here I am, 65 years old, working my 66th year, and I'm not dead. And I eat raw meat. I've eaten meat with every kind of parasite you could have imagined in it, purposely generated in it, to eat it. And I've never gotten a parasite from eating it. Never. And here I'm pretty healthy. So you have to take a look at that and you say, how much information are we getting about health has nothing to do with health, but has to do with you staying ill, so you pay doctors, pay the pharmaceutical industry. And that's what it's about. I've learned that 99%, 99 out of 100 times, that you hear something from the medical profession, you do the exact opposite and you'll be right. That's a bad statement for the medical profession. 

But it's absolutely true. Their books are written, medical books are written by the pharmaceutical houses. Merck's is this thick, and the word cured never appears there. The word healed never appears there. That should tell you right there, you don't want to go there. They don't offer anything of cure nor of healing. And they say there is no cure, there is no way to reverse this. You have to be on these medications. And if you have allergies to these medications, you have to take these medications. So you're taking 35 medications for one condition. And if you have multiple conditions, you could be taking 200 pills a day.

Q: When did this mindset begin? To tell the public you can't get healed, you can't get cured. When did they start doing that?

A: In the early 1900s when Rockefeller and Carnegie started funding all research in the universities. Then it was out the door. Because they were about their drugs. Because both of them, especially Rockefeller and Carnegie, were applying for pharmaceutical houses. So that was their whole intent. To make drugs the thing of, the medical tool. And they did it.

Q: What percentage of doctors, physicians throughout the United States, are aware of this nefarious situation?

A: I have no idea.

Q: Take a guess.

Q: I'm in the field, they're not aware of it.

A: They must not be.

Q: There's some outside, when they have problems themselves, they'll reach outside of it. Otherwise they're indoctrinated, just like the Republicans.

A: I have about 45 MDs on this guy. And about only a third of them have stopped practicing altogether, and gone and done something else. The others don't do what they did before. They don't hand out the medication that they used to. They suggest alternative ways. But they're always subjected to medical scrutiny, and they could lose their license if they get caught. Because the medical law is, and it's a medical law that got instituted through legislature, that if a doctor recommends anything other than the prescribed medical ways which were produced by the pharmaceutical industry, for ten years, less than ten years, they are subject to lose their license in jail. In jail time, yes. So they cannot prescribe or recommend any alternative unless a patient has suffered ten years of their disease with all the medical therapies that are available for that disease. Ten years. That means if you go to a doctor, you will never hear any natural cure or anything from that doctor until you have suffered for ten years. 

Q: Or died before.

A: Pardon?

Q: Or died before.

Q: So would it be your opinion that it's most advantageous to not have a health care plan?

A: Absolutely. My health care plan is my food, and I'm doing very well with it. There is no health care plan that can help you with them. You go to them and all they will have is medication for you, or surgery, or chemotherapy, or radiation. That's all they offer. There's no other need. Everything is mechanical and drugged. Nothing that will get you to a cure or healing. Just surviving with that disease. That's what they want. They make a lot of money that way. Just think, one diabetic. From one diabetic in this country, and they're over, was it 86 million now? They say there's 53 million, but there's actually, they sell enough for 86 million Americans in this country. From one diabetic, they make $1,200 to $1,800 per month. And a third of that is on Medicare. So we were all paying for them being locked into insulin. Now, as I said, I took insulin from 15 1⁄2 to 22. I went off it cold turkey from the raw milk. And I didn't even know that it was a cure. I just didn't want it anymore. And I started drinking raw milk after about 10 days. That was the day before my mind switched on. I cut off the insulin. I stopped taking it.

Q: That was with type 1 diabetes?

A: Type 1 diabetes. So, and I didn't know that Hippocrates, I didn't learn this until four years later, that Hippocrates used a strict raw milk diet to reverse any kind of diabetes. And that was way back then. Those people were all heavy on the grains and stuff like that, and sugars. At that time, they had their sugar made by the Chinese and Egyptians, which was relatively the same. Sugar was the same. Not sugarcane the way they grew it. They had other grasses that were similar to sugarcane, but they didn't grow as fat and as big, and they were not as phenomenal and as feasible in manufacturing that they could make into, you know... [unintelligible]. I've got to compete with Sally. That they could make into a sugar. So, I'm going to... We're going to take a break, like a 10-minute break now, and then we're going to get into the workshop in a minute. And in this workshop, I'm going to tell you how the body really works, not how the medical pharmaceutical industry tells you how it works, so that you will never be in fear of your body again. You will know what to do. You'll never have to go get an x-ray or anything like that again unless you have a limb ripped off and you need to put that back on. The doctors can be good mechanics. They're not good healers, and they know nothing about health. They absolutely know nothing about health. They really know nothing about bacteria. They're kept in the dark about that, so they'll be stupid and believe in the germ theory. If they knew, you know, what bacteria really did, and that those bacteria that they call pathogenic, pathogenic means disease-causing, are really janitors, then the whole farce would be over. And they are just janitorial bacteria. So we'll get into all of that. So when you leave here, you're going to know what to eat, what to do, how to run your body in the best machine, and the most functional. So take a break and enjoy. Thank you very much.

[unintelligible chatter]

Q: May I ask you a question while I'm waiting? A while ago you talked about the fact that you ate the raw meats with the parasites in them. What prevented you from being a host for the parasites that you ate?

A: Well, I was not. I don't know why. I have probably experienced 30,000 people eating fresh meats and high meats and rotten meats over the past 30 years. And none of them has gotten a parasite in them. So it's a falsehood. I mean, there may be parasites in the meat, but when we eat them, they just become food, too.

Q: It depends on your health if you were contracting parasites.

A: Not even that. I've had people, I thought they were going to die and rot to death. And they didn't get parasites. In fact, they got very well. I know you've been trained in that medical field, and there's great fear of them. I've been all over the borders with children and adults in grave states of health. And they eat the high meat, the rotten meat, never get a parasite. So I think it's pretty much a myth. I'm not saying that parasites don't exist, but I've tried to get a lot of them, and I haven't been able to do that. But we're going to get into that when I get there.

Q: So I didn't want to supersede your message.

Q: Just to follow up, so how do people all over the world get parasites? Or is that some kind of a myth that they don't have parasites that doesn't affect them, or do they get parasites?

A: We're going to talk about that. I want everybody to listen. Okay, so all the bacteria in the mouth is how we start digestion. Now, we have the ptyalin enzyme in the salivary glands also. The ptyalin enzyme, the only other animal that we know of is the horse. It is a carbohydrate-digesting enzyme, but it's only 2% of our saliva. Now, if you address just that, then our saliva starting to digest, there's only 2% should be carbohydrate. Now, if you take a look at our ancestors, like Lucy that was 4 million years old, and the latest ones that were discovered 2 years ago, they're up to 5 million years old. Homo sapiens, their pancreases were two and a half times smaller than ours. They ate no carbohydrates, they only ate meats, raw meats. And there isn't a lot of pancreas required. When you look at the animals who don't need a lot of sugar, what does the pancreas do? The pancreas addresses the food that's taken into the body. As soon as you begin eating something, the pancreas is stimulated. It measures everything that you eat, the nutrition that is in that particular food. It can be a tomato from the same vine, or a cup of milk from one animal to another animal, and the body addresses it differently. The pancreas is an architect. It decides how that food that you're eating will be restructured into cells and nutrition and energy for your particular body. So that's a very fine chore that has to be done. It does not normally make insulin. In fact, if you eat the proper foods on this diet with only 5% carbohydrates and 10 at the most, you don't even have to manufacture insulin. Insulin is to make a lot of sugar into a glycogen to store it when there's excess consumed. If you do not eat a high amount of carbohydrates, especially starch carbohydrates, you won't have any insulin activity. 

You don't need insulin unless you're overeating carbohydrates for the digestive nature of your system. And when we swallow the food, the next stage is, did I tell you we have more bacteria than dogs and cats and don't bite anybody? Don't bite anybody. When the food goes down to the stomach, what do we receive? The stomach lining forms hydrochloric acid, and that's a digestive enzyme, digestive juice. And what does that do? It takes large particles of meat and reduces it to smaller molecules so that bacteria can infiltrate and eat it. 90% of digestion is bacteria. 90% of digestion is bacteria. If all of your food was liquid, you wouldn't even need digestive juices. All you would need is bacteria. According to the latest research by biologists who are also endocrinologists, they found that there are 150 bacterial genes to every one human gene. That means that you're not even a half a percent human. You are 99.5% bacteria. Bacteria perform all functions of the body. Cleansing, building, disassembling, like in digestion, disassembles your food, and strengthening, energy, everything, every process is by bacteria. Without bacteria, you would not function. You would not have cells produced. Everything is bacterial. Those that are called pathogenic are actually janitors. When you look at it in a Petri dish, which is not a natural environment. A Petri dish is not the human body. It is not a natural environment. You put human cells or any kind of animal cells in that environment, and it's not in its natural biological form. The juices are in there. That is a serum that the laboratory has made that can sustain cells, but not help them thrive. They don't grow and multiply the same as they would in the body. They don't function near like they do in the body, and they're in a toxic environment. They're full of antibiotics. You know that every Petri dish contains antibiotics. 

Every Petri dish in every experiment contains antibiotics to keep the cell from dying because it's a natural process. It goes into an environment where it's not supposed to be living, so the bacteria in that cell will start decomposing, and it will die. You see in medical professions, bacteria kills cells, and then they see cells in a Petri dish which are breaking down from other, let's say, so-called parasites. But again, the cell is not in its natural environment, and it's not supposed to be alive outside of that natural environment. So, of course, natural janitors, whether they're parasitical, bacterial, fungal, are going to be born from the actual tissue. So it isn't that your cell has to go outside of itself to find a parasite or a bacteria or a fungus to break it down. It's innate within every cell. So, meat that you're eating that has parasites, the parasites will help to break down the dead toxic tissue in that particular animal. So you're not going to be a threat. It's not going to be a threat to you unless you have the same kind of decaying tissue in your system. And I found that a parasite from one animal will not necessarily live in another animal. I did that by taking chickens. Chickens have a high rate of pinworms that are fed toxic, contaminated food, especially by-product food like throw-off from Purina or General Mills or any of those cereals. They give that to these chickens. These chickens are eating very toxic food. None of it's alive. And then they start getting these pinworms in their intestines. They're eating all the damage from this high-sugar processed food that's damaged their intestinal walls and therefore have all these toxic cells in their intestines. So the pinworms eat that. It's not eating the bird apart and not killing the bird. It's trying to save the bird's intestinal tract. I've taken parasites from one pinworm from one chicken and give it to another and they don't procreate. They don't multiply. 

However, I give a chicken the same diet and all of a sudden they'll start producing pinworms that are on the same bad diet. But it isn't that they got it from another chicken. It's from their own cells. All of those properties are in every cell. Every property in a cell, whether it's an animal or a vegetable, has a process for its own decomposition. Otherwise we wouldn't have recycling. Things wouldn't become fertilizer that were alive to grow new stuff. It wouldn't be that way. But everything contains its own ecological system. And that's what you have to understand. So when the food goes down to the stomach, we have hydrochloric acid. It breaks down the larger molecules so we can reduce them to molecules so that the bacteria can infiltrate it and eat it. Simple. Our food is feces, urine, and sweat of bacteria. That's our food. Once you get that concept in your head, you say, oh my god, that's disgusting. But it's true. I can't look at it as disgusting anymore. But that's the truth. You're eating the fecal matter, the urine, and the sweat of bacteria. They consume your food. Their byproduct is your food. They are really parasites. They're symbiotic parasites that we live off of. 

Q: The parasites we see as worms, the parasites that we know.

A: Those are larger ones. Those help big breaking downs of the body. Like when I studied the South African children that had distended stomachs and had all these tapeworms. Now, all the children who were on their natural diets eating meat, whether it was cooked or raw, they had no tapeworms. Only the children who were fed by this Feed the Children agency, which were feeding them processed cereals that were thrown away from this country, paid top dollar for them, get sent over there, and were being fed processed powdered milk and water. What they do is take the cereals from the powdered milk, put it in water, and that was their food. High acrylamides. Acrylamides were damaging these children's intestines, but 99% of all that cereal was carbohydrate, processed carbohydrate, concentrated sugar. Tapeworms eat sugar. Toxic sugar. So these tapeworms are preventing the children from overexposing themselves to all this sugar. 

Q: And they vaccine the children.

A: Pardon?

Q: And they vaccine the children.

A: Yeah, and actually they were helping the children live a little longer on a very bad diet. 

Q: Right, the paradigm shift sounds then, according to what's being said here, is that the system, the human system, is not made, it wasn't made and then all of a sudden bacteria are assisting. The system was made for, not that the bacteria is assisting us, our system is assisting bacteria and that's how we're able to survive. So this is a completely opposite understanding of what we have an idea of what really is. It's an interesting idea.

A: Well, think about it. You have 150 bacterial genes in every line and table of genes. We are bacteria.

Q: So we're basically, exactly. So then once again, what we really are is bacteria in the shell. So the same way we have a soul in our body's shell, we're really bacteria. I mean, come on. Are we going to be deep on this now?

A: It's so simple. When you really understand that, you say, what is the medical system talking about? Are they nuts? Are they crazy?

Q: Or are we nuts? But we've got to figure that out. Because we follow it.

A: We accept that. And we don't have to. And that's what this is about.

Q: We're not here thinking this, but we're going to have to figure it out, exactly what the truth is.

A: We already did. At least I already did. 95% of diseases reverse on this diet.

Q: It makes sense. There's more bacteria than there are cells.

A: So, when the food digests, that's out, when the bacteria excrete and secrete, that is our food. And we also, in the stomach, in the lower compartment of our one stomach, bile dumps from the bile duct. What does bile do? Bile disassembles fat molecules the same way hydrochloric acid disassembles protein molecules. Without that, every fat we'd eat would end up as diarrhea going out of the body. So we need the bile to help break it down. So the bacteria that eats fat can infiltrate it and eat it. Now, it's a lot harder to digest fat than any other food, yet fat is the most important food there is. And during our entire small intestine, the food traveling through the intestine, it breaks it down. All the bacteria keeps eating and eating and eating, anything that has been eaten by the bacteria that preceded it. So all the way through. So we have 24 hours to digest our food before it passes out as fecal matter. And anything that's not digested, that's what is fecal matter. Now, a lot of people that go on this diet have been eating very bad foods their whole lives. Then when they get on this diet, all of a sudden they think they have constipation because they're not having bowel movements every day. Wrong. Your body is so hungry for this good stuff, it's absorbing and utilizing everything so you don't have all this fecal matter anymore. And people would expect, well, I have to go to the bathroom every day. Because, again, the medical profession has drummed it into your brain. You have to go to the toilet every day. I have people that go sometimes once every seven days. And they digest everything. If you look, like with the coyotes, when they lived entirely on what they hunted for, their fecal matter was always just some bone fragments, and it was always white with fur. And it would just disintegrate after a day in the sun. 

They'd digest everything, but all of the bone if there was a big animal. Of course, if it was a rabbit, they'd digest all the bone too, but not the hair. So you see that most of what they... well, everything that they discarded was what they couldn't digest. So if you're eating only what you can positively digest, you're not going to have excrement or much of it, unless your body's throwing off its own dead tissue. And then you will have some dead tissue waste from your own body that you will dispel in the form of fecal matter. When we get into the bowel... Now, the hydrochloric acid and the bile will dump and be made or transported from the stomach to the rest of the intestines during the whole process of the small intestine. So you don't have just the hydrochloric acid in the stomach and the bile in the stomach, you have it dispensed all throughout the small intestine to help digest, break down the larger particles into smaller particles. That is a process. It's a 24-hour process. I'm repeating it. It's a 24-hour process in the human body. It doesn't all happen at once. If you liquefy your foods to an extent that the digestive juices and bile does not have to recur or be utilized, And of course, you're going to absorb your foods very quickly, like an egg. The egg white, which is all protein, is all liquid. It doesn't require hydrochloric acid. The yolk is all liquid. All of that fat is liquid. All your B vitamins, everything, B12, everything, vitamin E, vitamin A, everything is in that egg yolk. All of your fat and vitamins are in the egg yolk. It doesn't require much bile, because it's already liquid. 

Q: For that reason, you take so many eggs.

A: Yeah, eggs are the most easy. When I get somebody who's really sick, I put them on only eggs. And some people who have Crohn's disease, I have them on eggs for six months to a year, and that's 80% of their diet. And they get well quickly. And only with a food like that can your body digest without spending most of its energy on digestion. Egg digests in 27 minutes. 27 minutes. Egg can be fully digested in 27 minutes. That's remarkable. Milk still takes 10 to 16 hours. And it's liquid. The protein in it and the fats in it have a tendency to grow. So the bacteria in it can actually reproduce the milk and make more milk than what you really consume. And then the body absorbs that bacterial digestion and that bacterial secretion of that bacterial secretion. So milk can multiply. Egg cannot. Egg cannot multiply like milk can. But milk takes 10 to 16 hours to digest. Meat, if you're eating it in chunks and chew it, it's going to take 19 to 24 hours to digest. And most of it will not be digested. Only when it's pated will most of it be digestible. You're still going to have excrement. You're going to have waste. All animals, look at herbivores, they only digest 67% maximum of all the grasses and hay that they eat. If you look at their fecal matter, you've got to see all these fibers all throughout it that they haven't digested. Then some other animal comes along and eats it, it's pre-digested for them so they can eat it. There was a tribe in rural Georgia, Russia, for centuries that they were so, the poverty and part of those tribes that didn't own land, didn't own animals, ate buffalo manure. And they thrived, they were very healthy, lived to 130, 140 years old. And National Geographic did an article on them, you'll never see it again. And there are very few of those copies left on this planet, they've destroyed all of the purpose of it, they've never redone it.

They interviewed some of the couples that were married, can you imagine being married to somebody for 128 years and still loving them? That's miraculous, you know, miraculous. All these other people were married for 96 years, 110 years, all of these couples. And the poor of them ate a lot of buffalo crap, because the buffalo had pre-digested everything, so all of a sudden a human could make that into food and digest it. Because if we eat whole vegetables, we only digest 2%, because we're not made like an herbivore. A herbivore has 2.5 times more digestive tract than we do, takes 48 hours to digest what they digest, and they only digest 67%. Plus they have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fats and the proteins. They are meant to eat vegetation, we are not. So if it's pre-digested by them, it's gone through 24 hours of digestion, and it comes out in an acidic form, then animals that normally eat animal product can eat that and get a lot of nutrients from it. I'm not saying go on a shit diet, a cow poop diet. I'm saying that some people have thrived on it. You just have to know what you're eating and what your body can digest. And these people, the poor people of these tribes, because they had no animals, they weren't landowners, they ate all of that, and they thrived, just as well as the people who were wealthy. Not a pleasant diet, I mean if that's most of what you ate, probably the smell and the taste is going to be good for you, good to you. A diet that's not appealing to me, so I'd rather eat the meat than the dairy and live on a diet like that. I'm just showing you your options by your digestive tract. So don't think anything is taboo about fecal matter and bacteria and all of that, think about that. If bacteria cause, if E. coli cause disease, remember the major digestive bacteria in the colon is E. coli. If E. coli was a danger, wouldn't all the animals on this planet be dying? Because they go around licking each other's butts all the time, their own and other animals.

Why is that so dangerous? Why do we accept the medical profession's garbage about that being so dangerous? Fecal matter is not dangerous unless it's full of toxic industrial chemicals. But it's not a diet I want, but it's not something to be afraid of either. It will not hurt you unless it's contaminated with arsenic or mercury or some other contaminant.

Q: So are we considering carnivores, herbivores, or omnivores?

A: I'm getting into it. If you have questions, write them down, because I guarantee I will answer 99% of them. And when we're finished, we'll have a Q&A, and all those questions that I didn't answer that you have written down, you can ask them. Rarely is there any question, but you will have the time to ask. Okay, so after looking at that, you have to say, okay, that's how the body works. Now how do we know what foods that we really need to eat? We take the bacteria from the different areas of the digestion tract. Now we put it on meats, put it on dairy, we put it on vegetation, we put it on fruit, nuts, grains, everything, cooked, uncooked, and see what happens. In my laboratory experiments with those foods, our enzymes taken at every different point and put on those foods, the only foods that it constantly digests is what the animals eat instead of foods, milk, meat, eggs, those are the only foods that it completely worked on and broke down and digested. If they were liquid form, it digested all of it. If it were, you know, larger particles, larger chunks of meat, they didn't get to digest all of it before they dried out, because I didn't have a, no way that I could construct an environment for them and observe them at the same time. But when the meat was in a liquid form, like I put the meat and ground it in a food processor into a mince, or a pate, and then blend it with milk to make it completely liquid, with no solvent, and hermetically sealed so there's no oxygen as it blended, then put it in a larger patriot petri that had the bacteria. Now how did I get the bacteria? I had people that volunteered to have tubes cut down their throat, pulled out, and what they do is upper and lower GI's, I get people to donate some of the stuff.

You know, that is extracted from the upper and lower GI, and that's what I use and put on these foods. And it was those foods, those animal products, were the only foods that our bacteria, that the human bacteria had a proclivity to. In the vegetation, it barely etched the vegetation, at most, even when it was liquefied, the only thing that was absorbed were just some of the vitamins and enzymes and minerals from the juice of the vegetation, but it didn't break down, barely etched, any cellulose. Even looking at it under a microscope, barely etched. So, and the fruit's the same thing, barely made a mark in those. So we are not meant to eat those things. And if you took a look, take a look at the primates who eat fruit, what do you see? Crazy monkeys. You ever seen a monkey that's always jumping around and masturbating, whether they're male or female? That's what they do. In the jungle, the same thing. In Thailand, I get to observe a lot of monkeys. I've got a piece of property and the monkeys live and cultivate the bananas up on the mountain side. And they're jumping around, they're just crazy, so hyper, just the way humans are, the fruitarians that I know, that live on fruits. They're not clear in thinking and they're very nervous and all of a sudden, and then they get very sleepy from eating all the sugar and go to sleep. If you want to behave that way, eat a lot of fruit. Now for me, when I came from a very sick being, and I came to a fruitarian diet, to me it was a blessing. First time I had energy without drugs. But I didn't realize that it was a toxic high, it was a toxic high. I was, you know, a evangelistic ve.etarian. I would make people feel bad and I would froth at the mouth, hitting them with the bile that I had against killing animals. That's what it did to me. That's not a good person to be. That isn't the person I wanted to be.

So when I realized that, I started cutting back on the fruit. And let me tell you, that behavior continued until I reduced the fruit down to no more than 5% of my diet. And if you look at the citric acid cycle in generating energy, you've got 80% fat, whether it's from fat made from normal fat that you eat from an animal or fat made from a grain altered into a ketone or another form of fat which you can't think of right now, or from a protein made into a fat. Your body can convert any nutrient into another nutrient, but it's a difficult process. And when you make fat from grain or any kind of a starch or from a protein, the fat will only generate two and a half times less energy than a normal animal fat. So if you want the greatest amount of energy, you eat fats that are made from animal fats. Dairy, eggs, meats. 

Q: That explains why I don't have enough strength when I eat avocados than when I eat cheese. 

Q: Maybe we should also expect that meat includes fish and such.

A: Oh yes, meat is all kinds of flesh food. It just doesn't mean you have to eat meat. Meat is any kind of flesh food. So, in the fat production, we build two and a half times more energy from fat than we do from carbohydrate and protein. Think about it. We produce two and a half times more energy from fat that's made from fat than we do from carbohydrates and protein. Even if we're using, let's say, glycogen to run the brain and the nervous system, when you use a carbohydrate fat or a carbohydrate-produced glycogen, which carbohydrate-produced, it will be very sticky. So, your thinking will not be clear. You actually have the synapse that drag because of the sweetness. The bacteria that moves in there is moving slower because it's in a sticky, thick environment. And I'll get into food eating later on that will explain how we can utilize everything to make us more productive in our lives. So, have you ever seen a skinny weightlifter or a skinny wrestler? They have no strength. Schwarzenegger, when I used to watch him work out in the 70s, late 70s, he would work out eating tremendous amounts of raw eggs and raw fat, raw dairy, raw butter, and raw meats. That's Austria, that's common for their athletes. And he would eat all of that until it came time to exhibit. And he was a bodybuilder. But really, he was a weightlifter until it came time to exhibit. Then he would stop eating all that fat, only eat the protein, and eat just a little bit of milk, and then he would become very cut, with very little fat in his muscles. And he went from lifting about 437 pounds down to 237. By the time he was exhibiting, because all the fat was depleted from his muscles, without the fat, he didn't have that strength. That's almost half of the strength that he had with the meat. So fat is very, very important. Nutrients in the body. And I'll get into that more when I get, when I talk about different kinds of fats.

Now, so in digestion, all of those, the hydrochloric acid, when I put those on those different foods, and I put the bile, the bile our liver produces on those other foods, again, it always worked on the animal fats 100%, as long as they were liquid. If I put it in with the vegetation or the fruits, very little digestion occurred. We are meat eaters. We are carnivores, period, according to our digestive needs. Even the shape of our intestinal tract, the amount of time going through it, is perfect for digesting non-liquefied meats. So we are only able to digest about 80% of it. That's pretty good. Vegetarian animal and herbivore only digest 67% of those things. So our ratio of 80% is pretty good. But our ancestors didn't have blenders and machines to make it into liquid. So they couldn't rely on any kind of juicing or anything like that, or vegetation, to at least get some vitamins and enzymes and minerals from the vegetable juice. Now, the gorillas will eat leaves. They spit out the pulp. Dogs and cats, you see them eat grass, they spit out the pulp. They only take the juices for the vitamins and enzymes and minerals in it. So you have to think about what your body's structured in. That's what I found was the truth. Okay, then let's get into the human body in general. Let's start with the endocrine gland system. Endocrine gland system are the glands that produce the hormones that enter directly into the blood. That's the endocrine gland system. So we start with the pituitary. We understand that pituitary fluid, when we use it, hormones, help growth. So we know that's for growth. But in what circumstance we'll get into that after we look at all of them. Then we have the pineal gland. Now the pineal gland is a tricky one. We don't know what it is. We put its hormone with other things and we don't know.

But some mystics and gurus say that that is the seat of consciousness. That when we go into the dream state, that is our vehicle to the dream state and those realities and back. And that helps convert the dreams or the experiences into a dialogue where we can understand and interpret it. I've never met anybody wise enough to prove it to me. So I have to say I don't know what the pineal gland does. Then we come down to the thyroid gland. When we take a look at this, this is very interesting. Only placing anybody that occurs. Right thyroid, left thyroid, two backups, two backups. So you have six thyroid glands. What is so important in the human body that you would have five backups for one gland? Pharmaceutical industry uses a ploy of you'll get fat if your thyroid doesn't work. Or you'll lose your hair if your thyroid doesn't work. It doesn't have anything to do with that. What the thyroid does, it protects the heart from the lungs. What happens if you fall out of a tree? You land on your stomach or back and all of a sudden your heart stops and you stop breathing. How many times have you lost the wind? Somebody's hit you or been in a football game or something and you've lost your wind. Your lungs are not breathing. They've stopped. Sometimes the heart stops with it. The thyroxine levels will go sky high in the blood. They'll shock the heart and the lung right back into functioning. How could I prove that? I got a football coach to let me go on to the football team for the whole year. Some guy got hit by five or six guys at one time and was out cold. I got to take a little bit of his blood. They only let me have one cc, but that's all I needed. These laboratories that take three ccs, three sets of ccs, three ccs, it's all waste. They only use about a half a cc to do 12 tests. All that other blood is thrown away. So it's a racket in itself. They take all this blood. Maybe they make it look more important. 

I can still not find a reason for taking that much blood. When I've been in the laboratory, that's all we ever do. And that was a lot of blood using a half a cc. We just threw the rest away. Or we kept it and labeled in case we had to redo the test. But all of that, 90% of that blood was thrown away. Discarded. So, anyway, when these guys got hit on the football team, and that was the best place to find it. You're not going to find it unless it's a boxer. And that's a little tricky getting to a boxer. Because they usually don't get the wind knocked off. They get their brain knocked out. Blackout from a knockout, from a head injury, rather than the torso being impacted to the point where the lungs and the heart stops. So, three times in that football season, there was an injury where the guy was out on the ground for five to ten minutes. Twice taken to the hospital where I took the blood. And by the time he got into the emergency vehicle, which was less than six minutes, all of them were awake. One guy was only two minutes on the field, but he got his blood before that. Every one of them, every thyroxin hormone was sky high. When you get fat, do you see high levels of thyroxin? No. When you lose your hair, do you see very low levels of thyroxin? People who are bald have lots of thyroxin. So why no thyroxin? What does thyroxin have to do with weight gain, weight loss, or hair loss? Nothing. The pharmaceutical industry knows that your biggest weak point is your vanity. Nobody wants to be fat, nobody wants to be bald. Unless you're one of those guys who makes a fortune on being bald. That look, or Star Trek, that's when you want to be bald. So the pharmaceutical industry takes full advantage of your vanity by feeding you some more garbage.

Then we go down to the thymus. The thymus, they say, regulates and helps the lung. It doesn't have anything to do with it. It's channels, it's network, go to the stomach. If you get a poison in your stomach, it gets past the tonsils. Tonsils are a lymphatic system. Part of the lymphatic system that draws poison out of your mouth for the food that you eat. And that breaks it down and neutralizes it, puts it in the fat and tries to dump it into the mucus and get it out of the body. At least neutralize it when it's in your stomach. The thymus is very similar to the tonsils. It regulates poisons that get into the stomach. It's the whitest celled gland of the body. Even more concentrated in fats than anything else other than the white blood cells in the bloodstream. Dumps into the stomach in case there's a poison there and those fats, those hormone states can arrest a poison very rapidly. If it's healthy, if the thymus is healthy. Then we have the... I count the pancreas as partially an endocrine gland because it does make insulin in an emergency situation. We have sugars that shouldn't be there in the body, in the blood, in the stomach. Then the pancreas can secrete insulin. Then we have the adrenal glands. The adrenal glands sit on top of the kidneys. And we've known for centuries that the adrenals secrete adrenaline that is used for fight or flight. Always in an emergency physiological situation. Like when I get hit with a bell, I'd have an injured area. The adrenaline would rush to help the blood move faster, the lymphatic system move faster, everything move faster to clean out the injured tissue, the injured cells, the damaged cells. 

Let's say, got the strap and let's say 10,000 capillaries were ruptured. And all of the red blood cells that were in the capillaries got into the tissue. And the veins, let's say 200 veins were broken and ruptured. And those red blood cells and white blood cells got into the tissue outside of the bloodstream. What happened? Those red blood cells and white blood cells were not in the right environment. So what did they do? They decomposed themselves with bacteria. If it's really a huge injury, it could be even gangrene, a fungus, or a parasite that needs to help because it's such a big injury. Like when you have your arm cut off or something like that. Then you may have a parasite. One interesting movie where they showed it was The Gladiator. And Crowe got his character, Maximus, got cut from the sword pretty badly. And he wakes and finds maggots eating at his wound. And the African said, and he starts to brush them away, and the African says, don't brush those away, they clean it. They clean it. And then later on in the film, he said, see how they cleaned it. And that's true. Maggots will help clean. African tribes, when there's a huge injury, will put maggots, take the maggots from meat that they've rotted, and then put it on there to clean a wound, to make it clean and precise so that it will regenerate. So you have the adrenal glands, which are for fight or flight. Then we have the gonads, the only endocrines that are left. Remember, there are two here. We have five here. So the body consists of heart and lungs, the most important. Of course, being able to climb a tree, get away from a prey, is pretty important. Or being able to fight when something's attacking you, is pretty important. So you've got two of them and two testes. I guess, you know, maybe when we're going to face extinction or something like that, you have two testes to procreate. And that's what the testes and the ovaries, the ovum, there's two of those. So the one is damaged, you always have the other. 

All the endocrine glands, in my experience, with healthy animals that are on their natural diet, endocrine glands do not function unless there's an emergency. Now, when would it be an emergency for the pituitary to secrete hormone to help something grow? When it's not fed right. When the good food that naturally creates reproduction in stem cells is absent. Bad food, bad diet, or starvation. I'm saying that there was a forest fire five million years ago, and all the animals were run away or killed. And the tribes that were left had no meat to eat, so they had to subsist on gathering nuts and grains and grubs and worms, whatever they could eat to sustain themselves. That's not enough to help reproduce stem cells. We need animal products to produce certain... Most of your...  They're the other stem cells. We need meats to do that. We need animal products to do that. So, we have a period where children wouldn't grow unless they had a pituitary to secrete the hormone to help them grow on nuts and not the best foods or inferior foods for their bodies. And that can only be sustained for a while until they can get to other places and get the proper food. And that may sustain them. In my experiments with animals, it may sustain them, depending upon the animal. If it were the human, it would be about six months. And the pituitary hormones do not really do much after that. So, you've got a six month span. The thyroid gland, I've already talked about when it gets inspired. It's when you have the wind and heart stop. You know, the lungs and heart stop. So, you fell out of a tree, landed on your back or on your stomach and knocked the wind out of your stomach. Your heart and lungs stopped. Thyroxin would be produced and dumped heavily into the blood stream to get the heart and the lungs working again. And the thymus, it's only when you poison yourself that it's active.

The adrenal glands, again, are not for normal activity. Your normal activity comes from eating the proper foods with enough fat to make the good energy. You would need adrenaline if your body is producing the right fats. Eating the right fats, mixing in the right nutrients to transform it into energy. Why would you need the adrenaline? Except for fight or flight. So, I found that all of the endocrine glands, when you're on a healthy diet, are for emergency purposes only. But, because people are eating bad foods, full of toxins, 60,000 chemicals go into foods now. There are 60,000 chemicals used in food production. On this planet, 60,000. We have 80,000 chemicals altogether. 60,000 of them are used in processing foods. So, all that kind of toxicity is what? Causing the body to be weak and feeble. Of course, we need hormones. Hormones are what? Hormones are substances that are 60-80% fat, 15-35% protein, and only 5% carbohydrate. Always only 5% carbohydrate. I don't care how much sugar you eat. Whether the body has made the fat from a carbohydrate, or a protein, or from another fat, it is still a ketone. I mean an acetone, or an acetate that has been converted, is still fat. And that's what your hormones are. So, of course, the body is toxic. It dumps its toxins into fat. Everywhere we have intense fat in the body, especially the brain, we find the greatest amount of toxins. Whether it's heavy metals, whether it's industrial chemicals, cast and kerosene, and all the byproducts of those. Whether it's from combustion, or just immediate contamination. Fat is where the body stores those toxins, so they won't hurt your live cells. Fat is so important. So you've got that ratio in the hormones.

So, of course, the body is going to use them when it can, especially when you're skinny. It's going to use your hormones to bind with poisons, because hormones are mainly fat. So the body is in an emergency situation. Everybody who eats a common diet, their bodies are always in an emergency situation, so they should have higher hormonal levels. Pharmaceutical industry doesn't take you back to the first stage and say, eat good foods, you don't need the hormones. They say, eat all this toxic crap, take this toxic medication, and then make sure your hormone levels are high and take our medication, our synthetic medication. And it just keeps you going. Remember this, the medical profession makes no money when you're well. They do not want you well. And the people who own the pharmaceutical houses or the same ones that own, have the greatest shares in food production. They do not want you well. All this stuff is known. My father was part of the, my father was an inventor. He invented the first Bering computer when he was in college at Purdue. He worked for the military, he worked for General Electric, different military projects, but he worked mainly for General Electric on their military projects. And they knew exactly what food did. But my father didn't care. He ate the same stuff to begin with, the other scientists and everybody else that were in their projects. They knew what was good food. Even urine, they know is a good thing. Urine is supposed to be good. Urine is nothing other than the blood, without red blood cells, and white blood cells, without many of them, and with extra ammonia that the kidney makes. So what do the astronauts drink when they're up in those missiles, those rockets? They drink their urine. They recycle their urine. That is their water. Think about that.

Your urine is a good thing as long as you're eating a clean diet. All that stuff is known by these people, yet they want you sick, under control, and sick and feeding them lots of money. Then we get into the organs. We have the brain, and of course we know what that does. That allows you to repeat activity. It allows you to execute activity from a conscious place. Say I want to lift my arm. I can just think about it and do it. If I didn't have a brain, it wouldn't happen. The body would just sit there. Even though it may not be a conscious act, let's say something comes at me, the brain registers that I automatically block. It's not something I choose to do. It's automatic. But if we didn't have the brain, the body couldn't respond that way. Some people are blind, and they can sense something coming at them, so they can still block it. So it's not the eyes, but it's the brain in itself. That eyes are just one property of receiving information. All of that is connected with the brain, so that we can be human. We can do back flips, we can climb trees, we can cultivate, we can make machines, we can operate machines. We can do all this stuff because we have a brain. Now, how does the brain operate? It operates by a fluid system, the neurological fluid system. And that neurological fluid system is contained mostly of metals. Metals reflect light and conduct electricity, and that's how the nervous system and brain function. So you've got a lot of aluminum, you have lead, you have cadmium, you have mercury, you have all of these metals which in an electrical environment in trace amounts, tiny, fragment amounts, do a lot of good things. In concentrated amounts, and cauterized from heat, they damage the system and are considered free radicals that do a lot of damage. 

When we cook a food and we fractionate the metals in the food, even though they're trace amounts, they have a tendency to collect in the brain and nervous system instead of passing out in the feces when they're not necessary. So they collect in the brain and the nervous system. They dump out the teeth, out the gums, they dump out the salivary glands and the tongue, mainly. Also they dump out the eyes, the tear ducts, the ears, and the mucous membranes in the sinuses. When you have a head cold, that's the brain cleaning. When you dump all that mucus out of here, that's the brain cleaning from here, from your throat. Those are all necessary body responses to toxicity that's collecting in the body. You have to get rid of it. And cooking causes the body to produce 32 toxic byproducts. And I list them in the last 50 pages of my recipe book. And those are only 32 that were identified. There's been no funding to look at all of the minute categories that go under those 32. The three top on the list that have been studied the most are acrylamides, heterocyclic amines, and lipid peroxide. Lipid peroxides are from fats that are cooked and processed. Heterocyclic amines are from proteins that are cooked and processed. The acrylamides are from carbohydrates that are cooked and processed. And everybody's heard about acrylamides. New York City has outlawed trans-fatty acids. It means plastic fats. When you hydrogenate a pressed oil, it turns it into plastic. It has the same molecular structure as plastic. Identical. That's how you make plastic. You take oil, whether it's petroleum oil or vegetable oil, and you subject it to the hydrogenation process, and you have plastic.

The longer you subject it, the harder the plastic becomes. So margarine, all of those oils, castor oil, all of them, what are they using now? All of those oils that are now substitutes for butter and animal fats, lard, all of those are hydrogenated. 99% of them are hydrogenated vegetable oils. Some say, well, we don't hydrogenate them. But they still put it through a process that makes their oils toxic. But hydrogenated vegetable oils are the worst because they aren't plastic. They don't convert into fuel, and they don't lubricate the body properly. They clog it.

Q: Margarine is one of them.

A: Margarine is one of them. Who grew up on margarine? It was our generation first.

Q: It was the new thing.

A: Plastic, plastic, plastic. That's what we were fed. And the King and Queen of England were responsible for that. They were responsible for World War II. The King and Queen of England owned 70% of all food production in the world. Through their trust, they owned Purina General Foods. All of the manufacturers, big manufacturers in this country. King and Queen had been involved in food production for eternity. Their family. And they pushed World War II through their little minions like the Rockefellers and Rothschilds. Their minions to create World War II. And what was the big thing? What was the big thing that came out of it? Besides all the money they made on blowing up bombs, every time a bomb went off, the blue-chip stock went up. You make $50 on a bomb exploding, you know, 50 cents on a gunshot. How many guns and how many bombs went off? How many Jeeps and all that? Big money. War industry. The biggest thing that came out of that was canned food industry. What did we see on TV in those days? Support your troops, eat canned foods. It wasn't called canned foods, it was called canned goods. Put a word in there, goods. Canned goods. Those were the exact words that they used. Not canned foods, canned goods. Planning to spin on stuff. And what did canned goods get us? What came in the fifties right after 1947?

Q: Botulism?

A: Botulism, two other things. Tonsillitis, polio. All that metal went into the spinal cord and went into the tonsils. The king and queen knew this after the fact and they started making plastics. In the late fifties, mid fifties and late fifties, They sponsored the development of plastic to coat the cans. So in the early 60s, all of a sudden, we have plastic coatings in the cans. But plastic coatings do what? They throw out polymers and phthalates. And what do they do? They disrupt male and female reactions in a body. They can turn a male into a female and a female into a male. Because they were very close to saying, a lot of doctors were saying, wait a minute, we've got some kind of processed food that's causing all this polio. There were several doctors in Los Angeles that were blaming it on ice cream. And there were several that were blaming it on metals in canned foods getting into the spinal cord. And that was the truth. That's what they wanted. And all the metals getting into the tonsils. So instead of getting rid of processed, prepackaged foods, it was, have your tonsils ripped out, have this medication for your polio, and then let's give you a polio vaccine, which has nothing to do with stopping polio. Because the four states, three states, and one city, county, they kept records of the rates of polio in 1958, when the first polio vaccines were given, showed that the polio went up to 400% more. And those people who had polio vaccines. So the polio vaccine was what? Mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, detergent, and ether. All full of metals, going into the spinal cord, creating more polio. So it was all big money, scam, and hoax. All vaccines are.

Q: How's the canned foods now?

A: Pardon?

Q: How are the canned foods now?

A: They have the plastic coating on all of them, but you're still going to have hormonal disruption.

Q: What about tuna fish in a can?

A: Pardon?

Q: Tuna fish in a can.

A: It's plastic coated too. If it gets through that plastic, let's say the plastic isn't sprayed evenly in the can, and it gets through, then you're going to have tin and the plastic in your system. 

Q: Plastic is better than before, but it's still toxic.

A: No, it's not better than before. It's just different. 

Q: It's still toxic. It's still terrible.

A: Very toxic.

Q: So tuna fish in a can is not a good idea.

A: Absolutely. No food, no packaged food is safe. There's all kinds of toxins in the process. Most of the food to pass the FDA and the USDA scrutiny has to have no animal fat and bacteria in it, or else it's short shelf life. All companies are striving for the longest shelf life. That means you can't have any product in it that can instigate a bacteria with moisture. Like milk. Your big milk dairies, like Arden, all of those, you're not drinking milk anymore. They take the milk from the cow, they extract the animal protein from it and the animal fat from it. They put back in it hydrogenated vegetable oil, plastic fat. That's what they put back in it. It's a blue liquid. They take all those other things, it's a blue liquid. Then they put the oil in it, it's still a blue liquid. So they take dolomite. You'll see these big factories, these big dairies, have the biggest buildings that they have. They'll have dolomite mounds. It contains rock that is mainly calcium. And they shovel it into these vats with this blue liquid to make it white again. And they call that milk. There's no relationship to milk. None. And the FDA should ban it and never let them use milk. The word milk should never be on there. It's no safer than Coca-Cola or Pepsi-Cola or any soda. It is all chemical. 

Q: What do they do with the protein and the fat that they take?

A: They make it into animal food and sell it to animals. Animal feed.

Q: Is that good? That casein that they give to the animals, is that good or bad?

A: They use kerosene or gasoline.

Q: So all the milk is like what you just described?

A: Let's say you go into a health food store and buy some. But they're getting off the track too. Because they're getting non-organic milk and they're labeling it organic. 

Q: Unless you go to an organic place. Other than that, any milk you find in a supermarket is what you just explained?

A: Correct. Unless you're a small dairy producing for a local area.

Q: Is casein good?

A: Casein is a protein of milk. And it's very good. It helps keep your cells together. All 22 amino acids are important. They all have a function. They all have a part and structure. Like you have wood here, you have metal here. All of them have something to do with the structure. Different structures that you need. Veins, arteries, skin, hair.

Q: This is pertinent to this. Every time I've been to seminars, they always say, what are you going to do? Stop dairy. I can understand from that perspective, it's not really milk. But no one really said it's not milk. They're just saying that milk itself, because we're not cows, so what are we doing drinking milk? And no other animal, after it becomes an adult, drinks milk. So how do we address that?

A: Are you meat?

Q: I'm meat, yeah. I'm bacteria.

A: You eat meat. Milk is just meat digested. 

Q: But how come the other animals and animals don't eat milk afterwards?

A: That's because their mothers stop them.

Q: But isn't that natural?

A: Well, the woman would be going around suckling all the time.

Q: But you see what I'm saying, it's not natural.

A: Babies don't want to stop drinking it. I don't care if it's not natural, it's a good food.

Q: Don't say you care if it's not natural, that's what we're here for, if it's natural.

A: No, it doesn't matter. I'm talking about here, what is good food. I'm talking about what you can ingest and make in your body properly for good health. I don't care if it's natural or not. And suckling an animal isn't natural after, of course, the baby gets to a certain age.

Q: And we don't live in a society that's natural.

A: Correct.

Q: But we're seeking the ideal, so we don't have to say, well, we're going to just settle with the unnatural. I'm seeking the ideal, so I want to go to exactly the natural. But that would be my decision.

A: Yeah, but look at your Maasai and Samburu and Fulani. The Fulani lives 95% on raw milk. The Samburu lives 60% on raw milk.

Q: Where is the milk from that they live on?

A: 65% on raw milk.

Q: What type of, where are they getting the milk from then?

A: They have their cows. They have cows. That's their wealth. Cows is their wealth. But they know that that gives them, and the Maasai and the Samburu are considered the strongest, tallest, healthiest, smartest, happiest tribes in the world besides the Eskimos. That's as far as happy goes. Eskimos are considered also the happiest. So, and these are all that live on raw meats. Now, the Eskimos don't eat milk. Because they don't have it. They have plenty of blubber and, you know, seal blubber and whale blubber. And they're killing animals to do it.

Q: You mentioned Maasai. Don't they also drink blood?

A: That's only when the calves are suckling. They don't have enough milk to go around to the tribe members, so they take the bulls, they take a bamboo about this long and about this big around, and they cut it into a sharp, and they take this huge slingshot, and they drive it into the juggler vein of a bull. Not the female. They take the milk from the female. And I've seen it. They take that big male, this close, they'll shoot it right into the juggler vein, and that bull goes right back to eating. As if it wasn't. And they've got this huge bamboo shoot in their juggler vein, and bloodpots are spouting out, and they take a cork or another instrument, and they plug it. And then when they don't get enough milk, and all the calves are suckling, they take half milk in their pouch, in their bladder pouch, and they have half milk, and they put half blood in it, and they shake it up and drink it. And they only do that for three months a year.

Q: What do you think about that?

A: Well, I've done it, and it's the most delicious thing. It tastes like ice cream. Just like ice cream. Phenomenal. Like when I butcher an animal, I will put them to sleep by spinning them, and then cut their juggler, drain the blood, and then mix milk with it. Fifty percent milk, fifty percent blood. The amount of energy. I could go three days without sleeping. Not needing sleep.

Q: It's not like a drug?

A: Well, no, because it doesn't make you unhealthy. A drug would make you unhealthy. 

Q: A drug would stimulate an adrenal...

A: Yeah, it's a natural, whatever it is.

Q: The endocrine system in some way.

A: But it doesn't do that. So, you've got all this rich nutrient in blood and milk, and it's wonderful. So, anytime I slaughter an animal, I don't waste the blood. I mix it with milk. And it's very nutritious. And the first time I saw it was in Brownsville, Texas. I had a girlfriend who came from the Indian tribe there. And they would take their goats and hang them and cut the jugular vein, get the milk, and take the goat milk and mix with it. You had to be a member. They wouldn't let you share it. I had to be a member of the tribe to have it. It was such a spiritual, sacrilegious thing to let anybody who wasn't part of the tribe have it. They were their animals. So, the first time I got to try goats, milk, and blood together was in Hawaii. We had a slaughter there, and a lot of people ingested it. Even vegetarians drank the blood in the milk. And you could see them eat. Because they wanted to see what was going on. Because almost all the people who were vegetarians in this one community turned on my diet because they were sick. They all had staph infections. All the time, staph infections. And when a few of them went on to this diet, the staph infections disappeared. And you're dealing with staph infections every day. Sores, pussing. You're losing all your white blood cells trying to get decontaminated stuff out of the body. And it weakens you and weakens you because you're losing all your white blood cells. Those are not bad things. The animals would come and lick it. The cats and dogs would come and lick the wounds and take their white blood cells and use them as nutrition. But people look at it and say, oh, puss, yuck. Ninety-nine percent of puss is white blood cells. Those are good things. So anyway, a lot of those people got on to my diet.

So I went over there, and they invited me over to do a lecture with some patients over there. And they invited me to show them how to slaughter and take care of the animals, skinning them. Because they were vegetarians. They didn't have any exposure to it. So we did it to one of the cows. So some of the neighboring vegetarians were just coming to observe. And we passed the goats. We had two gallons of it from one goat. A gallon of blood and a gallon of milk mixed together. So we had two gallons. Passed it around. But they wanted to be part of it with us. And we downed all two gallons in 45 minutes. And they drank more of it than anybody else, the vegetarians. So, I mean, it does phenomenal things. It's good stuff. Milk, it's a phenomenal thing. And if you're living with cows, if you have cows, those cows don't care. They don't mind being milked. They don't like their calves being taken away early. But you have to do it in order to do that. But then you have to take care of the calves. You have to milk them. You have to feed them every two hours, just like they would out in the field. They go to the mother every two hours for nutrients, for food. So if you're a good farmer, a good husbander, then you'll go feed your calves every two hours. And I just left a farm in Missouri that was just created by primal dieters. And we take care of the animals so wonderfully. And we let the calves stay with the mother until they're five weeks old sometimes. But you have to understand, a calf was born on my birthday last Wednesday, the 17th was my birthday. A calf was born on that day. That calf was on its feet running around eating grass when it's born. You know, it's like babies that we have. So they grow faster with milk, of course. And we continue to give them the milk. But we take care of those animals. And those cows, when they're ready to milk, they're in the barn. They want to get that milk out of them because it's so heavy. So it's a reciprocal thing. It's OK. It's not unnatural, as long as there's an agreement going on. And you care for your animals properly. You're going to raise them to butcher them anyway, to eat their meat. That's natural, too. It's not unnatural just because somebody says it's unnatural. If it's a good food product, it's a good food product.

Q: Nature shows it. I'm not saying it's unnatural. It's obvious that... I forget about what man is saying. You see in the animal kingdom, adults aren't eating milk, drinking milk.

A: But they would.

Q: Listen, I love milk. I stopped drinking milk, but I'll start reconsidering this.

A: I have taken milk and given it to cows and drank their own milk. I've given it to horses. Every animal that I ever offered raw milk to drank it. It isn't that they won't. It's that they can't get it. The other animals are not going to let them suck their teats. And the mother cow is not going to let the cow suck forever.

Q: What about a movement of human milk?

A: I don't know many humans are well enough to be distributing the milk. You know, they want to make money doing that, hey.

Q: They do do it for babies.

A: Babies, yeah. There are some women who do it for babies.

Q: They have milk bags.

Q: Oh, yeah, milk bags.

Q: If it's good, there's going to be a good price.

Q: Is it pasteurized?

Q: No, no.

Q: Don't they freeze it or something?

Q: No, it doesn't have to be. You can get it if you need it without being pasteurized.

Q: Without pasteurizing?

A: Yeah, too many babies get very sick when the mother's milk is pasteurized. They die.

Q: There's no nutrients left in them.

A: Even cow's milk, when pasteurized, is very reduced in nutrients. You look at Sally when she was at that Harvard conference on milk. It showed the two animals. Here's a calf that was fed raw milk from its mother. Not suckled, but fed from a bottle. Just like the other one was fed the same milk pasteurized from its mother. You see the calf that's raised on the pasteurized milk. The same milk from its mother. It's a third the size of the one that was raised on raw milk. And you can see it's very weak. Not strong at all. And the others are already built up and big. And that's from only a six month feeding. Six months on the raw milk and the pasteurized milk. Not processed in any other way, just pasteurized. That's how much nutrition is destroyed. So anyway, we've got to get back to this. Like I say, if you have a question, wait. I'm not going to answer anymore. Because you've seen the time that came involved in answering that one question. I did it in New York City once. And we didn't get out of there till 1.30 in the morning.

Q: I got time for it.

A: Other people don't. Okay, so we have the liver. And the liver forms bile. That is its only job. But now you have the medical profession saying, Oh, the liver is a filter for toxins in the body. Only because we fill the body with so many toxins, they have to go somewhere. So the liver is one place that they go. That doesn't mean the liver is built for that. The liver in all animals has one purpose, to make bile to digest fat. You've got this huge, largest organ besides the digestive tract that is meant to digest fats. Pretty important, isn't it? And then we have the gallbladder, which sits, is connected to the liver. What does it do? It holds bile. It has no other purpose than as a storage area for bile. Now it holds enough bile to digest 20 pounds of fat. Why do we need 20 pounds of fat? Why do we need enough bile to digest 20 pounds of fat? Because let's say you're a hunter, and like in the old days, and you kill an animal and you eat the liver first, and the heart, and then what do you eat? You eat the fat. You eat all the fat. Let's say you consume 13 to 20 pounds of fat in 24, 36 hours. If you didn't have that reserve of bile to dump into all that fat, you'd have diarrhea, and you'd have no use for the fat, and the dogs would come and eat it, and you'd be without the fat. So that is the reason for the gallbladder. If you don't have a gallbladder, you better be careful about how much fat you eat at one time. You have to piece it out a little at a time, no more than about an ounce of fat an hour. And you have to piecemeal it that way. You can't sit down to a quart of ice cream or you're going to have diarrhea if you don't have a gallbladder. Unless the liver has found a way to store bile in itself, and that has happened in a few cases that I've seen, but it's rare. So, without a gallbladder, you need to piecemeal the amount of fat that you eat at a time. Okay, then we move over to the other side. We talked about the pancreas already, what it does. And then next to that is the spleen. What does the spleen do? The spleen doesn't produce any hormones like the gallbladder. It produces nothing. It stores red and white blood cells, but mainly red blood cells. Now, why do we need almost two quarts of blood? A quart and a half of blood stored in the spleen. 

What happens when we get cold? The spleen will dump red blood cells into your bloodstream, thicken your blood, and all of a sudden you're warm. You get cold, I mean you get hot, and what does the spleen do? The spleen draws red blood cells out of the bloodstream, and your blood gets thin and you're cool. What happens if you fall out of a tree? You hit a branch and it cuts your jugular vein, and you lose three cups of blood before you clot. Or even more. So you lose a whole quart and a half. You're going to be anemic until the blood reconstitutes. And how long? The red and white blood cells breed in the bone marrow, which is a very narrow area of the whole body, and mostly in the knees and hip bones, the femur joints. The red and white blood cells divide in the bone marrow, mature in the bone marrow. Once they mature, it enters the bloodstream. That takes a lot of time. To make a quart of blood would take about 60 days. That's a lot of days. You're going to be anemic if you've had a bleed like that, and you're going to be dinner or lunch or a candy bar or snack for some cat or dinosaur as you're running around. And you won't be running around if you're anemic and lost that much blood. So the spleen, once you've done the clot and it's sealed tightly enough, the spleen starts dumping its reserve of blood back into the bloodstream. You're no longer anemic. You can run. You can fight. You can take care of yourself. So there's many reasons they have a backup of red blood cells. That's the purpose of the spleen. Then we have the kidneys. What do the kidneys do? The kidneys filter out fluids from the bloodstream. Why? Well, we're so toxic that we need to pee a lot. If we get too cold, and then we pee less when we get too hot. Again, it's like the spleen. If we get too hot, the body will allow more fluids into the bloodstream and the neurological fluids, and pee less. You notice when you get cold, you urinate a lot? It's because your body is throwing off fluids out of the blood to thicken it. The more water in there, the quicker you will freeze. You go into hyperthermia.

So the less fluid, the less water content in the bloodstream, the warmer you will be. I mean, the hotter you will be, or the colder you will get. When you dump that fluid, your blood gets thicker. And your red blood cells generate all this heat and energy. Now, if we didn't have a kidney to function the way it does, we'd be urinating our red and white blood cells every time we urinate. Every time we change a temperature or two of... Like when you go into an air-conditioned place. You're going to urinate more. You go outside, you're not going to urinate as much. Inside an air-conditioning on a hot day, you may urinate four or five times in about five hours. Or you hold it a long time and you go just three times in that five hours. You go outside and all of a sudden you don't pee all day. Why? Because your body does not want to lose the water. It wants to keep the blood thin so it can stay cool. So how does the kidneys stop the red and white blood cells entering the kidney along with the serum, the blood serum? It produces ammonia. Ammonia is like a negative magnet. A negative magnet on a negative magnet, it repulses. When your kidney produces the ammonia, the red and white blood cells are repulsed from going into the kidney. Very nice way without polluting the system. Ammonia is only toxic in very concentrated amounts. And then the body just throws the ammonia off through the urine. Now we have a bladder. Why do we have a bladder? So we're not pissing all over ourselves all day long as the fluid empties from the kidney. If you didn't have a storage area, you'd be trickling all the time. So you have a bladder, it contains a certain amount of fluid, and when it gets full enough for whatever size your bladder is or the health it's in, then you go urinate. And that can be, for some people, two ounces they have to pee. Other people can hold a quart, two cups is more average.

But the person can hold to the point where they say, ah, you know, it's just so uncomfortable. They're not dancing, but they've got to go soon. And then you have two cups in there. It's usually the point, two cups of it comes to the point. Unless you have a weak bladder. You know what the bones are for. The bones are so we can be an upright thing. If we were without bones, we'd be slime on the ground, moving around like a worm or a snail. And the muscles, of course, to be able to do all of that, to expend the energy in the way of the physical form. Skin is, of course, to keep everything contained. And the hair is to prevent certain kinds of, you know, too much sun rays from getting into the scalp. And, you know, down here, of course, too much heat. Because when the body, and men and women, with the ovum and sperm, well, the sperm goes above 98 degrees, even at its own body temperature, 98.6, the sperm can't swim. Sperm have to stay below 98 degrees, preferably 96 degrees, so the area stays cooler with the shade of the hair. Hair on the chest. Women have all of this fat in the mammary glands, and feeds the skin well, so they don't have to worry about burning. Men don't have all of those. They don't have the mammary glands. They don't have fat in that area, so men have more hair to protect too much sun from beating in on that tissue. Because these tissue are more sensitive. Why? The lymphatic system. The last system I'm going to talk about. One of the most important systems in the body in our toxic world. Lymph system is responsible for cleaning all of the waste out of the body. Little bitty nodes that are anywhere from the size of a BB to the size of a pellet. And then you have glands that are the size of a sugar cube all the way up to a large marble. And if you've had your tonsils removed, like I did when I was 3 years old, these glands swell to 5 times their normal size to make up for the missing tonsils. 

So I've had these swollen lymph glands that are that big that are the size of a ton or 5 times the size of a tonsil to take up for the missing tonsil. Remember I said that the tonsil behaves just like the lymphatic system. It's part of the lymphatic system. It cleans waste and toxins out of the body. So the toxins get into those nodes and glands and the body takes time to dissolve anything that needs to be dissolved, neutralize it, and then send it out the skin. We dump it in the connective tissue to be perspired out to the skin. 90% of toxins are supposed to leave through the skin, not through the intestinal tract. Remember I said in a healthy animal, the waste is not waste, it's not toxic. Fecal matter is not toxic, urine is not toxic. It fertilizes beetles, dogs, anybody, other animals that would eat fecal matter and make good nutrition. Even some humans in Georgia, Russia. Fecal matter is not supposed to be toxic. It's just food that is not all thoroughly digested, partially digested. But because we're so toxic, we have lots of toxins in our fecal matter and urine. And, of course, under our skin and our tissues, because we're not perspiring it out. We've got air conditioning. Unless somebody goes out and runs, they're not perspiring it out. Unless somebody goes to a gym, nobody's perspiring. So the 90% of waste that's supposed to lead through the skin are remaining in your skin and tissue. Swelling, swelling. You get bigger. You wonder why you just keep getting bigger as you get older. Because it stays in the skin. People who dry out and die young, they're not storing it in their tissue. They're not storing it in between their tissue. It's actually getting into the cells and drying out the cells. And then they crack and die early. Heart attack, stroke, something like that. So the lymphatic system has to be flowing clean to remove the toxins from the system.

Now, if you look at the animals, even the primates, their lymph system feeds every cell in the body. How does the lymph system do that? Well, the lymph system is connected with the lacteal system and the digestive tract. Remember I talked about all the waste or the byproducts of bacteria as our food? If you're eating beets, if you're eating blueberries or blackberries, no matter what it is, once the bacteria get finished feeding on it, their byproduct is always milk. Identical to milk that's made in the mammary glands. Everything you digest, that bacteria just turns into milk. That's why it's called lacteal. And when that's absorbed into the lacteal system, it delivers it to the lymph system. The lymph system and the lacteal system break it down into a translucent milky substance. So it's kind of a milky, hazy, milk-and-nut, strict white fluid. It breaks it down. Then that lymph system is supposed to deliver that lymphatic fluid to every cell in the body to eat. It isn't happening. All this system from margarine and all the hydrogenated fats has blocked our lymphatic system. So the lymphatic system now is almost strictly used to detoxify and clean the body. Two functions. Now it's only doing one. What system in the body is taking up the slack from feeding nutrients to the rest of the body? Blood. Now you have nutrients being transported to every cell in the body through the blood. And what's the blood purpose? The red blood cells take oxygen to the tissues to convert fats into energy. The white blood cells are there to take carbon dioxide, the byproduct of that, and get it out the lungs or dump it into the skin and perspire it out of the system. And the white blood cells eat dead red blood cells. There's an ecological system in the blood that keeps dead red blood cells from having to be dumped and the whole system being different, like a double kidney. So the white blood cells eat up all the dead red blood cells. They're called phagocytes for that reason, to eat, phago. Simple.

The blood has the job of creating energy in the body. Now it's transporting nutrients. How much of your energy is lost by the double process? Phenomenal math. When I was a child, very young, in the 40s, I remember the workers on my grandparents' farm. They were taking 30 and 60 pound bales of hay and throwing them into the loft. And the lowest part of the loft was 12 feet. So they were throwing it 12 to 15 feet up into the loft. That high. Now, farmers, even the kids, are using forklifts. They don't have that strength. They don't have that energy. Everybody's dehydrating from having all this centralized heat. And they're unable to handle the heat because they have central air. So the body is so weakened in every way that nobody can do what a body did 100 years ago. People lived. They didn't need coffee. They didn't need cigarettes. You had to be rich to have those. You had to be rich to have sugar. 90% of the population were farmers. And they were strong and healthy. I remember when I was in high school, I would go watch the football games, never participate in them. And you always saw when we had a group of farming community, their kids were the football players and ours were the city folk. You know who won. Those city kids, I mean those country kids, those farm kids were strong, drinking raw milk, around good environments, around all the, all the fecal matter of all the animals that should kill everybody. They were around all that, exposed to all that, all the bacteria, the so-called bad environment. And they were the best, best athletes there were. They would tear our team up. It was like there wasn't even a competition with them in a game. So you have to think about where we have gone and what our body should be doing. So the lymphatic system is supposed to feed the body as well as cleanse it. Now that it is so jammed with all these hydrogenated vegetables, plastic fats, how do you think your lymph system does?

How many people are very weak? Almost everybody is weak. People have to pump up with all kinds of vitamins and supplements, toxic substances to get them working. Caffeine, nicotine, theobromine, whether it's chocolate or no matter what it is. Some vitamin supplements with all the kerosene or hexane in it, gasoline. Some way to generate energy. It's not natural energy. And it should be natural energy. I sleep four hours a night. I have all the energy in the world. Sometimes I only sleep two hours a night. And I can lecture like this. I can go home, work until two o'clock in the morning, get up at six, and have a full day of seeing patients from 8.15 in the morning to 11 o'clock at night with two, you know, one hour breaks in there. And I may take a ten minute cat nap, and I'm charged and ready to go. Of course, when I was sick, I was sleeping 22 hours a day because 90% of healing happens in the sleep state. So a lot of people need sleep, but when you get healthier, it's unnecessary to have much sleep. If I were working on a farm and doing heavy physical activity, then of course I would probably need more sleep. When I've been in my farm in either the Philippines or Thailand, of course I'm doing work and I'll sleep five hours a day instead of four. So I do need more sleep when I'm physically active, but it's not that much more because of this diet. It's a marvelous diet. I've got athletes that just, you know, marathon runners on two and a half months have cut off 20 to 40 minutes of their time, and they're praised to do it two minutes, drop two minutes a year. And they drop off 20 to 40 in a few months on the diet. I've got a martial artist who competes in the world championships every year, and he's an older man. When he came he was 56. Now he's 63, 64. And when he was competing, when he first went on the diet, he, right before he went on the diet, he came in 35th place in his category. And everybody was 15 years younger than him who were above him in those 34 placements above him.

The next year, a year on the diet, he went to compete and came in fifth. Fifth. Same category. He's in the same category about to reach into the next one where nobody would ever beat him. And he's still with kids 15 and 20 years younger than him. And he's still staying in fourth and fifth place all these years. Yet he's getting older. He's on the diet. He's a person who can go jump 12,000 jump ropes in an hour. Can you imagine jumping 12,000 times in an hour? And his heartbeat is normal and down to about 110 in three minutes after he finishes a workout. Before he was on the diet, if you see the chart that he made, his heartbeat at three minutes would be up to 187. Of course, while he's jumping, it'd be 210, 240, something like that. But between three and five minutes after, his heartbeat was 187, average 187. Now it's 110, 103 in three minutes after he finishes working out. So this diet is incredible. Because I designed it on what the body told me it could do. I took the enzymes from the digestive tract and put it on foods. I looked at the ratio of how we utilized fat and energy. 80 of the citric acid cycle, 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrates. Put all that together in a diet, and that's the primal diet. It's high function. 

Q: What was the ratio? 

A: 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrates. And most of that protein is a protein sugar. So that's basically the body. Now we're going to get into the food. So let's take a break first. Take a 10-minute break. I know everybody needs it. I can go. If I start losing thoughts, I suck an egg. So I can just keep going, but I know you need a break.

Q: It's just because these chairs.

A: Yeah, I know. They're hard. They're hard, yeah.

Q: The seat's hard.

A: Well, that man back there.

Q: Do you want me to carry that down for you?

Q: I don't think so. Let me see what's in there.

Q: Well, here.

Q: Just my glass bottle. I have this.

Q: Nancy, here's something really cool. You want to put your cheese in there?

Q: Put my cheese in there?

Q: You guys do this diet? Do you do it?

Q: No, I've just gotten into it.

Q: This was frozen.

Q: Nancy, how long have you been doing the diet?

Q: Pure on the diet, since December, November. Almost a year and a half. I've been semi on the diet for six, eight years. But I was on raw veggies and cheese and everything. I've been on raw goat's milk for 20 years. I've always gotten raw goat's milk, almost everything I can. But I've never really went all the way until I had my operation. They messed up the cataract so that I had black stuff in the back of the eye. I didn't want to lose my eye. So that's when I went and called me Aajonus that's when I decided to do the whole thing to see if I could save the eye by myself.

Q: Isn't it funny you should say eyes? You have pretty eyes.

Q: What?

Q: You have pretty eyes. I'm looking at your eyes and all of a sudden you're talking about the eyes. Why is that interesting? Of course you don't want to lose your eyes because they're pretty. You want to be able to see and stuff.

Q: I can't be able to see.

Q: Exactly, exactly. That's a good thing. And so how do you feel after doing it?

Q: [unintelligible]

Q: So where have you been? Have you been in Thailand a lot?

A: Thailand, I've been to a farm in Thailand and the Philippines. Ten days of each back and forth.

Q: I haven't been seeing, you know, usually I see maybe 12 or 15 notices around the U.S. You haven't, you're not doing as much.

A: Well, I used to do it every 6 months, but now I'm doing it mainly once a year. I still follow the same path.

Q: What do you do?

A: I was in Chicago first.

Q: Oh, that's right, because we got to Canada and Philadelphia and here.

A: St. Louis. We just left St. Louis. [unintelligible] I did a talk, a workshop that was 500 people. But they were 99% vegetarian. When I finished it, three two-thirds of them were no longer vegetarians. So a publisher came up to me and said, anybody can do that, I want to publish your books. So we made a deal right there. So the books are now published in Finnish. So I have to go there.

Q: When is this?

A: Pardon?

Q: When is this?

A: July 4th, I will be there from July 4th to July 12th. And then I have to go to Switzerland and then South Africa. I'm going back to Australia probably next January.

Q: Are you going through the body scanners every time you travel?

A: No.

Q: Or you just opt out?

A: Opt out.

Q: You never miss your flight, they never give you a hard time?

A: I go early enough.

Q: How long does it take?

A: Because I don't let them scan my food and I take two quarts of milk at a time. So I have to go through a lot of stuff. I don't mind the pat-downs. To me it's a free massage. It's a free massage. They're gentle, it's nice. I mean, why do people complain about that? I don't get it. I have a letter from my doctor, and my patients get their letters from me.

Q: I'll wait and then have you mail it to me.

A: Next time you travel, you let me know by email. And then send me your name as it is on the document. [unintelligible] But it works every time. Well, one time I was in Denmark. I was going from Finland down to [unintelligible]. So I had to fly from Helsinki to one of the airports in London. And then I had to go to London. [unintelligible].

Q: Ready?

A: Okay, everyone, we're going to get started again.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I used to do one of these and do a food prep the next day on a Sunday. That was a lot of fun because we'd make like, let's say for each person we'd have a different dish. So let's say we were 19 people. We had 19 different things to eat. Sometimes somebody would just make a sauce with a meat dish so one would be one meal. We made cheesecakes. Okay, everyone. We need to get started. Okay, before I dive more deeply into food, I want to talk about some of the fallacies about the human body, blood pressure, cholesterol, and all of that. All of those are designed to get you to take medication. Thirty years ago, well, sixty years ago, the high blood pressure was much higher than it is now before it was so-called dangerous. You could have 190 and still be okay. 190 over 110 is still considered borderline. Now if you say you've got 190 over 110, 120, that's danger, you're in danger of an aneurysm, brain or heart attack. So you've got to understand that those are here to sell more pills. Cholesterol, all the same thing. I have a hall of fame basketball player in his 80s that keeps his cholesterol level up at 672. He outplays the teenagers still on the field, and as long as he keeps it up there. When he brings it down, he doesn't play as well. I have an Olympic gymnast, well I had an Olympic gymnast about 10 years ago. Her cholesterol was at 327, and her bad cholesterol was really high within that, and it wasn't even within their framework of what they say is good and bad cholesterol, LDL and HDL. She was getting sick, this was before she was my patient, she was getting sick every six weeks. She was on the U.S. Olympic team, and she would get sick about every six weeks.

That would take her through three weeks of a cold or a flu detoxification, and she wasn't able to work out in all that time because it would debilitate her so badly and she would have accidents and hurt herself. So during those periods, she could not work out, and they were about to kick her off the team. Then Paul Cohen, who was McEnroe's coach for ten years, has been on the diet now about 18 years, and he told her coach to go see me, take her to see me. So she came to see me and I said, if she has a 327 cholesterol, leave it at 327, you keep taking it down, then she's going to get sick. Those fats protect her. That's what she needs. She needs 327. I told him about the basketball player who he knew, and I said, he has 672. And I said, it's right for the person. You can't judge it on this graph that is designed for you to take anti-cholesterol medication. That is entirely what it's for. If you have a high ratio of bad cholesterol, that's because your body is cleaning out the toxic cholesterols more than it's shoving around the good cholesterols. When you're eating good fat and making good cholesterols, your body is going to remove the old toxic cholesterols and those are the bad cholesterols. So you should have a high ratio of them because you want to clean them out of the body. As long as you're functioning well, there's no problem. Don't listen to the doctors. They want you to take anti-cholesterol medication, medication that will lower your cholesterol which is to your detriment. Cholesterol fat is the most important thing in the body. You have a third of the cholesterols that will protect your cells, you have a third that will clean them, and you have a third that will give you energy. Every one of those is important in high amounts. I keep my cholesterol around 210 and I've been a raw fooder and clean, pretty clean for a very long time. My cholesterol used to be up around 400.

Q: I'm sorry, I just want to let you know, I just poured some samples in case anybody wanted some.

A: Okay. Thank you. I don't mind people, as long as they're not talking, get up and get something if you want. So it's fine. Eat all you want while you're here, no problem with me. It's all about eating. Okay, so cholesterol is never a problem, don't count it. Don't count your cholesterol. Not important. With your body, the level your body makes for you is what is right for you. Blood pressure is the same thing. Let's say if you're 500 pounds, your blood pressure should be very, very high, should be really high. If you have clogged arteries or veins, you better have high blood pressure to get the blood working and through the system, or the blood's not going to get to your body. And it's going to clog and even coagulate. So you've got to move it through faster if you've got a lot of pressure on your veins from weight, or you've got some kind of block in your arterial and venous capillary system. Forget all those. That's racket by the pharmaceutical industry to get you to take more medication. Okay? I want to clear that out right away, because that's what people fall into. The doctor will scare the hell out of you. So fats are the most important nutrient in our toxic world. Greatest amount of energy from it, the best protection. Even vitamin D, if you want it from the sun, you can't do without good fats in your skin. You'll burn. You can blister. All kinds of problems. But if you have the right fat in your skin, the sun is an aid to your building of your body. Cleansing of your body. Vitamin D is used for so many things. And sure you can get it from your milk and your butter and your meats, but let's say in our toxic world, we need more. And we do need more. We have low mineral content in the bones. We have osteoporosis of all sorts and to reverse that we need a little higher levels of vitamin D. So getting in the sun is an important factor.

The sun causing cancer is the most ridiculous thing in the world. If that were true, every African and every Asian that lived in the rice fields would have cancer. It's about the quality of your food and the more chemicals you have in your body, the more your body takes the fat from your skin and uses it to harness the toxins, so then your skin is deficient in the fats it needs to convert into vitamin D when the sun rays hit your skin. Can you say that again? The sun hits the fat on the skin. Your skin converts the sun rays with the fat into vitamin D and your vitamin D uses it throughout the body. If you are highly toxic, your body is going to take the fat from the skin and use it to bind with the poisons. Then your skin is left bare and then the sun will burn you and blister you. And if you blister enough times, of course, you deaden the skin. It's scar tissue. And what is cancer? Cancer is a collection of dead cells, scar tissue. So whether it's adding to it in one particular area or spreading it throughout the body, it doesn't matter. It is a collection of dead cells because your body can't dissolve dead cells and remove them. And that's all cancer is. Once you start supplying the body with the proper nutrients and if you're in an advanced state, that may be a while and an exercise in discipline on the way you eat, but you can reverse any cancer. Cancer, 95% of the cancer cases that I worked with up until 1992-1993, reversed. Now 97%, because I know more of what to do, 97% of the people who come to me with cancer reverse it. And it's not me, it's the diet. I know what foods to eat to do it. And it's the foods that do it, not me. I'm not some magician, I'm no Jesus that heals people by touching them or Buddha or any of those.

I'm just an individual that knows how the body operates. And if the cells are collecting in the body, your lymph system isn't working, it isn't dissolving those dead cells in the body, throwing them under your skin and then you're perspiring under it. Let's say your lymph system is working and it's dumping the toxins under the skin and the wasted dead blood cells, then you're not perspiring out of the body. You're going to get cancer, you're going to get cancer in the lymph or you're going to get cancer in the connective tissue or skin.

Q: You don't need sunscreen if you're eating properly.

A: Sunscreen is very toxic, very toxic. In fact, sunscreen causes a lot of cancer. It causes MS, multiple sclerosis, and it causes lupus, which is disintegration of the connective tissue. So, those things aren't ways to do it. I had a fellow who was an albino and I was living at a yoga ashram in 1974 while I was doing my travels. I hit a rainy spell, rain for 28 days, so I didn't want to be on my bicycle, so I went to this yoga ashram. They had an albino there, he had red hair, reddish-white hair, and his skin was so sensitive, he had never been able to get in the sun. I had him on butter. I had him eating about three quarters of a pound of butter a day with honey. This was a vegetarian community. I did get him to eat cottage cheese. The yoga there allowed them to eat some raw dairy. I had him eat all that, and after ten days of that, he went upstairs to get some sunshine and was out there an hour, no burn. Went out there two days after that, fell asleep in the sun ten hours, did not burn. Think about that. An albino that hadn't been able to even go out in the sun for a few minutes. All the butter that he ate had gotten into his skin, and his skin went from this dry white look to an oily look, and then when he got the sun, all of a sudden he didn't look albino anymore except in the eyes. He just looked like a punk rocker with reddish-white hair. So lots of raw butter is very important. There are so many fats that can be used in different ways, but your animal fats are always the most important, and butter is used more than anything in the body. It's used on the bones, the skin, the muscles, the brain, the glands. Where we need cream in any quantity is in the brain and nervous system. Only the cream supplies certain cholesterols that can't be made from butter.

What the liver does, the liver produces cholesterols which will digest the cream into two-thirds butter or three-quarters butter and one-fourth cholesterols to feed the brain and the nervous system. So that means three-quarters of the cream that you eat, whether it's directly from milk or a supplement of cream, a jar of cream or a bottle of cream, whatever it is, you use two-thirds or three-quarters of that as butter in the body. So you only need a small amount when you're supplementing your diet and trying to get up to a better state of health, concentrate on butter and the cream that's in your milk with a little extra, maybe an ounce or two a day, is all the extra cream that you need. Cream is very hard to digest, although it's the only one that can completely feed the brain and nervous system and assuage it. So concentrate on eating more butter and a little cream. It takes 60 varieties of bile to make the 60 varieties of cholesterol, a third of them as I addressed, protect the body, cleanse it, and give it energy, those three purposes or uses of the fat. When you're drinking cream, you never want to eat it with meat unless it's sour cream. Very difficult to digest, you will find that you don't digest all of your meat, maybe only half of it if you're eating fresh cream with it. If it's very sour cream, made into a sour cream, you can eat it with your meat. You will still slow down and maybe prevent yourself from digesting all of the meat. So I always tell everybody, sour cream and chives with meat is wonderful, it's delicious, but don't get hung up on it and do it every day, do it a couple of days a week or a couple of meat meals a week, use butter for the oven, or eggs with your meat, and that means any kind of flesh food.

When I say meat, I don't mean red meat or white meat, any meat, any flesh food. When I talk in my book, We Want to Live, and the recipe about red meat and white meat, red meat means four-legged animals. White meat is two-legged or no-legged animals, that includes birds, fish with no legs, with fins. So white meat, even ostrich, which meat is as red as liver, dark, is still in the white meat category. So white and red, when I talk about meat, is not a color but a category, a misnomer that I did a long time ago. I regret it, but it's done, published forever. So make sure you realize that it's a category and not a color. Cheese is, dairy in all of its forms, is a medicine. Cheese is a dehydrated product. Any dehydrated product is completely void of enzymes. There are no biologically active enzymes in any dehydrated product, none. So you're not going to digest cheese, even if it's raw and no salted. Now what is the advantage of having cheese that's no salted and raw, if you're not going to digest it? Because we have most of the poison stuck in the stomach and intestinal lining, intestinal walls. So every time you eat cheese, even if it's a small amount, you're going to be pulling those toxic products out of your stomach and intestine. I have construction workers that eat a sugar cube-sized amount every 15 minutes. You know, they have their older work pouches for their hammers and everything, and they've got a pouch for their cheese, and they've got a two-cup jelly jar, a glass jar, with all these little sugar cube-sized amounts of cheese, and they have their alarm, their watch go off every 15 minutes, and they pop one while they're working.

Anybody can do that. What I've seen in the last three years, I'm working with about 300 people doing it, the amount of cleansing of the intestinal tract without flus and colds and diarrhea is astonishing. Around the pupil you have the intestinal tract and the iris, and that area is usually brown or toxic or very scarred, and the years that I've been observing people getting well and seeing those changes, it takes many, many years to reduce that, it takes 40 years of amount of that to reduce it completely. But by taking the cheese either every 15 minutes or every 20 minutes or every 30 minutes, the change is great, the coloration, the digestion is improved, their skin is improved. I have one woman who came to me in Chicago with a rheumatoid arthritis and her knees were literally this big. She was crippled in a wheelchair, her elbows were that big a wrist, her hands were all buckled up like this and she couldn't feed herself, couldn't dress herself, nothing. Her husband had to do everything for her, and she was only a 50-year-old woman, crippled. She used to play cards with her friends, bridge or something, NASC, I don't remember what it was, and she played with them two days a week. When she came to me she hadn't played cards in three years with her friends, and she was literally a mess. And she came back after two years, well, every year she comes back, sometimes every six months. And you see everything getting smaller and smaller. So last year when she came, she was back playing cards with her friends, and when she went on this die, her friends said, oh, that's a dangerous die, it's going to kill you. She said, listen, I'm already crippled, I'm already dead, I can do what I think might work.

And he makes a lot of sense, wait a minute, guy's eating raw meat, parasites in the brain, that can't make any sense, you know, so that's what these friends said. So last year she was back to playing, this year she's back to playing cards with them. They have a whole different sense of it. They won't do it yet, but they see her and the change. So last year when she came, she gave me that news, I said, great. I said, well, next year I want you to come running in here. And she didn't know if I'm serious or not, and I said to her husband, I said, you really want to get a life again and take, you know, so you both can do things together other than that? You put her in a hot bath every day, 90 minutes, 105 degrees, and you feed her to make sure she's eating this cheese every 20 minutes, three times an hour, and you'll see what happens. So her knees were back down to about a third, you know, too big. Two-thirds down to what they were. This year she came down and every one of her bones is perfect, her joints. She walked in, this time, walked in. She and her husband going on a ship cruise. And even though it takes her a few minutes, I mean a whole, probably 40 seconds to get out of a chair, once she gets up, she's pretty mobile. She's climbing up stairs, she would let anybody help her from the ship all the way up down to the small fishing boat, she went fishing. She did all this stuff with her husband she hadn't been able to do in 10 years. And here she's, you know, she's in her mid-to-late 50s now, so you have to take a look at that. Lots of fat. Lots of all of these stuff, and you get well, because that's what your body needs. So she ate this cheese, and had these hot baths, and had that much more improvement in a shorter period of time. So that cheese can be a remedy for pulling poisons out of the stomach and intestines.

Now remember I mentioned the vaccines, those very toxic substances? Where I found that they went in 90% of people is in the stomach lining. Remember the stomach lining is the most resilient tissue in the body? It makes hydrochloric acid that can dissolve bone, yet it doesn't dissolve itself. Well I found in all the 32 autopsies I got to perform on cadavers that the stomach lining contained lots of, all the amalgam of vaccines, the mercury, the formaldehyde, the ether, and the aluminum were the highest in every stomach, all 32 stomachs. Well two of them were on the lower side, but they all had it in them, and 30 of them were dense in this vaccine toxicity, whether it's from, you know, allergy shots were all vaccines. Tetanus shot was a vaccine. All of these shots are vaccines, they have mercury in them, and all those other toxic ingredients, plus squalene and all this other stuff. 26 to 63 different toxins. They used to carry up to 67, 68, now it's down to 63, making it a little heavier. So that toxicity is in the stomach, and then when it dumps into your food every time you eat, and then it poisons your body as you absorb the nutrients. The cheese, as long as it's raw and no salt in it, will not be digested unless you eat a fruit with it, or honey. Then it re-digests. So you eat raw, all this cheese you eat all day long, you're not eating honey with it, and you're not eating fruit with it, and it'll go in and pull all this stuff out of your stomach lining and intestines, and you have an incredible, like two to three times faster without the symptoms of vomit and diarrhea that usually occurs when you detox a lot of the poisons in the stomach, you'll have the vomit, and it's the intestines you'll have diarrhea.

So cheese is a medicine, even though you can't digest it. But there's another way to digest it, and to get a mineral supplement, and I have lots of people who have osteoporosis, especially women, came to me with twenty to thirty-seven percent bone loss, and I'm saying, you know, I've tried everything to get minerals in them, and then I just woke up one morning and said, wait, if they just eat honey with raw, no-salt cheese, they'll digest the minerals, they'll digest the fats and the minerals together, they probably won't digest the rest of it, the protein and all of that, except to be utilized to handle the fats and the minerals. So I began experimenting with that, and over a five-year period, all of the women had their bones completely restored, even if it were up to thirty-seven percent deteriorated. Now when I have them, I ask those women to have three tablespoons of cheese, three times a day, with two and a half to three teaspoons, so it's a small amount of honey, with that cheese. And in one year, they are at a level where it's already being restored and in two years completely reversed, no matter to what level, osteoporosis. So think about that. There's no other, and they talk about taking Lipitor and all those other, and they don't even have one percent. Even the laboratory tests show there's not even a one percent proof of it, that it works to stop osteoporosis, and it's a scam, like all other medications, it's a scam. So that's another way cheese can be used. Now, if you eat raw, salted cheese, it will reabsorb, I'll tell you why later. The poisons that the cheese absorbs will be re-digested back into your system. So you'll re-digest the poisons, along with the salted cheese, which is not really raw, once it's salted. If you eat pasteurized cheese, because it's broken down and cauterized, you're going to reabsorb your poisons with the cheese. If it's pasteurized, salted, or unsalted, it doesn't matter, you're going to reabsorb your poisons. It has to be raw, no salted cheese for it to have that effect.

Q: It's impossible in Europe to get the no salted cheese. They just claim they have to have salt in all the cheese.

A: Well that's because people won't eat it, because they like that salty taste, but in France you can get it.

Q: I only eat my own curds that I make from the milk. 

A: Well you can make your own. You can make your own cottage cheese or a hard cheese.

Q: How do we know when we go to a place that they say no salt added, this is raw. How do we know for sure that what they're saying is what we're getting?

A: You have to look at what they're doing. You have to watch their process one time.

Q: So if you go to a store.

A: Oh, you know, you get the number of the place where they get it, and then you talk to them. You go see them. That's what I did in France too when I was there. When I started going to France, I had a girlfriend who was a flight attendant on a French airline. So I lived in France off and on for three years, and there was no raw dairy in any of the health food stores in France, in Paris. And I said, what's going on here? I had to go to the outdoor markets, to the farmer's market, to get my cream. And let me tell you, there was no such thing as sweet cream. If you ask for sweet cream, they look at it like you were out of your mind. Who digests sweet cream? You know, everything is sour. They sour all their cream. If you ask for sweet cream, they think you're out of your mind, because you digest all the sweet cream, the sour cream, but not the sweet cream, the way people eat it there. So I was able to get the raw dairy there. So then I got the health food stores all throughout Paris to carry it. So by the time I stopped going there in 96, all of the health food stores, and even carrefour supermarket, which is a regular, you know, supermarket run by the King, owned by the King and Queen of England. They, they carried the raw dairy in Paris and all throughout France. Now, in the last year, they've stopped it again, because of the EU, they call it the, there's a certain policy that they want everybody to follow the same health and food laws. So every, all food is interchangeable. Which means they just want to control all the food.

Q: At least for fewer questions.

A: Yes. Yes.

Q: Alimentus.

A: Alimentus. That was it.

Q: Codis.

A: Codis Alimentus. So anyway, you could get it easily there. That, the cheeses cannot be salted. They have to be raw. Anyway, I found, discovered that by checking the feces. When they ate raw, no salt cheese, I found all those toxins that normally were in the stomach and intestines, in the cheese, all undigested and out in the feces. When I looked at people who ate, the feces of people who ate salted raw cheeses, 90% of it was absorbed. And I'm sure that it absorbed the toxins because that 10% that was discharged had the toxins in it. And by looking at the irises over several years, I could see that they were distributing it by re-digesting it into their nervous system and spread out into the glands and then into the muscles over a period of years. 

Q: Can you explain how it's re-digested, the toxins, when you're taking salted cheese? 

A: I will tell you that later when I talk about salt. Again, kefir and yogurt are pre-digested the way your intestines would do it, but with a different bacteria. Usually bacteria from a goat or a sheep or a cow, where they use the rennet to do it. Now, the bacteria we have to digest milk is different. How we construct a cell from it is different. So, it is not the best bacteria for your system. It helps you breed your own bacteria. But, for someone who's very ill that doesn't break down the food anyway, it's an advantage for them to have the pre-digested yogurt or kefir milk, because they aren't digesting it in the first place and it's already broken down. The waste is already there from all that bacteria and they can absorb it and make themselves healthier and reconstruct their intestines to the point where they can start breeding their own bacteria that's familiar to them. Now, that bacteria, you get a sampling of it in your saliva. So, when I tell people to make their own yogurt or kefir, I tell them to take one and a half tablespoons of milk, put it in their mouth, swish it around, get lots of saliva in it, and then put that back into the quart of milk. That's the perfect bacteria. It'll make your own kefir and yogurt. Don't share with anybody. That's for you specifically. I mean, if you have a very sick baby, like a mother bird would do, or a dog, they chew it and regurgitate it into their offspring. They're young, and it works until they can get their own going. So the bacteria in kefir and yogurt when it's made from another animal are good, and they're a good resource for nutrients, but it's not the ultimate. The ultimate is your own bacteria breaking it down. So if you want to make your own yogurt, do it with your own saliva, with all your own bacteria.

Q: Say again how to do it, please.

A: Take some milk, put it in your mouth, swish it around until you get lots of saliva, and mix it with the milk, and then you put it back into your quart of milk, and then there you have it. In the next batch, you can just take some of that and put it into your next...

Q: And you'd leave it in a warm... 

A: Yeah, a warm place. Always leave it in a warm place.

Q: This applies to all ferments that you want, if you wanted to make some...

A: For many, many things, yes. Use your own bacteria. Absolutely. Will always address you.

Q: What about the curds and whey that just form naturally and you don't put in the bacteria? It just makes itself.

A: That's making a cheese.

Q: It's delicious.

A: Yeah, but it makes a cheese. And it will not be digested after you've made it into curds and whey, if you've separated the whey.

Q: Oh, you just eat it together? It won't be digested?

A: Yeah, it will if you eat them together because you have the whey. The enzymes are in the whey. So if you eat them together, you can just re-blend them. And you'd have the curds and whey just like milk again, slightly pre-digested. But if you want to pull the poisons out, you can use cottage cheese as long as it's not too wet to pull out those toxins out of the body. The whey, which is the runoff from making cheese, is high in lactic acid and some sugars. And it can go in and remove the lactic acid that is the by-product of metabolism. So if you exercise and have a tendency get cramps, then it's good to drink the whey because that helps clean it. Other fats are oils, pressed oils. Whether it's from flax or from coconuts, from olives, no matter what it is, that is a fat that we don't digest very well. But when we digest it, it's mainly used as a solvent to dissolve toxicity. We only use about 7% of all the fats that we use to dissolve certain compounds in the body and remove them. All oil in the human body is used to dissolve substances, like a muriatic acid to dissolve substances and remove them from the body. Cells make virus. Virus are not alive, they are solvents. This is known by biology for at least 100 years. Up to 60 years ago, or even up to 35 years ago, you never used antibiotic for a virus because there's nothing alive. Pharmaceutical industry 35 years ago said, hey, if you say viruses are alive, then we can say take antibiotics. Double our sale in antibiotics, so that's what they did. So the new students coming out of the university, which are all dictated by the pharmaceutical industries, what they learn and what they know, told them that they can use antibiotics for viruses and that it will help.

The old doctors were saying, what are you talking about? And there was a big conflict for about 20 years. And then the older ones started getting more kickback from the pharmaceutical industry, more vacations, more this and more that. So they said, okay, well, that's worth a new home or a hunting trip or something like that, or a new swimming pool. Also, I will prescribe antibiotics for a virus. But if you look at any sample of virus around, it is just a mesh solution of dissolved tissue and some kind of solvent that has caused it. There is no organism in there that shows that produces it or that is alive that causes the dissolution. Because the cells themselves make it when they can't use the normal cleansing system, the janitorial system, to get rid of biological waste, which are bacteria, parasites, and fungus. So what happens when you use a solvent to clean something? Say you use muriatic acid on the oil on your driveway. You use water with it. Why? Because water is a solvent, the basic solvent on the plant. You go into any chemistry, even in agriculture, basic agriculture, they tell you the first thing on this planet is that water is a solvent. You put anything with it, it becomes 20 times more solvent-reactive because water is nothing but water and is hungry and will dissolve things. When it rains, it dissolves rock, plant eat. It's a solvent. You drink water, it dissolves your mucous membranes, it dilutes your digested acids and bacteria, neutralizes them, and it just flushes your body, rips your body apart. So, that solvent in there, you've got water, you make body mixes with it, and then what happens? Does it reduce in quantity? No, it's multiplied. Toxicity is multiplied. Bacteria, parasites, and funguses, they eat it and then have a byproduct that is very minimal. Like when they're eating organic waste. Let's say you're eating dead cells in a certain area. Say like the tapeworm may be eating mostly sugars that you're eating, but will eat some damaged cells that were full of carbohydrates and they'll die if they eat too much sugar. And that's common in a human body. Cells die rapidly with advanced glycation end products that accumulates from using carbohydrates as energy.

So, you have this contamination in there that is greater than a reduced product. Say for example, a parasite can eat 100 times their weight in 24 hours, and their waste product is 1 to 5 percent. If you had 100 pounds of waste, would you hire a guy that can clean up that waste and reduce it to 1 to 5 pounds, so all you have to do is carry that out of the body? Or would you hire some guy that's got this solvent that comes in there and dilutes it, and now you went from, let's say, 5 pounds of waste and you've dissolved it with 100 pounds of toxic fluids, solvent, and now you've got 105 pounds of waste. Which is your preference? Do you go for the parasite or the virus? The solvent. Of course, the virus is the last thing the body wants to resort to. But now they're what most people get. They get viruses. They get fewer colds, which are bacterial. Parasites, when they work, nobody knows there's even a detox going on, because they eat so much and have so little waste. With a bacterial detoxification, you have the mucous discharge, you're not vomiting, you have diarrhea sometimes. Once in a while you might have diarrhea from having a parasite, but that's rare, and it's usually not debilitating. When you have fungus, the fungus will eat 50 times of its weight like a bacteria, but it has more waste. It reduces it to about 5% to 10%, instead of 1% to 5%, like the bacteria and the parasites do. So you have more waste product from fungus. What happens when you get a yeast infection, which is fungus? You get itching. If you get a, you know, athlete's foot, what happens? The toxins are so great and a byproduct, it peels the skin away. It kills the skin, it peels away, and it itches. So fungus is the third choice of cleansing. But it will work where the toxins are so great that bacteria and parasites can't eat it. Because it will kill them. The toxicity will kill them.

So then we use fungus. Then when it's too toxic for any of those three, the body uses virus. And that's nothing other than solvents created by the individual cells. You get 300,000 varieties of solvents that can be created. Viruses that can be created. Because you have that many forms of different cells within cells. And each solvent is specifically formed by the cell to dissolve one specific kind of cell. Let's say like we would dissolve certain neurological cells within the liver. That's specific. If we were going to dissolve the cells that make up the veins and the arteries that go to the liver, it would be a specific virus. So you've got 300,000 varieties of cells in the human body that need to be dissolved if they're too toxic with virus. They need to be dissolved if they're too toxic by utilizing virus to get rid of them. Because bacteria, parasites, and fungus can't do it. Too toxic. It's all so simple when we think about it. Let it go. Don't stop detoxification. That's a cleansing of the body's waste. You can look at my books and find out what to do with specific detoxifications. What kind of ailments you have in a particular part of the body. Anytime you have pain, anytime you have discomfort, your body's cleansing a toxic area. You don't want to stop it with antibiotics or any other. Cold packs. You want to increase the body's ability to detox by applying heat and good nutrients. Not stop the process because then you just go farther toward disease. You're adding more toxins to the situation. Let me explain that about cold and heat. See a lot of these people, they have an injury. Sports people, they have an injury on the field and they put an ice pack on them. Think about this. What happens in an injury? You've got damaged tissue. Let's say you have blood that gets into the system out of the bloodstream and you've got red blood, white blood cells in tissue where it doesn't belong.

What did I say earlier? They rot, they decay. By bacteria, usually. Unless it's very inundated and it's parasitical. But it dissolves those cells. If that remains in there, you have a whole rotting of the whole area of the body and you could get gangrene and lose that limb. You could cause an amputation. If the body is cleaning itself with its own needs, with its own ecological system of bacteria, parasites, and fungus, everything is good, everything is going the way it should. Now, when you get a bruise, why do you have swelling? Is the body stupid? That's what the pharmaceutical and medical community want you to believe. Swelling is bad. Put ice on it and stop swelling. The body swells because it's putting more blood and lymph into the area to clean it and to heal it. If you stop that, how are you going to cleanse and heal that part of your body? So what do we see with all the sports people that have an injury of putting ice on their knee or ice on their shoulder? They end up having dozens of surgeries in a decade. They are out of commission and no longer available in their sport by the time they're 35, 36 years old. They are spent. If they applied heat instead and stayed out of that game and waited until the next one, they would heal and that knee would become stronger. And if they ate right, it would become stronger because it was injured. Because you can only get an injury if it's a light injury and you get harmed because there's toxins in that area. If you get hit by a car, it doesn't have to be a toxic area. You get a bad injury. Again, you want to feed yourself properly, apply heat always. You want to increase the blood flow to the area, the lymphatic flow to the area, not stop it or reduce it. The most stupid, insane thing in the world is to put ice on an injury. You won't heal. You're going to starve. It's insane.

Q: Or the sprays that they use, they use sprays.

A: Yes, they use that too, like nitrogen sprays to freeze the area. That damages the skin. Then it no longer perspires, so then you've got multiple problems that happen. So, always use heat. Do not use electrical heat because electrical pads produce EMFs, electromagnetic fields. Three milligauss alter the molecular structure of cells. Any device, I don't know if I brought mine. I think I left it in the hotel. Yeah, I left it in the hotel. I've got a tri-field meter, and I go around in my hotel room and I see any hot spots. It's near the bed, I move it. If it's in an area where I don't want to be, then I move my desk or whatever it is to a different area in the room. If I'm on an airplane, the engines are on the wing, I sit in the back. If the engines are on the tail, I sit on the wings. The reason for that is the high EMF field in the cockpit with all the... not transistors and the other thing.

Q: Bounds?

A: Pardon?

Q: Bounds?

A: No, it starts with a C. Cathodes. But there's something like that. Anyway...

Q: Capacitor?

A: Capacitor. So you use capacitors instead of transistors. Capacitors have a high electromagnetic discharge. So they discharge all the way back through to the wing. If you've got the engines on the wing, you've got them shooting out there, so you have to sit in the back of the plane. The cockpit is anywhere from 135 to 200 milligauss. That's why pilots can only do 36 hours a week, or less. 30 hours, 29, 28 hours. It keeps coming down because the field gets higher and higher. It only takes three milligauss to alter the molecular structure of cells. So any exposure above that is not good. All the cars now, very high in them. And there's no way to really shield it, unless you're putting aluminum barriers, like bulletproof, when you're doing EMF proof, thick aluminum shields under the floorboard, behind the firewall, everywhere, to get rid of it. So I take that around and look it around. So when you're using anything to heat the body, use a hot bath, a hot tub, hot water bottles. Best way to give heat to the body. Now remember I said that the woman who ate the cheese also had her do 90 minute bands daily. Why is that? Remember I talked about the plastic fats from all those pressed oils that are used in all the chips, cereals, french fries, that's what's used to boil those things. So all of those products are made with plastic oils. So they block the lymphatic system. The only way you can get that lymphatic system moving is to heat the body up to 105 degrees for 60 to 90 minutes. After 60 minutes it just starts softening enough to move some of the lymph glands and lymph nodes. After 90 minutes you have a good, let's say, just a thin layer of all that. Picture a cold stick of butter. And you've got it in a two cup jelly jar. And you've got it sealed. And the butter just came out of the refrigerator. Let's say the refrigerator was 48 degrees. You've got 105 degrees outside. How long is it going to take for the outside 105 degrees to alter the air space around the butter into like 80 degrees to start just a bare melting of the butter? 60 minutes. And then to get it slightly to run takes 90 minutes. So that's how you have to look at your body. Your body's a solid piece of fat. And it needs to be melted down to get that lymphatic system moving again. 

Q: Would longer than 90 minutes be detrimental?

A: No. That's a minimum. Minimum 90 minutes. I've had people that have spent, in fact when I was sick, they would spend 6 to 14 hours a day. Because I couldn't sleep otherwise. Because I had all that back pain and I'd wake up after 10 minutes of sleep screaming in pain because of the back pain. One time I crawled up in the bathtub to drown myself, to kill myself, and I fell asleep. I got really tired and sleepy. And I got into the hot bathtub and I fell asleep. And I woke up in no pain. Not dead. I didn't drown. And I was floating in the water because I put Epsom salt in me. So my body was buoyant. And I expected to be dead. And I woke up and I'm in this like the rabbit thing. I ate it to kill myself. And it changed my life. And I found that when I was in the water, buoyant in the water, I had no pain. And you can get into a bath if you're in severe pain. And you'll remove 80 to 100 percent of the pain. 

Q: Does it have to be hot water or what about a sauna?

A: Saunas and steam baths are too hot. 110 as high as you can go or else you'll damage the vitamins and nutrients, enzymes in your skin, your mucous membranes. An ultraviolet, what is it called, infrared sauna is 137 degrees minimum. It causes damage to your skin, your brain, your mucous membranes, your lung, your bronchioles, everything. You do not want to get in temperatures over 110. Regular saunas, 167. Steam baths, 210. Very damaging to the system. Scar tissue in your mucous membranes and lungs and bronchioles.

Q: Being out in the sun?

A: No. Can't get hot enough. Even under exercise, the body temperature, unless you're in a fever, only goes to 101 degrees. You have to immerse yourself in water. I have people that do up to 110 degrees and that's okay. And they do it for a while. I have some people that do it several times a day. I had one man who was a couch potato. Sixty-six years he came to me, couldn't do anything. Had no energy, sit and watch TV, all that. He came to me with thyroid problems, prostate cancer. He was supposed to go on the meds, stood in the line at the pharmacy, looked at all these people and said, I don't want to become one of those. So he went home, thinking about what to do, and all of a sudden this young man who was a friend of one of his sons called and said, how are you doing on that diet? And he said, what diet? And he said, well, you know, the book you sent me, We Want to Live, for Christmas. He said, I didn't send you any book, We Want to Live. He said, yeah, you sent me two books, We Want to Live and an architectural book. He said, no, I sent you two architectural books. He said, no, you sent me We Want to Live and an architectural book. He had obviously taken a copy of my book that somebody had given to him and accidentally sent it to this young architect. And he said, this diet is so great. And this guy said, well, send my book back to me. He said, no, I've got it marked up. It's for me, you get your own. You gave it to me for Christmas. And this guy was even Jewish, so he celebrated Christmas. So the other guy was not Jewish, but the fellow who gave the present was Jewish. So the guy got a copy, got his own copy. Went to, at that time, that was six years ago, seven years ago. So they went to Amazon, got the book, overnighted it to him. So he started on it. And he was on the diet for about a year. And he said, I have more energy.

Everything is better, much better. I really don't feel like doing much. And I said, well, you took 66 years to get here, or 67 years to get here. You're not going to undo it. You're not going to rebuild every cell in your body overnight just because you're doing it. You can't look at the diet and touch the food, and all of a sudden, you're anew. It takes replacing every cell in the body five times to get to optimal health, according to Howells and Pottengers work, with animals that were sick, they got to optimal health. It took them five generations. And so that's 40 years in a human body, five generations of cells. So I said, well, you know, do the hot baths. That will help move things faster. So he did about 110 degrees every day, and I told him to only do two a week. So he did every day. And he called me after three months, and he said, hey, I'm still a couch potato. I have no energy. And I said, well, are you doing the hot baths? He said, yes. I said, and how are you doing that? He said, well, I'm doing 90 minutes a day, every day, 110 degrees. I said, well, anybody does that, they're going to be nothing but a slug, you know. So I said, stop doing it for a couple of weeks and see how you feel, because you certainly have gotten everything moving in your body. In three weeks, he started an international stem cell company. He's been on the diet 11 years. He works 14 to 16 hours a day, and he's 74 now. 76 now. Think about that. By eating this way, this diet, 100%, and taking those hot baths, he changed his life. He got his lymphatic system moving, so he could keep up to a high level of energy. That's pretty impressive. So, heat is so important for getting well. Very important, if you want to move fast. Otherwise, you will move slowly. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I don't care what they say. They're liars. 137 degrees is too hot.

Q: That's it. 

A: 137 degrees is too hot. 110 degrees, you destroy your own tissue. 

Q: 110 is okay. 

A: 110 is fine. Don't go higher. Infrared saunas are 137 degrees minimum. 

Q: How about a light, an infrared light, to keep it so far away from us?

A: Infrared is not a natural light. It's not the full spectrum of the sun. You reactivate certain cells and damage other cells. Better not to do that. It may work as a temporary therapy, but you don't want to do it for extended periods, nor repeatedly. 

Q: Is it best for the hot baths without the epsom salt, as you mentioned, or just the water? 

A: No, if you're in municipal water, city water, you have to put something, because there are dozens and dozens of chemicals in your water. In my book, we want to live, under the health modalities. I talk about the lymphatic bands. You put milk in there, like 3 quarters of a cup of milk, half to 3 quarters of a cup of milk, 2 to 3 tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar, and 2 tablespoons of sea salt or epsom salt. That will bind with the poisons in the water so they don't get into your cells. When I used to take baths, when I first started taking baths in L.A. city water, where there's 197 chemicals, because the water is used twice before it gets to L.A. Los Angeles City, the valley is used before that it is used. It's used in industry in those two places. Then we get to Los Angeles, we've got all those industrial chemicals that have been dumped into the water, and all the waste that people have used, paints and whatever they put in their water, and all the chemicals that they've used, all in the L.A. city water. So, I used to get in the water, and 3 minutes in that water, I'd really, I'd look like I had 10 cups of coffee. I'd just shake, and I couldn't stop the shaking, and my blood pressure would sky high, go sky high. And it would take hours for me to come down, until I realized it was the chemicals in the water. Then I started putting those ingredients that I shared with you, into the water, and it never happened again. So, you put those in the water, to keep them from being absorbed into your system, and perspire out of your waste product, into the water. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, nothing else would cause it until I got it in the water. So I looked at what was in the water from the lab tests from the city.

Q: How did you know that, uh...

A: Well, I knew that milk and those ingredients would do it, because I knew that when you have lots of heavy acidic toxins, your body will use to rid itself of them, lots of calcium, phosphorus, manganese, and potassium, alkalinizing minerals. And it will bind with the high acidic industrial chemicals and neutralize it. And the molecule becomes then too big to get back into your system. It can't get into a cell, so it locks it. The vinegar is a beneficial acid, and the skin likes a beneficial acid because the skin is acidic. So that takes it back into a good acidic level. Also, the proteins in raw apple cider vinegar bind with heavy metals. So that's your best chelation therapy. You're not taking TMSO or any of those other toxic chemical chelators, because they're very damaging. All you need is apple cider vinegar. It's the same amino acid without the poison, except that you can demineralize yourself with too much vinegar too often. So you have to have a balance there. And then the sea salt, that was just to make the body a little buoyant. Or the epsom salt. If you have epsom salt, it's a higher amount of magnesium. And if you have sea salt, it's a higher amount of sodium. Both of them will help the body be buoyant, so you don't have all that pressure on your body in the bathtub. It makes you comfortable. Then if you want to make your skin, you know, you're in that water for 90 minutes. 40 to 90 minutes. If you just want to clean the waste out from under your skin, 40 minute bath's enough to do that a day. But if you want to get deep into the lymphatics, you have to take 60 to 90 minutes daily. So to discharge those poisons out of the skin, it takes time and energy and the heat. So do it. It speeds everything up.

Q: What is it the milk did in the water?

A: The milk has lots of minerals. Calcium, phosphorus, potassium, and magnesium. Those bind with a lot of the acidity. Toxic acidity over acidity in the chemicals that they use to treat water or that's a byproduct of the industry.

Q: So if you have well water, there's no need to put the milk in there?

A: You don't have to put anything in the well water.

Q: You don't have to put the vinegar or the...

A: You don't have to put anything in that water if you have well water. And it's not contaminated. Let's say you have a high level of arsenic or copper. You want to put some milk in there, but not a lot. It won't take much. Or iron, too much iron. Still puts a little bit, let's say, of sea salt or epsom salt to get rid of the iron so it makes sure it doesn't irritate your skin and dry out your skin. It's not going to get into your skin, but it's going to dry the skin out on the surface. So, do what I do to help the skin be soft, you know, in my well water, without putting anything in it. I'll put a little bit of coconut cream in the water so when I get out, it's like, you know, when you put your car through the car wash, you know, it's got the spray wax at the end. Well, that's like putting a thin layer of oil and raw water soluble fats on your skin. And it's so nice to get out of the bath. And it can be pretty drying to the skin when you've got all that perspire of toxins. So, that's just a nice way to put it back on instantly.

Q: Even if it's well water, you'd want to put the vinegar in to remove heavy metals?

A: If you've got high iron or high arsenic in your, in your well.

Q: I meant physically. Do you put the vinegar in to remove heavy metals within?

A: No, you can. It'll help. You can do that. It might pull it out of the skin. It's not going to pull it out of the tissue.

Q: Oh, it won't go deep even if you're in there 90 minutes.

A: Because you're perspiring outward. So the only place that water is really getting is on the skin.

Q: So then there's not a lot of reason to put any vinegar in to draw it out?

A: Yeah, that's what I'm saying. It is going to dry you because water is a solvent. So putting the coconut cream, unless you want to put something on as a moisturizer when you get out. You know, a good raw fat. If I can't eat it, I don't put it on my skin.

Q: So coconut oil, if it was raw, you know coconut oil is never 100% raw?

A: Well, there's a coconut that's 100% raw. I have it made and I oversaw the making of it. I didn't make any money from it. The oil. There's an oil that's fermented in Thailand. Very expensive. But there's no processing of it. It's perfectly pure. But still, it's an oil. Remember I said oils are solvent, 90% solvent reactive. And our bodies make virus from those oils.

Q: Oh yes, the body makes viruses from those oils.

A: From those oils, yes. So, you know, it's not a good idea to have a lot of oil. And if you put the oil on your skin, it smothers you. You get very hot. 

Q: So, what I used to do is, after I make the coconut cream with the pulp, I noticed that the pulp cleans a lot the bathroom. I put it in my skin, then I draw it with the water, and the skin gets marvelous. 

A: Yeah, but that's mostly coconut cream. That's not coconut oil. Of the coconut cream, only 7% of that is oil. Just like in a plant, you take the oil, extract oil from a plant, it's only 7% of the plant. Very small percent. Take, for example, coconut. Coconut is 80% fat, 15% protein, 5% carbohydrate. Exactly like that used in the citric acid cycle of energy production. Coconut is perfect in that balance, in that ratio. When you separate the 80% of the fat, 7% of that 80% is oil. The other 93% of the fats are water-soluble fats. Nobody talks about those because they're very fragile. But you need 9 times more of that than you do oil. Which is the ratio on this planet of oil in any system is never more than 7%. In nothing is there ever more than 7% oil. Whale blubber, that's different. And seal blubber is a little different because they need more oil to keep from freezing. But all other animals in arid and tropical environments are all no more than 7% oil. So these water-soluble oils are the most important. That's why I say, you put the coconut cream in the water so when you get out you coat yourself. Or you coat yourself with coconut cream, not coconut oil. 

Q: I was talking about the coconut... 

A: Cream, yeah. 

Q: No, the pulp. The pulp.

A: The pulp. Okay, the pulp has the same thing. The pulp has the coconut cream.

Q: The sensation is very good and the skin...

A: But it's coconut cream! It's not coconut oil, it's coconut cream.

Q: The pulp being what's left over after you make the cream.

A: Yes. It's still coconut cream. It's still only 7% oil of the fat that's in it. Which is like 4 or 5% of the whole coconut. So even though he's juiced it and got a lot of the coconut cream out of it, whatever's left in there is still coconut cream. It's not oil. Some people, I don't like it because it gets caught in my hair and makes knots. You know, when I've used it for a massage. When I have a massage, when I have a place where I get a massage, I use half butter and half bone marrow. And, you know, stem cells, the only place we can get non-adult, what they call embryonic-like stem cells, is in bone marrow. Well, you can from sperm or ovum, but who's going to manufacture sperm and ovum? It would be rather impossible. 

Q: Where are you getting the bone marrow from?
 
A: Buffalo.

Q: From where?

A: North Star Bison. Also from, you know, my Amish farmers. From their beef.

Q: They all send the bone marrow?

A: Well, what they do is they send you sections of bone, and you let it get room temperature, and you pop it out. It's like butter.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I've never cut myself with it. I'll use a tool. So, you know, that's what I use as a massage cream. Also, I use half... I put three, two ounces of each in, and then I'll take a tablespoon of pineapple juice. Take a piece of pineapple, squeeze it in your tongue. A tablespoon of pineapple juice. Pineapple has bromelain in it. It helps break down dead cells in the skin. So it helps get rid of, you know, stuff like this, dead cells. They're collecting the tissue. I got this when I was abducted a little over two years ago in a hotel room and injected with three injections. That was when I went against the swine flu hoax. I had gone through the swine flu hoax in 1976 with Ida Honorof, the consumer advocate, who was syndicated in 3,200 stations around the world, and Dr. McBean. They had all of the statistics on what was in the swine flu vaccine, all the poisons that were in it, and they wrote a book called Vaccination, the Clear and Present Danger. It was focused mostly on the swine flu because she was a consumer advocate. The newspapers back then were mainly family-owned, and they all took pride in reporting true stuff. Now it's all owned by General Electric and the conglomerates, so all of the news is wrong news and false news. Well, back then, they carried her statements. This is all toxicity. You watch the polls where these people go in to get their swine flu shots, and they're going to drop dead, elderly people, young people. In a two-week period, 2,323 people died of the swine flu vaccine. So I had all of those records still with me. I called the CDC when I heard that the government was going to buy it. You know, what are you going to do to stop this? You would know about this. Oh, well, only 46 people died by getting the shot in 1976. I said, no, no, 2,323. I have the documentation of Ida Honorof and McBean. So I was invited on an international radio show, and I gave all of this information out. And let me tell you, the world picked it up. And I got calls to do shows all over, and I did radio shows. I could do it anywhere I was, on a phone. Plus, I got death threats you wouldn't believe.

So I decided after five weeks I better get out, because the swine flu was supposed to come out in April, end of April. The swine flu vaccine was supposed to come out. We were supposed to be hit by the slime flu around April. Everybody was supposed to get infected with it. It was going to kill millions of people. And we paid $8 billion to produce it and to have it available. So with my information went out there, it was picked up on that first radio show by a rap group in England, in Britain. And they did a song and a video called Just Say No to the Vaccine. And they got all these shots of kids getting injected, all the sickness and the damage, and all of these bizarre, ugly shots in the medical profession. And you hear my voice in it. They pulled it out of the interview. The only way you can get swine flu, unless you're a pig, is to get the swine flu shot. So when I left, I left after five weeks of a lot of threats and some damage done, computers damaged in my home. Many invasions through my firewalls into my computer. I left the country, went to the Philippines. While I was in a hotel room in the Philippines on one of the small islands, I woke and I'm half sitting up in bed. It was a pretty nice hotel, only really good hotel in this town. This was a small town. I've got a hypodermic hanging from my arm. Two guys standing over me look like clean-cut CIA types. Two more hypodermics on the bed here, and a cloth folding down my chest and stomach. By the time I realized, and there was a lot of light, there was big windows over here, so they were coming with the light from outside. So I couldn't make out their faces, but I could make out their coloring and everything. I could see that they were not Filipino. These were European-American types. And the one guy on my right picked up the cloth off of my lap, put it over my mouth, and I was out less than a second, or about a second. Now, as a child, I had had ether many times. It took 12 to 17 seconds to put me out. This had me out in a second, and it was not, it was odor-free. Completely no odor to it. 

So it had to be some kind of very special chemical by the military or the pharmaceutical industry that they did not let out to the public. And when I woke the next morning, I thought it was a bad dream until I rolled over and moved. And I was sick all over, vomiting. I had bubbles with needle marks in my arms. And you can see the scars when you're still there from there. They were bubbled up. Within 24 hours, I had skin exploding. So I've got huge scars everywhere, all over my back and over on the other side. 

Q: They're healed up though, much better.

A: Yeah, they've healed.

Q: They look much worse than the first time I saw them.

A: She saw them when they were still... And I got them all over my body. I mean, big ones in the leg. Huge one here, here, here. Lots of them all over my body. And I was probably going to die, but then I realized, you know, what can I do to reverse all of this? So I knew that if I got shark or stingray, they turn into, as soon as they die, the ammonia multiplies in them rapidly. No other fish does that. So I got a driver to drive me, because I couldn't drive. I mean, I would be standing for three minutes, and all of a sudden I'd start passing out. I had to get down on my knees quickly as if I'm diabetic again. But this was a whole nausea and vertigo. So I got a driver. He took me to a wharf. We found some baby stingray that was a day and a half old, so it was already ripe with ammonia. So I chopped it up finely and started eating a little at a time, because even ammonia can kill you, because if you eat enough ammonia to get into your blood, your blood stops transporting oxygen. So I had to eat just enough, because ammonia binds with poisons, chemical poison, and the body will reject them out the kidney. So that's why I was trying to clean it out of my blood. So that went on. I did that for about two days, and then most of the dizziness and fainting spells stopped. But I still had this stuff come out for six more months, just ripping out. It looks like I was in a grenade explosion all over my body. So then a year later, a year to the date, beginning of April, I went into another detox. And this time, it started on the arms. You can see these heavy scars that I have all over. They're small now, but they were big spots. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, I mean, scars everywhere, all over the place. And then on this leg, it started on this leg, and the whole foot erupted. It just peeled away. It was like I was going to lose that leg. Everybody thought I was going to lose that leg. Because I would just leave it open or put more raw meat on it. 

Q: We are governed by criminals. 

A: Huh?

Q: We are governed by criminals.

A: Oh, yeah, they're criminals. Well, I don't know if it was the government or pharmaceutical industry. I don't know who it was. But it was one of those, or all of them. I don't know. I created a cancer here, which was a kaposi sarcoma. It got about this big. I put the pineapple on it and put some honey on it. Put the meat on it. Dissolved it. Got rid of it. I know how to do these things, so I was able to save myself. This year, at the beginning of April, I said, I'm in a year of cyclic cycle. Whenever I detox, my detox is a certain thing. It's always a year after that date when I start again. It lasted for six months last year, too. This year, I was wondering what's going to happen this April. I started bleeding out this eye and this ear. And here. It started on my face. And then it stopped after two weeks. So I was very fortunate. Of course, it may not be over. I still may go into more. But I knew what to do, and I knew how to take care of it. But there are dangerous people in this world. They want to protect their medical integrity, which is a very lack of it anyway. They'll do anything they want to do, anything they can do, to keep their interests at the fore, no matter what they have to do to me.

Q: Did you analyze your blood to check for poisons?

A: On that island, there was no laboratory. I would have had to send it to Manila. And I tried, but they wouldn't let me send it, because I wasn't a medical doctor. And going to the police would have been absurd, because they would have said, oh, you're just a drug addict, you're shooting up. There was no sense in doing that. I had to survive, and it was about surviving.

Q: You don't know what they injected you with.

A: I assumed that it was swine flu. I think they wanted me to get the swine flu and say, see, he died, yes, he died of swine flu. Now, see, I was in Asia, which was perfect for them. Because if you get off of a plane in Asia, you've got every foreigner that comes through has to come through a camera that registers your body heat. So they're looking for fevers, and they pull you out. And they will quarantine you just for having a fever. And if they would have called me out, my name was on the registry, pull him out. He's got swine flu, he's probably a carrier. They would have told him anything to hold me in isolation. Then when I died, they would have said, see, he died of the swine flu. But see, I was aware of that. So before I got off the plane, I got ice water, put it in a towel, and put the ice water around my neck. And then that's it. I knew their games. I knew all their odds, what they could do to me.

Q: [unintelligible] the reason why you can get swine flu in such a virulent way, right? I mean, so to speak.

A: You can't get swine flu unless you're a pig.

Q: I'm saying that they gave it to you.

A: But the swine flu isn't virulent.

Q: No, no, that's what I said, so to speak.

A: It's the substance they use with it.

Q: So the fact that your body couldn't fight it, because you're so healthy, is because what? Because there was an overabundance of the bad stuff? Whatever they put inside you, why didn't your body fight it? Why did you get sick as a result of getting this?

A: Well, as I said earlier, you've got liquid mercury, aluminum, formaldehyde, ether, detergent, and up to 23 of them. The fact that in the swine flu you've got squalene and 16 other toxins in it, and all of them are toxins of their own. Swine flu virus, a virus of swine flu isn't going to harm you. But that's what pigs, when they're too toxic, use to dissolve dead cells. 

Q: Yes, and since that's an artificial, whatever they put inside of you. But if you go into a place where it's highly contagious, airborne.

A: There's no such thing as contagious.

Q: Okay, so let's just say a thing like Ebola is supposed to be something.

A: There's no such thing. You need to look at the literature. As Dr. Leonard Horowitz proved with the chemistry in the lab, Ebola was created by the U.S. and British military.

Q: Exactly.

A: AIDS was too.

Q: But isn't it spread?

A: No, it is not spread. It's injected into the body. Just like they used AIDS in Africa. They put it in 25 million smallpox vaccines. That's how all those people got it. And the British and American governments donated that. Hundreds of millions of dollars. And what they did, they got 27 countries into the World Bank. And they run 27 countries by devastating them with AIDS. 

Q: So you can't cough and spread some kind of contagion?

A: No, you can't.

Q: How does a person get sick?

A: A person gets sick, they're detoxifying. People get the same things at the same time because it's a matter of temperature. It's a matter of state of being. It's a matter of climate. Okay, let's take this for example. Bears come out of hibernation in Colorado. Bears come out of hibernation in Wyoming. Bears come out of hibernation in Canada. Bears come out of hibernation, and it's always a month after. All of a sudden you're up in Alaska and you're three months later. Are bears contagious? Did the bears here, did the U.S. cause the bears?

Q: They're not contagious, it's just the external conditions that's allowing for something to happen.

A: It's the climate and conditions.

Q: Right, right, right. So people are getting sick because, first of all, they're weakened. And it happens to be at that end of the hibernation period, let's say, kidding around. That's why there's the flu season.

A: Correct.

Q: Because the conditions are set. And if you're weakened, you're going to catch.

A: If you're toxic.

Q: So what happens if you kiss somebody, and they're sick, and all of a sudden you get sick?

A: That's just the same time. If I have a crow out there crowing and the sun rises, and the roosters crow every time the sun comes up, there's a crowing of the cock, the reason that the sun comes up. You can't utilize that. The medical profession gets you believing that. It has nothing to do with it.

Q: I'm aware of that kind of mindset. I really am. It's a great point.

Q: You can get syphilis.

Q: Huh?

Q: You can catch syphilis. Well, how do people get syphilis?

A: People get syphilis by taking a lot of toxins in, like vaccines that go into that particular part of their body and break down tissue. 

Q: That's a very good question. That's an interesting point. I wasn't aware of it before. So how does a person get HIV from someone else who has HIV?

A: Only blood transfusion. There are 213 couples that one of them has had AIDS since the early 70s. Their partner stopped using any kind of a sexual protective, and none of them got any AIDS. It's a myth.

Q: [unintelligible] blood?

A: Blood? If you put blood in yourself, you get a transfusion. The chemicals that you got injected into you with the hepatitis B vaccine is what did it. Dr. Strecker proved that the government caused AIDS in this country, just like Horowitz proved that our governments did it in Africa. They put the hepatitis B vaccine as an exploratory experiment in the cities of Houston, Los Angeles, New York City, and San Francisco. They wanted to try it out on undesirables. The AIDS virus that contaminated soup was created in UCLA in 61 and 62. It was given to the military. They put it in the hepatitis B vaccine in those cities. They did it because they wanted to do it to undesirables. They felt that homosexuals were undesirable. They found that the homosexuals in their drug use were getting hepatitis in huge numbers. In those cities, 90% of the people getting hepatitis were homosexuals. They put it in the hepatitis vaccine.

Q: How did they get the vaccine? Why would they do the vaccine? Why would anybody do a hepatitis vaccine?

A: Why do nurses and doctors take hepatitis B vaccine every year?

Q: I don't know.

A: You can't prevent hepatitis, which is garbage, because you can't prevent a solvent.

Q: I don't know.

A: That's what I mean. Babies that are born now, hepatitis B vaccine. The day they're born.

Q: My kids aren't vaccinated.

A: Good for you. Great. So, it is not a contagious thing. The medical profession makes people take a lot of vaccines and a lot of pills on the idea of contamination. Of spreading something. And it's not true.

Q: So you say, you understand that nothing is contagious?

A: Nothing is contagious. Laugh may be contagious. But prove that laugh is contagious. There's no chemical thing there. It's just that, oh, your body is going through a cleanse. It's the right climate for it, so let my body do it too. It's as much as contagious as a laugh. It's not a biochemical thing. 

Q: Okay, so could it be on the same level as biomagnetic fields where they can test, do EKGs and EEGs. And they can do somebody like, you could test mine. And then you could come in the room and they could test yours, and then they could put us both in the room. And my heart, by rhythm, would show up in your practice. They've shown it.

A: Well, that's a rarity.

Q: They haven't been able to reproduce that many times. No, it has been now produced many times.

A: Where? Who?

Q: There's a guy out of the University of Arizona that's reproduced. I've got the book there.

A: I would have to really check his information, because I find a lot of those medical stories are lies.

Q: It's actually experiments that he's done.

A: But I mean, they've come up with those false experiments all the time.

Q: But my whole point is that, if we're really that connected, then why wouldn't we be that connected with, like you're saying, somebody's...

A: You've got different biological chemistry.

Q: Right.

A: Your cells are different from mine. So the virus that your body would create would be different from mine. So your passing it to me is not going to make me create your virus.

Q: Right. That's not where I'm coming from. Where I'm coming from is that, if it's a detox, or the body's going through a symptom of detox, then why wouldn't it be communicating with other bodies that this is the time to do this?

A: Well, it can be, as far as an example, but it's not a chemical thing.

Q: No, I was talking about an energetic communication.

A: Let me tell you, if syphilis were contagious, every single mafia guy would have it. Every single mafia guy would have it. But very few people ever get syphilis. It's usually when they get it in a vaccine, a lot of troops get it. A lot of military people get it because of an injection they get that goes to those areas of the body that starts dissolving that tissue and then it gets into the spine. But that's from vaccines. 70% of all diseases today are caused by vaccines. 70%. About 90% of all diseases today are treated by the pharmaceutical industry. 

Q: So when you get a vaccine, are you saying, because I've heard this before as well, are you saying this that a person gets a vaccine and then it could be, whatever is in there is dormant until the right conditions trigger that?

A: No.

Q: Because not everybody is getting a vaccine right now, let's say an adult. And so how are they going to get sick if they're not getting a vaccine within the past five years?

A: You're not listening to what I've been saying. I've been saying that every way of detoxification, bacterial, parasitical, viral, fungal, is always in every cell, has the ability to do it. The vaccines are poison. The viruses in them and the cells that have a disease is a very small part of the vaccine. It really has no value. It's not going to create any kind of immunity at all. It's the poisons which cause the body to spend all of their time and energy on the poison. So your body's not going to be able to create any virus or bacteria or entertain any parasite to cleanse itself. So it stops those.

Q: But nothing's being introduced. What is is the overload of the other toxins that's causing the body to be overloaded and then get weakened and then get sick.

A: You don't have to get weakened to get sick. Your body just wants to clean itself and it'll go into a cold or a flu. There are many strong athletes who go into a cold or a flu. It's the body wanting to clean itself of toxic tissue. So it can maintain a higher level of functionality.

Q: But I still don't understand. If you can get AIDS through blood, not just a transfusion, but let's say...

A: No, you have to only get it through transfusion.

Q: So you cannot spread. If you get blood, a person's blood who's infected and it gets on your skin, you cannot get it.

A: You cannot get it. When it opens, you bleed outward. You seep outward.

Q: So basically, people don't have to be concerned about getting AIDS then.

A: Correct. Not unless you're getting a transfusion. Or you're getting hepatitis vaccine. Or any vaccine. Any injection.

Q: You really believe this?

A: I've seen the work.

Q: I'm not challenging you on this.

A: I've seen the work.

Q: Okay, I'll tell you why. Because if that's the case, then you have a more optimistic view of things. Once you believe that, you're going to have a brighter day. Because you know you're not going to get sick. Another paradigm shift.

A: The only place I'm going to get sick is if somebody stabs me. Because I'm not going to eat anything that's bad for me. Somebody has to subdue me and stab me like they did. Inject me with fluid. It's the only time you're going to get me to do something toxic to get a disease.

Q: What about food poisoning? What's that?

A: Well, I avoid food poisoning. Food poisoning isn't a bacterial problem. I've seen many people eat so-called heavily decaying food with parasites. And I've eaten myself high bacteria even up to a year and three months old as I did on Ripley's Believe It or Not in 2002. Did I get sick? No. And I'm considered a very weak person who's had blood and bone cancer and had a vagotomy where I don't have the hydrochloric acid. 

Q: Or what is food poisoning?

A: Food poisoning, true food poisoning is toxic 60,000 chemicals that you're allergic to that cause you to vomit diarrhea. Now the pharmaceutical industry, the medical industry will always address the bacteria that may accompany that. Because if you have damaged cells, say you have damaged stomach cells because of the poisons you've eaten in the food. Like that Jack in the Box incident where 125 people were so-called damaged by E. coli. Now it wasn't the E. coli that was the issue. That was each individual's E. coli in the detoxification of diarrhea. But what was really involved in the meat was somebody got the detergent in the meat when they were cleaning something and they didn't clean it all out. So it got ground up in one batch, two batches of meat that went in separate directions. It went to Washington State and Denver and that in Colorado, that area. So all those people got contamination. But they certainly weren't going to go after the food industry because that particular meat packing company was owned by George Bush. Family. Their beef company was the cause of that. Because they were not going to blame it on that. They blamed it on E. coli. E. coli is indigenous to everybody's intestine. So here they're pooping out this stuff and they say, oh, it's the E. coli. E. coli did it. 

Q: So there's no such thing as a bad bacteria?

A: No. Well, you can have a bad bacteria. Let's say you have contaminated food. Processed, heavily food. And bacteria feeds on that. Of course, secretions are going to be toxic. Because of what it's eating.

Q: Well, because of the secretions. Not the bacteria itself is bad, just what it's digesting and secreting.

A: Well, it will harm them eventually. Just like you can be very healthy and you eat toxic substances, you're going to break down and get weak and diseased. They will get that way too.

Q: If you eat this toxic food or other bacteria, how does it weaken you if there's no bacteria that's harmful? It's just its byproduct?

A: I said if you're eating pure food, there's no bacteria that's harmful. There's no bacteria in your body that's harmful.

Q: Right. Inside. But you can introduce it and then get sick.

A: Let's say you went out and got canned food that was full of aluminum and mercury and nitrates that they put in like meats. So, let's say I get some Spam, you know, and it's full of sprays, pink slime, and I eat that. And I eat it, keep eating, keep eating, I'm going to cause deterioration of my tissue. That's going to create a bacteria that won't be so healthy either. And its discards of eating that kind of tissue that I have eaten becomes compoundedly toxic.

Q: So, the bacteria that's in the body is good, but there are bacteria that are outside the body that are not good.

A: You can have that toxic bacteria in your body if you eat a lot of contaminated stuff. But it's not contagious.

Q: But the bacteria is coming from that food that's contaminated.

A: Correct. It always comes from, the disease always comes from outside.

Q: I hate to say this, but I'm still thinking about this, but wouldn't that be a form of...

A: We can't talk about this anymore, because we're not going to get finished. You're going to have to double on that one, and I've got plenty of stuff about it in my writing.

Q: That's alright, I'm going to do that anyway.

A: In my newsletters, go online, subscribe to my newsletter, I've got many articles on it. Just go through those, get all the articles back to 2006 when you subscribe. Lots of reading material, about 1500 pages, so lots of them. So we need to move on. Now, the other foods that we have to consider is protein. Remember, the protein that is right for us is the protein where hydrochloric acid and bile will break down those particular foods. And remember, it was always the animal foods that were properly digested. Nuts, no. Grains, no. Beans, no. Beans are one of the hardest because they even have more of a cellulose wall than regular vegetables. So those items have to be cooked for us to digest them. When you cook them, you destroy the vitamins and the enzymes. And what you have is cauterized protein, cauterized fats, cauterized minerals. So it's very low nutrition. It does not feed the body properly. So just because cooking something makes it more digestible, makes it easier to break down and absorb, doesn't mean it's healthier because it isn't. More toxic. Beans, nuts, grains, all have to be cooked to be absorbed in the human body.

Q: So beans are no good.

A: Beans are terrible.

Q: But the nuts and grains also are no good.

A: No good. We don't digest them properly. Only meats, when we apply our hydrochloric acid, our bacteria and bile, break down properly. Almost completely digest. So our proteins are meats, eggs, and dairy. Now there is a tribe that I met in the Philippines. Took three days to get there. One day by four-wheel drive, one day by boat, and one day by swimming. Over a mile to get there. And the government wouldn't let me go there. I had to go underground, get somebody to take me. When I got there, I met a tribe. Their average lifespan is about 138 or 148. And these people are vibrantly healthy and die with perfect teeth. Can you imagine dying at 148 years old, 147 years old, with perfect teeth? They do manufacture, they do produce a third set of teeth at 90 years old. That's documented in one place in Thailand by a Chinese doctor about six years ago. He found a man who grew a third set of teeth at 90 years old, documented. And that's what we're supposed to do. That's our second or third stage in life, for teeth. And this tribe, they just go to sleep, die happy and healthy. You know, it's just like cells can reproduce only so many times and live so long on a perfect diet. They lived on how many foods? Two foods. They ate raw fish that they caught every day, and sometimes they'd make it ripe and stinky and eat it. And they ate coconut, coconut meat. The women ate a half of a coconut a day, the men ate a whole coconut a day, and one to three pounds of fish a day. That's all they ate. Once a week, once every two weeks, they ate a green banana or a green mango. So it was less than one percent of their, not even one, but half a percent of their diet was fruit. Think about that. Half a percent of their diet was fruit. They lived on those two foods. Beats the hell out of the USDA's food pyramid where you have to have starch, you have to have the grains, and you have to have, you know, the vegetables and all that. When you're healthy, you don't need all that. Two foods, and these people were like you, strong and big. Yeah, you know, I thought people who ate fish would be skinny, but they weren't. You know, I had to take a look at that, and I only came to that conclusion because if I eat fish, I get hungry very quickly and I'll lose weight.

Q: They ate raw? Raw fish?

A: Yeah, raw. All raw. They only ate raw. They didn't eat anything cooked. And these people were strong and healthy. Then I had to take a look at the Maasai. The Maasai eat all this dairy and all this meat, and they're really skinny and tall. So these guys were eating fish and built like him. Did these guys pump weights or something? No, it's just, you know, they're living and they grow like a gorilla. Naturally grows like this, and they have to swing around and crawl around on the ground. And he builds all this muscle tissue naturally. And it was their system on nothing but fish and coconut. I was thrilled. I was excited. This was a marvelous, you know. And the government spent three weeks preventing me from getting there. They even outlawed me from renting a car in all of Mindanao. The only rental agency there was Budget. And they called Budget and said you cannot rent a car, four-wheel drive, or anything to this man. So they blacklisted me.

Q: They were connected with the U.S. government.

A: Of course they connected with the U.S. government. The U.S. government and the Philippine government are like this.

Q: Oh, is that the Philippines or the Thailand?

A: Philippines. That was Philippines. I happened to meet a man who was part of that tribe. And I helped him with his grandson through leukemia, who was only five months old. Helped him recover in three days. So he took me and picked up his cousin, which had only left the tribe seven years before. He had left it 30 years ago. He was a liaison between the government and the tribes. So they even refused to let him take me. So we snuck off and he took me anyway. So that's how I got to that tribe. And it was a miraculous thing. Two foods. Raw fish and raw coconut. Pretty amazing. You don't need a lot of food. You just need what you will digest properly. Now, when I put the hydrochloric acid, the bacteria, and the bile on coconut, the bile did digest the coconut pretty well. But mainly the cholesterols that were produced from it were those for cleansing. Not as bad as the pressed oils, like olive oil and all the others. But it still produced a lot of cleansing compounds, a lot of cleansing cholesterols. So it's still something that I don't suggest people eat a lot of. This tribe was raised on it and grew on it for thousands of years. And they were suited to it. The hydrochloric acid that I put on the coconut did break down the protein in the coconut by half, which is pretty good. But if you're living mainly on fish and the coconut's just your buffer, then that's okay. But that's what they mean living on raw fish. So you don't have to be complex and complicated. I like some complex and complicated because I found that there are foods that can help reverse certain diseases and ailments. And those are all listed in the back of We Want to Live in the remedy section. You have a problem, you have an issue. You look at the foods that are good for helping that issue. And those are the foods that you have to help those issues. And like I said, the cheese, that tribe's clean. They're not injected with anything. They're not being bombed with, you know, toxic exhaust waste all day long. And in their lives, they're not bombed with mercury from burning coal for electricity. They're clean. They don't need the cheese.

They don't need those things as remedies, because they have no disease. Not even dental caries. Not one cavity. There was one woman without a tooth, and she had a scar up there. So you knew that she lost her tooth from an accident. Or a fight, who knows. They didn't fight, so I can't imagine that. So, who knows. May have been bogey and hit herself with an oar or something, who knows.

Q: But the coconut fiber, they eat the coconut fiber.

A: They eat coconut fiber.

Q: With the fiber also.

A: Yeah.

Q: Like in Venezuela.

A: Yeah.

Q: That is the way I recovered so much, because I used to take one coconut a day, because I didn't have access to water.

A: Right.

Q: Jesus.

A: Eat the meat.

Q: No, I didn't eat the... Only I prepared, my formula was five eggs in the morning, because I had huge problems with my stomach, because I was vaccinated and a lot of antibiotics during all my life. So I had to eat every...

A: Small.

Q: Very small meals, okay? But in the morning, in order to be clean with my mind, to work with my job, that is mine, programming the computer, so I prepared five eggs, the coconut, the cream of the one coconut, three spoons of honey and... And if I find sometimes a piece of cheese, a very little piece of cheese, raw cheese  unsalted, only. That was my breakfast, okay? In lunch was...

A: Well, we can't go into that, we have to go through this, we're going to be very late here. So, you know, it's very simple. The coconut meat they were able to digest. We can digest more of that than we can any other cellulose, but it's still high in cellulose. Because I have no hydrochloric acid, I cannot digest much of it. But I will use it. If I can't get enough butter or milk, I will start eating more coconut. I'll grate it and eat it. Or I'll take the ground coconut and eat that as long as it's fresh ground. I grind it myself. And I feed it to my cows and myself. And the cows love it. Boy, the milk they produce from coconut, fabulous. Fabulous stuff. So, as far as what we can eat in protein is very limited. And we can keep our diet very simple and be very healthy. We don't have to have a lot of things. Now, vegetables I don't agree with because we only digest 2% of it. And that's mainly the juice to get the vitamins, enzymes and minerals out of it. So, we are lacking in vitamins and enzymes and minerals terribly. From our toxic environment that robs everything. Pollution and our bad diets and the ill health of everything. Everything you cook has no enzymes in it. And no vitamins that aren't altered into a state where they can't be used properly. So, your body has to manufacture its own no matter what kind it is. So, vegetable juices help in alkalinizing an over-acidic body. And to supply minerals and vitamins and concentration. So, vegetable juices are good. And I have vegetable juice suggestions in my recipe book. The ones that you might need for your particular health condition. So, that's basically the food regime. Now, how can we eat to make sure that we produce the greatest amount of energy and clarity of mind? If you look at the body, what does the body do? When you eat, the first thing the body does is make glycogen out of what's ever present. 

Glycogen runs the brain and nervous system. Glycogen is important for functionality, period. The body will make glycogen from whatever is produced in the first seven hours of your waking day. Six hours mainly, but seven to be safe. So, you don't want to eat any high-carbohydrate in the first six to seven hours, unless it's buffered by something that's anti-carbohydrate, like celery. Carrot juice is high in carbohydrate. Celery is so deficient in carbohydrate, there's not enough carbohydrate in celery to digest celery. So, you combine the two, and you do not have a high ratio of carbohydrate.So you can have a good vitamin A creator and vitamin D creator from the carotene in the carrot, without going to cause an excessive amount of sugars, carbohydrates, that cause the body to make glycogen from it. Remember, glycogen from carbohydrates is very sticky. Full of sugar. The brain won't function as well, the blood won't function as well, nothing functions very well. So you never want to eat a high carbohydrate for the first seven hours of your waking day. So what do you eat? Well, take a look at what's happening in the body. When I examined all of the autopsies of people who died during the night or early in the morning, we found pools of toxins in the stomach. Most people vomit in the morning if they are sick. And that vomit is highly concentrated in chemicals. Not in bacteria. Not in anything else than industrial chemicals. Along with [unintelligible]. And that pools in the stomach and hydrochloric acid to neutralize it. To control it. So, eat cheese the first night. Two tablespoons of cheese the first thing in the morning. One to two tablespoons of cheese. A big guy, two to four tablespoons of cheese. Absorb all that contamination that's dumped into the stomach during the night. That will carry it out. If you eat the food ten minutes later, it won't carry the poisons. You'll digest it without taking poisons back into the body. So what's the most easily digested food that I talked about earlier? Eggs. Suck an egg ten minutes after you eat the cheese.

Now the reason I say this is because when people were having upper and lower GIs, I examined their stomach fluid every ten minutes. And I found that there was a pattern. When they ate something, the body would start dumping all the poisons along with the hydrochloric acid into that food. And if they kept eating, it would go on for about as long as they ate, twenty-five minutes before it would stop. However, if they ate something, just one something, like a tablespoon or two, and then stopped eating, ten minutes after that, the body stopped dumping its toxins out of the lining. So then it wouldn't do it again for twenty-five minutes. So ten minutes you eat the cheese, ten minutes after that you eat the food, and then you have twenty-five minutes before it will start dumping again. If you haven't finished your meal, you have cheese again, wait ten minutes, and then you eat twenty-five minutes again. And that's the cycle that I found. So, you eat your cheese ten minutes before you eat anything, to make sure you have the poisons out of the way in the stomach and the intestines as the food moves through. So you eat the cheese, ten minutes after that you eat the food, and you have twenty-five minutes to eat the food. So, in the morning you have your cheese, ten minutes after that you suck an egg, five minutes after that you suck another egg. Make sure you get enough pyruvate from the egg white to build protein, I mean the glycogen from the brain and nervous system from the protein, which has no stickiness. Your pyruvate sugar is made into glycogen. No sticky by-product. So you have no advanced glycation end-products at all involved in the waste product either, to gum up the body. So then after that, I mean for you I would say have four or five eggs. If you have Crohn's disease or a serious digestive problem, eat four or five eggs. If it's taking over that twenty-five minutes to have, you consume those eggs, then you have cheese again, ten minutes after that you finish your eggs. Fill your body with the eggs, the easiest thing to digest.

After that you have your choice. If you are a long-term vegetarian, forget vegetable juice and go for meat. If you haven't, if you've been a real junk fooder, like with donuts and stuff like that, like processed, pre-prepared deli meats, then you want vegetable juice. So you wait about twenty minutes after you finish the eggs. You have your cheese again ten minutes after that, you have your vegetable juice. If you're going to have vegetable juice and you're a vegetarian, you put a raw egg in it and whip it, maybe with a teaspoon of cream. Then you let forty, forty-five minutes pass after that, you have cheese again, and ten minutes after that, then you have your meat meal. So you're having all of this meat and egg stuff, first thing in the morning, so your brain and everything will function at optimal, your brain and your body. Then about thirty minutes after you finish your meat meal, and always have butter with your meat meal, two to four tablespoons. If you want to keep on weight like this man, I would have four tablespoons of butter minimum with each meat meal, to maintain my muscle structure, like that. I always have at least two, two and a half.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I don't, but you can, that's okay, that's fine. And then, thirty minutes after you finish that meat meal, now's the time to supply the body with minerals. How do we do that? Anybody remember? Butter and cheese. No, excuse me, honey and cheese. Remember when you eat honey with your cheese, you will digest the minerals in it. And the fats and proteins that go along with assimilating those minerals. So, if I were him, I would have four to five tablespoons of cheese, with four to five teaspoons of honey. So it's one third less honey to the cheese. If it were that young lady back there, I would say two tablespoons of cheese, one and a half to two teaspoons of honey.

Q: Where are the minerals you're absorbing?

A: In the cheese.

Q: In the cheese.

A: Yes. Cheese is full of minerals. So, you do it upon, you know, what you need. And then after that, you're still going through the day, you still haven't reached your seven hours, probably about two and a half hours into your day, then do that little routine of having your little bits, little sugar cube-sized amount of cheese every 15, 20 minutes to 30 minutes, or even 45 minutes, just around the clock. Like, let's say every 20 minutes you have cheese, 20 minutes cheese, 20 minutes cheese, 20 minutes cheese. You're back on the hour. So it's three times an hour. And then you can sip milk in between or a sport formula, my sport formula. And I'll give you the sport formula in a minute. So you do that every hour, and you will get well faster. Then maybe you can do that for three, four hours. So you're seven to eight hours into your day. Time for your fruit meal. Fruit meal is great for cleansing the body. The body will make alcohols with it, with the fats that you eat, detoxifying fats, to help cleanse the body. And you choose the fruits that help with your particular issue, your particular problem. Let's say you have a lot of mercury and heavy metals in your body, and not iron, but one of the darker metals. And you want to get rid of it. Dark berries are great. You have dark berries and coconut cream together, with a little bit of berry cream, just to protect the nerves. If you've got digestive problems, you may have pineapple one day and papaya the next day. And you always have it with some coconut cream, which is mildly, but still very cleansing, rather than, let's say, olive oil or coconut oil, which is real aggressive. So you have your food with coconut cream and a little bit of dairy cream to protect the nerves. Remember, dairy cream is the only fat that can completely nutrify and protect the nervous system and brain. So have a little bit with that, because if you're going to start calling out a lot of toxins, you need protection for the brain and nervous system.

So find the fruits that are good for your cleansing, your needs, in the book. Then, for the next four or five hours, you do the cheese and the sipping on a sport drink or milk or milkshake. If you want to gain a lot of weight, you don't have milk, you have milkshake, with eggs and whipped cream in it, and milk, and the honeysuckle. And if you want to digest a little bit better, grate a little bit of ginger in there. Makes it taste better, stimulates circulation and digestion. Never have enough to burn. Some people like to burn, like Asians, like lots of hot stuff and ginger. Not good for us. It's too much stimulation. It could cause you to heavily detox. You could be going into a cold or a flu. So keep that to a nice taste flavor. Not too much. So you do that for another four to five hours. And then you can, if you haven't had a vegetable juice in the morning, you know, have the cheese, ten minutes after have the vegetable juice. And then maybe an hour and a half after that, you have your second meat meal. And then you have butter with it, of course. Now you can always make that butter into a sauce. I have 82 sauces, meat sauces, in the recipe book. They can be made in three to five different ways each. Such 400 sauces. Choose the ones you like and use those. Mostly butter, choose the ones that have butter in them. Those are the most beneficial. Then 30 minutes after that, cheese again. And then have your cheese and honey together. Your mineral supplement again. And then have a half a cup of milk before you go to sleep. And then one during the night. Or suck an egg during the night. Or a little four ounces of milkshake. Have something for the night. The reason for that is, is if you go four... If you go five hours, if you're very thin, four hours is all it takes. But most people who are not underweight, after five hours there's no protein in the blood for the red blood cells to eat. So they start eating each other. They become cannibalistic. So what happens is, after eight to ten hours of sleep, you've consumed two to four tablespoons of red blood cells. You are then anemic. 

That's why when you wake after eight to ten hours of sleep, you say, why am I tired? Because you're anemic. Caffeine, nicotine, theobromine from chocolate, none of those are going to help you with anemia. Eating is the process. So during the night, you set your alarm. If you don't, you usually wake during the night and eat half a cup of milk, four ounces of milkshake, or suck a few eggs, or eat a couple of ounces of meat and go back to sleep. If you're a hyperactive person and when you wake up after five hours and you eat and you can't go back to sleep and you want eight hours, then set your alarm for three hours, wake and eat and sleep for five hours. And then you awaken after five hours and you eat. So you never get into that space where your red blood cells are eating each other. It doesn't only happen at night. You go five hours in the daytime, you don't eat, your red blood cells begin eating each other. It's the law. The law of the body. So don't go five hours without eating. I suggest if you want to get well, eat a little bit all the time, all day long. And you have your big meat meals and your one fruit meal. So you're really only eating three major meals a day. It's that easy.

Q: It's the natural defense reason, natural reason why the red blood cells are eating the other red blood cells. There's got to be a good reason for that.

A: I just told you, they have no protein anymore. They don't have any energy.

Q: It's eating itself.

A: Yeah, they have to eat each other. They don't eat themselves.

Q: You know it's a bad thing, it's a good thing.

A: I'm a red blood cell and I'm littler than you. I punch you here and eat you. In the neck. So it's just a matter of one cell eating another. And of course, the big cells are going to eat the little ones.

Q: Because anything that happens in the body that seems to be bad, actually it's a good thing. It's just that it's trying to keep itself surviving.

A: Under the circumstances.

Q: Exactly, exactly. It's not the optimal thing, but at least it's still doing something good.

A: Yeah. It's always doing the best it can with what you provide it. And if you provide it with food like I do, you can even recover from maniacs sticking hypodermics in you with massive amounts of poison that usually can kill one person. And I survived three. But I knew what to do. I knew what to do for my body. I knew to get the high ammonia meat to help harness some of those chemicals that were getting into my blood constantly. Most of it was out in 72 hours. That's why I stopped eating the high ammonia meat after 72 hours. Didn't eat it anymore. Because what would be released from my tissues now would be minor and my regular diet would handle it. But I had to eat that high, nauseous, awful, tasty ammonia stingray for three days. And that stuff was nasty. Just hard for me to keep from vomiting. But I needed to get in there to protect the red blood cells or else I would have killed every red blood cell in my body. The things that were shot into me. Okay, that's how we maintain and function. Now I have two more things to talk about. I talked about water being a solvent. And it's not good to drink water except very little. Because the solvent will dissolve and dilute your body. I remember, well some of us that are older up there, we remember going to school and we'd just take a sip from the fountain. If you were somebody who was on the football team or baseball team or something, you'd drink maybe half a cup of that. But we drank orange juice and milk. Then sodas came out and people started drinking a lot of those. But one of the heads of the CEO's Pepsi or Coca-Cola got into a bet. You see trading places where there's two heads of leads of the stock market in a particular house bet each other that they could take this black guy off the street and make him a better stockbroker than the guy that they're top man already and throw him out on the street. And how he survived as a street person, a homeless person. Well, these two guys made a bet with each other.

One said that I can sell water for more than you're selling gasoline and milk and any other product and even our soda. And we can sell water for more. The guy said, wait a minute, get water out of your fountains, water's everywhere. This was in 1961. So what did that guy do? He hired doctors and writers to talk about how much water the body needed. Got athletes and coaches, paid them big money to say that we need lots of water. So that's when 8 Glasses of Water was created in 1961. And that's the first article you will ever see that talks about 8 Glasses of Water or even having a lot of water. It was understood water was not good before that. Drinking a lot of water was not good. You needed nutrients in your fluids. So milk, orange juice, vegetable juices, fruit juices were the things that you drank. Not water. And that is true absolutely. I don't suggest fruit juices because they are too high in sugar. And that will make sticky neurological fluid and blood. Not a good thing. Also make you hyper and then have a crash. Too much sugar one time. Also advanced glycations collect. In Columbia found that they collected in the human body 70-90% for a lifetime. The waste product of glycogen when made from carbohydrates, advanced glycation end product, stores at a rate of 70-90% for your whole life. That's where your skin starts shrinking in and drying up as you get older. It sucks in. And then water fills up in between your tissues. Because of all that sugar that has a tendency to dissolve tissue. It's not healthy stuff. So you avoid that by having high carbohydrates unless you're going to have fat with it. Just like I said, always have your fruit and fat together. Always have fruit and fat together. If you're going to have a vegetable, fruit juice once in a while, you put fat in it. Put cream and egg in it. Something to help block it. You eat some cheese while you're drinking. Do not have, 99% of the time, do not have any fruit juice. And then if you have it, it should be with the fat.

Maybe some cheese, raw cheese, and sparingly, sip it. Don't suck it all at one time. Cheese would be helpful because fruit juices have a tendency to demineralize the body. Now we have to talk about salt. Salt is a dangerous substance. It is the worst thing next to cooking your food. Why is that? Sodium is an explosive. An isolated sodium is more volatile than nitroglycerin. My father worked on a project for General Electric, for the military, to make it a weapon. Because you can take one crystal of pure sodium this big, and it will take out all of New York City and the buildings. It's worth five atomic bombs. One crystal of sodium. Sodium is explosive. When you take it, they give it to you. It's even with sodium iodide. You've got an iodine molecule bound with it, or you've got iron with it, or potassium. You've always got another mineral that's bound with it when you have it as table salt, or as a purifier for a water system. With the water system, it's usually potassium and sodium, which is saltpeter. That will damage your libido if you want to have sex. Do not ever use that as a water softener in your system when it's in your water. The sodium is an explosive. When you change the degree, when they isolate it like that, just the sodium, one and a half degree change will cause it to set off. They couldn't control it, so it's not a weapon yet. They're still working on it. But GE was given $2 billion over a 20-year period to make it into a weapon. My father was on that project for a while. Couldn't happen, too volatile. Now, to prove that, about three guys were going to ridicule me about it. And I said, you want to prove that sodium is an explosive, just take some meat, dead meat, and sprinkle sodium on it at room temperature. Meat has to be room temperature. Let's see what happens. So, it's on YouTube. You go to frog legs, salt, YouTube. Put those in a search engine. And you'll come up with a video that shows these three guys, where you only see two of their hands manipulating it. 

They take frog legs that have been dead for a day or two. And they've thawed out. They weren't frozen to begin with. But they now are at room temperature. And they take salt, and they sprinkle the salt on both sides of the frog legs. On one side, you see them starting to jump and twitch. Flip them over, and there's salt all over. It's not heavy salt. They're sprinkling the salt over like somebody would sprinkle salt on their food. And these frog legs, there's no body, they're just frog legs, spasm for 32 minutes. They show for only two and a half to three minutes. But it goes on for 32 minutes. That shows you that it's explosive. So they said, well, pepper is an irritant. What happens if we put pepper on it? They said, pepper's not explosive. Only if the creature's alive, you put, you know, under raw flesh, you put, you know, these skinned frog legs. They don't have the skin on them. This is the tissue exposed. You put the pepper on there, and they're not going to react. So they take a bunch of it. They take another frog leg, put a bunch of pepper on it. And I mean, they're putting five times more pepper than they put salt on. And it has one twitch, and that's it. The thing is not alive. And pepper would have to react, the body would have to react if it were alive to the pepper. Sodium is an explosive. It doesn't require anything to be alive. It required the moisture with the tissue, and it started exploding. Because the tissue, the fluids of the leg at room temperature will cause the sodium to separate from the iodide or potassium. And then it starts exploding, so you watch it. Now these guys did it to prove me wrong. But boy, they won't take it down now, because now they know sodium is explosive. When it goes into your blood, and your body separates the sodium from the iodide or potassium, what happens? It fires in the blood, and you've got the smorgasbord of nutrients that every cell eats. You can have 93 to 117 nutrients. All the enzymes, the vitamins of all sorts, all the B's, the D's, the A's, everything, all in one smorgasbord. And when a cell eats, it eats it all. Because it's all in a clump together, a cluster, a natural cluster, with ions keeping it all together. 

Once you cook it, cook anything, those ions don't keep anything together. So you're spreading your nutrients all over, and cells never get everything they want. But even if you're raw, those clusters will explode with the sodium. Your cells are only going to get 23, 50 nutrients, instead of their normal 93 to 117. Salt is not a good substance, period, any form, to eat. Now one more thing, I'm going to give you my sport formula. The sport formula is a quart. And the reason I call it a sport formula is because when I give it to my athletes, they need very little of it. And the other competitors are consuming massive amounts of water, and they're getting weakened by the water. And you can see it. You can see tennis players going for five hours, going round after round, and the more water they drink, the weaker they get. Of course they'll drink a little water, they'll have a little spurt of energy, and then they start getting more tired, they can use less oxygen, it's a rat race. With this particular formula, they only need to consume a quart in four or five hours of exercise. The number two, I mean the two number one high school champions of 2009 were two sick kids on the diet. When they came to me at eight, nine years old, Walker Kieran and Valerie Mysick, the number one high school champions of 2009, both happened to be my patients on the diet since they were eight, nine years old. They drank that substance and were just outdoing their opponents like crazy just by drinking that drink. Walker Kieran was sick with asthma. He was an asthmatic little kid. I had him talking before the board of supervisors. He says, you have to pass our raw milk bill because if I don't have my raw milk, I can't breathe. And then you see him from, that was 2001, 2000 to 2009 and he's winning the tennis championship. You can't believe it's the same guy and it's the same person just because he'd been doing the diet. No longer sick and enchanted.

So the sport formula, the thing that's good to hydrate the body properly. Remember, all foods are high in natural water. Even meat is 55-70% water. Milk is 86-90% water. Fruits are 90-92% water. Everything's full of water. Once you cook it, you separate the ion bond with the water. So now the water doesn't go with your nutrients properly to the body. You have to reconstitute. And the more water you drink, what happens? The drier you get, the more water you want. I consume about, in the summertime when it's hot and I can't get all the milk that I want, and I don't drink sport drink, I may drink a half a cup of water a day. Otherwise, I only drink a half a cup of water a month. And that's it. I suggest that all of you drink from a half to three quarters of a cup a day, unless you're somebody who does a lot of workout. You can do up to a cup a day, but no more. And space it out. Only a sip at a time. Only because you still need a solvent to dissolve compounds in your body that can't be dissolved without the help of pure water. Like I said, the body makes a virus, a solvent, mixes it with pure water, and it becomes even more reactive. So you need a little bit. I don't need so much anymore. But, you know, a cup is about maximum. A cup and a half from somebody who's, you know, a marathon runner. But they can drink as many of these sport formulas and as much milk as they like. So, a sport formula is a quart. Three cups of that is a combination of at least two of these four items. So, you have to have at least two of these four things in it. You can have all four, or even three of the four, but at least two. Tomato, cucumber, watermelon, and whey. Now, the cucumber, the tomato, and watermelon have to be pureed. They are not juiced. So, you peel the cucumber, and you peel the watermelon. You want to use the rind of the watermelon, and you deseed the watermelon. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The rind. The rind is white or pink, or, you know, you peel the green off. It's like you do with the cucumber, you peel the green. You slice it or dice it, put it in a jar. Now, you have a cup of other ingredients. The first cup is one tablespoon of raw apple cider vinegar, two tablespoons of lime juice, two teaspoons of lemon juice, two tablespoons of coconut cream, two tablespoons of dairy cream, you can grate a little ginger in it if you want that taste once in a while, just enough to flavor, and eggs to fill it up to the core, it could be two to three eggs depending on the size of eggs. You blend that all together, so it will be very pulpy. Now the important thing about those three things, let's say you have three quarters cup of each of those four things, that will make your three cups. Then what the tomato does is it provides the nutrients for the body to keep itself acidic, and all the alternatives say we need to be alkaline, we need to be alkaline. Everybody who over-alkalinizes does not digest their foods properly. We need to be acidic. Saliva, urine, fecal matter, and blood stream, all should be around 5.5 to 5.7. I've been 5.5 for 30 years. I told Dr. Travis that on the doctor show. He called me a liar. Nobody can live, you can't live on 5.5. I showed him my blood report. 

Q: [unintelligible]

If your blood is 5.5 acidity, pH balance is 5.5. They believe it needs to be 6.2 or 6.1, something like that. All of them, I said all of them the same, 5.5. 5.5 to 5.7. So the tomato can provide good nutrients for digestion, it helps dissolve dead cells for detoxification, it is an anti-cancer property as long as the tomato is raw. The cucumber helps replace collagen under the skin. Watermelon is the best food to create perspiration, also has collagen to replace collagen under the skin, collagen precursors. The watermelon also has citrulline that is like a natural Viagra if you have libido problems, especially the rind. And the whey, I talked about that earlier, whey is full of lactic acid and helps remove the lactic acid from metabolism out of the muscles so you don't cramp.

Q: Whey, I didn't hear you say.

A: Whey was one of the four, tomato, cucumber, watermelon, and whey.

Q: So when I make the cheese, the water that is a little bit yellow, that's whey.

A: Whey, not dry whey, liquid whey, not the garbage they sell in health food stores. Fresh, raw whey.

Q: And how do you make it, you make it yourself?

A: Just blend it, yeah, you make it yourself and blend it, just use a blender.

Q: You make juice out of a lettuce and a cucumber or you make a puree?

A: You're not using lettuce.

Q: How did you say lettuce?

A: Cucumber, I didn't say lettuce, I said cucumber, tomato, watermelon and whey.

Q: I heard you say lettuce.

Q: Vinegar?

A: That's vinegar, it's in the other cup. But you're putting them all together, blending them all together. And then you shake it each time and sip it because the pulp's going to come to the top and more of the liquid will be at the bottom, so you shake it every time you take a sip. And don't drink more than an ounce and a half at a time, all day long. Just take a sip here, a sip there. Milk, you know, with milk or after milk. Cheese, a sip of sport drink. Cheese, sip of milk. Cheese, sip of sport drink. Cheese, sip of milk. Cheese, sip of milk. Cheese, sip of sport drink. All day long, just to hydrate yourself. If you don't drink a lot of fluids at one time, the water won't rush to your kidney. When you chug any kind of liquid, most of the water is going to go to the kidney and not be carried with nutrients to the cells. So you're going to dehydrate yourself. So always sip. When you gulp a fluid, the water separates and goes to the kidneys because it's too much water at one time. And then your body won't have the H2O to take with the nutrients to the cells. And then the cells will dehydrate. 

Q: Would it work without the coconut cream?

A: Pardon?

Q: Would it work without the impossible, unattainable coconut cream?

A: Well, you can. There are new sources for it. Email me and I'll give you the new sources. You have one spoon of vinegar, two tablespoons of lime juice, two teaspoons of lemon juice, two tablespoons of coconut cream, two tablespoons of berry cream, and you can add a little bit of ginger in there for flavor if you like. It will help stimulate circulation and digestion. And then eggs to top it off, two to three eggs to bring it up to your quart. When done all together, we'll sip on it all throughout the day. If you're taking the hot tub, hot baths, sip like a half a cup of that before you get in, a whole cup while you're in there, and then a half cup when you get out and go hiking. Now taking those hot baths in a bathtub when you don't have a hot tub, to keep the hot water hot is difficult. What I do in a bathtub like I'm in a hotel, I'll put scalding hot water in, fill it halfway, let it sit for 10 minutes and heat the whole bathtub lining. Then I'll put lukewarm water in to bring it up to the level of the water before I get into it. And you know I take a washcloth and wrap it around that end so the water doesn't drain down inside. So I can keep the level higher in the bathtub. And then I put my milk and my vinegar and my sea salt or epsom salt in the water. I'll let that sit for 7 minutes. Then it's down to about 110 degrees. I get in. Then by 20 minutes it's down to about 102. Then it's too cold. Then I will let about 2 inches of the water out. And then that 2 inches, when I get down to an inch, I will turn on the hot water. Of course it's going to come out cold at first. So I funnel the cold water down the spout, down the drain. And then when it gets hot, I release it. By that time the last inch is out. Plug up the drain again. And then let that run, scalding water run. And then swirl it around until that temperature is up to about 110 again. And then I stay there for 20 more minutes. You have to do that every 20 minutes. You don't have to add more ingredients. But you have to add hot water every 20 minutes. If you have a hot tub, it is constant. You have a 105 degree temperature straight. Best thing to do. Straight, 105 degrees. 

Q: What do you use to measure the temperature?

A: I use a swimming pool temperature... You can use a thermometer for, you know, checking your temperature. You can use anything that keeps accurate, you know, temperatures. If you don't have a hot tub and you don't want to do all that, I'm right now inventing a combination of a sand filter with a pump, a small large aquarium type pump, and then a heater, an instant heater, all in one unit with a tub. Hose going from the tub through the filter, the pump and the heater, back into the tub. So even in a bathtub you can do it for under $1,000. A hot tub is going to cost you about $6,000 to get a good one. But it's worth it. It's worth the investment. But I probably won't have that ready, you know, for two months. You know, my version of it. So you just may have to, you know, let the water in and out every 20 minutes to be satisfied. Is that sun too hot for you? Okay, that's it. Questions and answers. You've written a lot there, young man.

Q: Well, you said a lot.

A: More than you could write.

Q: So you've got to take a quote. Or get the book.

A: No, the workshop tapes. CDs, DVDs.

Q: And that's just what, it's just basically what you're doing here on the CD, right?

A: DVD. On the DVD.

Q: So that's the quote on the DVD.

A: No, this workshop on the DVD, it's not everything that's in there, but most of it.

Q: This is a workshop.

A: We have to pay attention here? Okay.

Q: Okay, I have a couple of questions. Do you have mucus in the stool? You were saying mucus is good because it carries things out of the body, right?

A: And protects your mucous membranes. If you don't have mucus lining your intestinal tract, your throat, your eyes, you're going to be all dry and dead.

Q: But to have it visibly coming out, you're saying?

A: Your body throws off toxins through the mucus.

Q: So that's a sign that your body is throwing off toxins. Okay, all right. And then another one I have, you were saying about supplements and kerosene? How about herbal supplements?

A: Herbal supplements, they have to be heated and treated. They're cooked and then they're pressed.

Q: So they're not rinsed with kerosene.

A: Cooked, pressed and ground.

Q: So they're not cooked with kerosene, but you're still toxic.

A: Depends upon who's making them.

Q: Okay, but they're not all cooked.

A: Let somebody else have a question and answer here. Go ahead.

Q: What do you think about mushrooms?

A: Mushrooms are good. They help with digestion of proteins.

Q: What's the best way to get mushrooms?

A: Well, just those that you get in a store. I mean, if you want to grow your own, that's fine. That's great.

Q: If a person got poisoned, if you've gotten poisoned in the past, ingested something that might be a poison, you got poisoned at that moment, we talked about it already, but just specifically real quick, what's the best way to detox, to get that poison counteracted, and also if you've been poisoned in the past, is there something you can do?

A: It depends upon the poison. Like the poisons I got, I needed a lot of ammonia, and there are different poisons that you can get. Like I said, if, let's say, a venomous animal bit you, you could vomit and take your hydrochloric acid and put it on the area. Hydrochloric acid neutralizes any venom, whether it's from a frog, or a snake, or a scorpion, a tarantula, no matter what.

Q: Can you take a pill of hydrochloric acid?

A: Yeah, a pill will not work as well as your own hydrochloric acid. Remember, hydrochloric acid, instead of a pill, is not natural. Hydrochloric acid is a chemical.

Q: How do you get it without the pill?

A: You vomit.

Q: Oh, I don't know how to vomit. I've tried it.

A: Oh, stick your finger down your... eat something and stick your...

Q: That's the only way you can get it.

A: Well, yeah, that's the only way. You can stick a tube down and pump it out.

Q: So if you take several capsules of that pill...

A: Yeah, that would help. So it just depends upon the poison.

Q: But let's see, a general idea. I mean, I... because you may have...

A: I've just given you examples, you know, so... Um, you know, if you take it...

Q: It's ingested. That's ingested.

A: What? Give me an example.

Q: I don't... I don't know. I don't know what the injection... There's a reason why I can't get an answer. So I'm saying, is there like a general thing that you might ingest? Milk, obviously some milk, anything like that?

A: Milk will help any time. Because it draws poison to the stomach. Like I said in the book, American Indians, if they had a lactating animal around, and they got bitten by, let's say, a rattlesnake, then they would drink the milk, and it would draw the poison to the stomach, and then the hydrochloric acid in the stomach would neutralize the venom. 

Q: If you were poisoned, if you received some kind of poison toxin, does it stay in the system, or does it eventually just get flushed out even naturally, even if it's alone...

A: Well, the body's going to do the best it can with the nutrients it has. If you're eating a good diet, your body's going to work very hard to get rid of it.

Q: What do you think of colloidal silver?

A: Colloidal silver is highly toxic. We don't eat, we do not eat rock, plant-eating rock. Colloidal silver is minerals, mainly metals. Colloidal silver, think of that. It's a toxic, it's a poison. High in minerals, high in metal, metallic minerals. 

Q: How can we repair the adrenals when the person has adrenals?

A: Adrenals? Just eat meat, put hot water bottles back here at night. Milk, beef, hot water bottles.

Q: How to activate the growth hormone?

A: You don't need hormones for that, you just need lots of fat with your meat. I have many guys who are as thin as you, and within a year they were as big as him. Not quite as big as him, but big. I had one guy that was 61 years old when he went on the diet, he had been skinny as you are his whole life, he never put on the weight, and every time he started to, he'd get sick. All the protein powders and all the garbage things in the diet, to eat, to gain that weight. And after a year and a half on the diet, he called and he said, hey, can I body build on this diet? I said, sure. He's about 6'1. And I said, eat a pound of meat twice daily, with one of the lubrication formulas. The lubrication formula is in the recipe book of page 146. It's called moisturizing lubrication formula. It's called moisturizing lubrication formula because women love moisturizing and men love lubing. So that's why I call it two names. It'll be very appealing. It's highest in butter. It's a mixture of butter, egg, lemon, and honey. Tastes like lemon meringue drink. So you have a whole lot of those and one pound of meat. So he did that. And in one year, he had, well, in six months, he had gained four inches on his arms and six inches on his chest. And this is the guy that could never gain weight his whole life. You just have to eat the butter, and you have to get butter to do it quickly. Butter with meat. That's what it takes. But he worked out to build up that big.

Q: Because when I take the meal, I lose appetite.

A: Yeah.

Q: That's the problem.

A: But you see, you cannot eat for appetite. You have to eat all the time. Like I said in the book, if you want to gain weight, you have to eat until you're one bite away from vomiting.

Q: But that is good.

A: Yes, you eat and eat and eat until you can't eat.

Q: What if you want to lose weight?

A: Pardon?

Q: What if you want to lose weight?

A: Well, like I said, the body needs lots of fat to bind with the poisons. Once you lose the weight, you're going to be susceptible to terrible detoxification. You're going to have symptoms, you're going to be overly emotional, and you're going to have a lot more aches and pains when you detoxify. Fats bind with the poisons, fats dissolve the poisons. The body gets rid of everything with fats. So you need the fat. If you don't, you're going to be vulnerable to the toxins. They will damage your nervous system, your cells. So I like everybody, like I said in my book, women to be at least 15 pounds overweight. At least. I was, you know, I was as big as him, but mine was more fat than muscle. He has a little bit more muscle than I had. And I was that big when I first got into this diet. I drank a quart of cream a day with a quart of carrot juice, you know. And I mixed them. Boy, it was so heavy. And boy, it was, oh, for sometimes hours. But I wouldn't drink it all at one time. I'd space it, but still it would be heavy all the time. But I forced myself to do it to have all this weight. And I was able to clean out a lot of stuff quickly without a lot of symptoms. The only symptom I had to deal with was nausea because I always forced myself to overeat. But it works. Everybody who does it, it works. Unless you eat too much at one time. Always eat until you get nauseous. Don't eat until you vomit, but close.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, that's because they're homogenizing fats. They're putting fats through thin sieves and at high pressures, and that homogenizes the fats. Homogenized fats are terrible fats. They're very costly. They have a tendency to erode and putrefy. They have a tendency to putrefy. Raw fats never putrefy. They will oxidize and utilize as fuel and cleansers, but they never putrefy.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No. No. The thing is that I'm 18.5% body fat. Probably now from this weekend, the week of eating lots of extra cream, I'm probably 19.5% body fat. Do I look it? No. Most people who are my size and my weight, they're about 11-12% body fat. That's because I've been eating raw fats since 1972. No cooked fats. So all the fat molecules when they're raw are very small. When you cook them, they swell from 5 to 50 times their normal size. Take pork rind. You've got a thin, you know, it's like bacon. And then you fry it and it swells this big. That's your fat cells blowing up. I'm condensed with fat, but don't look fat. I have lots of fat. I'm 18-19% body fat. Which you won't look at when you're all full of raw fat. 

Q: Considering, you know, the environment, the toxicity, the pollution, what do you think are the safest, the healthiest places in the world to live in?

A: Everywhere was obscured. That's usually islands. In Thailand, they're chemically spraying chemtrails. They're using pesticides everywhere. The place I found in the Philippines is on a remote island. It's only 2% populated. It's Palawan. It's the island away from all the main islands. There are 52 volcanoes in Philippines. That's called the Ring of Fire. You know, typhoons, hurricanes. Well, hurricanes are typhoons. aAnd earthquakes, all kinds of disasters happen throughout the Philippines. But that one island, there are no volcanoes anywhere near and no typhoons. It's 200 miles from the Vietnam border. So that's the ocean that's across. That island is the least, but there are 7,107 islands in the Philippines. 90% of them are uninhabited. If you want to go somewhere that's clean, that's where to go. That island, I'm on... Pardon?

Q: How do you get meat and dairy there?

A: Well, you have your own animals. I have my own animals. I have coconuts, I have lots of them. I have cashews, I have all that, but they're not for me. They're already growing on the land by the natives, the tribespeople. I bought this from the tribespeople.

Q: You live there?

A: Yeah, I have my place there.

Q: Oh, I didn't know that. Okay.

A: Thailand and Philippines. And then I have goats and chickens in the Philippines, and cows and chickens in Thailand. So I have my food. That's all you need. Goats breed fast, you know. You can't eat enough of them, one person. So let's say you have 40 goats. There's no way that a whole family could eat all of your goats. You're going to have to be selling them, if you're eating goat's meat. And dairy, you know, if you're milking the goats, that's plenty for a family. You know, just three goats, milking three goats gives you enough milk for a family. So there's plenty of food. You just have to have your animals. And getting to my land in the Philippines, I'm on the other side of the island where there's only tribes, little villages. The biggest village is 100 people. And all the others are 25, 50 people to a village. And there's no paved roads. So I have an FJ Cruiser four-wheel drive with a lift, because I have to go through three rivers to get to my land. And if you don't have a four-wheel drive with a lift, you'll end up in the ocean. Which almost happened when I went to look at the land. We were in a four-wheel drive van that had lifts. But the four-wheel drive went out. And we were moving out to the ocean from the river through until a big, huge boulder stopped the van. So we could have been drowned because we didn't get out of the van until it stopped. So I have a car that's fit for that. It's an excellent, made for off-road driving. And it's a good farm vehicle at the same time. Now my land is 600 meters up, starts at 600 meters, a little over 600, and goes to 900. It's a kilometer long, so 108 acres. No roads. This is a jungle up in here. So I had to build a road. It took five months for them to build a road up to the land, up to the timber road, the logging road.

Q: Do you think Switzerland is good, high in the mountains in Switzerland?

A: Well, they do the chemtrailing there, too. They do it all over the world, even in Thailand. These are poisons sprayed by military planes. What's that company? Boeing planes are doing it for the military, spraying aluminum, barium, and other contaminants all day long. You see those streaks in the ceiling that become these dispersed thin clouds? Those are chemtrails.

Q: So to keep us safe.

A: They say it's to control weather. Pardon? Everywhere, absolutely.

Q: In the backyard, you can see the antennae.

A: It's crazy.

Q: All the time here. All the time. All the time.

Q: In Phoenix and Arizona, it's so flat. I mean, it's, yeah, crisscrosses and stays longer.

A: Everywhere.

Q: And these chemtrails, I've seen them myself. But which airplanes are doing this?

Q: Commercial.

Q: Commercial airplanes?

A: Yeah. No.

Q: Because I see them when I'm in the backyard. I see, well, I can't tell from the distance, but you can see that.

A: You get a telescope, you'll see that there. See you tomorrow. Bye.

Q: So that's what we have to eat.

A: Do you have a sister in San Diego? Yeah, I've got a sister, I've got a woman who's a patient who almost looks exactly like you. Her name is Barbara.

Q: So there's nowhere they don't do chemtrails?

A: They do them everywhere. In every country I've been in. The only place that I haven't seen them do it is that island I live on in the Philippines. They do it in Mindanao, they do it in Kizon, Lizon, all the other islands, the big islands in the Philippines, but not the one I'm on. It's just not populated enough. Not worth the fuel.

Q: Here's an interesting question. I'm going to deliver it with this preface first. I'm trying to find out about parasites in general, but as I thought about that question, I started thinking about bacteria as well. If there's a carcass on the floor, the vultures will come down and they'll start feeding. Great. But they were already existing, and then they came down to feed. So where does bacteria come from? And then I'm going to talk about fungus and parasites, but specifically, where does bacteria come from? Are they living somewhere else and then they come down? Or do they spontaneously exist?

A: You are 99.5% bacteria. Bacteria is like atoms.

Q: You know what? That's true. You got me with that one. It's already existing, so they're already there. What about parasites?

A: Parasites are a natural part of your cells. If you need one, you'll generate a parasite. Whether it's malaria to clean out the red blood cells, or it's, let's say, a tapeworm to clean out the intestines that eats too much sugar.

Q: So we already have this inside of us?

A: It's already part of us.

Q: Pardon?

A: It's already part of us.

Q: These things are already living inside of us, or do we need them now?

A: Just like the vultures and crows are living on our planet.

Q: So it's part of the healing system.

Q: So in other words, all of this stuff is already living inside of us. So that's why you say also there's no contagiousness, because everything is already inside of us.

A: That's right. And you don't get somebody else's, you get your own.

Q: That is good.

Q: Yeah, that is good, but I can think of some times in the past, I'm with a woman, she's got a cold, I'm doing healthy, I catch a cold right after her.

A: Same season, probably eating nearly the same thing.

Q: The coincidence is happening, let's say, if you get in touch with somebody, but all right, that's right. And that's the part that I just, you know, all this other stuff...

A: Take a look at the opposite of that. We got a family of seven people, three get the flu, one after each other, and the other four don't.

Q: Right, because the immune system is strong enough, it didn't...

A: That's bullshit, there's no immune system.

Q: There's no immune system?

A: There's no immune, that's again, that little spacey, mysterious thing that the pharmaceutical companies come up with to help confuse you about...

Q: In other words, the whole body, the whole system is, quote-unquote, that immune system that they're working on.

A: There's no immune system.

Q: Quote-unquote.

A: You got a body that completely functions in the homeostasis, and then it has a cleaning system built within it, and that's the lymphatic system. That is all there is.

Q: Right, exactly.

A: The immune system, oh, it's a hormone here, or it's a little chemical here, and they come up with all these little mysterious things. 

Q: The blood system, that has the white blood cells and cleaning things out. Then you have the lymphatic, totally different, but that's also included as the immune system.

A: But it's not the immune system.

Q: Right.

A: The system isn't saying, I have to protect myself. It's saying, I have to clean myself from waste. I eat, I have waste, I have metabolized, I have waste. We need to clean. So it's not about immunity.

Q: If that's a filter, the liver does the bile, but then also it can double as the filter.

A: If you're unhealthy, you're eating garbage.

Q: Right, so it's doing something else that it can do. And that's the quote-unquote, that's the system. The immune system, the body is healing itself, but they're going to say it exists as the immune system.

A: Yeah, and there's no immune system. It's just a cleansing system.

Q: This is the first time I've ever talked to you, my friend. I don't know anything about you. I just heard five minutes of the things, but all this other stuff, I've been exposed to. But this is, I mean, it's crazy. You see, you want to be healthy. You make sure that, obviously, I've not been doing this in my life. You know, when you eat, you're supposed to make sure that you're not full. You know, I don't say that. I say, no, you got to eat until you're like, well, you know.

A: No, but you've got the weight. You don't have to. These people who want to gain weight need to do that.

Q: Right, and other things that people say, you'll never do that. You know, drink water also. But I can understand about that. I use that word again. The paradigm shift. It's like, it's totally the opposite. You know, so I can understand that. But there's this thing about this contagious stuff. That's why I kept on it. You know, I've experienced it myself. I went to a seminar a couple of months ago. The guy was excellent. And it's this idea. What about the good and bad bacteria? There's no bad bacteria. So this idea, well, you've got to get a handle on that. Because you're so used to getting something else.

A: It's like there's good, bad, good, bad cholesterol. No, there isn't. There's cholesterol that's going to build you. And cholesterol that needs to take the body apart if it is weak. And there's a system that's toxic. And then there's the throw-off, the waste. So the two that fall into the bad cholesterol are not bad cholesterol. It's a waste and a cleansing. 

Q: Right. And you're familiar with Dean Morton's, right? Somebody got bronchitis? I'm happy you got bronchitis. What? Because that's your system cleansing itself.

A: Exactly.

Q: I heard this in 2001. What? What a revolutionary idea. That changed my world.

Q: Just like this whole thing about bacteria, if I could add to that. Over seven years ago, I stopped using antibacterial soap. I found out about you maybe three years ago. And then watching Discovery Channel or one of the planet channels, they talked about bacteria and how each human has more bacteria cells than there are humans on the planet. And then I thought to myself, well, why do we have antibacterial soap? Isn't that anti-human soap?

A: Exactly.

Q: So I was like, oh, great. I'm glad I stopped using it seven years ago.

Q: And what's the ratio again of human cells to bacteria?

A: 150 bacterial genes to every one human gene. So we are made up of bacteria. We're 99.5% bacteria. We are bacteria, just like we are atoms. We are bacteria.

Q: With the farm. To have a cow, cows are big animals, difficult to handle. What is the idea of an animal to have milk, cheese, meat, and can be easily handled by a short family? 

A: Well, I still think cows are. Cows are mellow. Goats eat a tremendous amount. I mean, I have 108 acres, and 12 goats will go through 10 acres in a month. 

Q: And sheep?

A: Sheep are okay. They'll still eat a lot, but they're not like... Sheep are very good, and they're good milkers. Great lanolin. That's good. Better than goats, for sure. And if you're thin, you don't want to drink goats milk, because you have adrenal precursors in it.

Q: It's the only milk I have.

A: You'll stay too thin, and you'll stay hyperactive.

Q: Are they actually drinking cows milk instead?

A: It relaxes the body more, and everything's more soothing.

Q: That's new for me.

Q: When you say it relaxes the body, are you talking about mood, energy, or...

A: Everything. You ever seen a calm goat?

Q: I haven't seen many goats in...

A: They bark, they'll rip a tree apart, they'll kill a tree by eating it. They'll eat nails, they'll eat anything. They eat everything and anything. You can never fill them. That's what I'm saying. I've got them on my land, and I have to get rid of them. On 108 acres, and I've got 12 goats, and they just rip to pieces. I can't have any other animals. I do have a horse in Thailand.

Q: So the worst thing that was ever invented was antibiotics?

A: Yeah.

Q: Is there any time that antibiotics can be applied helpfully?

A: I don't think so.

Q: What about if someone's got this pneumonia, and they can die, and it's an emergency?

A: It's garbage. All they do is don't lie down. When you're going through a lung detoxification, the lungs are weak. If you lie down, you have gravity pushing on your lungs. That way you won't breathe. So a lot of people at night, when the lung nerves detoxify, the lungs won't work at all, and if you're lying down, all of a sudden you think you can't breathe, and you panic and go to the hospital. I had a woman who had AIDS, and had been through pneumonia twice, twice in the two weeks before she came here. And I said, listen, you're going to go through pneumonia many times, because you took all the penicillin, all the antibiotics. You're going to have to go through it again and again. Next time you go through it, do not lie down. You sleep sitting up like this. The gravity keeps the lungs open. Works with you. You will never run out of breath. Five days later, after she saw me, she went into the worst pneumonia she ever had. She sat and she was through it in three days. No problem. You just have to know what to do. The people where I went to get my land in the Philippines, to get over there was no paved roads, and there's only a jeepney that goes over there once a day, back and forth, one a day. All these people can't transport themselves. It's hard. So I set this up, meeting up to see the property two weeks in advance. I get out there and the assistant to the chief, the chief's right hand man, whatever you want to call him, said, listen, I can't spend a lot of time with you today. I have two daughters that have malaria, and I have to take them to the hospital. So that was interpreted to me in two languages, English to Tagalog to the native language. And I went back, that was interpreted to me, and I said, 76% of people die if they go to the hospital for malaria, in the hospital. That was interpreted to him, and his answer was, you may be right. Five years ago, I had two daughters that got malaria. I took them to the hospital. They were dead in 24 hours. He said, what do I do? And I said, well, take three ounces of lime juice, three ounces of degust, which is honey there, and then six ounces of buko, which is coconut water, mix it all together, and then give them two tablespoons an hour for three days, and then one tablespoon every two hours for three days. So he said, OK, I'm going to do it. He trusted me completely. The kids were well in three days. Just a three-day cycle. They were well in three days.

Q: It's like that song about the lime and the coconut. There might be something to it.

Q: Thank you.

A: You're welcome.

Q: And drink it all up.

Q: Have you ever thought about writing a book of all your cases, all your successes? It would be fascinating to read about them.

A: Yeah, but it's a matter of finding time to do all that.

Q: Is there a book on how to have a farm? Because I was living in the city always.

A: There are so many books out there now.

Q: But the good ones.

A: Yeah, well, there are good ones. You can go for any of the biodynamic farming.

Q: OK, good. Thanks.

Q: He was asking me, there's a machine that's used to separate the cream from the milk. What is that called?

A: Just a separator, cream separator.

Q: Cream separator. Desnatador in Spanish. I have to make my own butter in Venezuela. Impossible to get it from any farmer.

A: Well, there are different ones. You can buy the churning type, which are metal. I like the wood churners, the old wood churners.

Q: A particular brand that you can recommend?

A: I go to the Amish and Amish make them.

Q: Amish?

Q: Pennsylvania.

A: Well they have Amish all over.

Q: Amish what?

A: Amish Farmers.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I have 6 gallons. From my reserve. In each place. In each home. 6 gallons. Absolutely. One of the best things you can save. I have meat that I put in olive oil. Take strips of meat. I dry it out a little bit. Like an hour on each side.

Q: In the sun?

A: No, in the house. You can do it in the sun. But there's so much to do so fast. I'm one person. So I do it by myself. So I have these, you know, like inch and a half cuts. Inch, inch and a half strips of meat. That are, you know, somewhere around 2 and a half inches wide. And I put those in half gallon glass canning jars. And I'll stuff them in. Of course I pour about half a cup of olive oil first in there. And stuff them in. And of course the olive oil rises and rises with the meat. And seals the meat off. And then when I get up to the top I'll put more in. And stuff them in until it's completely full. And then put the lid on it. And I did that, first time I did that was in 1999. Getting ready for, you know, the 2000.

Q: Y2K. 

A: Y2K. Now I was a programmer, an autistic man. I knew there was bullshit. That there was going to be a problem. Computer wise. There would be some glitches. Because of the, you know, the clocks and the calendars. But it wasn't going to create a disaster. That was a, you know, it was a, who was that? Perot? You know, and those guys set it up so they could milk the government. And, you know, a lot of money. To change their programs. But I just wanted to explore and experiment by taking advantage of that. So I, I made.

Q: Was that aged meat or fresh meat?

A: Fresh slaughtered meat.

Q: Fresh, not aged.

A: Fresh. And, well, it was aged for half an hour. Well, by the time I got it from Nevada City to Los Angeles. It was probably two days old. So, then when I put it, it was probably three days old by the time I got it into the jars. And I put a cap on those. I had ten of them. So after a year, I ate one of them. Perfect shape. No fermentation. Now some I did. I did some others in coconut oil. Coconut oil fermented. Nasty smell rolled up. It still was good. You know, just nasty tasting, nasty smell. But those in the olive oil stayed slightly acidic, you know, because some of the olive oil got in. But I ate one every year. And even to ten years, it was like I just put it in the olive oil in the jar. Ten years.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, you can't trust people who grow chickens. Chickens will eat everything. They're scavengers, but they're mainly vultures. Chickens are vultures. They eat rotten meat as their main diet. And they eat bugs and stuff like that. That's good. That's what they eat. But they're fed grains and processed waste. They eat the waste from processed foods. Cereals and all that. They eat contaminated garbage.

Q: So eat the meat, the red meat and the fish?

A: Yeah. Eat the red meat and fish. That's best.

Q: Anything that you prefer?

A: Grass-fed is always best. Not grass-finished. Grass-fed.

Q: And also, when you're talking about...

A: Or grazed.

Q: Like hair in the sun. Is there a... I like to go in the sun, right? And I don't put anything on, you know?

A: You should.

Q: I purposely did that. I never put sunblock. I used to put the no-sunblock. I just don't do anything for about a year now. Should I be concerned? Especially with the hair. It's for the head.

A: So the hair is protecting your head.

Q: Right, exactly. Let's say I'm out there. [unintelligible]

A: Well, they're going to have to put a hat on or put some mud up there.

Q: Okay.

A: Or they take their chances like I did. From chemotherapy, it never grew back.

Q: Right.

A: But, well, you know, if I'm out there too long, I'll put mud on there. In fact, if I'm out there too long and I'm getting too much sun in the tropics, and all the natives watch me, I pack mud all over myself. I look like an African who puts mud on themselves to keep from [unintelligible].

Q: Have you ever experimented with insects? Or insects as a source of food?

A: Yeah. In Thailand and all of Asia, they eat a lot of insects. They grow cockroaches this big. They eat scorpions. They eat bats. They eat all kinds of things. Tarantulas. I've eaten them when I've had to. They're not delicious to me. If I had been raised like they are with them, as a natural part of their diet, yeah, I'd probably be okay. I've got one Thai on the diet who goes around collecting jubugs, beetles, out of her garden all day long. And she puts them in a little, you know, like a pot bottle. And then she'll go around eating them all day long. You know, alive and crispy. Like that. That is normal for her, natural. I like my meat. I like my dairy. So, it's not a bad thing. It's a good thing. I see very many healthy people, tribes people, eating those bugs and insects and thriving very nicely. Not me. I do when I have to. I have nothing else. Now, if you're looking at an ear of corn, and I'll always choose an ear of corn with a worm in it. Those worms taste just like the corn. And they've predigested the corn. So I love those. I had a roommate who was from the jungles of Peru. And she taught me. Every time I go shopping, and she'd pick one with a worm in it, and down the worm went. I said, what does that taste like? She said, like corn. Just like the corn. I said, you're kidding. She said, no, it tastes exactly like you chewed the corn.

Q: Do the apple ones taste like apple?

A: Tastes like apple, yes.

Q: And you chewed the corn. You didn't swallow, you just chewed it.

A: Oh, I chewed it, yeah.

Q: You mentioned something about before, about don't gulp water, or don't gulp the other liquids. Can you say that again? What were you saying?

A: I said, if you gulp it, a lot of the H2O gets separated and goes to the kidney, and you get dumped from the body without being distributed through the body. Like so. So you pee a lot when you gulp. If you sip, you don't pee so much.

Q: [unintelligible] Drastic. Don't drink water. I've been drinking water like crazy for the past two years. Now it's coming up. Honestly, I'm going to have to re-evaluate this because...

A: No, the only way you're going to know, evaluation doesn't mean anything. You have to try it. You sip water when you take it. You sip lots of milk, 86 to 90% water.

Q: Does that make sense?

A: Your vegetable juices are 96% water.

Q: So what is the necessity of when a person... What is it necessary when a person then takes a little bit more water? When is that necessary when a person drinks more water as opposed to just getting it from the food?

A: Because you have toxins in there that need extra solvent reaction. 

Q: And then the animals are drinking the extra water, but I guess they don't drink that much. That's a good point about the solvent.

A: The only animals that drink a lot of water are birds because they eat a lot of dry food. A lot of cows that are eating dry food will drink a lot of water. The only two animals that are basically meant to drink a lot of water are the camel and the elephant. Camel has an extra sack and so does the elephant. Camel can drink 25 gallons of water at a time and not drink water for another 30 or 60 days. An elephant can drink 55 gallons of water and go three to four months without drinking water. 

Q: Because he's really just drinking at that time just to store it.

A: Yeah, they have a pouch to store it.

Q: That makes sense. That's why you keep saying water is a solvent. Exactly. So if that's the case, if you drink too much, then it's going to be over... That makes a lot of sense.

Q: I've been on this diet for a year and my desire for water, I don't really need it. Every once in a while. No, I don't feel thirsty.

Q: How safe is suet or how good is suet?

A: Suet is excellent.

Q: I cannot digest that. How can I take it?

A: Suet is the fat around kidneys.

Q: I stick it in my teeth and I cannot take it.

A: Well, what you need is to eat a little bit of pineapple with it.

Q: Pineapple? I never eat pineapple.

A: Take a little inch by inch square of pineapple and you have about, let's say, a quarter of a cup. You need about one inch cube of pineapple.

Q: How much is it? Because for me it's easier to get suet than butter.

A: But suet is harder to digest because it has ammonia in it to protect the kidneys.

Q: Ammonia? As well?

A: No, it's just that it's harder to digest.
