A: My name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz. I got into health because I had to. I suffered. I was born into a very violent household, a very sickly individual. I had a brother who was 18 months older than I. He was very jealous because I took mom's attention away as soon as I got home from the hospital. And he didn't like that, so he was going to make me suffer. And so he would do things like pinch me, you know, poke me, jab me, all these things. Usually when mom wasn't around, sometimes when mom was around, dad was never around. So he was either at work or down in the basement inventing something. So it was a very testing and challenging childhood. By the time I was 3 months old, my brother realized, because he had fallen on a rusty nail, that my mother would take me to the hospital or doctor, like she did him, and give him a tetanus shot. And the tetanus shot made him very sick. So he realized that if that happened to me, then my mother would take me and do the same thing. And sure enough, he pushed me on a rusty rake, and my mother, being a nurse, immediately took me to the doctor, and I had my first tetanus shot at 3 months old. Then at 6 months, he did it again, and at 18 months, he did it again. And at 18 months old, the mercury, the thallium, the ether, aluminum, all those good things, that they put in vaccines, went to my communication center, and I became autistic. I could not, for love, nor money, nor life, or anything, understand the written word as far as communication, nor spoken word. So it wasn't until I was about 8 years old until I heard sound patterns enough so I would repeat them. And of course, I repeated what I heard in my house. It was, shut up, sit down, you're an idiot, be quiet. So you take those things to school with you, and what happens? You get beat up a lot. So, and back in those days, I went to a parochial school, Catholic school, and back in those days, it was understood that to be godly, you had to be punished. And the nuns, I don't know anybody who was more violent than the nuns, except for my brother, and the priests. So I went through a lot of that, a lot of disciplinary problems, because I said things like, go to hell, sit down, shut up, to them, because they'd asked me to respond, they expected me to respond. And I just, you know, in my house it was, oh, shut up, sit down, go to hell, you know, stuff like that. Yeah, so I was saying those things, thinking it was funny and cute and okay. But it wasn't, so I got punished a lot. Of course, I got beat up a lot, too. So by the time I hit about the sixth grade, I realized that the only way I could save myself was pick the biggest guy in the school and beat the heck out of him the first week of my school, school year, each school year. And then everybody left me alone. I also learned by that time that it emulates some cool person that everybody thought was cool. And back in that time, it was James Dean, you know, so, you know, I'd look cool, stand around, you know, cool. And then people left me alone because I thought I was just some kind of tough, wise guy and not just autistic or not autistic at all.

I was never allowed to function as an autistic child because if I started my stares, my parents would slap me, my father would slap me on the back of the head, my mother would slap me on the back. And they would never say, stop that, you look like a crazy person. You know, my mother was a very educated individual, my father was an inventor and scientist, so they didn't want an idiot, you know, in the family. So they were not going to let me behave like one even though I was an idiot. It was a very difficult childhood. By the time I reached about nine years old, I was having colds and flus over the last three to five months a year. I would be bedridden for up to two, three months a year. And by the time I reached 12 years old, I had so much information that I'd sift through in my head, so that's why I hum and hum and hum, stuff like that. When I get into the technical stuff, I won't be thinking so much. Bear with me in my hums and ahs and stuff like that while I go through this. So when I hit 12 years old, I developed a case of peritonitis. It was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. They went in and found my appendix in good shape, took it out anyway. In the report it said, in case it causes trouble in the future, we're removing it. It's like, hello? And what I learned over the years is that an appendix is a library of anything that's been in the body. So if you've had any kind of a foreign substance, any bacteria, anything that's in the body, the body has a library of that compound and what to do about it. So your body can respond to a re-inundation or re-exposure within about 20 to 32 minutes. If you don't have an appendix, the body has to re-evaluate it and analyze it every time. So it can take 32, 36, even 40 some hours for your body to do that. And that compound could do some damage in that amount of time. People who don't have an appendix are at a great loss and a great risk of injury cellularly or holistically. So they treated me for appendicitis. They kept giving me lots of drugs, shots about every two to three hours. Sometimes they let four hours go by. It wasn't usual. And after four or five days of that I was bloated all over. I had black and blue marks and yellow marks all over my body. I was in severe pain. I couldn't lie anywhere without excruciating pain. I couldn't sleep more than probably 20 minutes, 30 minutes at a time. They would inject me while I was asleep because I wouldn't let them inject me while I was awake. So it came to the point where I just started knocking trays out of the hands of the nurses so they couldn't inject me. So after about 24 hours of getting no injections I was able to get out of the hospital. I was never the same. I was chronically fatigued and had fibromyalgia from probably the time that I had my second tetanus shot, which was about six months old. It was very difficult to get out of bed. When I was seven years old we moved from Oak Ridge, Tennessee to Cincinnati, Ohio, and then it got extremely cold. My father would turn off the heat at night completely, so the temperature in the house would get down to freezing or even below, around 30 degrees.

So I'd be aching in every joint, very sick, and I'd have to roll... They'd come and beat me out of the bed with a belt, and I would roll off onto the floor and get in front of the heater. As soon as it went on, I wouldn't get out. I don't care how many times I got belted. I would not get out of the bed until the heater kicked on. So I would lie in front of the vent and then heat my clothes so that they'd be warm. I'd put my clothes on, and I bundled in the house. I mean, it was like I was out in the snow. That's why I lived indoors. So it was very difficult. So after this 12-year-old incident in the hospital, it was worse. My chronic fatigue and fibromyalgia were extreme. To get through each day, I would sneak into the kitchen at night and take whatever coffee they had left, and I would put it in a jar, keep it under my bed, and take it to school with me. And I'd sip on coffee all day to give me some energy, because I was always falling asleep. I didn't sleep much at night. I was always afraid my brother was going to come and punch me in the stomach or something like that, or some boogeyman was going to come out from under the bed and get me, and I had all those kind of fears. I figured with what they say about what happens in the dark, if it could happen in my daily life in sunlight, what could happen at night? There could be really some danger. The Blob or something like that, all those awful B-movies were coming out in the 50s and 60s like that, showing all these awful things. The Creature of the Black Lagoon and all that stuff. Quite a bit of fears. Being healthy doesn't help you not have fears. Being unhealthy. Being healthy helps remove a lot of that stuff, and I was not. So then at 15 years old, 15 and a half, I received my third polio vaccine within 10 days, 14 days of that. I can't remember exactly, but it was within a two-week period. I got diabetes and angina pectoris. Angina pectoris are muscle spasms in and around the heart, so basically they're heart attacks. So I was having sometimes up to eight heart attacks a week, and after a few months they went down to one a week, one a month, and drifted like that. But I had 300 heart attacks by the time I was 22 years old, 18 and a half, 22 years old. About 50 of them caused me to black out. What you have to remember in a heart attack is that it's a charley horse in the heart, in and around the heart. If it happens around the heart, it's the same thing, the muscles cramp and don't let the heart pump. So what you have to do is relax. You fight a charley horse, it stays until you stop fighting it. And you generally massage it and rub it, breathe deeply, try to relax, try to ignore the pain or go into it, and it'll go away pretty quickly So a heart attack is the same thing, and I naturally went into that every time I had a heart attack, so I never died. So it's unlikely that you will die if you have a heart attack unless you panic and cramp and tense your whole body with the charley horse in and around the heart. It does not disappear.

So I also started getting much sicker at 15 1⁄2 with the diabetes. My whole diet changed overnight. I hated starches. I hated pastas. I hated pizza, anything with crust on it. I hated doodles, the worst. Macaroni and cheese, I could projectile vomit, it was pretty bad. And then all of a sudden, overnight, after this polio vaccine did its damage to me after about a two-week period, I craved it, went into school the next day, and ate two plates of pasta with four pieces of bread. And I hated rye bread, and that's what I wanted to eat. So it all changed overnight. I also stopped digesting anything. So I went from being a very fat, plump person they called fatty Arbuckle, to being a very skinny person. All happened with the getting thin, all happened within about a six-month period. Very challenging, everything was very challenging. I also found diet pills, you know, girls at school had diet pills. In the 60s it started. So I started stealing some diet pills to give me some energy along with a coffee. Also smoked a lot of cigarettes. Lucky Strike non-filter to give me a nicotine high. So I lived on all these things, and then I found I couldn't sleep at night, so I would raid the liquor, you know, the liquor cabinets, and steal liquor from stores and keep it under my bed and drink it. By the time I was about 17 years old, I was drinking three to four cups of alcohol a night to get me to sleep. I was consuming somewhere around three milligrams of Benzedrine, Speed, every day, two and a half packs of Lucky Strike non-filter. I averaged probably two packs. And 11 cups of coffee a day was all to keep me going and keep me going because I was chronically fatigued and fibromyalgia. Plus I took a lot of aspirin to help with the pain. So at 15 and a half, I met a girl at school. Remember, I was still autistic. The way I got through school was I picked the smartest, most sensitive girl in the class and I would sit near her and I copied her hieroglyphs off onto my paper. And a lot of times it wasn't completely legible. I mean a letter wasn't even a letter. But I couldn't even comprehend the word "the" at all. And I couldn't even spell it in comprehension until I was 22 years old. So that's the way I got through school. Math, I was an idiot savant about math. Give me a problem, I write the answer. How I got it, I don't know, I just know the answer. So I didn't have to put the method of how I got to it, the progression of analysis, to get to the answer. So they always accused me of cheating in math. The only place I didn't cheat. And, you know, they found, they put me in a room with the problems that, you know, they just came up with like that and I had the answers. So they never understood it, they never understood my autism, but at least they understood that there was something special about me. So they thought because of that, that I was being a wise guy about language and everything else. So it was pretty, they were pretty brutal. So the second year, I mean my first year in high school, was with Franciscan priests, and those guys are really mean. They swear you never heard, sound like a bar room with a bunch of thugs, you know, rednecks rather than, you know, priests. And I had only been subjected to Jesuit priests up until then.

And these priests were, you know, pretty violent. They would hit with their fists. The dean had about six to nine, I forget how many, paddles, canoe paddles. Some with holes drilled in them, some with grooves in them. And you get to choose your paddle when you got hit. And they would put the person's head, you know, the subject's head, the student's head, about six inches away from the doorknob. And Father Ant and I and the dean had a very small room. And he was 6'1 plus. So he was a big guy. And he would really swing hard. And if your head hit that doorknob, you got an extra hit. If you cried, you got an extra hit. So sometimes people would walk out of there 20 minutes later, you know, and just bust out screaming and crying, you know. Spend the whole day doing that. So it was pretty violent because, you know, again, I was repeating the stuff that I got at home. You know, leave me alone, sit down, shut up, always in a jovial type of expression and manner. They didn't care. So they punished me. I got forty-five days of detention that year, my freshman year. I got two days of sanding crew. That's when you have to stay after school and sand the desks people have marked and written into with knives or whatever. And two weeks of shoveling coal on Saturdays. So that was when you were really, really bad. You had to come on Saturday and shovel coal into their heater, their incinerator system. So I was breathing in all that mercury and thallium from the coal. So I arrived, this was the first day of my sophomore year, and they kicked me out of school. They said, we told you not to return. I didn't know what all that meant. I got my schedule, so I showed up to school because I was directed to get on the bus. So I was very happy. My parents sent me to a public school, and they were very different there. They cared about the kids a lot more than I'd ever seen anybody care about. So they put me in classes where they thought I would do well. They spent time with me almost a whole day and just got a feel for me. It was very different. I still was unable to learn, except for gathering all this information, and all of a sudden one day it would all switch on and make sense. But at that time it didn't. I still had to continue cheating throughout school. And then I met a girl there at the end of my sophomore year who was a year advanced in grade than I, and was a little older. And we fell in love, and it was all sensual. It was psychic. We didn't have to talk. We'd just be together, and we'd always be smiling and happy together. Of course, she didn't have to live with me. I had watched enough movies, and I knew the lines that you tell a woman from whatever James Dean would say or Elvis Presley would say in a movie. Those sounds I would memorize. I didn't have an idea of what I was saying. Not the literal sense, but I usually knew it was a nice thing to say. So these are the things I said to her. We didn't talk much. And this was number two most intelligent girl in the school. Not the most beautiful, but definitely to me she was. 

So we got married when I was 16 years old and had a baby the first week of my senior year in high school. And we weren't living together because married students weren't allowed to attend that school. So we had to wait until Mary had graduated. So we started living together the summer after she graduated. I still had another year to go. But they weren't too hard on males that way. And she was six months pregnant at her graduation. She wore full sweaters. Let me tell you, she did exercises, sit-ups and everything to hide it. So a month after not doing the exercise, boom, just like that. Like a basketball, very quickly. So we started living together and she realized she was living with an idiot. Because we were together, you know, a lot. School wasn't on, I went to work, she didn't go to work. She was just carrying the baby. And, you know, she realized that there was something wrong with me. She still stayed pretty nice and pretty kind. And then after the baby was born, she had post-partum symptoms that were out of the world. So we just completely drifted apart. Divorced by the time I was 19 years old. I had an uncle who was matriculating for his doctorate in psychology to the UCLA in Los Angeles. So he thought maybe he could help me. So as soon as I get out there, he put me on an LSD experimental plan, help open my brain, you know. Gave me 720 micrograms and nothing happened. 720 micrograms. I was immune to it. So they weren't able to help there. I continued my drinking. I was also, like I said, an idiot savant before I went to California, after I graduated from high school with D's. My mother took me to a new school that had opened. It was a trade school for learning computer programming and wiring unit record equipment for programs. At that time, everything computer-wise was written on digital cards, key punch cards, key punched cards. And your program went through the machine first, through the computer first, and then your data came next and it would calculate it. So you had to wire these boards and write a program that would be put on these punch cards. I was very adept at it. My mother took me, they didn't have one test for comprehension, a language or anything. They were only interested in your math ability and your awareness of physics and logic. And mine was extremely high. So they found that I could write a program in an hour or two hours, it could take them a month to a year to write with no flaws. So they farmed me out. They realized what they had. The professors there, none of them were over 38 years old. So they were all pretty aware and intuitive at that time. So what they would do is they would put me with a company as a systems analyst and they always had somebody with me to write everything. I was not allowed to write anything, which is good, because I wouldn't write anything but figures and stuff like that that would be only understood by the person who was writing for me because we got a language. He understood my language because I couldn't comprehend any other language. I was making a lot of money as an idiot.

When I decided to move to California at my uncle's request, I really didn't know where that was. They showed it to me on a map. I still had the geometric kind of consciousness. I knew that where I was was cold and where I was going was warm. That's all I needed to know. I drove out there, followed maps. I could do that very well. So I got out to California. I was working. I transferred with Time DC trucking company, the third largest trucking company in the world, as a systems analyst. So I continued there. I went on with Carte Blanche Corporation as a systems analyst there. So I was making a lot of money as an idiot. I had a two-bedroom house in Beverly Hills and still doing 11 cups of coffee a day, two packs of non-filtered Lucky Strikes a day, and Benzedrine. It was very easy to get at a trucking company. It was all the drivers were taking it to stay awake on their long hauls. So I developed an ulcer by 20 years old and started vomiting blood. That's how I knew I had an ulcer. I started vomiting blood. And I was still drinking a lot of alcohol at night, up to a fifth of gin or bourbon a night to get to sleep. And then I started vomiting blood. And then I went to the doctor and they gave me Maalox. I consumed a lot of Maalox. All that does is absorb a lot of your hydrochloric acid so you don't digest anything, especially anything with protein in it. So that caused the tumor to develop next to the ulcer. So they said we have to go in and remove that. So they gave me a vagotomy pyloroplasty, which means they severed all the vagus nerves to my stomach so I would never again secrete hydrochloric acid. So they put me in the category of octogenarians, who don't secrete hydrochloric acid and don't digest anything. So you give them all liquid foods. And they're not allowed to eat anything raw, not even an apple, a banana, or anything unless it's been treated, heated, or cooked, or steamed. So that was the program I was put on. They took the duodenum, stretched it three times its normal size so it would hold the food up longer. For what? You've got no hydrochloric acid. Why would you want to hold it up there? At least you have hydrochloric acid dumping in the small intestines. But you can't expect logic and sense out of a doctor. They're not trained to have that. Doctors are trained by the pharmaceutical industry. They write all of the curricula and procedures for doctors to follow. And most of it's chemical. 90% of it is chemical. And Mercks manuals for doctors is about this thick. And of course, they want people to take drugs. So that's what it's all about. So after the surgery, I started developing a tumor at the incision. So the scar of the tumor got up to as much as 3 quarters of an inch high and up to an inch and a half wide. So they said we have to irradiate that to stop the tumor from growing. And this was all the way into my stomach. And even into the stomach where they had cut me into the stomach. The tumors were forming.

So they gave me 10 weeks of intense irradiation therapy. And imagine taking a malleable clump of clay and firing it even at cone 4. What does it do? It turns into a hard substance like rock. And you take it up to the highest, it'll be glass, depending upon the kind of clay. Well that's what they did to my spine from the radiation therapy. They cauterized my spine. So my movement was like this and excruciatingly painful. I wasn't relaxed from pain for probably another 6, 7 years. After that, where I had a certain amount of my day that was relieved from some pain. The radiation gave me blood and bone cancer. And we know radiation, what that does, they gave it to me anyway, because that's what you do to stop the tumor. So it was never about do no harm, it was what can we do to stop this symptom and to hell with any other symptom that follows. And that's the way the doctors approach anything these days. They totally are hypocrites with their oath, which is do no harm first. So after the blood and bone cancer, they decided to give me chemotherapy. And the chemotherapy, after having that, I was completely bald. After the radiation therapy, all of my bone around my teeth dissolved. So my teeth were dangling in my gums. So if I tried to bite on anything, or even my own teeth, I would bleed anywhere from half a cup to a whole cup of blood. So I was getting up to two transfusions a week. Then I had to blend everything and suck it through a straw. So my favorite foods were powdered donuts and RC Cola, Sprite, those kind of things. So I put those in a blender together and blend them and suck them through a straw. Great diet, huh? And also waffles with boysenberry syrup that was full of sugar, corn syrup. And that would go into the blender with some RC Cola or Sprite or 7-Up. And that was my diet. After the chemotherapy, I stopped it. I was invalid. I was crawling on the floor like a worm, pulling my body along. It was too painful to try to move my legs or my hips or anything, so I just dragged myself around the floor. I wasn't going out of the house anymore. It was impossible. I lived on the floor. I tried to get up on pots and bowls and jars to urinate and defecate in, but that was so painful I mostly did it all over myself on my hardwood floors. I lived in the living room, clothes off the bedrooms, because there was no way I could go in there and live in them, nor could I be in a bed because I would just soil it. I had hardwood floors, took out all the carpets, took out most of the furniture, and I just lived on the floor, defecating, urinating all over myself. They tried to put me in a hospice, but being autistic, there was no way I was going to go into a hospice and deal with the ridicule of not being able to speak normally and talk normally, because I would still say unkind things and be abrupt. So the two volunteers at the hospice agreed with my uncle that they would come in two to three days a week, and they'd shop for me first, come in, cook the food for me, prepare it for me. 

Everything had to be blended because I couldn't chew, and prepare it all for me for two or three days at a time, clean the house, and boy, it was a mess. The whole house reeked of urine and defecation because it was just all over, and certainly I couldn't dump it, nor could I even lift it at all. They had brought me a big container to put it into with sawdust and sand in it, but just trying to lift it up into that pot, I mean, into that container, was impossible without severe pain, so I usually didn't make it. So it was just all around me, so I just lived in it for days at a time. Not a pleasant thing, but most of my senses were deprived from me from the chemo and the radiation therapy, everything. Even the delicious, you know, waffles mixed with, you know, blended with 7-Up and stuff like that tasted like postage stamps and cardboard, so nothing tasted good to me anymore. I just wanted to die, I wanted to die my whole childhood, so I was praying for death every day. And I have a little story to tell you that I don't tell many people. My mother was always afraid of, you know, getting cold, getting very cold, and getting pneumonia and dying. This was one of her big fears. Why? I don't know. Nobody ever, she ever knew died of pneumonia except some people in a hospital, but it certainly wasn't just from getting cold in the snow, cold in the snow. So I realized what this was, or fear, not in, you know, spoken words, so I ran into this puddle, this kind of a creek-type puddle, and I broke the ice and I immersed myself in it, and I still had a mile to walk home. So I thought, I'm going to die. I'm going to get what she's afraid of, and I'm going to die. And this was about probably nine years old, and I didn't even get a cold that time. Can you figure? Usually I get colds and flus constantly. So it was several weeks before I got a cold and a flu after that. So here I was, you know, debilitated, toxic, and one of the volunteers was an 18-year-old African-American boy, about 6'6", and a very kind person. Volunteering, he made a fortune because he was part of the Creative Source singing group that was funded by the Fifth Dimensions. I don't know if I'm dating myself. I don't know if anybody here even remembers the Fifth Dimensions. Up, up, and away, and things like that. You know, Aquarius. So he also worked for the Ford Motor Company in the going thing group, which made a fortune. So he was probably making at 18 years old in 1968 about $100,000 a year, and that was a lot of money for an 18-year-old African-American boy. So very kind. Here he was helping, and he got me into eating raw carrot juice and raw milk, first the carrot juice. And within 10 days of drinking those, my autism clicked off. I woke up in the morning and said, oh, noun, preposition, phrase, sentence. Oh, I got this. I understand now. I didn't have any vocabulary, but I finally had comprehension. So I called my uncle, and he said, that's really you Aajonus? So he thought I was a comedian friend of his that was imitating my voice because he could imitate voices. And it was a half an hour before he really realized that it was me because I told him something that only he and I would have known about the family. So he realized it's me.

And he said, well, because I told him I wanted to go to a bookstore and get a lot of books on nutrition because I really think they have to do with this carrot juice and this raw milk. And he said, as a psychologist, he believes everything's in the head. And I said, oh, it's just a matter of what you think about it. And I said, wait a minute. I didn't think anything about the food, and here I am eating it. It's just the only thing that tasted good. It didn't taste like cardboard or postage stamps like everything was processed and cooked in. This tasted alive and, you know, vibrant. I didn't have the words. I said, it tasted like light, you know, because that's the way I interpreted it at that time. It tasted like life, like light. And he got the image of what I was trying to go for. Vibrance, vitality in the food. So, you know, he had his concept about it's all in the mind. It doesn't matter what you eat. So I went to, but he said, when you go to the store and buy your books, your bookstore, get a book called Siddhartha. You're a diehard asshole Republican. You need a wired comprehension of interactions and interrelationship with people. So he said, it's a small book, very thin book, reading. So that's one of the books I got. I called Steve. Now the doctors had caused me and the hospitals had completely bankrupt me. All of my $80,000 had been saved in that few years, that two years was all gone from the medical therapy. Plus I owed another $60,000 to $70,000 with interest. So it was climbing. It was about $80,000. I [unintelligible] because there was no way I was going to pay it. Because I told them they're the ones that gave me the cancer that they treated me for and charged me for all the money for treating me for something they caused me to get. So they never came after me after I wrote that letter. So I didn't have to pay it, but I was broke. I was getting evicted and I thought I was going to be dead. So it didn't matter. If they could evict me, I'd be dead before the 90 days would be up. So I went to the bookstore at this particular point and Steve, the African American boy, got a wheelchair for me. It took us like three hours just to get into the car and to get there. And then all the time they took in the bookstore was a couple of hours. And they helped me choose nutritional books because I certainly still was not able to read. So we got Siddhartha and that was the first book I read. It took me a full week to read, reading 20 hours a day. And I would have to look up every word in the dictionary of the words in the dictionary. So it was like, you know, every word I had to look up, I had to look up the words in that definition. So it was maddening, all at one time. It wasn't a progression of learning over a long period of time, like everybody else gets to enjoy it and do it all at once. So it was pretty intense.

And it was about this fellow who grew up in an affluent family, got away from the family, became an alcoholic, a drug abuser, and even a murderer and a whoremonger. And then realizes himself and then becomes a mystic, you know, a prophet. So, I mean, all of this stuff, it was so unusual to me because the hell and brimstone Catholicism was, you know, very in line and I expect everybody to be violent and judgmental from that perspective. And Cincinnati, Ohio is a very German Nazi town and everybody is judgmental and gets in your business everywhere there. And Los Angeles, nobody gave a shit about what you did, you know, as long as you didn't hurt anybody. So it was quite a change of behavior from one city to another and I enjoyed that. So it gave me a different perspective on behavior and attitude. So I was very delighted to see that because there was kindness, there was understanding, there was true forgiveness without punishment and condemnation. So that helped me become a better person definitely because it opened my mind to other realities. But I was still dying and I just kept eating the foods that Steve would bring to me and it was mainly just the carrot juice and raw milk. But I gradually got better, better and better and better. Within a year of drinking that milk, my bones around my teeth completely grew back. So I could eat again, I could chew again. Not nuts or anything that was very hard. It took a few years to get to there. But still I was able to chew and bite on my own teeth without having to worry about bleeding to death. So by the time I was 27 years old, that was all transpired at 21, 22 years old at that point. By the time I was 27, I was healthy enough to reduce the pain by certain kinds of exercises and sleeping in the bathtub. Because there's no way that I could sleep for more than 10 minutes at a time without being in excruciating pain. So a few weeks after my autism shut off, I realized that if I got into a lot of warmth, it would ease the pain tremendously. So I filled my clawfoot bathtub, which is pretty deep and pretty long, with hot water. And I'd be able to sleep in that for an hour and a half, two hours at a time. Because they're made of cast iron, it would retain the heat longer. So I'd stay in there an hour and a half, two hours. I'd wake up freezing to death and in pain, but at least I was sleeping an hour and a half to two hours at a time. So then I'd let some of the water out, reheat the water, spin around some scalding hot water in there. And then I was able to sleep in there for another hour and a half, two hours. I'd sometimes sleep 14 hours a day in the bathtub. But I was getting sleep. I was beginning to heal to me quicker, quickly. So by the time I was 27, I had it down to where if I did yoga exercises every 45 minutes to an hour and a half, I could keep a lot of the pain from my back in a mitigated state. So I decided I was not going to learn what I needed to learn about health from doctors or anybody else. Nobody had any wisdom. Everybody was just regurgitating what they had read or learned and nobody had any experience. The apprenticeships of the past were gone. You could go to a school, read all this garbage information. You don't know it's true or not. 

You just accept it and then you go out and consult people. I mean, how do you know it's truth? You don't. And it wasn't because it wasn't working for me the way I wanted it to. The only thing that was working was this raw diet that I was on. It was mainly raw dairy and a little bit of lightly cooked meats. But I didn't eat much meat at that time, cooked meat, because after the surgery whenever I ate cooked meat, I'd break out in these boils all over and just be full of white blood cells and puses, white blood cells trying to arrest the poisons. And I'd get those all the way from the top of my head scalp down to my knees. And it was very painful and looked hideous. I mean, how would you like to see somebody with all these white pustulations? It reminds me of Lawyer, Lawyer with Jim Carrey, you know, there's this lawyer in his office that's got this zit on the end of his nose that's all red even white and ready to pop. He wants to get rid of it. He can't stand looking at it. You know, that's the way I looked all over. I had them all over. So I stayed away from eating cooked meats. Once in a while I'd have some chicken that was lightly cooked, but I still had to deal with pustulations. But then I moved into raw vegetarianism and then fruitarianism, did that for about four years. Most of that was while I was out trying to discover what was better because books I knew I wasn't going to learn anything. I was going to go out and live with primitive tribes and animals. So I got an Italian Ligi touring bike and I packed saddlebags and a little dog on the back, a little Hungarian Puli Vizsla that was dwarfed and fed her all raw foods. And we took off on a bicycle. Went and been across the United States with my bike five times, all the way from Yucatan, the lowest state in Mexico, all the way up to Canada. A few times I hopped freight trains because I was a little too exhausted or in pain, especially at the end of that period. And I lived with four Indian tribes, alligators, coyotes, chipmunks, all kinds of creatures, studying them for usually a month to six weeks at a time. And trying to figure out what it was about health that I wasn't learning in society with all their non-wisdom. So I lived with the Mayan Indian groups that were still alive in the woods in Yucatan, Oaxaca. And they said eat raw meat. The Yaqui Indians in northern Mexico, they told me he raw me. The Sioux, I have a great-grandmother who was Sioux Indian, so they realized that and took me in. And they also told me to eat raw meat. And then with the Eskimos, my last venture with the Indian tribe was with the Inuit in Alaska. They also told me to eat raw meat. And I thought all this time I knew what the cooked meat did to me, and even though I did the leap from eating any kind of cooked food to raw was good, I could not do it with the meat issue because of those pustulations. So I just didn't make that leap. I thought they were just trying to kill this white boy and finally get revenge at the white man for what we'd done to them.

So while I was with the Eskimos, they have a certain celebration every year, and they dug into the earth and pulled out these hides, unwrapped the hides, and in there was this patinaed black and white moldy ingredients inside there, and it stunk like a slaughterhouse that hadn't been cleaned but abandoned. And it stunk pretty badly. It made me want to vomit. And it didn't stink enough. There was a call, a bird call from downwind about a half a mile, and I called him in and it didn't stink enough. It didn't stink enough downwind. He reburied it for another week. So they pulled it out about five days later. It stunk worse, absolutely. And I couldn't get within five feet of it without having to want to vomit. And so all the kids, you know, they're jumping up and down. Like so happy smelling this stuff. It's like if I had cotton candy when I was a kid. You know, and this stuff would reek terribly and all the adults liked the smell of it. And the adults were eating like two pounds of it during this day and evening. And the kids were eating like a half a pound of it. Of course, if they were teenagers, they were eating anywhere from a pound and a half to two pounds too. Even the girls. So they're eating all this rank stuff and I mean it stunk terribly. And they tried to get me to have some and finally I agreed. But we took some cotton balls with musk oil and stuck them up my nose so I wouldn't puke. And I ate about a golf ball sized amount. It may have been a ping pong ball, but they're pretty close. And, you know, it was very soft. It was like braised in brandy lamb, you know, because it was so soft. It like melted in my mouth. As long as I didn't have my nose smelling it, I was okay. So I went back to my sleeping bag, let them enjoy the rest of the night. I was getting pretty tired. And when the sun goes down, the temperature goes down. And at that time, my blood and bone cancer, my multiple myeloma, were returning after two and a half years of living outdoors. So if the temperature got below 50 degrees, I was paralyzed right where I was in pain. So I had to get inside my sleeping bag and get warm, and get the sleeping bag warm before the temperature dropped. And this was in the early part of September 1976, so it was getting down to like 48 degrees at the time. So I was basically crippled at that point. So I was in the sleeping bag, and the next morning rolled around. And usually when I woke at that time, for at least six months prior to that, I used to have to wait until I'd wake up somewhere around an hour before the sun would come up. I'd be in pain in every joint, headaches with the pain. Then the sun would beat this on the sleeping bag, and I'd be in there for about two hours, an hour and a half to two hours, for my body to heat up enough where I'd crawl out of the sleeping bag and then bake naked in the sun for about 30 minutes. And then I'd be able to move relatively with some ease, but not with comfort. And after this stuff that I ate, I was able to get out of the sleeping bag in 45 minutes after the sun beat on it, and only 10 minutes naked in the sun. So I knew that, and I also felt a little bit better, so I went back to the elder. They don't call him the chief, he's always the elder. And I said, what was that herbal mixture?

Because I didn't know that meat, patinaed, I didn't know that gangrene was a fungi. I just thought that meat either just dissolved to dust after it was jerky, or worms ate it and it disappeared, or some other animal came and ate it. I didn't know that it got moldy, so I couldn't comprehend. So I thought this stuff that they give me was some kind of herbal formula, because I'd seen mulch and I'd seen the molds break down vegetation. So I thought it was some kind of herbal formula. They kept saying it was raw meat, raw caribou, and with seal blubber. So I thought that they were just pulling my leg and just weren't going to give this white boy the information. So I hopped on a freight train for my bike. I hopped on a freight train with my bungee cord laid up, had my hammock stretched across the open doors, and just watched the beautiful scenery as I traveled on the train down through Canada. Back in the United States, they had to hop a few trains because they don't all go the same way. They don't all go from Alaska to California. They go many ways. So I got back to an old Indian burial ground that I knew in Southern Desert below Palm Springs. I got to fast myself to death because I wasn't going to deal with it. I was just in too much pain. And it was, you know, that golf ball size of high meat is what the Indians called it, the Inuit Eskimos called it. It wore off within about two weeks, maybe three at the very most completely. So I started fasting myself to death, drinking, you know, two gallons of water a day because I knew I'd get headaches also. I was taking enemas, you know, to get rid of that fecal matter that could cause headaches. And I just kept getting weaker and weaker. And there was a den of coyotes that would come down every night, and they would howl and scream like a bunch of crazy people. And that's what they sounded like. And they would come wake me up every night, and one would sit there continuing doing his thing, and the others would get by me in the wash from my campsite. So after about 10 days, 14 days, I got to the point where I could sense where they were. And then the next night after that, they hunted and killed a jackrabbit for me. Jackrabbits are pretty big animals, about 7 1⁄2 pounds. And, you know, ears about this tall. So it's a lot of rabbit. And another reason I had become vegetarian is because I loved animals. Not the human animal, but all other animals I loved. I hated the human animal because, you know, I figured they were my problem my whole life, you know, even myself. So here was the Easter bunny on my feet, bleeding and warm. You know, so it was pretty revolting. And, you know, I looked at it and looked at the coyotes offering it to me. And then all of a sudden this dialogue that my uncle had had with my brothers and cousins when they were going rabbit hunting flashed through my mind. And my uncle was telling, told my cousins and brothers that, who were going rabbit hunting, that when you kill a rabbit, you have to cook them thoroughly so that there's no pink. It has to be well done all the way through, burned on the outside.

So, you know, because my uncle said that there's a microbe in the rabbit, in a wild rabbit, that will make us very sick, that will take over the digestive tract, extremely painful, and we die within 48 hours. They would die in 48 hours. So I thought, oh, these coyotes are trying to help me die quickly, because I could fast for 40 to 60 days. Two gallons of water a day, all these enemas, headaches. Because I was in the desert. It would be 110, 115 degrees even though it was late September in the day, and at night it would drop down to even 40 degrees, 38 degrees at night. So... I'm having fun. So I was fasting away, and I looked at this rabbit, and I said, okay, I'm going to eat it. End this quickly, no more fasting. So I chewed on the rabbit, came right back up, and it was raw. That's what I felt. And then I said, okay, I've got to go back to when I used to be forced to stay at the dinner table. Now I told you I hated pastas and all that stuff. They never made me eat that. They made me eat my cooked vegetables, and my mother overcooked everything. Nothing tasted good. And if she gave me broccoli or Brussels sprouts, I could hit that wall with projectile vomit. And it wasn't something I controlled. It was not in my mind. I was an idiot. How could I understand? It was just that it got in my stomach, and my body wanted to reject it, period. It didn't have anything to do with the taste. As soon as it got in my stomach, it would want to come back up. But after a few years of that, even the taste of it would repulse me so I wouldn't even swallow it. So I'd have to stay at the dinner table anywhere from an hour and a half to two hours a night, half an hour to 45 minutes after everybody else left the dinner table. I had to learn to mash the food in my mouth, cut my taste buds off, take about a teaspoon of milk because I was only allowed a cup of milk at dinner time, wash it down, and hold it. It would take anywhere from three, four minutes to hold it so I wouldn't vomit. It would allow it to pass through. So that's why it took so long for me to eat dinner. Going back to that time, I said, OK, I'm going to do this, I'm going to eat this rabbit. So I psyched myself up, took about five minutes to start eating it, doing a thing, swallowing it with a little water, kept it down. And then, all of a sudden, after about probably ten bites, it started tasting good. So I started eating it. The more I ate, the more ravenous I got. So I ate about three, three and a half pounds of that seven and a half pound jack rabbit. Coyotes shared the rest of it. I went back to my campsite to die. It was going to be quick. It was going to be quick. You know, I thought, two days of stomach cramps, no problem. I've been through so much pain in my life, this would be a breeze, two days. So I get back to my campsite, and I knew I was dying because I felt good. I mean, I felt really good, almost painless, as I'm walking back to my sleeping bag. I get in my sleeping bag, go to sleep, expect to go to the tunnel of light and, you know, whatever it was, and I was going to be in heaven or hell, whichever it was, I didn't know. And I woke up the next morning still in my sleeping bag, relatively painless, sun beat down. I was out of my sleeping bag in 45 minutes, in the sun for only 5, 10 minutes, and I was more functional than I had ever been, with the least amount of pain. Still very painful, but for me it was relatively painless at that point.

So three days went by, no cramps, no problems, healthier than I'd ever felt in my life. Felt more energy, natural energy, than I'd ever felt without the Benzedrine, the speed, and the cigarettes, and the coffee, which I hadn't had in like 6 years, up to that point. So I was feeling, whoa, it's the raw meat, that's what the Indians were trying to tell me, and I was completely, I said, you idiot, you're still an idiot. You can even communicate and you're still an idiot. So at that point, a sidewinder rattlesnake went right by me, coincidentally, and I had seen Indians go up and put their moccasin's foot on the head, pick it up in front of the rattler, whip it around, snap its head off. Without even thinking, I'm butt naked, I go up and put my foot on the snake's head, pick it up in front of the rattler, and I said, oh hell, what am I doing? I don't know how to do this. And I'm spinning it around and I'm beginning to get really sore. And I know that I can't keep this going. It must have been only three minutes, but I was so sore. I said, well, it's either going to eat me or I'm going to eat it. So snap, it came right off, peeled it back. I don't know where these cats came from, and all of a sudden they had nine cats sharing this raw snake with me. And let me tell you, snake does not taste like chicken. It tastes, raw, it tastes like fish. A lot of bones, even more than in fish. So the cats and I shared the snake. I felt more invigorated. And then I started eating, trapping birds and eating bird eggs. There's not much out there in the desert, so I felt badly because I knew I was going to end their lives if I kept eating their eggs. But there was nothing else to eat, so I ate scorpions and tarantulas. Just popped off their poison gland and would eat them. And I had seen, you know, National Geographic, all the tribespeople eating insects. In Thailand, I mean, these huge cockroaches that look like this big. Eat them crispy, fry them in water, eat them. So I'd seen all that, so it wasn't a big deal. And in China, they eat all kinds of scorpions. They don't even pop off the poison gland. I never figured out that one, but they don't get sick. So I ate everything I could and decided there's no way I'm going to survive out here in the desert. So I got on my bicycle. I visited about ten farms. I made deals to do work around the farm in exchange for food. So I was getting lots of raw eggs, lots of raw meat, chicken and goat, pig, beef, even horse. Anything I could get and all the dairy that went along with it, butter, cream, whole milk. Anything that I could get and eat that was raw, that was animal matter. And it was phenomenal. In like two and a half months, I gained like 50 pounds. I looked like a scaled down Arnold Schwarzenegger for me. Either fat on here, because my shoulders never developed. I was in the frame of a woman, big hips, small shoulders. So about a year after eating this diet, all of a sudden my shoulders grew. So my shoulders were wider than my hips for the first time. So this is what raw meat did. So that was very interesting and very happy for me. So I went back to Los Angeles and spread the word. Raw meat is the answer.

And they said, are you crazy, you're going to get a brain flu, you're gonna be an idiot? And I said, I've been there and done that. But it's the only thing that makes me feel good, so I'm going to continue doing it. So for about three years I ate meat once a day, three days a week. Whether it was chicken, fish, or red meat. I did pretty well in that time, still developing, getting better and healthier. Then I ate a poison mushroom. The death cap nearly killed me, gave me liver problems, almost destroyed my liver. Gave me blood cancer three times worse than I had had it prior. So to come back from that, after about a year and a half of moving slowly out of that death experience, near death experience, I learned that if I ate meat twice a day, every day, I got better faster. So it took me about six and a half years to get back to a functional level and eleven years to get over that completely. So I'd gone to this peak place where I was even able to exercise. I was running up to thirteen miles a day, barefoot on gravel, in the freezing cold rain of winter. Vitally healthy. And then a year after that eating this poison mushroom. And it took me eleven years to recoup from that. So I've been through hell and back many times. Now everything you hear from the medical profession, you'll be very wise to say that 99.9% of everything they say is just the opposite. If you do the opposite of what they say, you're going to find help. You have to remember that they're programmed by the pharmaceutical industry who makes money only on your sickness. So everything they tell you should be the opposite of what they tell you. Take a look at all the new research that's come out the last two years. Fifty-seven, fifty-four, fifty-seven thousand people were followed over almost a ten-year period, six to ten-year period. And guess what they found? People who had high blood pressure had almost no heart attacks. People who had low blood pressure had all the heart attacks. So high blood pressure, you want it, of course, if you've got congested arteries, you're fat and you've got pressure in your veins, you better have high blood pressure. It's normal. So the doctors telling you high blood pressure bad is an absolute lie. It's fraud. So you want high blood pressure if you've got a condition that leads to that and your body's not going to go into high blood pressure unless you need it. And the cholesterol thing, what happened last week or two weeks ago? A test came out on how many thousands of people did they find that the fat people had less heart trouble than any other group and that they had other diseases which were uncommon, that were only common in skinny, thin people. So here it is, being fat is healthy, fat and happy. A hundred years ago, if you were a skinny woman like you are today, you wouldn't have been chosen as a good wife because you couldn't get through childbirth, you couldn't make it through cold winter because you didn't have central air conditioning and heating like we have today.

You had to deal with the elements and that's what killed people. Those elements and also burning coal in your home and you have the thallium and mercury vapors you're breathing in a not well-ventilated home, cooking your food inside, that's what shortened life. Our medical profession is not lengthening our life. It's the ease of our environment that is making that, giving us longevity right now. So if you keep all of that in mind, you'll learn how to be healthy on your own. So in the next phase here, we're going to go into a workshop. It's going to be about four and a half to five hours. I call it a workshop because it's your work to stay awake and stay with me, but you'll have less ums and ahs and all of that because I don't have to read through all that information. I know it and it's clean. I don't have to filter through it like I do my life, deciding what to tell you and what not. So it's $85 or did you raise it $5? No, $85. Just stick around for that. What I will do is I'm going to tell you about the human body, how it works, so that you will be relaxed with what happens in your body. You won't be afraid of it and you won't run to some quack doctor. They're all quacks. There are some of them who get into it because they want to help people. But because they're programmed by the pharmaceutical industry, they're full of misinformation. So there's a lot of good doctors out there, good people out there who are doctors, but there's more that aren't. And those good doctors are brainwashed into the wrong information, so going to them, no matter what kindness they have in their heart, is not going to help you get well. Remember, doctors are trained on disease and drug pushing. They don't know nothing about health. They don't study anything about health. They do not study health. If they have nutritional class, it's at the most 16 hours in their whole 12 years of study. Hello? Why would you go to somebody flipping hamburgers to learn about health? No, you go to somebody who knows health, somebody who has a picture of health, and knows about health, not a doctor. So what I also do at the end of the workshop, I do a mini consult, which means I read similar to the Chinese method of reading glandular activity from the mounds on the hands, the coloring on the hands, and read the blood, the lymphatic system, and sometimes the neurological system. And it takes about 6 to 10 minutes per person. It's $40. If you want a long consult with me, it's an hour and 10 minutes for the first consult. It's $375. What I do is I photograph the irises, one little pinprick of the irises. We can blow up to this size so I can see all the toxicity that's in the body, where it's in the body, what systems it's in, so I can help you regain your health faster that way. I give a detailed diet. In the mini reading, I will give you a juice formula, the fruits that are good for you to eat, and the kinds of meat that are good for you to eat. In the full consult, I give you an actual program, what to eat, how much, what times of the day, everything, so you've got a good plan to get well a little bit faster. I think there are three consults left and that's it for this trip. So there you have it. We're going to take a 15-minute break. Anybody who hasn't signed up for anything, see Sherry. Thank you everyone for coming.

[break]

A: When we finish today, you should not be afraid of your body anymore. Not have to run. My father broke both my eardrums when I was about nine years old, so I don't carry very good tunes. No perfect pitch here. Okay, first we talk about the two circulatory systems of the body. Three circulatory systems. We have the blood, which everybody is acquainted with, with red and white blood cells. And that system is supposed to be very limited in its function. It's supposed to deliver oxygen to the body so that the body can use fats and other acetones and acetates as energy with the help of the citric acid cycle, which is a little bit of vitamin C or carbohydrate. That's only about 5%. And with 15% proteins, usually in the form of pyruvate, which is a protein sugar, a sugar that the body makes from proteins. The liver is supposed to deliver the oxygen. The white blood cells and the red blood cells as well can remove carbon dioxide, but usually it's a result or response of white blood cell activity. That is the job of the red blood cells and the white blood cell and the whole circulatory bloodstream. That is its job. The job now today in our toxic society, the body's having to filter it, it's detoxing with it, it's taking care of a lot of other jobs that it should not be doing. So you wonder why you have such low energy and you're supposed to be eating better foods, right? People take all these supplements, you're supposed to charge them up. Well, 100 years ago, even 60 years ago on my grandparents' farm, the farmers were taking 90-pound bales, got that 90-pound bales, and throwing them by hand into a loft that was about 12, well, 15 feet high, but they were throwing it about 12 feet into the lower part of the deck up there. They were throwing 90-pound bales with one hand up there. Then, 30 years later, it was 60 pounds. Then 20 years later, it was 30 pounds and a forklift. If we're so advanced, why are we not able to do what the farmers used to do back then? I'd like to see anybody here throw a 90-pound bale 12, 13 feet high into a loft. Wouldn't happen. Even this big, strong-looking guy there. A lot of these guys didn't have the bulk of this young man because they worked so hard. The bloodstream, if it is not forced to do other things, would create our peak energy level. Then we have the neurological system, very simple system. It delivers light, electricity, and it does it mostly through metallic minerals. Metallic minerals conduct electricity and reflect light, carry light, especially if there is a radioactive variety. A small amount of radioactive, nicely done, not manufactured, is part of the human body, part of any animal body, even any vegetative system. There is always a micro trace amount of radioactive material in the body. That system, in response to our toxicity of cooking foods, causes a lot of free radicals. When foods are combined in vegetation, which we will eat the animals that eat vegetation, all the nutrients are clumped together. In the human body, our body forms 93 to 117 units of nutrients. So it's a whole smorgasbord of nutrients. When you cook foods, add salt and drink water, it fractionates and explodes those. I don't know how many of you took chemistry in here. What happens when you have pure salt? It's an explosive.

A chunk of pure salt this big is worth an atomic bomb. It is so unstable. It's three times more unstable than nitroglycerin. That's why it is not used. But it is one of the most highly explosive substances on this planet. Salt, and you're eating it every day. Sure, they combine it with chloride or some other mineral to keep it from having that explosive reaction. Iodine and chloride is usually what's used. And why would anybody feed you poisonous substance like that? Well, the king and queen of England in the 1300s saw that they could make a lot of money by selling salt. Because there was no refrigeration back in those days. In fact, up to a hundred years ago there was just ice. You had ice cubes delivered and you had an ice chest. And you had to be wealthy to afford to get a block of ice, to have an ice chest. So a lot of the times the foods would be off-tasting. So salt was a cheap, quick way to do that. But it also causes explosive reactions even if it was combined with other minerals. In the bloodstream it is an explosive. Anywhere in the body it is an explosive. It fractionates all of those combined nutrients into sub-particles. So let's say the cell is going to eat. After that it is getting maybe 10, 20, 30 nutrients maximum at a time. Every cell is deficient every time it eats. If you are eating cooked food, salt, or salt and drinking a lot of water. Water is a solvent, it does the same thing. It explodes and fractionates these combinations which are supposed to feed a cell holistically each and every time. Then it opens to eat. Now a cell eats by osmosis. It's got one or two ions in it and that's called its belly. And when it opens to eat it attracts ions outside. So it's supposed to have all these nutrients 93 to 117. Not 93 and 117, but 93 to 117 elements in it and nutrients of all sorts. So a complete full diet, one gulp. When you have salt, the sodium ions clump, prevent proper absorption, effectively clump too much, can't even get inside the cell. And then the ions, the magnetic field is reversed and it pulls the ions out of a cell. And the cell shrivels like a grape to a raisin and dies, never eating again. That's what salt does. Drinking water doesn't do that, but it fractionates things. Eating cooked food doesn't do that unless there's salt in it, but salt does. It causes the killing of cells by ripping the guts out of it. So these cells have to eat. So in the neurological system, when you eat cooked foods and you've fractionated all the bonds, all the ion, all the electrolyte bonds to nutrients, all fractionated. Then they take on only electromagnetic properties. So those that are electromagnetic will gather or repulse each other. So you've got a whole new variety of combinations that are chemically oriented rather than food and nutrient life oriented. It's a magnetic field. It's an electromagnetic property. So it isn't bioactive in the same way.

So what happens is, since the brain and nervous system uses most of the metallic metals for its functions, it absorbs most of the free radical metallic minerals. Lead, cadmium, thimerosal, which is liquid mercury, and there's other metal that's like mercury. Toxic mercury is as soft as lead. Thallium, yes thallium. So that means I need to suck an egg when that happens. If you want to suck an egg the easy way, I grew up with a very narrow throat passage because of all the chemicals that I had had as a child. So it never developed. So if I drink an egg Rocky style, I'll gag on it because my throat just doesn't open up. So what I do is I take the fat end of the egg, take this eye tooth, and I dent it without poking a hole. You've got a membrane inside which holds the yolk and the egg white. And you see those baby bottles with the plastic inside and you see the plastic collapses and the milk is being sucked out. Well that's the same thing will happen here if you fracture the makeup of where that attaches, that membrane attaches. Break the integrity of the attachment. Then this end you do the same thing. And usually because it's a smaller end it will open a hole pretty quickly. If it doesn't, put a smiley on it. Then you have a smiley face. Now when you hold it down, suck it out, only the egg white comes first. So it just tastes like slimy salty water. Pretty good, pretty cool, not bad. 

Q: I can't do it that way.

A: Then when you get down to the egg yolk, you just...

Q: I don't like that part.

A: Suck, not a bit of it is left when you do that. Then you don't have to clean a glass. Hermetically sealed. Completely biodegradable. You'd be surprised how quickly those degenerate. Ah, that one rubbed in. I'm not going to waste my... on that. See how many toxins go into a piece of paper? Pretty bad ones. So, yeah, my body can eat it through the skin. So when you eat cooked food, all of these free radical metallic minerals go into the brain and nervous system. So you hear all the theories on these really imaginative archaeologists. They would talk about, we have the largest brain on the planet because we're more intelligent. We can make planes fly. We can do all this stuff. But we kill. We're greedy. We do all these ugly things to the planet that no other animal does. So we're not very wise. If you look at the technological developments that we have, they correlate with the increased brain, not vice versa. We get a bigger brain and become smarter. The brain holds a lot of heavy metals. It holds toxins. The brain is 60% fat. 60% fat. According to all science, where do toxins store? In fat. We've got fat brains, right? So heavy metal toxins are going to go into the brain, store in those fats. If it takes up a lot of brain space, what needs to happen? The brain needs to get larger to handle more of the waste and garbage and toxicity. So it isn't because we're getting smarter, it's because we're getting more toxic. The increase in the brain size correlated with making tools, smeltering minerals into metal tools. The brain exponentially grew to handle those toxins, toxic metals that got into the brain. If you do an autopsy on the brain, the concentration of toxic metals is so great that it will equal the toxic metals in the whole rest of the body. That's saying a lot. It's also showing how toxic we are. So, cooked foods, heavy metals, our pollution, our habits of industry are causing tremendous amounts of toxins in the brain and the neurological system. Now, when the brain detoxifies, it detoxes out the mouth, mainly. Sometimes the sinuses cause drainage, sinus drainage, a lot of mucous formation. But most often it leaves through the gums, the salivary glands, and the tongue. So, when the metals dump out the gums, what happens? The body uses alkalinizing minerals to bind with it, causing plaque. The toxic metals, especially if you've had vaccines, heavy mercury, heavy thallium, heavy aluminum, ether, formaldehyde, drips down, comes calcium. The toxic acidic minerals are greater than the cauterized alkalinizing minerals from cooking, so the plaque gets very thick, but still does not defend your dentine against those heavy metals that damage the dentine cells, cause cavities. Bacteria does not cause cavities, biggest joke in the world. You can apply bacteria straight with no toxic minerals to the teeth and it will never, ever cause degeneration of the dentine. I've done it in a laboratory at least 30 times, never once, even over a six month period, with no brushing of those teeth to form any kind of a decay. However, if you put thallium, mercury, lead, any of those on the dentine, usually within two weeks, ten days to two weeks, you have damaged dentine. No matter how small the layer is, the longer it sets on there, the deeper it goes.

So, yes, brushing is very important to do in our toxic society, but with what do you brush? That is the question, and I'll give you some of those answers later with my latest experiments. They've been doing quite well, I must say. I'm very happy about that. So, dent... Teeth are one of the hardest things to rejuvenate and protect because of all the heavy metals in the brain constantly leaking out the gums. So, in our toxic environments, it's very, very difficult. And you have 40 years on a perfect diet for all of them to be removed, so it takes a long time. My teeth are now starting to regenerate. The fillings that I have, the body is filling in behind them, so the fillings go outwards. So, I've got this big lip between the tooth and then, you know, they'll pop out and then I used to have them filled again after that. Now, I don't have them filled in my teeth or active teeth that I have, that are mine, not capped. Will... Are filling in and mending themselves. And here in my 62nd year, you know, when I was 20, they were all decaying like crazy. I've almost lost all my teeth. Another thing I forgot to tell you, when my teeth dangled like that, the medical profession gave me a few weeks to live and they wanted to pull all my teeth. And I thought, I'm going to freaking die and you want me to suffer for the last, you know, weeks of my life with complete mouth infections? Are you crazier than I ever imagined? Yeah, they are. Absolutely, they are. So, the brain detoxifying, it comes out, mostly out the mouth. Of course, it can be other places where you may dump, but that's the primary discharge location is in the mouth. The other circulatory system and one very much neglected is the lymphatic system. Now, the lymphatic system in its pure healthy state is connected to the lacteal system. Now, the lacteal system is a web network that extends from the intestines. That's where all of your nutrients are absorbed. It's called the lacteal system because when you digest everything, I don't care if you digest blueberries or ostrich, which is as dark as liver or liver, it turns into a milky substance. It looks white and milky. No matter what you've eaten, reduces to a milky, look just like this, reduces to a milk color. The lacteal system delivers it to the lymph system. So, what does that tell you? What does that tell us? The lymph system is supposed to feed everything. But you know what we found the lymph system to be limited to do? Detoxify. So the lymph system is responsible to remove all of the waste products from the whole body as well as feed it. The bloodstream delivers oxygen, takes out the carbon dioxide. The lymphatic system delivers nutrients, removes the waste as byproducts. Very efficient. Our lymph systems are so jammed right now with toxicity, especially cooked fats made from vegetable oils, hydrogenated oils, that we get congested. The lymphatic system is completely congested. It no longer feeds the body very well and the bloodstream has taken on that. You've given the bloodstream a job that it wasn't meant to do. So how much energy does that take from you? 

How much vitality does that take from your body? What happens when particles get into the blood which are not meant to be there? What happens to the red and white blood cells? How many white blood cells do you lose to the toxic waste products from cooking foods that end up in the bloodstream? So how much carbon dioxide isn't going to get removed? How much lactic acid is going to remain in the muscles and tissues? All of these are questions that should be answered and you'll find out why you have all the problems you have. You're not like those animals out in the wild. Think about if you were a cow in the Maasai tribe. And it was that three months out of the year when the calves are suckling and the Maasai don't get enough milk. What do they do? They drink blood. So they take a bull and they'll take a bamboo about this long. They cut one end down to a very sharp point and they take this huge rubber slingshot that they make and they shoot this bamboo shoot into the jugular vein of a bull. And if you watch the bull be down there grazing, they shoot it in and the bull goes back to grazing. How would you like to be that healthy that a huge bamboo gets shot into your jugular vein and it's just a little strain on you and you go back to eating? No crying, no anything but just that little discomfort. We should be that healthy. And we are not. Everything hurts. Everything affects us tremendously. And it shouldn't be that way. If we follow our natural dietary path, which I'm going to get into immediately, if we followed that we wouldn't have all this obstruction of the systems, the intertwining, the mixing, the liver becoming a filter. The liver wasn't meant to be a filter. It makes bile to do just that simple job. But now it's a filter. Filters out a lot of waste from the blood. This shouldn't be there in the first freaking place. So that lymph system is supposed to deliver the food and it's supposed to remove the toxic waste. Simple. When you eat hydrogenated oils, fats, what does that make them? It makes them into the same molecular structure as plastic. In fact, that's how plastic's made. By hydrogenating oils, heating them at high temperatures. So, you've eaten a lot of plastic oils. What's going to happen? They're going to crystallize and harden in your lymph system. And what's going to happen? The lymph system isn't going to be moving. It becomes congested. When the lymph system dumps its waste, it takes the waste, runs the lymphatic system, delivers the most toxic substances to the nodes, which are very, very, very tiny little things, about the size of anywhere from a BB to a pellet. And then, if it has to break them down even more, it has to send them to the lymph glands, which can be this big. Normally, they're about that big. But they can swell up to this big. If you've had swollen glands before, that's when the body's taking in a lot of toxicity. These are usually the most toxic right here, and these will swell more. Mine have been swollen ever since I was a kid.

These two never shrink. I mean, they'll go up and down a little bit, but they're always working over time because of all the toxicity that was given to me as a child, all the injections that involved mercury and other metals that went to my brain. So I'm still dumping. I've got 12 more years on a perfect diet to finish that detoxification, according to the work of Drs. Howell and Pottenger. When they did work with diseased animals, they found it took five generations for them to get to optimal health. Well, five generations for us is seven to seven and a half years to replace every cell in the body one time. So five times seven and a half is what? Thirty-seven years or thirty-seven and a half years. So about 40 years it takes to go through that process. So I still have 12 years to go on my journey after eating raw meat on a daily basis several times a day. So that's when I started my journey. So I'm already more than satisfied. As you can see, I'm on my 62nd year, and I get healthier every year and much better. And I see everybody else going downhill from my classes in 65 and my college class. Some people were dropping dead in their late 30s and 40s. One of them was the most likely to succeed, had the best smile, and he had like three in our yearbook... He had like three great things of what a great person he was, and he dropped dead at 41 years old. You've got to take care of your body if you want to get beyond all this sickness and disease. A lot of people say, well, do you expect to live a long time? I don't care how long I live. I just want to live healthy while I'm here. Richard Dreyfuss told me, we had lunch together one day. I took a course at the British American Drama Academy at Stanford. So it was like a summer intensive. So Marcia Mason, Richard Dreyfuss, Ann Jackson, and Ted Knight, and a couple of other stars were our professors for that time. And we're having lunch, and Richard Dreyfuss says, if you get hit by a bus, I'll say, I'll be a healthy way to go. I'll be healthy when I'm dead, when that bus hits me. He looked at that and said, yeah, that's true.

Q: He died healthy.

A: Yeah, I died healthfully. That's what I want. So the lymph system, when it gets jammed with that plastic, it's very difficult to move it. Even vegetation, vegetable oils in the human body are not good. Why? Because we have a body temperature of 98.6 and lower. An herbivore has a body heat of 101 to 105 degrees. It can keep vegetable oils, no matter how much bile is in it, keep vegetable oils liquid at their body temperature. And our temperature, even with all the bile that we can produce, still will start drying and crystallizing if they're made part of a cell. Crystallizing. So wait a minute. If animal fats don't crystallize because we have a certain body temperature, yet vegetable oils do, what causes hardening of the hardened arteries? It certainly isn't animal fat like we've been told. It's vegetable oils. It's margarine. All that garbage. So again, who lied to us? The food and medical industry together have lied to us. Who owns the food industry and who owns the medical industry? They're friends. They're close friends. Those families are close friends. And the King and Queen of England owns most of the food industries throughout the world. They own most of the salt. They own almost all of the coal mines. These are very tight families. They keep everything together and supporting each other. And, of course, they own all the media now. And they have since the late 1930s. That's how they took over everything. They caused a crash of the market. It's like they're doing again. So they can absorb everything they want. And they absorb most of the media. Of course, they did it under their trust so nobody could track it to them in those days. But now things can be tracked to them pretty well, pretty easily. So it's a tight family. So all the information you're going to get about health has nothing to do with health. It has to do with you eating and eating and eating foods that will never satisfy your body. So you overeat, you overeat, never satisfied, never happy. What happens with unhappy people? They like to buy things to distract themselves, thinking that they're going to buy happiness. And it's endless. They know you're unhappy, you're going to be a consumer. How ugly and cynical that is, it's the truth. When I was a boy, and my mother's side is from Alabama, Dawson and Huntsville, way down there in the corner, way up high, in Dawson, Alabama and Huntsville, Alabama, we used to go there and visit almost every year. And I would go into the back country, we'd drive through the back countries of Alabama, and you'd see these African American families, poor as poor can be, they have their own gardens, and the kids are completely happy. They're out there having fun, and my brothers and I are in the car, and we're all fighting and arguing. And these kids are out there loving one another and having fun. Why? Because they grew their own food, and that's all they needed, to have bodily happiness. We, all we wanted was more toys, more candy, and all we did was squabble and fight. And I looked back at that and I said, why are they happy? We're supposed to be non-poor.

We have all these luxuries. We have a car. They're lucky if they have bicycles or tricycles. And you have to take a good look at that. What is important for the body's happiness? What does it take, how little does it take for the body to be happy? And they've got all these good foods. And most of the African Americans were still segregated against and basically low-wage slaves back in those days. I remember when I'd go to a fountain, there would be a fountain for the whites and then the coloreds. They'd have one for them and it would say coloreds. And then the toilets were, they didn't say white, it just said men and women. And then for the ones that said coloreds, it was bisexual. Both women and men used the same one. And they were not allowed to drink out of the same fountains. But yet these people were happier. They always grew their own foods. Everybody else who was Caucasian wanted to buy canned foods and pre-prepared cereals, you know. That showed how advanced we were technologically, how rich you were, and yet you were getting crap food, the worst food you could get. So look at that. All this unhappiness in these Caucasians, and all these Africans and Americans that are eating fresh out of their gardens were happy. Take a look at that. Get that image in your mind. It will make a big difference to you. This is something I think about every day. I wanted to be one of those African American children out there having fun with my brothers. We never had fun. We hated each other because we weren't happy inside. We were always irritable from all that toxic food. My father forced us all to eat salt, that explosive nutrient in our bloods. So you think about that. Now, I produced a newsletter. It's four months behind because all four of my computers were damaged. Somebody broke into my house and damaged all four of my computers. So they were down for four months. So the newsletter is out and it talks about, is behavior affected by diet? And of course, I give all the new tests that have come out, especially from Wisconsin, where they trance, in the schools in Appleton, Wisconsin, this particular high school. There were all these children having problems. There were weapons problems, violations. There were lots of expulsions, lots of trouble in the classrooms, low grades, all these problems. And some organization called Fine Gold Organization got together some medium, wealthy people who could afford something like this. Not the high wealthy, the real wealthy people who control the world. They knew that there was something wrong with all these additives in foods that were causing problems. I had first studied them back in the 60s, late 60s, when they were given to me by my tutor. Tutored me for three and a half years. And it showed that additives and pesticides and herbicides caused emotional and toxic reactions of the brain. So I'd seen those studies before. So when these new ones came out on this Appleton, Wisconsin event, seven years they've been following it, no weapons violations in that seven years. All the students' grades high. They have no problems in that school whatsoever. And the only thing they changed was everything's fresh food, made from scratch, nothing packaged. 

Take a look at that. Big change. Why isn't every school in America adopting it? Because Cola and junk food companies donate a lot of money to the school boards to keep their vending machines and toxic substances in the cafeteria and on the school ground. So diet is the ultimate necessity for being a happy, intelligent, calm individual. Of course, your toxicity, that can get into the system and act like any other substance eaten. So you've got to know how to control it, and we're going to get into that. So let's take the digestive tract, covered that lymphatic system. The way to get it to melt first, all that toxicity that you have hardened in your lymphatic system to get it to melt, picture a stick of butter right out of a refrigerator in a big glass about this big around. You've got a stick of butter sitting there. You've got 102 degrees. The amount of heat that you can take, probably 103 you can take, but 102 is safer, so you don't destroy the enzymes in your own skin. So you're in a hot tub or a hot bath that heats it slowly. So picture your lymphatic gland being jammed with hardened fats. We're using the butter, cold butter, as an example. How long does it take for the heat to counterbalance from that cold butter to where it'll start melting? It takes about 50 minutes. That's how long it takes to get the heat deep enough into our systems where it's touching the lymphatic system so it starts melting it. So every 10 minutes, you'll have just a slight melting of the outside of that butter. Remember, you've still got cold generating from the center. This is cold... It's when it first came out of that refrigerator in the center generating cold outward, and the heat inward, very mild heat going inwardly. So let's say after an hour and a half, you've melted a thousandth of an inch worth of that. At least it's moving. And in my book, We Want to Live, if you look under lymphatic baths, you'll know to take a combination of pineapple and coconut cream with some other animal fats, mix them together, and you drink that before you get in the bath to melt that system. By the time an hour and a half goes by and you do the exercise that I said, which is just mild walking, it keeps that fat from hardening when the body cools again. So you've got a working little bitty tiny flow, and if you do that two times a week, at least one time a week, over a period of years, that's going to open, and you're going to be functional. Let me give you an example of how that works. I had a man that was about 66 years old when he came to me. He had prostate cancer and chronic fatigue, a little bit of fibromyalgia, not too bad, and a non-working functional thyroid gland. So they were going to put him on Armour, and they were going to give him chemicals for the prostate problem, eventually remove it, give him radiation therapy and all kinds of stuff that they do, because his PSA count was pretty high. So it was like 30, pretty high. So 31, 32. So he was standing in the line at the pharmacy, getting ready to pick up his Armour thyroid medication. 

And he says, I don't want to do this. So he walked home, he was going to get something to do, and a friend of his called. And he said, how's that diet going for you? I said, what diet? What are you talking about? He said, you sent me the book, We Want to Live, three months ago for Christmas. You mean you haven't been doing the diet? He said, wait a minute, I sent you that book? No I didn't, I sent you an architectural book. This guy was an architect, young architect, friend of the family. And he said, no, you sent me, yeah, you sent me the architectural book, but you also put in there this We Want to Live book. He says, I've been on it for three months and it is fantastic. He said, send me my book. He says, no, that's my book. He says, you're not getting my book, you have to buy your own. So this man got the book, started on the diet, and he's on and off, you know, probably 70-80% for a year and a half, two years. And I said, Don, you've got to do those lymphatic baths, because the main problem you're having is you're not cleaning your body properly. It's all solidified. All you want to do is eat and sleep, and that's all you want to do. If you want to have a life again while you're retired and enjoy your retirement with all the millions that you have, do these lymphatic baths. I said, you've got to do one a day, two days a week, at least three days apart. He wasn't listening. He started doing them every day. That's causing a tremendous amount of toxicity. Plus he was doing them, there was a typo in my book that I didn't know was a typo. It said 110 degrees. It was supposed to be 101 to 105, so there was a typo there. He was doing them at really high temperatures. He did one every day for three months. He says, I don't know if this is working, man. All I'm doing is eating and sleeping. I said, that's all you were doing before. He said, yeah, but I'm really wiped out now after those baths. I said, well, how many have you been doing? He says, well, one every day for three, almost three and a half months. I said, my God, stop. Do them only two days a week. You can do short ones, 30, 35 minutes a day for the other days because the lymphatic system will dump their poisons into the connective tissue. Then you have to perspire it out of the connective tissue. Now, when I wrote the book, I didn't have that piece of information. It wasn't complete to me. So I don't say in my book, have the 30, 35 minutes every other day that you don't have the long lymphatic baths to clean the connective tissue. And I found probably about, you know, one out of 20 people who are starting to develop congestion in their connective tissue. And that can lead to MS and lupus, which is disintegration of connective tissue. With the lupus, of course, it's hardening of the nerves in the connective tissue and it's multiple sclerosis, MS. So I found that you've got to do the 30, 35-minute baths, you know, at least a couple, two, three, four days a week following the long lymphatic baths, which are an hour to an hour and a half to complete that. So the man for weeks stopped doing them every day.

And he called me after about 10 days and said, I have so much energy, I don't know what to do. And I said, well, you're in retirement, do whatever you want to do. So two months went by and he started an international stem cell company and to this day, six years later, he works 14 hours a day and loves it. That's the difference between getting your lymphatic system moving. If you're eating this diet and he does it 99%, his wife makes everything for him. He doesn't need to do that. I make all of my food for myself in the first 45 to 50 minutes, maybe an hour of every day. I get up, I have my juice. Between that, by the time I start my meat and finish my meat, all my food's prepared for the whole day. I don't have to go in the kitchen each time and whittle away and make my food. It's all finished for the day. I just grab it, drink or eat. That's it, very simple. That is the key to making this diet easy, is to prepare it all in the morning so it's all ready. Plus, I don't refrigerate anything but my vegetable juices for the rest of the day so it's warm and bacteria's moving so it's more healthful, easier to digest. I'm gonna take a sip of this, I'm so thirsty. Chew your juices. Swallow your meat whole. Okay, so let's go over the digestive tract now that you understand the lymphatic system, neurological system, and the blood. Start off in the mouth. Now a lot of vegetarians say, we have vegetarian teeth. Yeah? Do your teeth look like a horse or a cow or are they all molars? No, we have cutting teeth. All the way from here we even have the canine ripping teeth. Everything's cutting. We have a few molar crushing teeth to crush meat. Everything's for cutting and ripping. They say, well, that's for fruit. If you're a monkey, if you want to be a monkey, how will the monkeys live? They eat all that fruit and what happens? All day long. That's what monkeys do all day long because they eat fruit. If you want to be functional like that, eat all the fruit you want and you won't behave just like that. I guarantee you. I see fruitarians, I was like that as a fruitarian. I had to be busy all day long or masturbating or something. And that's what happens when you eat all that sugar. So take a look at the gorillas. The gorillas are a little different. Most people don't track gorillas so they don't know how they live on a daily basis. A friend of mine named John Goodall, I mean Goodell, followed some gorillas and found that about every 28 days, every 23 to 28 days, it was more like clockwork on 28 days, they kill 2 or 3 or 5 animals for the tribe of gorillas. And they consume anywhere from 10 to 20 pounds of meat each in about a 20-24 hour period. So they go through this massive meat ingestion and the rest of the time they eat bananas that are green, peel and all. Can you imagine eating green bananas with the peels? Alamine, how do you get that much saliva? But they're natural, they're healthy, they can do it. So they eat these green bananas and they'll chew on some leaves and spit out the pulp to get their vegetable juice. But mainly they're eating meat, heavy amounts of meat for a few day period.

We're sick, we need to eat it everyday in small amounts to get back to that health level. So we have teeth which are geared toward cutting and ripping flesh, not vegetation, not anything else. Our systems aren't bent toward that. The only thing we have remotely resembling any herbivore is the horse, we have ptyalin enzyme. And we developed that since eating all the carbohydrates. Back in Egypt, you know, the amaranth and then in Asia the rice, developing all that. So we developed the ptyalin enzyme. Even the Norwegians didn't have the ptyalin enzyme because they were meat and milk drinkers. Meat eaters and milk drinkers, so they didn't know ptyalin enzyme. But a lot of us now have the ptyalin enzyme. It's not a lot, but it's a little bit. And it can over alkalinize your system in your mouth. Most of what you produce in the saliva is, guess what, bacteria. We have more bacteria in our mouths and saliva than any canine or feline. So you better watch who bites you. All that bacteria. Now why bacteria? Because bacteria eats meat and animal products. Their excrement, their secretions are our food. Just like the intestinal bacteria. We're getting a flushing of this bacteria here. A lot of people say, well it goes into the stomach and the hydrochloric acid destroys it. No, not our own bacteria. It won't do that. They are working together. And if you're eating raw foods, that is. Of course, if you have the stomach pumped, which I've done, extracted the food out of the stomach before it leaves and goes into the small intestines, that bacteria, I've seen it under a microscope, it isn't destroyed. The hydrochloric acid doesn't destroy it. It's a neat combination. So the food goes from the mouth down the esophagus, dumps into the stomach. Now we have two divided pouches in one stomach. We have the main point, the first compartment, where the hydrochloric acid dumps quite a bit. Not like a feline or a canine, they have 15 times what we do in the stomach. Then as the food passes over to the duodenum, then the bile begins to dump. And a nutritionist said to me, where did you get your education? Bile doesn't dump into the stomach, it dumps into the intestines. And I said, if you've ever done an analysis on vomit, do you find bile there? Yeah, there's lots of it there. Well then hello. Bile had to dump in the stomach for you to vomit bile. And there are huge concentrations of bile whenever you vomit, huge concentrations. So the information that you get out there and you think you know is usually trash. It comes from the medical profession or any academic, scholastic endeavor. They do not have the correct information and it's purposeful. They don't want you well. They don't want you smart. Just think, if we had a revolt like we did back in 1776, we would be running the world. Not 5,000 people would be running the world. Everybody would be running it cooperatively. It would be very different, but they don't want that.

That's my own view and a lot of other people's view from their behavior and their actions. The food goes from the duodenum into the small intestines. In the small intestines, when I've done autopsies, I've found continuous amounts of both bile and uric acid, I mean hydrochloric acid dumping in for digestion, plus swarms of bacteria. The villa, as food passes the villi, you've seen those ocean, oceanography things where you get all those nice little flora dancing around, and you see the little fish going between them and the particles and they absorb those particles. Well, that's the same way it happens in the intestines. So when food moves through those villi, they secrete enzymes, bacteria, all kinds of substances to help digestion. Sugar eats away those things. So when you're 50, you have one-fifth the length of villi, if any, by the time you're 50 years old. Digestion has been removed by 90% by eating just sugar, processed sugar, whether it's from the beet or sugar cane. So naturally in the environment, guess what we're supposed to have? Who thinks that eating pigs, who's been told that eating pigs is a terrible thing and trichinosis is horrible? Who's been told that? How many people? Let's say a good 50% of everyone in here. Now when I was a child and I heard these sound bits and I didn't know what they were talking about. Trichinosis, what's trichinosis? You know, it's just a word to me. But it was a whipworm that exists in the intestines of pigs. Well guess where else it's been found in archaeological finds for millions of years? In the human digestive tract. All of the tribes, the primitive tribes on this planet have trichinosis. Guess who doesn't? Our civilized, over-chemicalized society. So how does that harm us? Take a look at the work of Joel Weinstock, a gastroenterologist at the University of Iowa. Twenty years ago, he was raised on a farm, became a gastroenterologist, doctor, became a professor, and he looked at the pigs at the university that was all in a stale environment, got all this great clean food, and he found these pigs, these porcines, were all sick. And yet, out at the farm, we're living in garbage and mud and fecal matter and urine and everything else rolling around, so perfectly healthy. So being a gastroenterologist, he decided to check the intestinal tract. He checked a lot of things, the blood, everything. But he found the only difference was the pigs on the farm had trichinosis, the ones in the university didn't. So he filtered the fluid from a healthy pig, took all of the eggs that were produced from the whipworm, infused them into the pigs at the university, and guess what? They were well in three to four days. Three to four days. So he realized that the whipworm ate up food particles to dissolve them and digest them rapidly, and their secretions were that animal's food, readily made quickly. 50 times faster than bacteria can do it. So you get all this great nutrients in a very short period of time by having the whipworm, the trichinosis. 

So he went to the FDA and he said, I want to do this on six people. I want to infuse them with these whipworm eggs, give these people trichinosis that have inflammatory bowel syndrome, and see if it helps. And the FDA said, OK. But everybody in the study, all six people, have to have had medical therapy without relief for a minimum of ten years. And he said, OK. That's when I discovered that there was a law that you are condemned to medical therapy for ten years if you go to an MD, or any kind of a licensed doctor. A licensed doctor cannot legally suggest any alternative therapy for you. You're only allowed their basic stuff that's dictated by the pharmaceutical industry on treatment, which is chemical, surgical, irradiation, those invasive-type therapies. You are condemned for ten years when you go to a licensed doctor, MD, any kind of a medical doctor in that avenue. So think about that. And even if it's a conscientious doctor, will not be able to prescribe or lead you to any alternative without fear of losing his license. And do you think his family and their welfare and their swimming pools and their house are more important than you? Absolutely. Absolutely without question. You are an ant in their world, where they're going to take from you, but they're not going to give to you, even if it means their morals are shot. It's just the way it is. So Dr. Weinstock took six individuals who had suffered from 10 to 32 years with inflammatory bowel syndrome. Inflammatory bowel syndrome so bad that if they drank water, they got gas and stomach cramps, vomiting, diarrhea. No matter what they ate or drank, they always had digestive problems. In five days, five of the six of them were completely asymptomatic. Can you imagine suffering 10 to 32 years and all of a sudden you can eat anything? All the pain, all the suffering, the diarrhea, the vomit stopped in five days because they got trichinosis. Trichinosis was pre-digesting their food, was making their food available for them when the bacteria in their own intestinal environment was incapable of digesting food properly. Because of toxicity, because of all kinds of problems, their mothers could have gotten some kind of injection of DES or antibiotic or any of that while they were gestating. So you as the offspring had your entire digestive tract raped and annihilated by causing antibiotics in your mother. So one man, one of the patients who was a man, one of the six, was not harmed and was not benefited by getting trichinosis. Why? Tests were never done to substantiate that they incubated and they really reproduced his intestines or what. That particular part of the information is lost, purposely or non-purposely. Then eight years later a team of doctors who were also gastroenterologists from Germany and several other countries pulled together and followed up on Weinstock's work and they found the same thing. Trichinosis caused incredible health and reversal of almost every intestinal problem that anybody suffered. But can you get the trichinosis in this country? No, you have to go online and get it from Germany. And you have to ship it from there, kind of inconspicuously. And you can get a vial of your trichinosis, your whipworms, so you can get a case of trichinosis.

Q: They're very expensive.

A: Very expensive, absolutely. Very expensive. So, you have to take a look at that. Why don't we do that in this country? How many people suffer digestive problems? Probably 9 out of 20 people? Pretty amazing, yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: In the archeological finds, the one that is indigenous to us, to humans, is the whipworm, Trichinosis. The hookworm is not really a human parasite that works with us, the hookworm will, but it does some things that aren't as congruous and as balanced as a whipworm.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, that's what I tell my patients. Go to an Amish farmer, tell them you want a section of the small intestines, eat a pound of it, you'll have a... Pig. Pardon, pig, yes. So a great way to do it. If I take questions, we're going to be here all night. One time I did that in New York, I didn't finish until midnight. So I usually answer all of your questions by then. If you have a question, write it down. If I don't answer it, ask when I get to Q&A, but I guarantee that 99% of all the questions you will ask, I'll get to anyway. So save your questions. Okay, so as we go through the intestines, we get to the bowel. And what is the bowel? It's a large intestine where what? Different other kinds of bacteria form. We have E. coli, it's the main bacteria that lives in the colon. E. coli, that dangerous stuff. Oh my god, it causes so much disease. It causes kidney disease. It will melt your kidneys. All these wild B-movie type bad Hollywood stories are coming out of the medical profession because the pharmaceutical environment wants you to be afraid of the natural things in life that make you healthy. E. coli are responsible for releasing 90% of the B vitamins from all the food you eat. They're responsible for making finite particles of protein that feed your brain and nervous system. So your brain and nervous system rely on those E. coli for their good health. 90% of depression is caused by a low E. coli environment. From all the toxic food, all the wastes, enemas, colonics, stuff like that that flushes them out, wipes them out. So you can head into depression pretty quickly. Also head into heavy paranoia. And all of a sudden you get hooked on doing enemas or colonics. And you'll get crazy if you don't. And I know people who have been on them long term. And let me tell you, they are very chemically sensitive individuals who have done it for a long time. And they have a lot of other problems. That E. coli is the food producer for your brain and nervous system. Anxiety has nothing to do with that. 90% of anxiety has to do with not exercising. A lot of people produce a lot of hormones for physical activity. That's estrogen, adrenaline, testosterone. Those hormones will force you to be physically active. This is the most exercise I do. I don't produce hormones. Only time I start pumping active hormones is when a girl that I'm very attracted to on a physical level. And that's testosterone. That's the only hormone I produce for physical activity. How I get the energy to do this in front of you, I don't know. I do it no more than once a week and that's my exercise. I carry my groceries once a week. That's also what I do. I have no activity rings in my eyes. Activity rings tell me how much hormone you produce on a daily level and for how many hours of physical activity. And if you have one, you have to get about an hour, hour and a half up to two hours of activity a day. That doesn't mean exercise, it just means making your food and doing stuff. And you're a good sedentary type work person. You'd be good for secretarial brain stuff.

If you have up to, I've seen up to 14 activity rings, and those are athletes. A lot of children are misunderstood. They're written off or concluded that they're ADD or ADHD. These are normally sports type people. There's nothing wrong with them, but the pharmaceutical industry knows that if they're hyperactive all their life, and you can convince a doctor, and the doctor convinces the mother that they need to be on drugs to calm them down, instead of being in a sport and heavy physical activity, they're going to have a drug user for eternity, for their life. And that's what happens to a lot of kids right now. Four million children in this country are on medication because they've been diagnosed as ADD or ADHD, hyperactive. And all they are is very active sports people, and their body produces those hormones. I had one woman come to me here in Chicago, or a couple come to me in Chicago with her, I think she was a 10-year-old girl. I shot her eyes, and then was just reading the eyes to the parent, not looking at the little girl, after that time of just shooting her eyes. One time I looked around and she was holding on to the chair like this, going like this, and by the end of the almost 70 minutes, I got to the very last thing I read is when I'm doing the diet to find out whether somebody should eat white meat or red meat and how much, I look at the activity rings. The more activity rings, the less red meat. So I said, this little girl should never eat red meat. She'll be hyperactive. She has more activity rings than I've ever seen. Usually I see 11 is the highest, and my professional athletes that I consult, they have 11, and even one's a Hall of Famer, 11. She had 14, and I said, this little girl, you should never expect her to be normal. She is a highly physically active individual. You should not put her in a regular school. She needs to go into either a military type school or a professional sports school that is going to teach professional athletes from a young age. She needs to exercise 15 minutes out of every hour, otherwise you're not going to get her brain to focus. She's a very bright, focused young girl because she has three activity rings in her brain as well as 14 in her body. Most people have one in their brain. People like Hillary Clinton have four. Lots of the females who are very up there in the man's world have three to four activity rings in their brain. She had three, so I knew she was bright and an athlete. So I said, that's the way you're going to do it. And they said, that's why we brought her. And I looked at her and she's wringing that chair like this. I held her up for 70 minutes. She was about to go crazy sitting there all that time. And I said, that's your key. You have to understand that she is a human athlete. 15 minutes of exercise an hour if you want her to be focused mentally. Because those physical hormones take over, over any mental. It's a physical first.  They say all brawn and no brains. Well, she's got both. But the brain will never have its release unless she can get rid of enough of those physical hormones to allow the brain hormones to take effect.

Of course, if she's a quarterback or a pitcher or something like that, then she'll be in heaven. So I said, do you have her in tennis, soccer, volleyball? Volleyball is not as good because you're not active all the time. You've got to wait for the serve and all of that. But soccer, hockey, basketball, those are the sports she should be in. We put her through all those and she likes baseball. I said, well, she better be the pitcher. That's what she loves. She loves to pitch. Now we've got somebody who's got that brain, constant physical, got the brain and the body working together. Perfect. I said, but now you need to put her in a school that's going to train her that way for her life. So she gets all that physical exercise every hour. So when you see that in your family and people around them, give them a hand. It's a physiological problem. It's not a psychological problem. It's not a chemical disorder that the pharmaceutical industry wants you to believe, so you've got them hooked on for life. They put my son on them at six years old. He still has a drug problem because of that. They taught him to control his behavior with drugs, and if he doesn't get them from the medical profession, he'll get them from the street. And he's 42 years old. He's in jail again. He'll do the diet, he'll eat the raw meat, he eats the raw eggs, and then every two and a half years he'll go off for six months and back into the crack cocaine and back in jail. I couldn't even bail him out this last time. They wouldn't let him out. That was it. And the pharmaceutical industry condemned him that way, the medical profession. I didn't know any better. Of course, he wasn't with me at that time. I didn't know any better, though. I didn't know to say, no, don't get him Ritalin. A psychologist, psychiatrist, a woman who did both doctors in San Diego gave me a report and showed that 82 to 86% of the people who've been diagnosed crack cocaine addicted had been on Ritalin as children. Good connection there in the Bush family who ran cocaine into this country heavily to support the CIA when Bush was the head of the CIA for 30 years. That is when that set up and all that cocaine. That's when my son got started getting addicted to it. So you have to understand that those people who are running the world do not want you to be healthy and together. They want you dependent on bad food, bad medication, bad everything. So you keep consuming and can't change their world. They can run it exactly how they want to. If you turn it around and you run your life, you can start changing the world and your environment and your laws just like I have. The raw milk laws, I helped change in seven states. I even got, last year when I lobbied in Washington in June and July, I got a doctor, Ron Paul, senator from Texas, to write a raw milk bill. He says anybody who wants raw milk, no matter what I believe about it, should have the right to raw milk.

But he believes, even as an MD, that raw milk is healthy. So we wrote a raw milk bill and it should be coming to vote right after the elections. Of course, did everybody see that news article out of Russia? The Bush administration, Bush himself, sent an announcement to the British Parliament saying that it was going to suspend elections and declare October a financial emergency, something like that, and suspend elections indefinitely. So, financial emergency month. So it's going to suspend elections in America. So we'll see what happens in the next eight weeks, won't we? So what happens if that happens? Guess who stays in office as a continued dictator? Bush and his loyal cronies, and his war cronies. How many people know that their family owns most of Carlisle Group? Do you know what Carlisle does? They sell military weapons and machines to other countries. Not America, not Europe, but countries like Iraq, Iran, all those third world countries. It sells tanks, ammunition, everything. So every time a bomb goes off, they make a million dollars. Every time a tank gets blown up and they sell another, it's two million dollars. That's profit on each one. So they love war. That's why every time a Bush gets in office, there's a war. And this was an illegal war. They made trillions of dollars. This is Iraqi war. Then they run their other buddies into there and run the country of Iraq. And who are those? Five companies that are part of those big families that are now making all the money off of Iraq. So it's a big rat race out there. So anyway, back to diet and food. So that intestinal environment, the E. coli, is very important for the health and welfare of your brain and nervous system. If you are depressed, if you're paranoid, it's because of a poor intestinal environment. Get your E. coli up. A lot of people eat high meat. I talk about it in my recipe book. If you eat meat that's been pre-digested by bacteria and it stinks and it's foul, like the Eskimos showed me, it's pre-digested. It does what the E. coli does. So you eat it and ten, twenty minutes later you're in heaven. You're laughing, you're not depressed, everything's great. Everything's hunky-dory. Even though it stinks bad, if you opened your bowel, you know how foul it would smell? It would smell just like that. But it doesn't make your whole body stink like that unless it's cooked foul food. Cooked foul food that putrefies will make your skin stink just like it does in the bowel. But when it's raw it doesn't have that effect because once the fat, and it's in the fat that stinks, fat cells. Once those fat cells have been broken down again and reabsorbed, the odor disappears. Everybody has bad body odor. Why? Because of the synthetic flavorings and fragrances in food. To make strawberry ice cream smell like strawberry ice cream after it's so processed, they put an artificial perfume in it. That is plastic, fat plastic molecules. The fat, the dye that they feed salmon that's farmed isn't even a food substance, created by the University of Washington. Because anybody who saw the first year that salmon came out that was farmed, the meat was gray. It wasn't pink and rich. Nobody was going and buying it. They looked at it and said, oh my god, it looks diseased. 

So they lost a fortune those first two years. So they paid a fortune for the State of Washington to develop a food coloring that they could give to these fish to make their flesh look rich and alive. The report came out about three years ago and I saw the report that when it's passed through the human body, it is not even a food substance. It can't be absorbed and causes lots of toxicity and it's a form of plastic that has a BPA and other kinds of toxic substances that can cause damage in the system. But they don't care. They just want you to buy whatever they can make money with. They want to farm salmon. Hey, who cares what happens to you. It's the way it goes. It's like 99% of the organic chicken you will find out there is not really organic chicken. Rosy organic chicken isn't organic chicken. What they do is they feed it 85% soy. The soy in a bird and a human has to be processed and sterilized because there's a toxin in raw soy that will kill humans and kill any poultry, any kind of bird. So they have to highly process it. So even if your soybean is grown organically, once they finish treating it as a feed, whether for human or birds, it is no longer organic. So I called Rosie on that, I talked with the chemist, I also talked with the head of the company, the CEO, and I said this is the situation. He said well the FDA allows us to call it that. I said, where's your morals? Your public out there thinks that this is organic and it doesn't have kerosene, kerosene derivatives. Remember kerosene is natural, you know that kerosene is natural, so is crude oil. Would you eat either? Would you soak your peaches for 25 minutes, 29 minutes in kerosene derivative and then eat it? No. Well basically that's what you're doing when you eat any of those processed foods like soy. They have to be chemically treated with a wood alcohol base, sure wood alcohol is natural, but it's not healthy and it causes damage in the human body. So is a kerosene derivative. Natural, all natural. You have to understand when a lot of these supplemental and food companies go to a laboratory, they say we want something all natural, has to be from food, has to be from natural sources. Because the people who want these products are not chemists and are delving into the finite processes of production, they don't have a clue that what they're getting is not healthy nor good. Any supplement has to be processed this way. But most of it, when they go to these companies to make these, these chemical companies, to have their supplement produced, you'd have to grow your own fields of food, then you'd have to process them to extract. Do you know how much a bottle of vitamins would cost, of 100 vitamins? Probably about $2000. So what they do is, these chemical companies go to Purina, General Mills, Kellogg's, buy their food waste, it's already been chemically processed in 90 ways, and they said this is a food source, they'll treat it with natural, usually with a kerosene derivative rather than some other derivative, and you think it's natural and it's clean and all from good food. It isn't. It's all trash. Every bit of it. Every vitamin supplement out there. So you want a magic bullet? You're not going to get it. There are no such thing as magic bullets. Sure, they can make you feel good, they can suppress symptoms, how do they do that?

Let's say you have a sore shoulder and I punch you in the nose, is that shoulder going to bother you? That's the way vitamins work. They go and poison the blood stream and the intestinal tract, the body takes all of its energy, stops the detoxification wherever you're at pain, and that's what pain is. It's a swelling of the area from having added nutrients go into the area to cleanse and heal the area. If you have poor quality nutrients in your blood, in your lymphatic system, neurological system, the swelling is going to be grandiose and cleansing and healing won't happen properly. So all it does is make everything toxic so all your body ignores those other areas that it was dealing with. 

[audio cut]

A: So rather than digestive tract now, you've dumped your feces. Now, in the planet out there, other animals can go eat the feces. Insects, birds, rodents, roaches, all kinds of animals eat fecal matter. That's because fecal matter is not really toxic. It's just the substances that did not get completely digested and they are fodder for other creatures. So what have I found? Well, let's take a look at the work of Dr. Arab who got her doctorate at the University of Toronto from using fecal matter. She used the verotoxin produced by E. coli to do what? Completely dissolve human brain tumors in 2 to 5 days. You mean shit will do that? If I eat shit, I can dissolve tumors in my body? Absolutely. Don't eat it of humans, they are very toxic. Don't eat of any dog or any cat that is domesticated because those are toxic. Any creature that eats processed food is toxic and diseased. Those are not fecal matter that are non-contaminated. Those are contaminated but they are not contaminated with bacteria like you are taught. They are contaminated with chemicals. The whole structure of making you afraid of your own body and bacteria and blaming bacteria for disease is the pharmaceuticals way of controlling you. They killed Popeye last year with their spinach E. coli thing. Hello? We have been raising spinach and other crops in shit for how many years? And all of a sudden now it is killing people? Give me a fricking break. So three biochemists and I visited three of the areas where they said the 0157H7 appeared, E. coli appeared, the dangerous E. coli. We did not find one of those 0157H7 in any of those fields. And we took probably 87 samples, about 87, 89 samples. I will say 87 because I know it is better than saying more. 87 samples at least. Not one 0157H7 did we find. In fact, in all of the cases I never found a 0157H7 in anything. Only place I got one was a friend of mine at a university in Northern California was given it by the FDA. Now where did the FDA find this thing? Did it manufacture it? It certainly looks genetically modified. It does not look like any E. coli you find in nature. So is this something they created like AIDS where they spread it out and say this is your problem? See this proves that bacteria is our problem of disease. It isn't. Bacteria digests our food. Bacteria are janitors. Do you know that you used to have 8600 varieties of salmonella that lived on your skin and ate your skin when you didn't bathe? Our ancestors didn't bathe. They go months without a bath or a shower. What took the skin off of their, the dead skin off of their bodies? The salmonella. You had 1600 varieties in your nose. Some have been estimated up to 2300 just in your nose to keep it clean. So why are we told the salmonella is a bad guy? Because they want you to believe that it's not the industry, industrial chemicals that are causing disease. They want you to believe that nature is causing it. So then you'll use more chemicals and use more chemicals. Antibacterial this, antibacterial that. Antibacterial blankets for your children. What are antibacterial blankets made of?

Plastic fibers. Do you want your baby breathing plastic fibers as they lint? What's it going to do to the baby? Well you can get a comparison. In Vietnam the American government so screwed up the economy of that government and China was too poor to really help them and bring them back, to supply them ammunition for the Vietnam War that everybody's looking for simple and easy in Asia more so than other places. So they sell them what? Plastic clothes very cheaply. When I was in Saigon, Hanoi, all the major cities that I went to, 90% of the women went around in plastic pajamas as normal everyday wear. Something we see as pajamas, they see as normal wear for women. So they're running around in plastic pajamas, living and eating and sleeping and breathing and working in this plastic material. The rate of lung cancer in the major cities in Vietnam is five times higher than anywhere else in women only. The men still wear silk and cotton. Take a look at that. That's what happens when you breathe plastic fibers. Even rayon which is said to come from pine needles. Do you know what you have to do to make pine needles into a fiber? You basically have to use polymers and all kinds of other plastic resins to bind them and make them that way. It isn't like cotton or silk, you just spin it and then you've got fibers. You have to break that stuff down to a powder and it's like press board. Sure press board is made of wood, why is it so toxic? Look at plywood. The mothers for organic living and welfare of children, whatever that organization is, they have outlawed plywood as outgassing for 15 years. So if your child's room is made with plywood, rip it out. Rebuild it. Get rid of the plywood. That's what they say. Because it will damage your children as they grow and live in that room because it will outgas up to 15 years. Press board is worse. It has more of those same chemicals that are used in plywood to glue it all together to bind it all. Plastic fibers in clothes are the same thing. Don't wear anything that isn't, you know, silk or cotton or animal, furs and leather, stuff like that. Even your hemp is a problem. Why? Because it has heavy tars in them, vegetable oils that crystallize in the human body. So hemp is not a good thing.

Q: Bamboo?

A: Bamboo is a horrible thing. It is too hard to be a good fiber so they have to beat it and treat it with a chemical to soften it. And your bamboo has a tendency to mold so they put anti-molds in it. Formaldehyde mostly. All of your bamboo cutting boards, heavy in formaldehyde and strychnine. You want a cutting board, don't get one that's pieces, you get a chop of one board, not something that's been glued together. You can go to any hardwood shop and get a scrap of wood. It will cost you very little. Say give me a hardwood, you know something that's very hardwood and just give me a certain size of board. Whenever you have scraps of, very easy. Don't get something out of a store, they're all glued together and the glue is the problem. Unless it's bamboo, then you've got treatment and glue problems. Remember, bamboo is in slats so when they glue it all together and put it into slabs of material, it is predominantly plastic, predominantly glue, not healthy. So I'm going to get into bacteria, parasites and fungus next, but we're going to go ahead and take a break now.

[break]

Q: Sherry was messing with the thermostat, maybe she turned it up too high.

A: Oh, were you guys all cold? Are you really?

Q: I'm not cold.

A: I used to be always cold and freezing and in pain. Now I'm a horse. Okay, I was going to talk about bacteria, but I think I'll talk about the glands first. So we start in the pituitary. Pituitary we know has to do with growth hormones to an extent, but I want you to be aware that the endocrine glands that secrete hormones directly into the bloodstream for immediate activity are always for emergency purposes. Just like adrenaline is for emergency purposes, fight or flight. Not for normal, regular activity. Normal, regular activity for an athlete is normal, regular activity and adrenaline shouldn't come into it. If you're healthy and work properly. All the endocrine glands are for emergency purposes. So let's say something happens to a child during growth. Say the child gets injured, the mother and the family is attacked and the baby gets damaged. The baby's nutrients are going to go toward repairing that bruised tissue, those damaged cells. Pituitary will come into effect at that time, increase the growth hormone potentiality so the body doesn't have to use a lot of its proteins and fats to organize and develop them as it would normally do. All the glands do the same thing and I will go down and list them as we go through them. Now the pineal gland or pineal gland, tomato tomato, however you pronounce it, nobody really knows what it does. You can't seem to find any direct reaction or change in the system. The mystics, your yogis, people like that say it's the seat of consciousness. It's how we stay connected in our dream state to other realities. And it helps us with intuition come through. I don't know. Nobody knows. So we'll have to skip that gland, except just to mention it. So as we go down, we have the thyroid and parathyroid. You have a thyroid in each side, and two parathyroids in that cartilage there. The parathyroids are very tiny, really tiny. Some are as small as BBs and some are as big as pellets, but they're still very small. Now the thyroid does what? The thyroid makes sure that we continue breathing and the heart keeps beating in emergency. It isn't keeping your hair from falling out. It's not keeping you from losing weight. That's a pharmaceutical's way of trapping you into taking medication so your hair won't fall out, so your lungs function properly, or you'll lose weight, and it has nothing to do with that. Again, it's protection of the lungs, the bronchioles, and the heart to keep them beating and moving at all times in case of emergencies. We are so sick, we're so debilitated, we are in emergency state almost all the time, so our bodies are using these glands on a daily basis, sometimes hourly, just so we can function, and this is not a healthy state. That is how toxic we are, that is how sick and unhealthy we are. So we go down, we have the thymus gland resting right there at the lungs. It is a backup for the thyroid and parathyroid. The parathyroids are already backup for the thyroid, but what is more important? The lungs and the heart. You can be in a state of coma, but as long as your heart and your lungs are functioning, you will not die. That is how important those three glands, separately by name, protect the lungs and the heart. 

Then we go down to the adrenal glands, and the adrenal glands are the fight or flight type of thing, but we are using them normally just to have energy, and it is not normal. It is common with ill health and fatigue, but it is not normal to normal energy levels, to healthy energy levels. Then we have the gonads, and they are for reproduction, of course, and that certainly is an emergency. We would not have a human race without them. And I mean a race. For Sherry, I was going to say she is sure doing her job... 

Q: But she doesn't have any balls.

A: So, but she has gonads, just ovaries, not testicles. So, again, the testosterone, the estrogen production, again, is for emergency purposes. It is not for a daily, everyday thing. You don't have to have a high testosterone level to have a sexual appetite. Sexual appetite is normal and healthy, not exceedingly active sexual level like a lot of people have because of the excess testosterone or estrogen or even adrenaline that can be utilized as a sexual drive type of hormone reaction. So, again, the endocrine glands, when the pharmaceutical industry says, oh, you've got a low thyroid, say thank you. That's good. As long as I'm not lying in bed unable to breathe and my heart's not pumping, you don't have a thyroid problem. But if they want you to take it, especially women, oh, it's going to stop your hair from falling out. Nothing's going to stop your hair from falling out but stopping the poisons from going through the brain, leaving through the skull. But we want them to go that way. We want to get rid of them. So if they cause follicle damage, they cause follicle damage. If aluminum comes out and destroys the para-aminobenzoic acid, which destroys the pigmentation of your hair and your hair turns gray, that's the way it's got to be. So you get it out. If you want to mitigate that, you get bone marrow and rub it into your scalp. Now, I've only experimented with bone marrow over the years, mainly internally. It's got stem cells in it. People know what stem cells are? They're like growth hormones from the pituitary. They allow for rapid...

Q: I have a message for you. Sorry to interrupt everybody.

A: A directive. What time is it now?

Q: 4.17.

A: Pardon?

Q: 4.17.

A: 4.17. Would somebody let me know when it's 6.15?

Q: Sure.

A: Okay. That's when I have to start the mini consults. So I have to be finished by then. Okay. Bone marrow. Bone marrow. So bone marrow and stem cells. Stem cells can't... Certain kinds of stem cells can become any type of cell. Heart cell, eye cell, gonad cell, skin cell, bone cell. They can become anything. They're shape shifters. They say that adult stem cells can't do that, but I've seen that they can. The stem cells are made from good raw food, good raw meats. However, when they're not, they don't produce good shape shifting ability and they're more limited in production. They say the embryo cells are the only ones that shape shift in any form. That's because they want to use the waste first and stuff like that, whether it's placenta or an actual aborted fetus. They want to use that waste product to make a lot of money because the amount of miscarriages every year is astronomical in the United States. The profit a hospital can make by selling that back to a lab to make stem cells is astronomical. They want that money, so that's why they keep pushing. Of course, there are factions out there that are using the moral thing and not letting that happen. But that's still not a way that we should go get stem cells. Just get bone marrow. My hair has been growing back very gradually ever since I had chemotherapy. When I had a few patches and it all came back in gray. I'm getting [unintelligible] for the first time. Oh, this is nothing but... I don't know whose that is. Okay, somebody here at Whole Foods wanted information about this. So, the hair has been growing back very slowly, gradually as I get healthier every year. Of course, when you have chemotherapy and I had AZT, it was outlawed the year after I had it as too toxic for humans. It was killing most everyone. So, that was in 1968 when they outlawed it. I had it in 1968. They outlawed it at the end of 1968. So, guess where they brought it out of the vaults? For AIDS. No testing or anything, just threw it on the people with AIDS and killed them. Killed 90% of all the people with AIDS, who went to doctors. All those people who didn't go to the doctors, they're still alive. Out of the 237 couples that have been together anywhere from 8 to 27 years after diagnosis of AIDS, the other one of the couple, even with unprotected sex all these years, have never gotten AIDS. So, they're just not contagious. Absolute malarkey. was manufactured at UCLA in the laboratories to study cancer in laboratory animals because it caused cancer in laboratory animals. And it was given to the War Department and the Dr. Stretcher tracked it to the War Department. And the War Department, the Defense Department, Langley, decided that they were going to experiment with it in an undesirable part of society in America. And they decided on the homosexual population. So they thought, how can we get this into the homosexual population? So they found that in Los Angeles, New York City, Houston and San Francisco, that 90% of the people who contracted hepatitis were homosexuals because of the drug use, damaging the livers.

So they put in the hepatitis B vaccine. That's why 10% of the population was not homosexual. This is all documented in a book called Bioattack Alert. It's in the bibliography of my book, We Want to Live, Bioattack Alert. So about three months after that book was written, and thank God it got published, the writer of that book was a high-powered attorney, never had a depressed day in his life, and the senator who helped him get all the information from the War Department because they wouldn't give it to him even on a freedom of information basis, both of them were dead after that book was written and published. But the brother who was the doctor that discovered that information published it anyway. But you won't find it in any store. You have to go right to him to get it, to the doctor. I've given that address in the book so you can get the book. Of course they don't want all that known. How did AIDS get into Africa? The US government and UK government, British government, in their military donated 125 million smallpox vaccines infected with AIDS. 125 million. Over 75 million were given and everyone who got the hepatitis vaccine, everyone got AIDS. If you want to look at that statistic, you look under Leonard Horowitz who's got five doctorates or four doctorates. And he'll give you the information about Ebola and why, and how that's also a manufactured disease, and all the other ones that were given to Africa. And what they did was, if anybody's read the confessions of an economic hitman, that's the same way they did. It's to take over the resources of those African countries. They put them in dire straits with disease. The British and American government says, we'll give you all this medical help and we can cure your AIDS with no intentions of curing it, but you will owe us a phenomenal amount of money and you have to pay it back. Of course they couldn't pay it back, so they took over the resources. Twenty-seven of those African countries are now run by the World Bank for the United States government and Britain. It's called, you know, it's called bacterial warfare for the profit of the resources of those countries. So, it's an ugly thing, but greedy people play those games, and they're true and real. So don't worry about AIDS, you can't get it unless it's injected in you. If you get somebody else's blood, you're taking a big chance. If you get any injection from any medical source, you're taking a big chance. You don't know what's in those vaccines. You don't know what anybody's put in them, and there's never anything good about the vaccines. Every injection, no matter what it is, whether it's a vaccine or an antibiotic, when it's injected, there are at least five chemicals that are dangerous in it. The most common are thimerosal, liquid thimerosal, which is liquid mercury. They have twelve different names for that, to trick you. One they call, it's an antiseptic, one they call an antibacterial, and another one they call it a preservative. And there are different names, about four different names for each of those categories. But it's all the same thing, liquid, toxic, neurotoxic, mercury. Then they put liquid aluminum, ether, formaldehyde, and a detergent. 

Every injection that there is. If I put that into a blender with a rotten egg and offered it to you, would you drink it? That's what a vaccine is. They grow mostly a disease in rotten eggs, and then mix those other things in it, and then there you have it, you inject it into your body. Hello? Because you've been conditioned to think that that's a good thing to do. And it's insanity. They can trick you that easily, because they don't tell you what's in it. If I told you, since I told you, how many people would go out and get an injection? I don't see one hand up. I agree, I wouldn't do it either, ever. Nobody's ever going to stick me with anything again, regardless. And if I ever had an accident where they had to put an IV in me, which I had to do about two years ago, when I had a bladder stone that was the biggest one that anybody's ever seen in the world, because it had been growing since I was three years old. And the core of it was liquid mercury, from all the vaccines that I had and all the tetanus shots. Because I was getting a tetanus shot like average of every six months, even though they were supposed to be good for a year. Now they say tetanus shots are good for five years. They can't make up their mind. When they want more money, they don't last as long, of course. Then you get more. So I wrote in my agreement an analysis of when I was going to go under, if they were going to put an IV in me, because they wouldn't do it without an IV. I said that if there is anything other than the sugar water, the glycogen, in the IV, that they would be sued and they would lose millions of dollars and they would agree to it. Let me tell you, the hospital and the doctor fought me. I said, why are you worried? If what you are going to give me doesn't have all that stuff in it, anything that you say it shouldn't, why would you be afraid? And I said, I get to the end of the bottles of each one, you have to save them for me, because I'm going to have them analyzed. So you know I got taken care of. You know I got taken care of, because I would have owned the hospital and I would have owned the doctor and the anesthesiologist. But they weren't allowed to inject me, they weren't allowed to put anything in there. They weren't allowed to inject me with anything else. All they needed was the sugar water to make sure I didn't have a cardiac arrest. That was the only thing that was limiting. So I said, okay, that's the only thing limiting, you have to agree to this other stuff. I'm just going to get the sugar water and that's it. Because the sugar water made me crazy for a couple of days. But you know, I had them drip it, a very small drip, and if there was any kind of signs of emergency, they could turn it up, and that's all they could do. So I had them by the balls, they had me by the balls. Literally, because...

Q: So they put you out?

A: Yeah, they had to put me out, definitely. How did you react to that? They had metal tubes that were going to go up that little bitty penis hole. You better believe I was going under. I couldn't be awake for that. No way.

Q: How did you react to that?

A: React to being put out?

Q: Yeah.

A: Oh, well I ate within, they say don't eat within 12 hours, something like that. I was eating eggs up to an hour before, so I had my body all ready for all that. So it didn't really bother me. I was a little hyper for a few days, a little off, a little disoriented, but I knew what to eat before.

Q: Did you contain all those other substances that you said?

A: I didn't let them in. No, not an IV, usually sugar water.

Q: No, no, but whatever they used to knock you out, did that contain all of that other stuff?

A: No, that was a pure, I chose the belladonna oriented medication to put me under. So it did have a slight amount of it in there, but I knew that I was aided, ate properly to handle that with the eggs and I had cheese. I didn't vomit, I didn't have a problem because it wasn't cooked food, I was eating.

Q: Were you nauseous?

A: When I woke I was a little nauseous, so I had the cheese immediately with me, so I started eating the cheese in the room. But that stone was the largest one they'd ever seen, they'd never seen one that had grown for 50 years, and they said it was at least 56 or 58 years that it had been growing. It just came to that point, 59 years old, all of a sudden I couldn't pee. You know, I had to go like this to get the stone to move aside and pee like a dog, literally, that's right. I'd go into an air court and I'd go like that, people would look, oh this guy is out of his mind, but that's the only way I could pee. You know, usually bladder, kidney stones, if they've got a laser up there, and what they have to say, four tubes that go up this big cylinder that they inflate the poor penis, you know, the urethra, they stretch it this big around, literally. So that little bitty hole gets stretched enormously. So they have four tubes that go up there, one's a scope where they can see what they're doing, another was a laser to blast it apart, another was a hose shooting in water, and the other was a vacuum to pull it out as they were blasting it to pieces. So usually a stone takes five, three minutes to blast apart. They're usually small. It took them almost two hours to blast this one because it was solid metal in the center. That's how they knew it had grown so long in my system. But it took fifty-some years, fifty-nine years or fifty-seven years. He figured it had been growing since I was two or three years old. That's how long it took me to have problems to get so big. And my bladder walls were real thick from the irritation and now they're nice and thin, normal. But I had to go through the operation to get there. But I also held them by the balls for what they could do to me. And it was on the contract, too. And if they didn't do it, I would sue them, too, because they have to help. And it wouldn't look good in court if they said, well, we can put all these poisons into you. That's not going to look good in any trial. So I had them by the balls and they had me by the balls because I was going under. But I also had a nurse that I had befriended that backed me up to watch everything. So I took care of myself. But otherwise than that, I don't let anybody inject me with anything. I'll donate my blood sometimes to a situation like an infant who has the same blood type as I will, if they're on the diet and need help for whatever reason. A child was born to a mother who had drugs or other problems, smoking or something like that during pregnancy. It could cause some anemia problems. So I remember one mother remodeled her house during the whole pregnancy. I said, this diet is not a miracle. You're dealing with asbestos when you're tearing out the old walls and you're dealing with all these toxic substances. It's going to affect the baby.

She said, no, I don't think so. So she very rarely wore a mask through six months of remodeling her house while she was pregnant. Her baby died two years old. No explanation, but all the intestinal tract was dehydrated. The baby was completely healthy otherwise. Nobody knew. But all of those particles had gotten into that baby's digestive tract and by the time it was two years old, it had damaged it that much. I mean, nothing is going to get by a lot of these chemicals. So this diet can defend you tremendously, but it's not a magic bullet. You've got to be sensible. Sure, a mask is uncomfortable when you're tearing walls apart and you're rebuilding. You're hot under there, it's uncomfortable. But if you're carrying a baby, even yourself, you're your own baby. You've got to take better care of yourself. Do it slower, some other way, but just don't take your life at such a risk. You will pay later. And I mean, that mother paid. She's still depressed. This is three years later, two years later, and she's still depressed. Two and a half years later, she's still depressed from that. Of course, part of it was all the remodeling and damaged herself as well as her baby. So you have to be rational about things. I'm sure this guy will help, and I'll explain how it helps when we get into that. So let's, we've gone over the glands, now let's take a look at the organs. Now we know what the lungs do. The lungs absorb oxygen, help expel some of the carbon dioxide. But a lot of the carbon dioxide leaves through the skin. Ninety percent of toxins lead through the skin. Remember I said earlier that you lose a lot of toxins in your fecal matter, in your urine. It's not normal. We're not supposed to have toxins. Our feces and urine are supposed to leave and be fertilizer. Do you know what the main fertilizer is on this planet? Urea. Where do they get the urea? Feed lots. Collect the urine, sterilize it, put it into a chemical solution, and then sell it to farmers in these big tanker trucks. Do you know where I get my urea? I collect my own urine, mix it with nine to one, or one urine to nine parts water, and I spread it all over my garden. My plants went from my mint, my spear mint, usually grows about this high. After I started doing that, my spear mint's this high. My lavender bush is about from that door to here, about this high. It's one little lavender plant that I plant. It's enormous. And my mint just grows everywhere. It just grew over my whole backyard. Pretty spectacular. So, what else? Oh, I had one little indoor fern. The fern, it's first year, it stayed its normal size, and I started using my urine and water. And the fern is now from that wall to this wall. Ferns usually grow in sprawls, it's about like this. This one is this high and spreads out all over. It's in a shadier area, but it even grew into the sunny area. It's perfectly healthy. Nine parts water, one part urine. I have well water, but you use whatever water you have. But I've got three acres in my backyard, so I've got a lot to fertilize. I have little jars that I collect it in, and then when I get a couple of gallons and I'll fertilize for a week. 

Q: So if you did it directly, let's say with your three acres and urinate out there, would that happen?

A: Yeah, you'll burn some roots. It's too concentrated, much too concentrated. Most people, what they will do is take that urine and they'll dump it into the compost pile. But I was peeing too much to do that, all into that compost pile. A little too much nitrogen in my compost pile, because I don't have a lot of waste. I live out in the mountains, so the crow, the ravens, and the hawks, and the coyotes, and every other creature eats any of my, any produce that I have, you know, and the meat scraps, everything. So nothing really goes in my compost pile, you know, unless I take cuttings and throw them in. So, anyway, let's get back to urine, feces is not supposed to be toxic. We're not supposed to be dumping toxins. When they leave, they're mostly supposed to leave through the skin. Now we have the bronchioles, you know, where they help the muscles contract and expand in the lungs. It is a cavity where it isolates and allows the changing of chemistry. When it goes out the lungs, because if we had the same chemistry exactly as it reabsorbed into the lungs and expelled it, we'd have the foulest breath. A lot of people do have foul breath because of that. Because a lot of the toxins that release to the lungs, if they're not neutralized by the time they leave the bronchioles, you have very bad breath. So it's a way to mitigate all of those changes in the system, which are only normal to unhealthy people and people who are trying to get healthy and working their way toward health. So then we go down to the liver. And the liver, its only job that it was meant to do was create 60 varieties of bile to make 60 varieties of cholesterol. A third of those cholesterol are to give you energy. A third of those are to lubricate the body. And a third of them are to cleanse the body to make solvents to dissolve toxicity and remove it from the system. And that's all from different cholesterols, fatty substances. So again, what happened? They said for all those years, 30 years they went around saying high cholesterol is bad. High cholesterol is bad. Now they're saying we found fat good, also cholesterol. Without cholesterol you wouldn't function. They don't tell you that. They want you to keep your cholesterol down. What happens if your cholesterol is down? You're not going to have enough fats in the body to take care of things properly. You're going to be deficient in areas. I have a basketball Hall of Famer. You know basketball is probably one of the hardest sports besides soccer. Constant motion, constant motion, constant motion. I've got a Hall of Famer, African American basketball player, and when he was playing his cholesterol stayed at 675. When it would fall, he would not do as well. I had an Olympic gymnast. When hers fell below 375, she'd get very weak and couldn't perform. On a cook diet, at 375 she couldn't work out and perform, but she'd get a cold or a flu every six weeks and be incapacitated for two weeks and couldn't work out.

So they were about to kick her off the team, and then Paul Cohen, who was a famous Olympic champion in the 50s, who was also McEnroe's coach for 10 years, told that coach that they should send her to me and put her on the diet. So I put her on the diet, kept her level at 375, never got cold, never got a flu. She was dispelling the poisons out of the sweat of her body from working out all the time, and she got a gold medal. I can't tell you who it was. She's retired now from that. But people have different levels and different needs for cholesterol. The pharmaceutical will hook you into taking cholesterol medication for your life, because they know if you have a high cholesterol point, it's always going to be high for the rest of your life. Just like high blood pressure. Once you have it, you're going to have it for all of your life, unless you do this diet for 40 years and clean out your arteries and lose excess fat. What is excess fat? She's perfect for me. Fat protects the body, depending upon the individual. Skinny people are in trouble because fat arrests poisons. And if you don't have the fat to arrest these poisons, where do they go? Into the cells to do damage. So, when you say, Aajonus, you're not fat. Yes, I am. I was checked last week and I'm 24.5% fat. I thought it was 23.5% and I went back and looked. I'm 24.5% fat. Do I look it? No. Why? Because fat molecules when they're all are very tiny. When you cook a fat molecule, it swells 10 to 50 times its normal size. You want a comparison of that. What about pork skins? Pork skins are very thin, small. You cook them in oil and they grow up and blow up into these huge molecules of fat. And you're eating this shit. And your fat's going to be enormous. So, I've got all this fat on my body, I look like somebody, maybe a man that has 12, maximum 15% body fat. And I've got double that. Double that. And you can't see it because it's where it should be in the muscles tightly. I don't exercise. You know, I can show you my legs, but you say, yeah, but you've been walking around for eight hours today, so your muscles are going to be very tight and strong in your legs. But this is the only time I walk. And this is all I do with my hands, except for carrying my groceries once a week. And I pull my suitcases, I don't carry those. So you can't accuse me of exercising there. But look at this, solid. And that's just from eating properly. I don't eat garbage fat. I eat fat molecules that are very tiny and stay that way. So I can have a lot of fat on my body and not look at it. Now you take a look at the Maasai tribe. They're built the same way, but they're very skinny. They don't eat the concentrations of fat that I do. They're about 12, you know, 15% body fat. But they're very skinny and very tall. They're also considered the smartest, most ferocious and cunning tribe in the world. And what do they eat? Raw dairy and raw meat. All the tribes in Africa, the Fulani, the Samburu, and Maasai, however you want to pronounce it, eat raw meats and raw dairy. The Fulani lives on 90% raw dairy.

The Maasai and the Samburu, it's similar, not exact, but they eat anywhere from 60 to 65% dairy and about 25% meat and the rest some vegetable juices they'll chew up or things like, you know, wild squash or cucumber. And in the Maasai tribe, because they're so skinny, so fat deficient, it's been a law against eating fruit, high carbohydrate fruit, because they're so skinny. Fruit goes in to utilize fat as fuel, as energy, so you've got to control how much sugar you intake, you ingest. So then we go to the gallbladder. Now this little thing about the size of your thumb, sometimes it gets swollen and large. What is the gallbladder? The gallbladder is just a storage for excess bile. It doesn't manufacture bile, the liver does that. But let's say you're a caveman, you kill an animal and you've got 10 pounds of fat on that animal and you know it's going to go off and you want to eat it all at one time because you've been starving for food for days anyway, so you've got to eat 10 pounds in about 24 hours. Your liver can produce enough bile to digest about a pound of fat a day. So if you ate 10 pounds of fat in 24 hours, what are you going to get? Diarrhea if you don't have bile. So the gallbladder is a storage for that. So you have plenty of bile in those situations. If you didn't have the excess bile, the gallbladder, and you ate ice cream, you'd all have diarrhea every time you ate it. Maybe with the plastic ice cream nowadays, it probably wouldn't happen. But when you have true ice cream, there's a lot of cream in that. Without the bile, you'll just have diarrhea. It'll just lose it and pass through you. Then we go over to the pancreas. Now we're told that the pancreas handles sugars. That's just one finite job of the pancreas. And if you look at the human compared to the gorilla, we don't consume much carbohydrate. So what does the pancreas do if it isn't handling a lot of sugar? It reconstructs enzymes. It helps the body address and reconstruct the foods that it's digesting. When we got into cooked foods, it also produces hormones that go out and visit cells and it's like thugs saying, give me some of your vitamins, enzymes, proteins, fats, anything that's unadulterated. Give me a little bit of your pennies in your bank account. We're going to use them for this toxic cooked food in the intestinal tract. So the pancreas is responsible for being the mafia and leeching from the people, from the cells, because the whole of the body is eating garbage food. The pancreas is very important for that. That's one of its major assets, its major functions. Of course, medical profession doctors and scientists say, oh, well, when you eat cooked foods, all of a sudden these enzymes appear. You know, it's money growing on trees, right? How many people believe money grows on trees? That's what they believe about these enzymes, all of a sudden they appear out of nowhere. No, the pancreas has gone through a process of leaching it out of every cell a little at a time, spending your bank account. So when you get up to 60, 70 years old, you're down to the bottom in a lot of people. 

And some people, it takes until they're 90 to get that way. And a few people, a tiny few of them, they get to 100. But how old should we be living?  All other animals live seven times the times it takes them to finish maturation. We finish maturation at 21 years old, so seven times 21 is 147. So we should be living to about 150 years old. We're not even living half that. Why? Because of our diets and industrial pollution. People are dying and you think they're great because they're living to 100 years old and going around feeble? It's not healthy. In the Andes and the tribes and in Samuru and Fulani, they're cultivating, they're riding horses, they're taking cows a thousand miles through the desert to a watering hole every year, 90 and 100 and 110 years old. In Georgia, Russia, there was an article in National Geographic in February 1971 or 72 that showed these Georgia Russians living to 168 years old. Can you imagine having been married to the same person for 97 to 115 years and you still like them? That's health. These people ate shit as a major part of their diet because some of them didn't have the land to have the chickens and stuff like that, so they would eat buffalo shit. Why? Because the buffalo had pre-digested the food and its waste was not toxic, it was pre-digested vegetation. Now in the human body, it's impossible to digest vegetation. We have a short digestive tract. An herbivore has one two and a half times longer than ours, plus they have 60,000 times more enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to get the fats and the proteins from that cellulose. We don't have that. Ours is mainly acidic. The bacteria, everything is to break down animal matter, not vegetation. But when the herbivore dumps it out at his manure, it's acidic. We can eat it. We can digest it. So these tribes were eating shit. Eat shit and live. So these things are not meant to be toxic. We can utilize anything. We can adapt to any diet, but how can we adapt to one healthfully? These people in Georgia, Russia still consume mainly raw milk. But if they didn't have the protein, they'd eat buffalo shit. The first time I saw it was on a National Geographic thing way back in the 70's when I saw it on TV. I forgot who was showing it at that time. I think it could have been Walt Disney who was sponsoring that. Anyway, you see this black haired woman with blue eyes, rich color, you can tell she gets some sunshine, a lot of sunshine. She's Caucasian though with dark skin, reddish, really reddish skin. And the camera backs away and you see her hands and it looks like maybe she's eating chocolate. She's smiling at the camera, looking into the camera, and the camera pulls away and you see this buffalo tail swishing in the background and then, you know, water buffalo. And then you pull away even more and she's got a big glob of kind of, you know, grassy, you know, strawy, you know, brown stuff in her hands.

You pull away and you see she's a diminutive woman, probably about five foot tall. And she's there, the fecal dump that this water buffalo had left was twice as big as her head and she's eating out of it, happy as can be. Now take a look at that. This animal predigested 70%, 60 to 70% of it. But when they discard it, there's still that much that they don't digest. Then other creatures, insects, other animals eat it or it breaks into the soil, gives the soil its great bacteria and then it grows plants. So it always is giving to life. It's not supposed to be toxic. Our waste is extremely toxic, very toxic. So don't eat any human waste. Don't eat any fecal matter from a domesticated animal. I don't care about an animal. I don't care if it's on a farm. They could be getting shot with hormones, antibiotics, fed antibiotics, all that stuff. So if you're going to do it, that's the way to do it. And I've had some cancer patients, even on this diet, I couldn't get their tumors to shrink and they would grow just a little bit every year. But still, that isn't what I want. I want to break it down and remove those dead cells that a tumor is. A tumor is a collection of dead cells because the body has the inability to dissolve dead cells and remove them from the body. And it's mainly a lack of digesting fats the proper way. The proper fats for dissolving toxicity in the body. Fecal matter with this so-called verotoxin, according to Dr. Arab from Toronto University, 30 years ago started using the verotoxin produced by E. coli in the bowel of a herbivore to shrink brain tumors in two to five days. Think about that. So I have people in situations where they don't reverse their cancer readily within two and a half years, they're not reversing it. I tell them to eat shit. And live. And they do. All of a sudden, the one that I noted in my recipe book, you know, I mean hers wasn't reversing, she had 15 or 16 hard rock tumors in her breast, she was only 28 years old when she came to me, breast was down to here, she had a tumor in her kidney attached to her adrenal glands and cancer of the hip bone. Dissolving the hip bone. So it wasn't a tumorous, but it was a type of cancer that dissolves itself. That's what cancer should be. Cancer cells, I love cancer cells. Cancer cells are not your problem. Cancer cells have a fluid in them, a dissolving fluid, like a virus. They dissolve dead cells. So when the body's ready to get rid of a tumor, guess who dies? Cancer cells. Set out this fluid, it dissolves all the surrounding dead cells. Because a live cancer cell, you may have one in a hundred, all around dead cells. And you've got circulation through it, blood going through it. In a benign tumor, there's no circulation and there's no fluid. So a benign tumor, the body has to eat away at it from the outside. It could take 30, 50 years to get rid of a benign tumor. But a cancerous tumor can get rid of in days. Usually it takes years, but it can in days. And Dr. Arab proved that in her experiments and tests. Now why aren't they doing that for us? Because no money in it.

Q: Where do you get good fecal matter?

A: What I do is have people contact one of my Amish farmers and say, I want the bowel with the content. You need about two pounds. So they tie it off like, it looks like a sausage when you get it. And you just take about, you know, a two ounce slice of it. And it's good if you eat the bowel with it, you know, this little lining of the intestine, to help your own environment of E. coli, even though they're different from a herbivore to a carnivore. And you eat that amount of fecal matter. And you don't have to eat all of it, that's usually what they'll send you, is a pound or two pound section of it at a time, it's easier than a small where you could tie off the ends and it's too small. So that's what I found. You know, it's cheap. Cheap, you know, compared to anything else. Maybe you pay $10 a pound, but the medication and drugs cost you $80,000, $60,000 in treatment. Which would you rather pay? $20, $30 for the shipping? Or would you rather pay the $30, $80, $90,000, $120,000 for chemotherapy? And that'll kill you anyway, most of the time. 

Q: What about the wild scat in the woods?

A: Pardon?

Q: What about the wild scat in the woods?

A: The problem with that is it's got to be fresh and alive. You've got to get it right away when it dumps or you get it in the intestines. And once you have it wrapped in the intestines, it'll last months in those intestines, still be active. So it's less active once it dries. E. coli dies. Dehydrated. So it stops producing the nutrients that give you the ability, you know, the fats, that give you the ability to dissolve the dead cells. And that's what you want to dissolve those dead cells. That's what cancer is. Dead cells collecting, because you cannot dissolve them anymore. And they're collecting and collecting and collecting and collecting to the point where it creates tumors. And if you don't correct that, the body will keep the build on those tumors until they're obstructing functionality. It's in the lungs, stops the functionality of the lungs. You stop breathing. Esophageal, the worst, cuts off your breathing and eating. So, you send most of the toxins out the skin. That's where the main toxins should go. But we shouldn't be so poisonous that they're causing skin damage and rashes and funguses, and that's fungi, and that's usually what it does when it goes to the skin. It damages the skin cells. If you have a rash, any kind of an outbreak on your skin, it's a good idea to take lime juice and put it on your skin in that given area. For about three minutes, rub it gently. Don't rub it hard. Don't scrub it in. Just rub it gently into that area. Then apply a little bit of coconut cream with a tiny bit of honey in it, and rub that over the area, because when that toxin comes through the skin, it can cause damage to those live skin cells. If you want an example of that, here we have an example. You see the little bit of scarring. You have worm right here. You see this white patch? That's a [unintelligible], and that's what it looks like. It causes a lack of pigmentation and damage to the pyramid, big zoid, absorption, and content of the skin. It causes a white-ish area that looks scarred. Now, if you put the coconut cream, I mean the lime juice on there first, it will coat the toxicity coming through the skin and preventing it from doing as much damage. Then when you put the coconut cream and honey on, that nutrifies that skin, so it doesn't get harmed when those toxins pass through it. Remember that the toxins leave your skin, 90% of them, so your skin will be the last part of your body to heal properly. It will be the most damaged. It gets the remains of everything you eat. It gets the least of everything you eat, your skin, so you need to feed it from the outside. Put coconut cream on your skin. Coconut cream, why? It's a little sticky, but it contains all the water and fat-soluble vitamins and enzymes and minerals. All oils don't. They contain only the fat-soluble, and that's only 8%, 7%, 9% maximum of what is in food. A very small percentage of the oils is in any animal or any product, any plant. Avocado and coconuts are the only exception. Pigs are the exception. Pigs as animals, they're up to about 40% fat. But your avocado and your coconut are up to 80% fat. 

Q: Olives?

A: Olives aren't really meant for us to eat. They have to be processed in an exceptional way to be healthy. They have a lot of strychnine in them, so they have to be aged. You really have to know what you're doing to process olives. It's not something that you can just grow some olives in your yard and expect to not get sick from eating them or even pressing the oil out of them. You really have to know what you're doing. And to really know that, you need to go to Italy or Greece or Turkey, where they're masters at it. So that's a tricky one, so that's not a normal one. Avocado and coconuts are pretty common and no danger there, except for eating too much of them and getting diarrhea or losing your appetite for other foods. That's mainly with the coconut. With the avocado, I've eaten up to ten a day and still haven't been too hungry when I was a vegetarian. Eating seven pounds of nuts a day, just can't get the nutrients out of it. So anyway, back to the skin. Of course the hair follicles, everything is going to be damaged. So you can buffer all that damage by feeding the skin directly from the outside. So let's get into, then we have the, from the pancreas you have the spleen. Now what is the spleen? The spleen holds blood. A lot of doctors tell you that your bone marrow produces red blood cells and white blood cells. Yes, red and white blood cells divide in the bone marrow. Normally they mature in the bone marrow. When they mature, they leave the bone marrow and it's in the bloodstream. Now what does the spleen have to do with all this red blood cells? Well if you got cold, the spleen would dump a lot of red blood cells into your bloodstream, thicken it and you'll be warmer. If you're hot, you'll remove a lot of the red blood cells, thin your blood and you'll be cooler. Because we're so toxic, we have another function that does that and that's the kidneys. Whenever we get cold, the kidneys will help pull a lot of the H2O out of your blood so it gets thicker. When you're cool, it stops dumping, it stops pulling the H2 out of the bloodstream so that the blood gets thinner. So there are two ways to do it. It used to be just the spleen, now the kidneys are functioning to help us cool and heat over the last couple hundred thousand years. And people drink a lot of water and you need to discard it, so the kidneys will help throw it off. Now the kidneys have their function. Also, if you have a spleen, let's say, you know, when you were swinging around in trees, our ancestors, and they fell on a branch and cut themselves open and lost a cup of blood, they would be anemic for up to 60 days if they didn't have a spleen with about two pints of extra blood. So the spleen dumps the blood into the system, the body has 60 days to create the backup of that blood to get more red blood cells back into the system, but the body does not lose its energy and vitality and is not likely to be lunch or dinner because it's anemic.

Some other animal, you know, figure you're pretty weak and all of a sudden the cat comes up and eats you for dinner, you know, so that spleen dumps the blood in there, you've got the vitality, you know, you've had the cut and the bleed, you're still vital, you haven't lost your cells, the cells are needed to propel oxygen into the system to use fat as fuel. And the bladder, that's the station so you're not peeing all the time. It helps collect the urine, the fluid, and the urine. There's a lot of people who drink urine as therapy. In India, because there's so much vegetarianism, they don't process and don't get a lot of protein so they drink the urine to have another chance at that protein to recycle it. Now urine is nothing other than the blood without the red blood cells. That is the job of the kidneys, to eliminate, to filter out the red blood cells only. Otherwise the contents of the urine is the same as your blood. It has all the nutrients, values, all the fat cells, everything that's in your blood except for the little ammonia. That's how it makes ammonia so it can separate and call out the red blood cells to keep them in the system so we're not losing a lot of red blood cells. Red blood cells are too easily lost, hard to reproduce and that little bit of bone marrow we have. I mean we've really got a lot of bone marrow but it's pretty toxic nowadays. Because what? 60 to 70% fat. Another place for toxins to store. Another reason that we're so debilitated. We have so much aluminum that goes into the bone marrow and other metals that the red and white blood cells don't grow up in a healthy environment. So they're only so healthy when they get into the blood stream. They can't carry all the oxygen nor remove the carbon dioxide that they were meant to, the quantity that they were meant to. So another reason we don't have the energy and vitality that we're supposed to. Okay, so that takes care of the body. But you know about the muscles that makes us be able to dance or paint or draw or scream at somebody, fight, do sports, whatever it is. Muscles allow us to have dexterity and to do things. The bones are our skeleton to make sure we can keep in one piece to do everything and have that strength and have those abilities. And we went over all the other systems, the skin, the fluids, connective tissue dumps the poisons out of the skin. So now you know your body. When you've got a problem, you figure out what it's doing. Don't run to some doctor that doesn't know his butt from a hole in the ground. And literally they don't about health. They do not know how the human body functions properly. They only know what they're told by the pharmaceutical industry that wants you to believe the worst of the human body.

But if you know how it functions like you do now, you won't be afraid if they say, oh I'm having a detox, this is what I do, I'm having this kind of detox, I'll go to the book and find out what I should do. And there you've got it. You've resolved your problem. Just be patient. Hippocrates called suffering people patients. You know why? You have to be patient for the system to clean and heal itself. It's not going to happen overnight and don't panic because it lasts longer than you'd like it to and you're suffering. You just have to get through it. If I'm around, you can give me a call if you can't put it together and I'll help you with it. And I take calls from 7 to 9 in the morning when I'm in town. If you've got an emergency, send me an email with emergency at the top, telephone number, the problem and either I'll send you back an email with a number and a time to call me and make sure you call me at that time and at that number because when I travel, I'm gone to different places all the time and I have so many slots to fill. So it doesn't mean you have to call me, it's just that if you do, you call me at the slot that I tell you, that I ask you to call me. And I could be anywhere in the world. So anyway, I can give you my help that way. But most of you are pretty intelligent people and I don't think you'd be so confused. Of course, when you're going through a detox and it's painful and uncomfortable, the mind doesn't work well sometimes so you can use some help. I'll be there to help you if I can. But most of it's in the book. And sometimes when you're in pain like that, it's hard to go through the book page and then you look in the index for this and then that. If you get the downloadable version on wewant2live.com, have it on your computer, then you got every time that word appears, click right to that spot and you've got every part of the book in my books right there at the click of a button. You don't have to leaf through the pages. So that's to make it easier. And it does make it much easier. And let's say you're spending 60 bucks on both books in your computer. You're saving yourself thousands of dollars from hospital and doctor bills. We're talking thousands. Because those people charge two arms and two legs and you don't get anything but more ill health. So think about the value there. Okay, let's get into food. Now I kept hinting about the importance of fat. Fat binds to poisons. So when you have poisons in the body, you need more fat. Like I say, fat, fat, fat, get fat, get fat, get fat, get fat, get happy. If you're not protected, you're going to have damage in your cells. 

[audio cut]

A: Your myelin sheath. Your myelin sheath, what does it do? It buffers the amount of information that gets to the brain. It's the skin on the nervous system and it's the skin on the brain, the myelin. If that gets thin, all this information gets to the brain that doesn't belong in there. You get overwhelmed, you get paranoid, you have all kinds of problems. Psychological, mental, that's big and heavy during PMS. That's very low blood fat level. And the blood fat level needs to be replenished like every two hours. If you're having your period, every two hours you better be drinking or eating some kind of fat. I don't care if it's just an ounce, I don't care if it's two tablespoons, I don't care if it's a half a cup. Every two hours you need to consume it. And that will buffer your PMS. Because toxins are floating incredibly. Because women get to utilize that menstrual period, menstruation period, singing Happy Menstrual. It should be a happy period, but it's not, to get rid of a lot of toxins. Building up a mucus, discharging it out the mucus. Now women produce 20% more mucus and discharge from the menstruation than men don't have that. Women live 20% longer than men do on the average. So you get the tie in there. Women have the ability to discharge a lot of poisons at that time. And of course, if those poisons get into the blood and are unregulated, unharnessed by fat, you're going to have PMS reactions. You're going to be irritable. You're going to be in anxiety. You're going to be fatigued. There's a lot of side effects to that that everybody has to endure, your children, your husband, your boyfriend, whoever it is, and you. So eat the fat more regularly during that time. So fat is so important. Now, the fat from pressed oils is mainly made for detoxification, mainly made for solvents. I'd better go over because I'm going to be touching on some stuff. Let me go into bacteria, parasites, and fungi. Now, they're mainly either digestive or janitorial. I mentioned this earlier. So bacteria goes in and helps you digest food. Listeria, campylobacter, those are digestive processes or digestive bacteria and good for you. Yet, the pharmaceutical industry and the medical industry, oh, listeria causes disease. Campylobacter, salmonella, E. coli, no. Mainly, those bacteria are digestive bacteria. A lot of salmonella are janitors. I mentioned those on the skin, your nose. They help eating up so you're not like a snake. If you didn't have salmonella, we'd be peeling off layers of skin like a snake. Not quite conducive to the activities that we go through. So, I mean, if we're slamming around on the ground, you know, and not using our hands and legs and stuff like that, we just slide, we go to sleep after we eat something. For a few weeks, we wake up and we slide out of that skin. We don't live that way. We're active all the time. So, we can't afford that. So, we have all these salmonella. They eat away dead cells. So, we can function normally. So, our skins can breathe. So, we can get rid of waste products through the skin. 

Bacteria is not harmful unless it's man-made, genetically modified in some way, which mainly the military, now industrial, you know, food generators want to produce all these toxic, genetically produced, cloned animals and products. They want to grow meat without even the organism being alive and breathing. And they're doing it. They're growing... They'll put meat in there and they'll feed it all these synthetic hormones and the meat will grow in a petri dish. And the FDA is ready to license them to allow it. This year they've allowed genetically modified animals to be sold. No labeling. This Bush administration has been the most destructive administration toward public health of any and all times. Terrible, terrible group. So, then parasites. They eat a hundred times, the cleansing parasites that aren't eating the food to help you predigest, like the whipworm, the trichinosis. The others are detoxifying. They can eat a hundred times their weight in a 24-hour period. And their excrement and secretion, which can be food for us or toxins if it's janitorial, we only have to deal with one or two percent of their waste. That's like taking a hundred pounds of waste that we can't break down and we have to break down with solvents, break it down and dissolve it and get rid of it. Would you rather break down the hundred pounds or the two pounds? One or two pounds. Of course, the one or two pounds. Not much work to do that, is it? A hundred pounds is. So those parasites are doing that work. The janitorial bacteria eat about 50 times their weight in 24 hours. So they're half as efficient, but they're very good. Fungi do the same thing. They dissolve it with a mycelium, which is a milky, fluid-looking substance. It dissolves that, it breaks it down into a smaller waste, and you can eliminate it. But the waste is only half reduced. So there's a lot more waste with fungi. That's why when you have fungi coming to the skin, you have a lot of rashes. You have a lot of peeling skin like athlete's foot. There's a lot more waste product. But it's still better than having no help at all. When you have no help at all, the body uses a virus. Do you hear all this malarkey going on? A live virus? A reproducing virus? It's like saying Tide soap reproduces. Give me a fricking break. I mean, 30 years ago, a doctor knew that if you had a virus, there was no antidote for it. There was no antibacterial for it. There was no penicillin you could take because it wasn't alive. It has no nucleus, no respiratory system, no digestive tract, no nothing live. It's just a protein structure like a solvent that dissolves certain kinds of damaged tissue. And there are over 500,000 varieties, 300 to 500,000 varieties of virus depending upon what kind of cell. Cells manufacture virus from fats. So what happens when you take a solvent? You put it, dilute it in some water. You use it to clean up the grease off of your driveway or your garage. And then what do you have left? You have one, half, two, five-gallon tub of toxic fluid, toxic waste. Because there's nothing eating it to reduce it. It's pure soap.

It's pure toxic solvent with your waste product only broken down but mixed in a lot of fluid. What happens? Your whole body is systemically full of this kind of toxic fluid. I'd much rather have the parasite. Second choice would be bacteria. Third choice would be fungi. And boy, my last choice would be virus. But we are so chemically toxic that the parasites, the bacteria, and the fungi aren't able to sustain these toxins in our cells. So if they eat that toxin within the cell, it kills them. Because of the chemotherapy and all the medication I had, I was unable to get a parasite. And let me tell you, I ate many parasites. I've tried to infuse many parasites into my body and was not able to do it because every time they would eat something out of my body, it was so toxic it would kill them. So since the chemotherapy, I only entertained virus all these years. Much more debilitating, much more arduous to clean and cleanse from that kind of a detoxification. And do you know that we've gone from colds to flu? Cold is when it's predominantly bacterial detoxification. Viral is predominantly, flu is predominantly viral. So you notice that many people aren't getting colds anymore. They're getting flus and flus and flus. We are too toxic. We've got antibacterials in our food now. The FDA three years ago approved six viruses to spray on your meats and foods that kill bacteria. Hello? These people are insane. Literally insane. And all they do is just keep giving us more chemicals to make sure that we don't have any bacteria, any parasites, any fungi in the body to help us get well and stay healthy. They make a lot of money on sickness, a ton of money. And we're the victim.

[audio cut]

A: So don't worry on virus, parasites, bacteria, and fungi. Do not be afraid of them. Be afraid of the chemicals. That is our problem. Everything they're trying to get us to do to foods is the opposite wrong thing. We need to get full of bacteria foods again. Bacterias that are throbbing with it. Now when I go to Asia, I know that they're heavily indoctrinated off of the U.S. Health Department's rhetoric on bacteria and virus, I mean bacteria and parasites and fungi are bad. So what do they do? They'll spray chemicals and all kinds of stuff on the food in regular supermarkets. So I don't buy any kind of meat from the supermarket over there. American, French, no matter what it is, because they're indoctrinated. The locals will work at those places doing all the processing. And everybody's afraid of getting sued because of salmonella or E. coli getting in their food and somebody suing them. It's the chemicals that are causing the illnesses, the diarrhea and all of that. Of course you have damage from those chemicals in your body. They will damage cells in your body. So of course you're going to have your janitors there to help you. You're going to have bacteria in that area to help you to try to dissolve that damaged tissue from the chemical. So they don't investigate. Anytime a doctor takes a specimen, do you think they look for the chemicals? Do they take a spectrum of what chemicals are in that tissue? They only search for bacteria and point the finger at the janitors. Did the janitors create the party they're cleaning after? No. Chemicals did, in your food. So when I go to Asia or any third world country, I do not buy out of any commercial supermarket. Carrefour, family markets, whatever it is, I do not buy meat there. I go to the villagers, the people, the poor people, who can't afford the chemicals, that grow naturally. I will buy the meat that has all the flies on it. Because I know it has flies on it, there are not chemicals there. And I do not rinse my food. I eat it with all the bacteria on it and everything. And you think that's weird, take a look at this tribe in Australia. They're hunters. They hunt the meat, they cut it into thin strips, they lay it out on these thatched boards. Flies come and lay their eggs on it. The larva hatch, they eat, eat, eat. And in five days, right before they're ready to become flies, they eat nothing but maggots. Big, fat, juicy maggots. They can run as fast as horses. They can catch a horse in a run, in a gallop, in a run. They don't need to drink water. They're incredibly healthy and strong. Hell, I want that. Give me maggots. I'm not home long enough to hatch them, so otherwise I would. Just think about that. Think about the possibilities in nature. You don't have to be afraid of nature. You have to be afraid of our industrial chemicals. That is what's causing disease. Not nature. Okay, so we'll get back to foods again. So we talked about the fats. Now the fats in various foods are very important, especially dairy. Dairy takes on a very different relationship in whichever way it is. So it's therapeutic in every form, whether it's milk, kefir, yogurt, cheese, butter. What else is there? Sour cream, cream, all of those. Pardon? Sour cream. Sour cream?

Q: Ice cream.

A: Ice cream. Girls true to my heart. We should get together and have some ice cream. Okay, so each one of these has different medicinal properties when you segregate them. Milk, dairy is the only one that does that. It's a special substance. Now a lot of vegetarians will say, well we're the only animals that eats dairy after they're weaned, you know, after they're a few years old. Okay, how many women want to be suckled on for their life? Not many women species of any kind want to be suckled on for as long as they have to and that's it. Hey, leave my breasts alone. I want to feed only myself. You go out and feed yourself. That's the only difference. I've taken milk and I've offered it to horses, to cows, to every herbivore, even deer. And guess who drinks it? Every one of them. Every one of them have drank that milk. It isn't that they don't want it, it's that who's going to let them suckle. A cow will let us milk them forever, a goat most of the time. So we can get a milk source, which is very, very healthy for us. I mean, look at the Maasai tribe, considered the smartest, strongest, tallest, most fierce tribe on earth, but also the happiest and the most congenial, most cooperative of any of the tribes. 60% dairy. Pretty important. Works for them, why wouldn't it work for the rest of us? Fulani tribe, 90% dairy. Until the British government came in, and a British individual that brought them all this other garbage, and they regretted it 35 years later. And if you look up Fulani movie, British archaeologist, you'll come up with a documentary that he did over a 35 year period on his influence on the Fulani tribe. How he completely corrupted them by teaching them agriculture and our human ways. Completely ruined them in all ways. They fight now, they never fought before. They used to argue only, and then the kids at night, there was an argument, the kids would mimic the adults. They would play roles, and each one would play different. So the whole tribe got to see what an absurdity was, so it was a parody. And everybody would laugh at it. They don't do that anymore. The whole intellectual psychology stuff, the British brought into it, to completely ruin the tribe. Now there's jealousy, there's killing, there's fighting, there's toxicity. They have tractors in now, with petroleum destroying the environment. And at the end of this documentary, this British individual, who thought he was being philanthropic, treating these savages, bringing them to wealth, regretted it at the end. He said, what I have done to this tribe, has not made them better or happier. So he regrets it. It's a very good movie to see. You see 35 years of transitions. So an incredible movie. But the Fulani used to live on 90% raw dairy, and 10% very slowly cooked meats. And then the Samburu, almost the same ratio as the Maasai tribe. None of them had any disease, not even dental caries. Wouldn't that be a thrill? Being happy every day and not having cavities. 

You don't even have to brush your teeth. I mean that's non-toxic. Pretty incredible. That's where I want to be. And I'm working, I have 12 more years to go. Already starting to grow my teeth in. I mean cavities that I've had for 30 some years, you know, are now filling in and repairing themselves. That's pretty special. I just invented or formulated a new toothpaste. Because a lot of people have had a lot of antibiotics, it has a tendency to make the teeth go gray and yellow as we get older. Especially penicillin. They say penicillin is the greatest thing invented since the wheel. What a marketing job that is. Penicillin lives in the body and has no shut-off switch because they sterilize it before they inject it in you. So penicillin will grow in your body as long as you're a carbohydrate eater or a grain eater. You eat bread, pasta, anything that's made from grain, that penicillin has no shut-off switch. And it will eat the cells that have been made from your cooked grains products. And on the by-products, the aflatoxins that are produced and the verotoxins are contaminating to the system and debilitate the body. It turns the teeth yellow. Things like Cipro and, what is that very commonly used for skin? Tetracycline. It causes the teeth to go gray and a lot of people... That's the fungus still growing on your nerves and in your tubules of your teeth. Well, this new formula I have is reversing all of that. It pulls the fungus out and destroys the fungus in the teeth. Pretty amazing. And all it is, is a tablespoon of coconut cream with three quarters of a teaspoon of apple cider vinegar, one level teaspoon of terramin clay. And you mix that together. I use a little one ounce jelly jar, glass jelly jar to keep my hand. And keep it refrigerated.

Q: How much vinegar?

A: Three quarters of a teaspoon. The clay is a teaspoon, a level teaspoon. And the coconut cream is a whole tablespoon. You mix all that together. And make sure you, you know, I suggest that you all get an infant's toothbrush. Infant's toothbrush works on one tooth at a time. And that way it gets that fluid up in there, up in your gums. And it actually dissolves it, vinegar and clay and the coconut cream dissolved plaque like that. It's difficult for your teeth to build plaque in a 48 hour period when you're brushing with that stuff. Plus it whitens the teeth. Now my lower teeth, now these are mostly caps up here. But all these, most of these down here are my teeth. And they turn yellow and grey. And they've been getting more yellow and more grey as I dump all this fungus out from my brain and skull out of my mouth. They've been getting darker and darker. And all of a sudden they started getting lighter. My mom said, wait a minute, your teeth were getting black, now they're getting lighter, what are you doing? Are you having them whitened? I said, I guess I'm whitening myself. So it was this new toothpaste that I was experimenting with that I made. And it's working for, I've been using it for about nine months with about 12 people, 15 people now. And it's working with every one of them. One person had eight to nine deep, you know, the pockets were nines, eights and nines. And in two and a half months, two and a half or three and a half months of using that particular toothpaste, their pockets are only twos, twos and a half.

Q: Oh wow, that's huge.

A: Pretty incredible. So that's something new, that's when you come to my workshops you get to learn something new every time. Terramin clay, T-E-R-R-A-M-I-N. Go to terramin.com. It's a clay that's mined in the California desert from an old hot aqua spring. They mine it to where the temperature never exceeded 98 degrees where phosphorus starts cauterization. So none of the minerals have been cauterized.

Q: What does that mean, cauterization?

A: You take clay and you fire it, you cauterize it, you burn it hard. It's a burning to make something solid, to make it lifeless and hard. That's what happens when you cook food. When you pasteurize dairy, 141 degrees, you cauterize over 50% of the calcium. That's why pasteurized dairy causes decalcification. That's why the dairy companies take dolomite, which is calcium rock, and they dump it into their vats of milk to make it white and full of calcium. But it's not a calcium that we digest. We don't digest rock. We digest calcium that is made into little spongy-like balls and nobody utilizes it properly. When it's in rock form, it's too solid. We don't utilize it properly. Okay, so if you use cream, cream is great for the nervous system. It is the only fat that will completely soothe and nurture the nervous system and brain. Other fats will do it a little bit, but nothing like cream does. That's why people go for ice cream, heavy with raw cream. It makes them feel relaxed, calms everything. You know, in the summer when it's all hot and everything and people are getting low in fat levels and they don't want to eat fat because it makes them too hot. So what do they do? They eat ice cream because it's cold, but yet it's full of cream. Now, the next day they may suffer because it's pasteurized dairy, but the person who eats it raw will not suffer the next day with heat prostration. Butter feeds every other tissue in the body the best. It is the most easily utilizable. When the body uses bile to digest cream, one-third of it goes into nutrients, cholesterol, that will aid and feed the brain and nervous system. The rest of it is made into butter by the liver in that process. Not by the liver directly, but through the bile as it dumps into the intestinal tract. So the bile makes the rest into butter, that it doesn't convert into nutrients for the brain and nervous system. So when you eat butter, it's already fairly pre-digested. It's already into a form that can be made into cholesterol to feed everywhere else in the body. Now I found that the organs and glands in the human body, because of the toxicity, are so starved that when you eat fats, all of those organs and glands absorb all of the fat. So it's like at the orphanage. The big guys get all the food, the weak ones get very little food at the end. So your skin doesn't get fed, your bones don't get fed well. So the lubrication formula that I have in the book is for that. It's called the moisturizing lubrication formula. That's what it's called, moisturizing/lubrication formula. In the recipe book, I think it's on page 145. I call it moisturizing because women love the word moisturizing. You can sell them a $30 bottle of moisturizing formula if you promise them it's going to bring their skin back to life. It's all bullshit. The only thing that's going to bring your skin back to life is sperm and bone marrow because they have the stem cells. That's the only thing that's going to bring your skin back to life. You can protect it with other fats, especially coconut cream, but the only thing that's going to bring your skin back to life is moist, fresh sperm and bone marrow. Just rub it into your skin.

Q: Anybody's sperm?

[laughter]

A: If it smells like an iron that's been on for an hour, it's very heavy metal toxic. Do not use that sperm. It's full of metal.

Q: What's it supposed to smell like?

A: It'll smell slightly gamey, you know, like let's say a little off dairy.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If it smells like iron, like cooked metals, you know, because when you iron and it has the water and steam, you've got metallic minerals in there and other minerals. And when you iron it, they cauterize and it puts out this metallic odor. Anybody who's ironed knows that odor. And if the sperm smells like that, do not use it. Do not swallow it. Definitely do not swallow it. Otherwise, you take the man's sperm and you use it. Don't share it with them. Take full advantage because I've seen many cases, and even in Japan, they're using sperm now from mice and getting incredible results as both a feed and as an application because of the stem cells in it are just as potent as they are, almost as potent as they are in bone marrow. So if you can't get access to bone marrow, you get access to sperm, use the sperm. Otherwise, use bone marrow. It's easier. You don't have to deal with the guy. Okay? The fat in pressed oils, like I said, 90% solvent reactive, mainly makes virals, virus in the body. That's what helps make virus. Pressed oils, olive oil, coconut oil, any of them helps you make solvents to dissolve toxicity in the body. They will not stabilize your system. They will not soothe your system. You can use about 10% of it as energy. And remember, fat is your highest energy source. You get 2.5 times more energy from fat than you do carbohydrates or protein. 2.5 times more. That's why all hunter tribes eat a lot of cream or some kind of fat before they go into battle or before they do heavy exercise. The Hunzas would drink like a cup of cream if they were going to do some kind of incredible sports or athletics. Can you imagine drinking a whole cup of cream? Can you digest it? They could because they were healthy, no problem. With us, it's a little bit more difficult. Can you imagine doing a marathon after drinking a cup of cream? Oh, man. But they could. So that's what we want to get to. So I've had many of my athletes drink cream, but maybe half a cup, not a whole cup. Also, they have butter and honey, and they have a sport drink. I've created a sport drink, which is different from the hydration drink in my book. It's one cup of tomato, two cups of cucumber, peeled always. 

Q: Why is that so?

A: Pardon?

Q: Why peeled?

A: Because the peels are indigestible. We're not an herbivore. They'll spend time, nutrients, trying to digest them. It's complicated. Plus, the FDA allows them to call organically grown cucumbers that have been waxed with 15% petroleum wax organic. If somebody didn't believe me and they would have looked on the box, there it was, petroleum wax. 

Q: Wow. Can you feel that though?

A: You can take a flat knife and you can peel, you can scrape the wax. If the wax dissolves in your finger, it's natural. If it does not, it turns into a waxy, oily substance or thick substance that doesn't dissolve. It is a manufactured wax.

Q: But what if you're in the store and you touch it, can you feel it?

A: Pretty slimy.

Q: You shouldn't be able to feel it, right?

A: Pretty slimy.

Q: Because I know on the non-organic you can.

A: It doesn't make any difference. Peel it because you don't know what they're doing nowadays. They're getting craftier than ever in hiding their pollution.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, they're doing it to apples.

Q: If it's peeled, is it okay?

A: Pardon?

Q: If it's organic and it had that on it and it's peeled, is it still okay or is it still bad?

A: You still need to peel it. But what you can do is you can take your peels and juice them with your juice. Your vegetables. And you can get some nutrients out of it that way. But eating a peel, you can't digest it. I can't digest it.

Q: But if it possibly has a wax on it, you wouldn't want to juice it.

A: Pardon?

Q: If it possibly has any of that wax on it, you wouldn't want to juice it.

A: No, you don't want to juice it. You throw it away, definitely, if it has wax on it. Only if you grow it yourself and you know that it's not waxed, you can juice the peels. But you don't want it for the sport drink. So then you add one to three teaspoons of vinegar.

Q: Apple cider?

A: Yep. Raw apple cider vinegar, preferably aged in wood. That's Bragg's or Solana Gold. Two to three tablespoons of coconut cream. One to three tablespoons of dairy cream, unless you gain a lot of weight fast and don't, or you swell. You get a very puffy water retention. Only have one tablespoon of cream in it. One to three tablespoons of honey. One tablespoon of lemon juice. And about three to four ounces of water. You blend all that together. So you've got tomato and cucumber puree. Now because, like I said earlier, we don't eat a lot of fruit on this diet, only one meal a day, we don't get enough collagen to make sure our skin stays vibrant and healthy. I mean, most people say my skin looks like I'm in my late 20s or 30s. Well, the way I replace my collagen is by eating the cucumber, which is a bland fruit. And I eat the pulp. So now when I, rather than juicing the cucumbers for my juice, I blend the cucumber in the juice. Peel it, blend it, so I get all this collagen, collagen precursors in the cucumber. So you've added in your juice, and you have it in a sport drink, so you don't drink water, a lot of water. As I said, it fractionates your nutrient structures that are food for your cells. It leaches and breaks down the toxicity, I mean it dilutes the acids in the stomach, breaks down and damages bacteria and enzymes. It causes a lot of problems. So water is not a good thing, except in little sips. Everybody needs some solvent, and that's what water is. If you look in an archeological book, the first thing under solvent is water. It rains, it dissolves rock, plants eat. We do not want to eat water. Say your question, write the question down if I don't get to it. So, what happened? This water thing came about in 1961 and 62. Why? Because the cola companies, especially Pepsi, decided they wanted to start bottling water and selling water. So they paid a bunch of doctors to say that we needed eight glasses of water a day, and the rest is history. Before that, we were in grade school, we'd go up to the fountain and have one, two sips a day. If you were an athlete, maybe you sucked a half a cup of water. The rest was milk, the rest was vegetable juices, or fruit juices, or fruits. That's where we got our water. Not from water, not from drinking water. So it was a marketing tool, and a marketing tool that's been very destructive to health. All your food contains water. Meat's 55% water. Milk is 86% water. Fruit's 90-92% water. Take a look at it. Everything has so much water. Everything we need. And you cannot absorb water into a cell unless it's bound in nutrients. It cannot be utilized. When water gets into a cell without the proper nutrients, it dries out a cell. The more water you drink, the more dry you get. Look at the people who drink the most water. Their skin's dry, wrinkling. 

And they've got huge water retention. And it's dissolving their tissues. So they're puffy, sallow, not healthy. I mean, if they're athletes, they're perspiring a lot of it. And you don't see the immediate effects of it. It will be longer term. Their joints will start drying out. Their organs will start drying. Their hearts start hardening. And what happens, they hit 40, 48 years old. They're no longer, you know, they haven't been an athlete in 10 years professionally. And now their hearts are hardening and they're going towards serious disease. Have a heart attack, brain aneurysm, and they're gone or they're in a coma. So you have to look at the damage the water can do. Okay, we're just about finished with fats. Now that lubrication, the moisturizing lubrication formula, is a combination of eggs, butter, lemon juice, and a little honey. A little lemon juice too, mostly butter, some egg. So you look at the proportions in the book that I suggest and you go with them. If you're coming for consultation and I see that you need a specific formula for that, I will give it to you, a specific formula for your moisturizing lubrication formula. The reason I make it complicated and say moisturizing and lubrication, like I started to say before, women love moisturizing, men love lubrication. So that's why it's a moisturizing lubrication. I want it to appeal to everybody. It's a very important aspect of a good balance on this diet if you want to get well quicker. Okay, let's take a look at proteins. Now, they say that we have lots of proteins in grains and nuts, legumes, and we can get all our protein from that. We are not an herbivore. We don't have the digestive tracts. We're not a poultry. We're not a bird. Birds have a gizzard to break down the grains. So they say, well, cook it. It releases everything. It releases so much that what happens? Take, for example, what's his name from Staying Alive, John Travolta. Remember how skinny and lanky he was, lanky he was? Remember how slim body he had all the way down? Now you look at him, his jaws, his bone structure, everything just went whoosh from eating cooked food. Look how many people get thicker and thicker. They're trim and lean. Kevin Costner. Remember how tiny he was, like in No Way Out in his early days. I mean, this guy was slender, small bones. Everything has grown, 40 years, 35 years since that movie. No, it wasn't 30 years since that movie. 28 years, 28 years since that movie, No Way Out. And look how thick he is now. Steven Seagal, the same thing. I'm using these names because these people will be familiar to you. You can rent their early movies and have their later movies, and you see the difference. Mary Beth Hurt. You look at her in that movie, was it with Robin Williams? Where he's an author and his mother is a...

Q: World According to Garp?

A: Yes, World According to Garp. You look at Mary Beth Hurt in there and she is a tiny skinny woman. Now you look at her and she is thick. We're not talking about fat, we're talking about thick. Because they've got excessive minerals, excessive proteins that were meant to be digested into the human body. If you're going to be a warrior or a wrestler, good idea. Eat a proportion of your meat cooked and your foods cooked. Get thick and you go out and kill people. And you'll be less likely to get as harmed. But if you want to be agile, if you want to have more energy, and you want to have more stamina, don't eat those cooked foods. We don't need those intense minerals that are cauterized and the proteins that are swollen and also cauterized. Why do we need that? It's absurd. Now, you can see the difference between him. If you had seen him about three years ago, he was very thin, mainly as a vegetarian, not completely, but he was very thin. But, you see, his weight gain is fat. It's not thickness of tissue. It's not thickness of bones and structure. You see, his bones aren't getting thicker, like John Travolta and all those other people that I mentioned. We're not supposed to have that kind of a structure. We're supposed to be finished with that by the time we're 21. We're not supposed to get fuller and broad and go around like... I mean, take a look at... Everybody remembers John Travolta before and after? Take a look at that thickness. Russell Crowe is the same way. You want to take a look at a person who doesn't do that as much? Braveheart? Mel Gibson. Mel Gibson eats raw meat, eats mainly raw foods, his whole family. You don't see his jaw getting heavy and structured. Tom Cruise is the same way. You don't think he's getting big and structured and thick in the same way. Because they are more raw fooders. Demi Moore. Do me more, I call it. She has that very thin frame, but she's mainly a fruitarian. So she has no fat on her, so she's ultra skinny. But she doesn't get all that baked on, you know, heavy mineral, heavy protein concentration that makes people go whoosh as they get older. So if you want to stay in a frame as when you were younger, don't eat cooked foods. You get whatever we need, you will get whatever you need from eating the proper raw diet, period. Just like all the tribes and the natives do. You don't see them getting any larger as they get older. They stay agile up until the day they die, and they stay youthful and young. It's pretty good. I mean, I like to be one of those tribes in the Andes. Once a year they do a hundred mile kickball trip through the Andes mountains. High level, low oxygen, and they get about nine to a row. And it's a straight line, and the front one kicks the ball forward, he falls to the back, and they rotate like that for a hundred miles kicking that ball. And there could be fifty to a hundred of those lines.

And ninety-year-old men are up there in the same line with the young ones doing the same hundred miles. How many of you can run a hundred miles without stopping? Hello? Anyone? I have an actor friend who does one every three years. He consumes a whole bottle, two bottles as a matter of fact, of aspirin to do it. He can't even leave the house for almost a month afterwards. Why? What does aspirin do? It destroys the vitamin K and vitamin U, so it stops blood clotting. It makes everything very thin. So if you touch him, if I were to touch him like this, his skin would peel right off, just like wet toilet paper. So he cannot go out of the house for a month. Who the fuck in their right mind is going to do something like that for a sport? I mean, give me a break. Where's the mentality? And he does it every three years to prove that he can run a hundred miles. But he has to do it on aspirin, and then he has to go through all that afterwards. And basically, he doesn't recover for a year properly. So, I mean, this was a friend of mine who made $250,000 on one pineapple commercial that ran four years nationally, worldwide. Can you imagine one day's work making $250,000? It's pretty good. So he had a lot of time to kill and do crazy things. And he did crazy things. But think about that. I mean, is that what you want to prove? Do you want to do that to yourself to prove anything? Let's be a little bit more rational about what we're going to do in life. But I shouldn't be judging him. That's his goal, his trip, his thing. He does enjoy it. He's very careful for the six weeks afterward. So he doesn't go out, has things delivered to him. People make things for him so he doesn't, you know, hit and bruise himself. I mean, basically, he's an indolent for six weeks. He takes all this vitamin K and vitamin U, which is not real, utilizable vitamin K and U. You know, if you look at vitamins when they're in food, they're mostly spongy little balls that look like cotton balls. When you fractionate them and extract them from food and you process them and clean them according to FDA regulations, what do you have? You have glass spikes or slate-like matter that's 100 to 2,000 times larger than those little squishy balls. They have no relationship to each other at all. If I knew that we were going to have a screen on my computer, you could have been able to see them because I have photographs of that that's in food and that that's processed. In natural vitamins from a food source. It's glass, it's slate, it's rock. It's no longer anything like it was before. So supplements are not a true vitamin supplement anymore. Not any of them, any kind of supplements. If you've got a mineral supplement, it's rock. We don't eat rock, feed it to your plants, juice your plants. There you get the proper minerals. So, okay, protein, to get protein in the body, I found that the only way we can get it properly is from meat.

In my laboratory tests with animals, the only time I could find a high ratio of hormones for reproduction to help cells divide rapidly was in raw meat, no matter what kind of flesh food it is. Raw meat for me is not just red meat, it's any kind of flesh food, whether it's fish, poultry, seafood, or any of the red meats. In my book, I talk about red and white meat. When it comes to red meat, I'm talking about a certain class. When I talk about white meat, I'm talking about a certain class or category as well. So these are not colors. Look at red as being larger animals that mostly have red meat. But you look at your ostriches of the bird family. It is still in the white meat category. Liver from a poultry is still in the white meat category. It doesn't fall into the red meat category. So anything that is fish, seafood, or poultry is in the white meat category. Again, not color. So these are where we get our proteins to be able to reproduce cells quickly and rapidly. Not in frozen meats. When I took a laboratory experiment with animals, I always took sickly animals, only animals that were anywhere from 12 to 16 years old. Because if you can help those old creatures come back to life, you know something is really happening well. So I gave half of the group the same meat that was frozen, and the other half of the group raw meat that was unfrozen. So we both got raw meat, one frozen, one unfrozen. All the animals who were in the experiment of frozen got a skin disorder within six weeks. One of them even got scurvy in six weeks from eating frozen meats. The animals that had it raw, now that's the only thing I fed them. Normally I would feed an animal, you know, some butter, you know, a tiny bit of honey, some milk, along with meats and lots of bones. Here I was only feeding them frozen meat to see what the difference would be. The group that only got the unfrozen meat had no problems, no skin disorders and were fine. So even freezing your meat causes problems. Now a lot of people say, oh, you know, freezing your butter doesn't hurt anything. In fact, Sally Fallon, a lot of people say, freeze your meats because it will destroy, you know, parasites. Hello? You don't have parasites in meat anyway. You know, and if you did, you'd see them, they'd be undulating in there. And then eat it anyway. It'll be better for you. They've already predigested some of that meat. But so many people who are educated with information and don't do experiments don't know anything about reality and wisdom. So I took butter that was frozen, the same butter unfrozen, and I took that group that was sick with the skin disorders, because I know that raw butter mends skin disorders pretty rapidly, especially if you give it to them in the way of the moisturizing lubrication formula. However, with these animals, I did not want to give them anything but the butter, the frozen and the unfrozen. So I divided the sick group and gave them frozen and unfrozen raw butter.

The group that had the unfrozen raw butter healed in three times faster, three to five times faster than the group that got the frozen butter. So again, the frozen butter has some damage to it. It sure helps health still, but three times, five times longer to get well? Hey, man, it could be unfrozen any day. I'll eat frozen if that's all I have, if that's all I can get, but I'll take unfrozen primarily, absolutely, without question. Then we're going back and we're talking about the protein. So, fat, the meat proteins are the only ones that speed regeneration of cells. Bone marrow is part of the meat in the bone. The bone marrow, if you let it stand out to room temperature, like overnight, for about eight hours, you can just pop out the bone. If you don't, you have to dig it out, like with a knife or something. It's much tastier when it's warm. Just pop it out, eat some of it, rub it on your skin, whatever you want to do. I had a massage with bone marrow one time. That was an incredible week, that week for my skin. It was phenomenal. I didn't take a bath for seven days, had no odor, except right in the pits, and I just used my lemon for that. And it was great. Usually I'll go four or five days without a bath, but here I went seven days without a bath. No itchy skin, no dry skin problem, after seven days from having that bone marrow massaged in my skin. Expensive massage, but I'm worth it. I hope everybody else thinks we're worth it. Better than spending it on drugs and stuff that are not going to make you well. Spending a fortune on it. All these supplements. Bio-identical hormones. Who are you kidding? You get it from grass and then you call it bio-identical to the human body? What are you, crazy? That's marketing. They call it bio-identical. Bio-identical to grass, not bio-identical to a human being. So all these misnomers are fraud. Understand them. Don't be tricked. Anytime it goes into a supplement, it has to be processed with either wood alcohol, kerosene derivative. I don't care that they're natural, but one of those substances has to be involved in manufacturing. Or heat. So you can never get a raw, natural substance unless you're eating the food. And that's what you need, the food. And be patient. It takes time to get well. Okay, starch. And we need to talk about that. And carbohydrates. The carbohydrate thing, you know, it can cause this. I talked about the monkeys being crazy and hyperactive. The killer monkeys go on a binge of eating high-carbohydrate fermented fruit 24 hours to about 36 hours before they go on a killing spree. And when they have like figs and fermented guava fruit, stuff like that, they'll eat a tremendous amount of it. They'll be drunk as monkeys. And they'll be crazy. And after that time, they just go through a jungle. And they just kill everything, insects, other animals, and they'll just do that for like 24 hours. It's just like the lions in the jungle, and they just kill everything. Everything in their sight.

So, that is what happens when we have a lot of high-carbohydrate sugar in our system. It has a tendency to irritate, cause a lot of manufacturing of alcohols, disturbs the body. Not a good thing to do. So, if you want to be calmer, you stay away from high-carbohydrate food. You eat fruit, like the gorillas do, they eat unripe fruit. They eat green figs, they eat green apples, I mean green bananas. Fruit with low carbs in it. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I know, low sugars. I'm going to go 30 minutes over, regardless. So, I've got to get my information. So, eat fruits that are green, not ripe, high in fruit. Fruit sugars. When you eat fruit sugars to slow that sugar getting into the body, so you don't have the high and the low, you eat fat with it. Always eat some form of fat to slow the sugars. Also, since most of that sugar is going to be utilizing fat as energy or as solvents to detoxify and cleanse the body, you want fat with it. So, the starch that I wanted to mention, I have a category within my particular diet, the primal diet. Using starch is important because certain hormones in the body, byproducts of hormones being used in the body, stores toxins like any other toxin. If you have a byproduct of adrenaline, you're going to have irritability come up on you. When it comes up, it's going to be like PMS, whether you're men or women. And it's going to irritate you, make you irritable, make you anxiety stricken. You can exercise it off a great thing, but you still may have some toxins that are causing problems. The only way you can get those to absorb in and out of the body are with starches. The primary way I suggest people do it is by using my nut formula. And the nut formula is on probably 146, I think, of the recipe book. And that's taking nuts, soft nuts we digest okay, hard nuts like almond we do not. And you blend it until it is a flour, like walnuts, pecans, pine nuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, any of those we can digest fairly well, as long as they are in this particular mixture and balance. If you don't put these mixture of foods with it, the phytic acid in seeds and nuts will prevent you from digesting and utilizing certain minerals, that prevent you from digesting and utilizing certain proteins, that prevent you from digesting and utilizing certain fats. So it's one problem after another. So you have to get rid of that phytic acid and by combining these foods it works. A lot of vegetarians will say, well if you germinate them, if you soak them in water and germinate them it gets rid of the phytic acid. Yes it does, but it creates three similar enzymes that do the same thing and it's three times the amount of phytic acid. So that's why these vegetarians go around eating this way, they're swollen, they're bloated, they end up with cancer. Half of my cancer patients were long-term vegetarians. That doesn't say much for vegetarians. They're not getting the proper proteins to make the body regenerate cells so they hold on to all their dead cells and still and then it comes to the point where they build tumors. So being a vegetarian is no answer and eating cooked vegetables and cooked grains and cooked legumes, even raw and germinated, is not going to solve your problems. So eat the nut formula and the nut formula is the powder, you turn the nuts into a flour and then you add egg, raw egg, raw honey or coconut cream, I mean raw butter, raw butter or coconut cream, butter is always best and a little bit of honey. It's a delicious nut formula and whenever you feel anxiety stricken and exercise isn't doing you enough, the normal exercise and you're feeling whacked out as they say, have a nut formula.

It'll calm it down. Sometimes you may be dumping that stuff for ten days in a row. You need to eat it about every other day. You can eat a half of it one day, a half of it the next day and keep eating that. If it doesn't work after ten days, it's not doing it. Go to a cooked starch. Preferable just a little bit of already steamed or boiled rice. Only a third of a cup after boiling. So you may start with two tablespoons and end up with a third of a cup of your rice. Have about three, four tablespoons of butter with it. And see if that works. If it doesn't, you need to exercise more or just, you know, you're dumping it every day for a very long time and you could have a lot of it, especially if you're very skinny in your lifetime, you're going to have a lot of it stored in your tissues, in your cells. And the cells are going to be throwing it off. Everywhere in your body is going to be throwing it off. And you'll be stressed out and in angst and having problems for an extended period. So, I usually break at this time but I want to complete it because I'm being rushed. Usually I finish at 7.30, 8 o'clock, but they're rushing me to finish at 6.30 today. I don't know why this changed. Are they closing early or something?

Q: No.

A: Does anybody know why people are rushing me to get finished earlier? No one knows? Then why are they doing it?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, and Whole Foods wants me out of here earlier?

Q: They're a little bit more illuminati [unintelligible].

A: Okay, it's true. They're owned by a Texas firm that's owned by the Bass and the Bush family. Okay, so you use that kind of starch to help bind with that excess hormones. It's good to have a nut formula once a week just to take care of it, to have a preventive measure. Have one nut formula a week. You can have it as a sauce for your meat meal or as your fruit meal in the afternoon, something like that. Now let's get into, if you want to make sure that your body functions and focuses best throughout your day, there's an eating pattern that I discovered over many, many years of experimenting. Now first let's take a look at advanced glycation end products, something that carbohydrates, we form from carbohydrates, whether it's fresh fruit or cooked starch or manufactured sugar, no matter what it is. When the body makes glycogen, which runs the brain and nervous system, from high carbohydrate foods, cooked or raw, there's an advanced glycation end product that's formed as a by-product and Columbia University found that the human body stores it at a rate of 70 to 90 percent, and a healthy body at a rate of 70 percent, and an unhealthy body at a rate of 90 percent. The two groups that they named as unhealthy and compromised that would store 90 percent were diabetics and people with kidney conditions. So you can imagine storing 90 to 70 to 90 percent of by-product for a lifetime. You're going to have sugar by-products all over your body, which causes more cancer than anything else. Sugar by-products that cause damage to tissue, to cause them to dissolve, not function properly, to ferment. A lot of dead cells are formed from that. So how do we reduce that? Well, we don't eat the high-carbohydrate fruit. We keep very low on the high-carbohydrate anything. Carrot juice, when we have it, we have it with celery to reduce that carbohydrate factor, and to make sure that we don't build glycogen from high-carbohydrate, the first six to seven hours of your day, you do not eat a high-carbohydrate food. No nuts, no heavy milk, no, with a lot of lactose in it, that can cause a lot of milk sugar to form. Not a lot of carrot in your juice, a lot of carrot juice in the morning. No fruits. Keep down on your carbohydrates to almost, well, to a very low level. 

Q: I didn't understand what you said about the milk.

A: Milk even has a high sugar content, so your body can make glycogen from it and cause more of those advanced glycation end products.

Q: Is that true for fermented milk too?

A: Absolutely, fermented too. Yogurts, any of them. So, what you want to do is for the first six, seven hours of the day, when you first have your long sleep and when you get up, your body will make glycogen for the whole day for 24 hours based on your first six to seven hours of eating. So, if you don't eat, your brain's going to be fried. You're going to be out in la-la land. If you eat high carbohydrate cereals, fruit juices, you're going to be up and down and all over the place. So, if you eat, when you wake in the morning, the body is very acidic. The nervous system cleans when there's no light. So, when the sun goes down, the nervous system begins cleaning. By midnight, it's in full force. From midnight to five o'clock, it is powerfully cleaning the nervous system. And remember, the nervous system is the most toxic because it has the most heavy metallic toxic minerals in it. And they're dumping into the blood causing an overly acidic red blood stream. How do we neutralize that? We have vegetable juice. We know we don't digest vegetables, but we can still get concentrated vitamins, minerals and enzymes, not from bottles of supplements, but from vegetable juice. A lot of people say, wait a minute, the soil is depleted. We don't eat vegetation anyway, so when we juice it, we're getting such a concentration that it will outdo a whole bottle of vitamins that you're taking a day, and they're not even natural. So one 12 ounce glass of vegetable juice in a day is going to provide you with more vitamins and enzymes and minerals than you ever could get any other way. And it provides a lot of alkalinizing minerals to help neutralize the over-acidity in the red blood stream, in the blood stream. So what happens is you have juice when you first wake up. If you have a lot of toxicity in your stomach from vaccines and other chemicals, you'll often, 90% of the time, I see it going into the stomach lining. So it leaks a little bit into your food every time you redistribute your poisons. If you eat raw cheese, I forgot about this, we forgot the cheese part of the milk factor. Raw unsalted cheeses cannot be digested in the human digestive tract. All of my analysis of feces after eating cheese, I find that cheese bound with all kinds of toxins and not digested. It goes out. When you have pasteurized cheese or raw cheese with salt in it, it causes that fractionation. It will bind with the poisons but then be reabsorbed into the body. So very little of the pasteurized or salted raw cheese passed out of the feces compared to the amount that they ate. But almost identical within 98%, the raw cheese passed out of the body with concentrations of toxins removed. If you add honey, my experiment is adding honey to the cheese directly, mashing the cheese into the honey or making a cheesecake layer where the honey and the cheese is together, or mixing the cheese and the honey in your mouth together, allows you to absorb a concentration of nutrients in the cheese. Because remember anything that is dried is bioactively enzyme deficient.

All those enzymes are inactive. Remember enzymes are not alive. A lot of people say live enzymes. It's a misnomer. You have bioactive enzymes with active nutrients within that, but the enzymes are actually solvents. They will fractionate food so that we can realign it and absorb it, or it can help restructure depending on what the enzymes, but enzymes are protein structures. Just like virus there's no nucleus, there's no respiratory system, it's just structure. Elements to help us reconstruct or destruct. So enzymes are not alive, but in the cheese that's dry, any other dried food, you can add honey. I've tried to add honey to nuts. Doesn't really do it. You can't really absorb those nutrients. In any other dried food, dried fruit, anything like that, it still does not provide the same thing. Only the cheese with the honey, the honey with the cheese, do we get that complete digestive reaction. The main thing that is digested when you add cheese to honey is the mineral content. So you get a huge, tremendous inundation of a mineral supplement, especially of your calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, potassium, those that neutralize poisons the best in the body. Wonderful. You've got a bone problem. You've got osteoporosis. Eating cheese with honey about 30 minutes after your two meat meals a day, or three meat meals a day, is a good way to reverse that to get your mineral supplement. When you eat cheese alone, raw, unsalted, it binds to the poisons and removes. So if you have all those toxins that are stored in your stomach, like 90% of the population has, every time you eat you're going to dump some of those poisons into your food, a little at a time is enough to poison the whole system. If you eat just a little sugar, two sugar cube-sized amounts of cheese the first thing in the morning, ten minutes later you have your vegetable juice, your first vegetable juice. So you absorb the poisons. If you don't eat anything for ten minutes, the body stops dumping the poisons into the stomach. So you eat your cheese, you wait ten minutes, it stops dumping. The cheese has absorbed all the poisons. You eat your food, you're not going to get your poisons in. You have twenty-five minutes of eating before your body will start dumping the poisons into the stomach again and into your food. So if you've finished eating at twenty-five minutes, it won't dump. If you're going to eat over that twenty-five minutes, then you need to stop, eat the cheese again, wait ten minutes, and then you finish your meal. Most people only do that with meat. They'll take a long time to eat their meat. And that's the meal you definitely do not want poisons in. So you have your cheese, ten minutes later you have your vegetable juice. Like I said, you want in your vegetable juice, you want cucumber puree rather than cucumber juice. I've given some examples of juices in my recipe book for all types of things. But that high concentration of celery is good for two to six years. If you're a high carbohydrate individual, you need that negative celery.

Celery has a negative carbohydrate. There's not enough carbohydrate in celery to digest celery. So it's a negative. So it helps pull toxic sugars out of the body. Some people reach that limit of detoxification in two years. Then if they drink a juice, they get fatigued because it draws too much of their sugar out. It draws the good sugars out of the blood, the glycogen out of the blood, even if it isn't carbohydrate manufactured. If it's, you know, proteins derived, it still will pull it out of the blood and leave people listless and tired after a juice. If it comes to that point, you reduce the celery as low as 20%. And you have like 30-40% cucumber puree and you add about 10-20% carrot juice to help balance that. Now that's not in the book, so remember that. That's not in the book. I haven't updated... That's new information that will be in the new book. Hopefully that will be out next fall. You know, that will take over everything that's not in the first two books.

Q: Can you repeat that?

A: Which part?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay. In the book it tells you how to have high celery to pull the sugars out, although it doesn't explain that that's what's happening in the body. When you shift it, it should be about 15-20% carrot. Reduce the celery down to about 20-25% maximum. And use cucumber puree anywhere from 30-40% of your juice. Keep your skin beautiful. And if you still have cucumber in your juice with a high ratio of carrot, just don't juice your cucumbers like I have in the book. You puree them so you get that pulp. And then of course you always have your 5-10% parsley or cilantro, depending upon the juice you're choosing, to do whatever. And that's in the recipe book. Okay, so let's say 30-35 minutes and chew your juice. Ptyalin enzyme can help, bacteria can help a little bit too. So chew your juice, you don't have to chew your meat. The hunter tribes do not chew their meat but maybe enough to crush it to swallow it. Eskimos, I mean, they would eat huge chunks of meat, three chews down their throats. I don't have a large throat like that, you know, so there's so no way I could have mine broken or ripped into little pieces. Also because I have the vagus nerve severed, I do not have the hydrochloric acid in the stomach like most of you have, so I have to have it in smaller pieces. I don't have the hydrochloric acid to dissolve the meat so the bacteria can get in. And that's what happens. The hydrochloric acid dissolves the meat so the bacteria can eat your meat and release all those nutrients in the body. That's how the body works. You cannot do it without bacteria. Your body is 70% bacterial operated. 70% of your body functions on bacteria, so you've got to get rid of the bacterial theory, nonsense, stupidity, ignorance. Anything I can say that's negative, I will say about that theory. And that's what the entire pharmaceutical and medical principles are based on. And then we have people like, you know, Weinstock come up with, you know, the parasites are good, bacteria is good, bacteria does this and that that's good. Then we fracture that. Of course, they hide it. You don't see much publicity on that. And they just give out the regular rhetoric, get your flu shots, make sure you're using antibacterial everything, wash your hands after you go to the toilet. That's the problem. We shouldn't be doing that. We should be letting all that bacteria go around. It's the chemicals we shouldn't be exchanging. And everywhere, antiseptic sprays, aerial sprays, I mean this is all toxic stuff that causes disease, not microbes. So, about thirty-five, forty minutes after you chew your juice and finish it, you have another bit of cheese. You could have just maybe a sugar cube sized amount of cheese, which is about half a teaspoon. Again wait ten minutes and have your first meat meal. 

Again, we're not having anything high in carbohydrate because we don't want to produce advanced glycation end products. We want the brain to function and focus wonderfully and clearly throughout the day. How do you think I function here? I've been going on babbling, jumping from this subject, crossing over, jumping around, but I always end up at the right place. Why? Because I'm following all of these networks of patterns all through my head and I can keep aware and focused on them at any particular point. Why? Because my mind is cluttered with a lot of toxicity and a lot of sugars and other debris from cooked or even high carbohydrate fruit. So you have your meat meal. With that, I always suggest that you have the moisturizing lubrication formula or one and a half tablespoons of butter with that meat meal. So you do not turn that meat meal into a fat or too much sugar to be utilized as fuel. You're providing the fat with the meat. Remember, you're having a juice first, not a lot of food in that, not a lot of protein or fats in that, unless I ask you to put a little cream in it or whip an egg in it, if I see you directly. If you get heart palpitations from your first juice, those are toxins flowing and the heart does not want them to rest in the heart or in a gland. Remember, your intestines are 30 feet long, so your heart is very short, your glands are very short and small, so when the blood is pumping fast, it's going to go through a lot of space of the intestines where the body wants that garbage to dump, especially if you have cheese in there, so it dumps there. If you have heart palpitations from a vegetable juice first thing in the morning, you whip a raw egg in it for about five or six days after that and drink it with a raw egg in it. Then try another week, try one time without the egg in it, and when you can drink it without having heart palpitations, don't have an egg in it. Whenever you have heart palpitations, you have an egg in your juice. It means you're very lacking in protein and fats. So with a meat meal, you don't want to turn that into fat or fuel of any kind, carbohydrate fuel. You want to make sure it's there to reproduce cells and to heal you, to make sure that the mind functions well. So you have butter with it or your moisturizing lubrication formula with it. Then about, and there are lots of sauces in the recipe book. There are 82 sauces that you may have made in three or five different ways each. So it's over 300 and some, almost 400 sauces. So that's more than one for every day of the year. And you usually find the one you like, make a batch of them, and whenever you make your meat, just throw some of that on. Take one of them out of the refrigerator. Doesn't have egg in it, you can refrigerate it. It has egg in it, you don't want to refrigerate it. So, let's take a moment, my mouth is getting a little dry.

Oh, in other words, oh, and notice that I do not gulp or drink my milk anymore. Watch what I do. Keep my lips together, my teeth together, and suck it through. What does that do? Provides a lot of bacteria from the mouth. When I started doing that, I cut my milk consumption by a third, a third. Pretty impressive. Also, my juices, everything else started digesting better and fully. So, you want all that bacteria in your mouth, especially your milk, anything fluid, although normally it won't go, you just guzzle. And what I also found was that I don't [unintelligible]. If you gulp, you don't have the bacteria to break down. So, all that excess fluid, like I said, milk is 86% water, rushes to the kidneys. So, you're not getting the benefits of the water anyway. It takes the bacteria to be able to utilize the nutrients to carry the H2O into the cells. So, suck your milk. If you need to drink it through a baby bottle, do it through a baby bottle. But still, I tried it through a baby bottle last week. I found some actual rubber nipples. I tried it and it isn't as forceful as doing it the way I do it. Sucking as an adult through a baby bottle, it's no challenge. We've got a pretty strong mouth here, so it didn't do anything special for me. But drinking, sucking, like I said, through my lips and with my teeth closed, it works very, very well. So normally, I'd be going through one and a half of these at my workshops that are eight hours. And you see how much I've consumed? That's all I've consumed in this whole workshop, because I suck it hard through my mouth and get lots of bacteria in it. So, after your meat meal, like I said, you can have the cheese and honey if you need a mineral imbalance. If you have a mineral imbalance, you've got nail problems, hair problems, you want that access with those extra minerals, bone problems. Have your cheese and honey together. Thirty, thirty-five minutes after you finish your meat meal. Then wait two to three hours and have a milkshake. Not with fruit in it, unless I suggest it. If I ever suggest it, it would be a very small amount of fruit. And have a milkshake with raw milk, kefir, yogurt. Remember kefir and yogurt are always predigested. You're going to get a lot more nutrients from them than you will milk. Always leave your milk out so it's not cold. If your milk is cold out of the refrigerator, don't drink more than two ounces of milk at a time because your stomach will contract from the cold. You won't secrete hydrochloric acid and you'll have milk lactate, the milk sugars, and casein, which a lot of people are allergic to when it's cauterized and pasteurized milk, will pass into the blood undigested. It goes right through the stomach wall. If you look at the recent research that's been done over the last two years, when you drink cold fluids, they pass right through the stomach wall into the blood. So we don't want to drink a lot of cold fluids, especially at one time, no more than two ounces at a time if you need to cool yourself.

It's better to just put your head under cold water, or put ice back on your neck or on the top of your head. You will cool much better that way. Also on your wrists, it cools the body rapidly. In the stomach is not the place to do it, because it will absorb right through the stomach walls without digestion. Then you have undigested food in your bloodstream, causes complications in your blood, can zap your energy, can cause a lot of problems. So, I leave my milk out at least twenty, well, at least twelve hours before I'm going to drink it. On the seldom occasion when I'm traveling and all of a sudden I end up in a place where I only have refrigerated milk, I put the milk in hot water and let it sit. I usually, when I get home, I turn on my hot tub and it stays in a hundred and two temperature for a few hours. It's ready, the bacteria's growing, I'm happy. My body's happy with it. Otherwise, you need to go put it in hot water, not hot enough to burn your hand, but pretty hot, because that cold glass, or whatever you put it in, it's best if you get your milk in plastic and put it in glass as soon as you get home, because it will leach, especially if you put it in hot water. You put that in hot water and it cools down, come put some more hot water in, so it's a couple of hours it's sitting in some warm water, so the milk will be more digestible and utilizable, and you'll spend less money, because these days the farmers are gouging us. They're not happy with us that we're making them a fortune, they're gouging us, so they all want to retire on each week of sales. So, we're trying to get them to lower their prices, but it's almost impossible. They've had a taste of that money and they're not going to let it go. So, the milkshake should consume, let's say, three to six ounces of milk, kefir, or yogurt, one, two, five eggs, depending on the size of person you are, a little bit of extra dairy cream, and maybe an extra tablespoon of coconut cream, and one, two tablespoons of honey. And you sip that, suck it like I do, you know, digest better. You may not need as much, a smaller proportion if you're sucking it like that, because you'll digest it better, gain weight faster. And then, let two to three hours pass and you can have cheese, a little bit of sugar cubes, a size amount of cheese, about 10 minutes before you drink your milkshake. Then, let two to three hours go by, have another little sugar cube of cheese, and then have another vegetable juice. Then, if you're diabetic or you have a sugar problem, hypoglycemia, hyperglycemia, either one, you have another meat meal. Now, the average is, take a pound of meat, if you're an average sized person, you have a pound of meat a day. A pound of meat is equal to about two and a half cups of meat. If it's ground, it'll be three cups of meat make up a pound, because when you grind it and make a hamburger, it swells up and it has more air in it and less volume.

Less density, more volume, less density. So it takes about three cups of ground to make a pound, two and a half cups of meat to make a pound if it's not ground. So you can split that into two meals or three meals. If you've got diabetes or a sugar problem, you have three meals, you break it into three meals. You have your third meal after the second vegetable juice. Again, this time you should wait about an hour after your vegetable juice. Have cheese again, ten minutes after that. Have your third meat meal. If you've eaten the meat meal, the next will be your fruit meal. If you haven't eaten the meat meal, you'll go from the juice to your fruit meal, which could be an hour and a half, two hours later. If you've eaten the meat meal, it needs to be about an hour, an hour and a half after you've finished the meat meal before you have your fruit meal. Green fruit is better unless you've got a problem where it calls for ripe fruit in my remedy section of my first book, We Want to Live. Mix that with some kind of fat. If you want to use this as cleansing, the coconut cream is the most important for cleansing and detoxification, and the most thorough as well as the most, reduces the most symptoms. It's the most gentle of them even though it's the most powerful. So you're going to get three to six tablespoons of coconut cream with your fruit. Always have a animal fat with it to bind with the poisons so you don't damage your cells. So you could have like three quarters of a tablespoon to one and a half tablespoons of dairy cream. You could have about a quarter to a half a teaspoon of butter along with that coconut cream as your animal fats will protect you. And honey is not necessary, but you could put a little tiny bit of honey into it, say no more than a teaspoon. Now when you mix berries with that mixture and you blend it together, you're going to have something like a parfait because the pectin in the berries will cause it to thicken. If you have papaya, it's also going to have a tendency to thicken. You can whip those fats into like a whipped cream and eat the fruit chopped or whole. It's up to you how you want it. And the different ways you make it, make it taste differently so it will taste different each time, feel like a different kind of meal to give you some variety. And to find out what fruits are good for you, if you haven't come to me and I tell you or suggest to you, then you go into the recipe, remedy section and you go through and all of your symptoms that you have or that you've had in the past, those fruits are the fruits that you eat for that. And you could have maybe 3 to 4 different fruits in a week, just one or two mixtures a day, depending upon what your needs are. Then let 2 to 3 hours pass, have another bit of cheese, another vegetable juice or not, and then go into your second or third meat meal. Cheese before the meat meal again.

Fat with your meat meal, either the moisturizing lubrication formula or some butter. Once in a while you can have avocado or something with the meat meal. Just remember butter is always your best if you want to heal and get well faster. And if you're going to eat cream with your meat, it should be a little bit or sour cream or cream cheese. Because cream, like I said, is very difficult to digest. And when you have hydrochloric acid and you have all those mixtures of food going through, cream is very difficult to digest. It can wrap around your meat and cause you not to digest it. And if you see in your feces a pearly color on the feces, that means you haven't digested the food and you need not eat that cream mixture, whatever you had, that particular sauce with your meat meal. Eliminate it. Try it maybe another six months down the line. If it does it again, you have to eliminate it for another six months. Give yourself time. Sour cream will not do that. Very easy to make sour cream. Put some in a glass jar, leave about a third of the jar empty with air, put it in a dark cupboard and leave it for a month. You have sour cream. You want cream cheese, leave it in for three months.

Q: But it should be in a warm cupboard, not in a refrigerator.

A: Well, if you leave it in a refrigerator it could take three months. So if you want sour cream quickly, it's usually two weeks to four weeks out of the refrigerator. So it depends on how you want it and how you want it to taste. Okay then after that meat meal, thirty minutes later, you want your concentration of mineral supplement. You have your cheese and your honey together again. The ratio of cheese to honey is one tablespoon of cheese to about one-third of a teaspoon of honey. A very tiny amount of honey. About one-sixth the honey to the amount of cheese. So let's say you're a smaller person you have one and a half tablespoons of cheese, you have about a half a teaspoon of honey. If you're a big guy, two, two and a half tablespoons of cheese, a teaspoon of honey. 

Q: Is this for mineralization?

A: Pardon?

A: For mineralization? Yes.

Q: What happens if you use the same amount?

A: You're going to use those minerals as fuel. It won't re-mineralize your system. Then you let two to three hours pass and have a glass of milk before you go to bed or half a cup of milk, maybe a little extra cream and honey in it so you sleep well. And never go the whole night without drinking raw milk or eating a raw egg or something because if you go five hours without eating, the protein level in the blood drops drastically. Red blood cells become cannibalistic and eat each other. In an eight-hour period without eating, you will consume, depending upon the size of the person, two to four tablespoons of red blood cells. That's all you manufacture in a day. So you're creating an habitual anemia by sleeping eight hours. So you get up in five hours, you have a half a cup of milk, suck an egg, or one or the other, and you go back to sleep for three hours. If you're a hyperactive person like some people I know, you have to wake up after three hours, you eat and then you go to sleep for five hours. Because if you wake up at five hours and you're a hyper energetic person, you drink that food and you're ready to go. But if you want to sleep eight hours, you need to wake earlier. That means set your alarm if you don't wake automatically. I'm a person that if I've had no sleep all night and I can only get ten minutes sleep, I can lie down and I will wake up in exactly ten minutes. That's how clear and healthy my body is, it does exactly what I want. It took me a while to get here, but I'm there. And I mean like in Santa Fe where I just left, I was sleeping one, three hours a night. I usually sleep three and a half, four hours a night. And I needed a nap in the afternoon to make sure I was going to be able to make it throughout the day in my consults. So I went down, laid out in the yard, the dogs that lived there slept on either side of my leg and we would sleep for ten minutes. Woke up in exactly ten minutes, I was fueled for another four hours and did my consults. And then I had another ten minute nap after I ate, you know, for my next four hour bout. So we can function that way as long as we're eating. And you get healthier, the healthier you get the easier it will be to do that. But if you don't wake up on your own, you set an alarm. It's important. Most people sleep eight hours, they woke up, they have no energy. Why don't people have energy after sleeping eight hours? Because their body's eating their red blood cells, they're eating. So they go for caffeine, nicotine, some kind of charge, some kind of chemical speed. Is that a remedy? Is that a cure for anemia? No. Eating is. You're just going to deteriorate the body more. So all these little keys are so important. They make a big difference in a lot of people's lives.

I'd give you a story, but we don't have time. Okay, we need to talk about eggs. I like to say the eggs is the last, because they're one of the most important foods for recovery in many situations. Most people digest very poorly. They don't digest foods well at all. People who are very sickly are not digesting, not getting the proper foods or not digesting the foods that they're eating. If you take the example in the recipe book about the woman with emphysema. Her MD called me on a Thursday night and said, I've got a woman who has emphysema. She was diagnosed 70 years ago. She's mainly been on machines and bedridden for the last two years. I cannot prescribe anything out of the ordinary unless she's on her deathbed or she's been unsuccessful with medical therapy for 10 years. I said, well, that's your conscience. She said she's going to die this weekend. I said, well, you're calling me a little late, aren't you? She said, well, like I said, it has to be 10 years or she has to be on her deathbed. So that's why I'm calling you late. All I can do to tell you now is she cannot digest foods. Obviously, that's why she's in this situation. So you need to get her the most digestible food possible, raw eggs. Get 10 to 15 dozen, put them at her bedside and ask her to eat one as often as she can. So, I get a call on Monday morning. That was a Thursday night late. It's probably 10 o'clock my time. Had to have been 1 o'clock in the morning. She was calling from Maine or Massachusetts. So I noticed she didn't get the eggs until probably Friday evening or Saturday morning. So I get a call on Monday morning from this raspy voice woman. She said, well, I've worked. I'm out of bed and off the machines. What do I do? I said, well, who are you? She said, oh, my doctor called. You told her to tell me to eat as many eggs as I could. I ate 33 on Saturday, 33 on Sunday. I'm off the machines and out of bed. What else do I do? I said, keep it up. Keep sucking those eggs and add raw dairy and raw meats into your diet as you can digest them. If you don't digest them, if you have diarrhea, if you have vomit, you're not digesting them. Eat little pieces of them, little sips of milk, but you keep sucking those eggs. Eggs digest in the maximum of 27 minutes. Everything's already liquid. The protein in the egg white's liquid. The egg yolk or all the fats in your proteins and B vitamins, I mean, the fats in your B vitamins and your lecithin, your vitamin E, vitamin A, all of it's there in the yolk liquid. So, when it gets in the stomach, hydrochloric acid penetrates it. Already ready for digestion in five minutes. Passes over to the lower abdominal region called the duodenum. The bile starts penetrating it. Wow, already ready in five more minutes. Gets into the small intestines.

You've got 10 minutes, 17 minutes to digest it in three to five inches of intestines. Pretty neat. Very little digestive energy has gone into it, so you can use all of those nutrients to repair and strengthen and heal the body. When my mind, you saw I started losing my train of thought, I went and sucked an egg, right back in an instant. My mind was back. That's what I always do if I have some brain fart interfere with functionality. It just means that I'm low on the pyruvate to... the glucose to run the brain. I'm not going to go for high carbohydrate and starches like they always say. No, I go from a solid protein, which is clean, and I can go for hours. Eggs cause, when you're eating eggs alone, because of that, they cause tremendous weight loss. Now this is something not for you women to abuse. Only one in here that really could use that weight loss is you. You could probably lose about 50 pounds or 45 pounds and be okay. The rest of you are still too thin. You're perfect, absolutely perfect. You have the right amount of weight to protect you and to make your life easier. So remember, when you're thin and you're detoxifying, you're going to have more symptoms because you don't have enough fats to protect you. Now when I get down, after I get back from Asia, when I don't get enough cream and dairy, I'm down to a 30.5 inch waist, which I was at 17 years old. I'm also 5'7 and 3 quarters exactly what I was at 18 years old. All of my family has shrunk an inch to 2 inches, inch and a half to 2 inches. Not me, because I'm eating properly. Yet if they're eating cooked food and it releases all these minerals and proteins, why is everybody shrinking? Hello? I mean these arguments are so shallow and so ignorant. Ignorant means they're ignoring the whole picture. Not because they're stupid, just because they're ignoring the facts that these arguments are ridiculous. Just ridiculous. So, eggs are vitally, vitally important. When you eat eggs with other food, they help you gain weight. When eggs are eaten alone, they'll help you lose weight. In between that day, you're sipping a moisturizing formula in between those meals that I gave, and milk. But if you find your digestion is slowing for that day, or in general, you suck some raw eggs in between there alone. Nothing within a half an hour either side of that egg. And you'll start absorbing and digesting rapidly. And if you need to lose weight, that's what you get. Eggs between, stay away from the milk between. Just have your moisturizing formula, the sport formula that I gave, and the eggs in between, just alternate them. Just leave enough space, half an hour, in either side of an egg. Say you're having eggs every 45 minutes. Wait 20 minutes, or half an hour, you have your sport formula, sip about half a cup, or a quarter of a cup, half an hour later you have an egg. And just keep doing that, and you'll lose weight.

But don't abuse that information, because you're going to suffer more. I guarantee you, you will suffer more. You go through a detox, you will suffer more. And you can experiment by that, having a lot of weight on you, go through your detoxes for a year and see what it was like, then get skinny for one year and go through them and see what it's like. I guarantee you, you're going to be fatigued, you're going to have more pain and suffering, and you're going to be a lot unhappier if you're thin and go through detoxification. Okay, now I talked about the salt and the water, I usually end with those, but I decided I'd throw it differently today. I gave you that early, so I don't need to do that, so we're going to jump into the Q&A. Anybody have any questions I didn't answer? Yes?

Q: I have two questions. How do you keep the water up at 102 degrees for the bath?

A: You're going to have a hot tub that's regulated like I do at 102 degrees.

Q: And if you don't have a hot tub?

A: If you don't have a hot tub, you do like I used to do, you heat the bathtub up with just scalding water, fill it halfway, and it will heat the entire tub. Then you put lukewarm water in or slightly, well, tepid water in until you fill the tub up to where it's going to be when you're going to get in it, and then that will cool down. Then you put your ingredients like I instruct in the book. You put the milk, raw milk, it could be old milk if you don't like. Remember, old milk is better for the skin. Raw, fresh milk is a little bit more alkalinizing. The skin is acidic. It eats better when it's acid, and it defends itself better when it's acidic. So, the older milk is a little bit better to put in your bath. What it does is it arrests the chemicals that are in the bath. Also, you can add 2 ounces or 3 tablespoons of raw apple cider vinegar.

Q: How much?

A: 2 tablespoons, it's about 3 tablespoons, raw apple cider vinegar. 2 tablespoons of sun-dried sea salt or epsom salt. That's to make sure you're going to pull the poisons out of the body, and they don't get into the body. Then, if you want to make your skin very nice, put a couple of tablespoons, 2 to 4 tablespoons of coconut cream in there. It'll float on the top, so when you get out, it'll just coat your skin, just very finely, so your skin won't feel dry when you get out of a long bath. Every 20 minutes, the temperature, and you're at probably about 104, 105 degrees when you get into it. It takes 20 minutes for it to drop, 25 minutes for it to drop to about 102, 101.5 degrees. Then you let about 2, 2 1⁄2 inches of water out, put scalding water in, and then you just swing that water around so it doesn't cook the ingredients in your bath. Just keep it swinging, and then when it gets up to that high temperature again, which is putting about 2, 2 1⁄2 inches of water in the tub again, then you wait 25, 20, 25 minutes, 30 minutes again. Just keep a thermometer there and test your water, and that way you only have to, over an hour, you've changed it maybe 2 or 3 times. Hour and a half, maybe 4 times. But you don't need to add more ingredients. '

Q: How long does the sport formula last?

A: That's usually a quart, and it will last a full day, unless you're a tennis player. My tennis players, which are probably the most exerting because they do it outdoors in the sun, they'll go through one of those through a 3 to 5 hour match. Other tennis players are out there guzzling a gallon, gallon and a half of water for a 3 to 5 hour match. Get this. Anybody know who Walker Kehrer is? Walker Kehrer, he's the number 2 high school champion in tennis. When he was 8 years old, he was brought to me with asthma. Could barely breathe. Put him on the milk and everything, and what they told him never to eat was milk. Put him on the raw milk and it changed his life. Now he went from this feeble little boy, and I got him on tape because he went before the board of supervisors to testify. I got his mother to take him, and he said, if I don't have my raw milk, I can't breathe. And you've got this sympathy kid in front of you, and now he's the number 2 champion in the United States in high school. Pretty impressive, isn't it? And he just has one of those in a match. Yes.

Q: Your standard of ethics when it comes to places like Whole Foods, how does it match up? Who matches up? What do you sense behind all of this food out there?

A: Well, you know, Whole Foods is not a very reputable company. They advertise go organic or go organic, and yet you see the least organic produce in any health food store. Like they say, it's owned by the Bass and the Bush companies and their trust in Texas. When they first came out, I know the Bass family. I went with one of the Bass daughters. They're ruthless, horrible people, just like the Bushes.

Q: You just allude to motive being greedy. It could be harm. Well, you know, I know years ago the big shots, Carnegie and all, they were very, very concerned that the projection of the population would be way off the page. And whoever it was that suddenly, you know, whoever it was that had a motive to reduce population in World War II, they may have presented paying for the gas and railroad cars. So now this depopulation process is paying for itself quite handily. So in some way, shape, or form, I have to imagine that these people who are as human or humanoid as we are, perhaps of us, they must think that they're doing us a service. And an 80% population reduction is what I've heard is their standing. Have you come across that at all?

A: Yes, I have. But on this, you know, like I say, they don't offer us much organic in any whole foods. And their all-natural beef, when they first came out, I wanted to know what they were feeding their cows. All-natural means a lot of things. They could be feeding them kerosene. That's natural. They could feed them petroleum oil. That's natural. So I called their, I had a friend call, because I'm too well known. I had a friend call their company to get the ranches that were, you know, getting the meat they were getting from the person who oversaw it. Because they are contracted with Whole Foods to produce and feed their meat in a certain way. They were feeding them 15% bakery waste. Donuts. Stale donuts. Got cheap. Very cheap. And I called them, I called them personally and said, you're feeding them 15% bakery waste. That's not natural. No cow eats donuts. But they're made from grain, which cows eat. I said, they don't eat it that way. That's not natural. Well, the FDA lets us claim that.

Q: Wow.

A: I said, then you don't care about your customers. All you do is care about your product. 

Q: [unintelligible] grain-fed buffalo.

A: But those herbivores can handle all that sugar. When my grandparents fed their cows corn, best milk, best meat in the world, still is healy and very calm. So, I don't go with all of this grain fed stuff, grass fed, because I watched the cows in the field. Of course, the cows wouldn't eat the green seed. They would skip that grass and they would break it off and let it fall. As soon as the grass turned to, the grains turned dry, that's the first thing they were sucking out of the dirt, was grain. So, every cow that I ever witnessed in the field grazing was eating two cups of grain a day. Of course, that's not all grain fed, but a lot of your people are against that. And when they're raising hay and alfalfa, they're cutting it before it goes to seed. So, then a cow will never get any grain when they're used to having about two cups a day. Okay, so there's, you know, people who, you know, all these anthropologists who say that when we were cavemen, we lived on a lot of fruit. Man, these guys never lived outdoors. I lived outdoors for three years. You never found fruit in the wild unless it was in very small amounts. There was no fruit available unless man cultivated it. Monkeys purposely cultivate it, so they can be crazy monkeys. But not even the apes cultivate it. So, high-carbohydrate fruit is not a norm out there. People get these ideas and they think that they're brilliant because they can imagine and have ideas, and they have nothing to do with reality. It makes me crazy. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible] bone marrow?

A: The animal cannot have been fed hormones and antibiotics and injections. Any animal you like. The beef and the larger animals it's easier to use. In chickens it's very red blood cell oriented. It isn't the hard stuff that is normal in the larger bones of animals. 

Q: Thank you.

Q: [unintelligible]. The idea is that as you heal, [unintelligible] further away. I've heard stories where people say, oh well I got hit in the face with a baseball so many years ago, and during the retracing process as they healed, their face would actually swell up, their eyes would get black and blue for a short time and then they would go away. What do you think of that?

A: That is absolutely true. However, I've even gone through, you know, there were times when I would detox something that was much farther back than more recent. You know, like on my escapade when I had the nose surgery, when I got that cancer from that epoxy that came out of my glued together fractured nose, it burned a hole here, burned a hole here, took off a third of my nose, and it went down and damaged my eye. But during the night, the acids that I said cancer holds that dissolves dead cells, went down and burned my cornea. Now that occurred when I was, that accident occurred when I was 15 and a half, when I got hit by the baseball. And the surgery that did that was when I was 21. They reconstructed the nose three times. Then when I had that detoxification, it was just 10 years ago, you know. And I had a lot of other detoxifications that were deeper from, you know, even when I was 10 years old, I mean 12 years old. And that appendicitis, when it was really a peritonitis, a lot of the symptoms and all the tastes from that five-day episode came up in my 30s, mid-30s and early 40s. Yet this didn't come up until I was, you know, until 11 years ago, so I was in my early, mid-50s, early 50s. 

Q: When I started the diet, using the book, I got severe headaches. So, is that a detox?

A: That is a detox.

Q: And then do you, like, cut back?

A: No, it's usually salt in your brain. A lot of people have salt that stores in their brain. So, it stores in the meninges, not actually in the brain, in the neurons. It stores in the meninges. So, when the meninge swells, that's what causes headaches. You have no nerves in the brain, so I could do open brain surgery and talk to you at the same time, you'd never know it. But if I'm fooling around with the skin of the brain, the meninges, it has nerves and you're going to feel pain. So, what happens is the brain, the meninges swells, the skull doesn't swell along with it and you have a headache. So, what you do is, like I said in the book, you put a hot water bottle on each side, lie on your back, put a towel over that, tent the heat in, so all the tendons and ligaments that attach the skull's fissures together will relax and your skull will swell. 85% of your headache is gone in about 20 minutes. In the first 10 minutes it gets worse because the brain swells first and the skull, it takes longer. So, you have to make it through that little bit of 10 minutes of more headache. It takes about 5 minutes where it starts increasing, goes about 10 to 12 minutes of more pain and then it starts lowering at that point.

Q: So, you keep on with the diet, you just do the remedies to the symptoms?

A: Also, eat more celery juice to pull those salts out of there. Also, eat tomatoes, watermelon, rind and not the heart, the heavy sweet, but about this much of the pink and then the rind. Eat that, it will help pull those salts out of the brain. So, you'll have less swelling in the brain, but that's always an indication of salts in your meninges. It's not a reason to stop the diet.

Q: I didn't know if I should cut back, because if I cut back on the food, then the headaches would get lighter. It wouldn't be as bad, so I didn't know if I should...

A: Well, cut back not altogether on the foods, but the amount that you take at one time and drink more of the celery. Remember, celery is a negative on carbohydrate and it's high in sodium, so you can eat a little, drink a little of it and pull it out. That will also allow you to have, if there's any toxin causing excess swelling in the brain that pushes on the meninges, you can have the lemon, honey and sparkling water to help neutralize those toxins, so that the carbohydrate in the honey will be reduced by the amount of celery. Now, honey, we didn't talk about that, and we should. A lot of people say, well, honey's a high carbohydrate. Not really. When the bee collects the nectar, it swallows it. It produces enzymes in its stomach which are very similar to insulin, so it converts 90% of the carbohydrate value into enzymes for digesting mainly proteins and secondarily fats. So, when the bee gets back to the hive, it vomits. So, that's what honey is. It's nectar bee vomit. Lots of insulin-related stuff. Pretty tasty. See all this disgusting stuff? It's only disgusting because we're taught that creatures give us bacteria and parasites and all this awful stuff. It's just nonsense. But we all believe it, and it's so sad. We're afraid of our world, and we should be afraid of our industrial world because that's who's causing our damage. So, the honey is not a problem that way. Some people will get sleepy after eating honey though. If you get sleepy after eating honey, you're a person that should only eat it with fat in very small amounts until you can eat more. Okay, let me pull somebody back here. Somebody back here had a question?

Q: Can everybody be able to eat high meat?

A: Everybody, anybody can eat high meat. I've never known anybody that can't eat high meat. Yes?

Q: You know, when you have this cancer thing going on, what's a gentle way to handle it?

A: Which type?

Q: Well, I mean when you knew what you were doing, what's a gentle way to handle these detox symptoms so you can survive? I mean, it sounds pretty dramatic. I mean, other people have died from this.

A: Yeah, or they would have gone to the doctors and had chemotherapy and radiation and died sooner.

Q: Right, but so what do you do to handle it?

A: Well, you use hot water bottles at night and they help you relax more. You try to ease and relax the body. If you're having tremendous amounts of vomit, you know, nausea, you eat little amounts of cheese like every 10 minutes to 20 minutes to help absorb the poisons. You eat some, like I said, the nausea. Also, you can drink some sparkling mineral water with some lemon and honey together. Also, it'll help neutralize the poisons that are dumping into the stomach. There are always these little points that you can do to make yourself get through it. Now, like I said in the book, 95% of the people don't survive cancer on this diet. But everybody's life is made better. Let me give you an example. I had one woman come to me. Her entire arm was a cast of cancer, hardened all the way over to the chest. She was bloated and huge. She couldn't work. She was a caretaker of children for a couple of movie stars. And she absolutely was non-functional. I put her on the diet. Five months later, she was back to work. The cancer had reduced down to half the size. We didn't get rid of it. I didn't think it would because it had already taken over too much of her body. And in a difficult way, she was an elderly woman. She was in her late 60s. So I knew that all that this would do, I didn't know. But pretty much guessed that this was not going to get rid of her cancer. But it would give her another year, year and a half of a much happier, productive life. She worked until the day she died. She died a year and a half after she started the diet. But happily, her daughters called and thanked me and said, Oh my gosh, she had a good year and a half. We thought she was only going to die a miserable death before she came to you. So they were appreciative and thanked me. Other people, I had other people, my mother didn't live. She lived two, three years on your diet and she still died of cancer. You're an awful person, she should go to the medical profession. I said, and died in six weeks, three months? They don't get it. They just don't get it.

Q: How about people who live on a good diet like yourself? Do you stop going to the chiropractor or things like that? Is that something that just falls away?

A: When I had all my back problems, I went to a chiropractor sometimes three times a week.

Q: But now that you're much healthier and everything.

A: I go like this, you want to hear? [crack] Hear that? Cracked my back right into place. Hear the neck? Cracked it right back into place. I can do it myself. Getting into the plow, doing the spinal twist yoga exercise. Puts my back back into place. Hot water bottles during the night along my spine relaxes it. A hot bath, a hot jacuzzi relaxes so everything expands. Then you do your stretch yoga. It'll align yourself. You won't have to do it. You've got something where you can't adjust right in the back and that's usually this way. You know, usually you do the spinal twist. You do this. The plow takes care of it. But the other way of getting everything back in place, what I do is get a medium pool hot water bottle. I put it on the floor and just roll my back up and down and around on it right back in place. So I don't have to go to a chiropractor anymore. I don't have to wait. Oh, I've got to go to a private chiropractor. Oh, my God, I'm in pain. You know, I'm out. I can put it back in. So it's very easy.

Q: How many years did it take you to get to that point on the diet?

A: Well, my diet wasn't instantly the way it is now. I didn't have my diet, let's say, 70% perfected until mid-'80s. And then all along that way, I'm still perfecting. I'm still finding better things. I stopped going to a chiropractor probably about 15 years ago. So I spent 20 good years going to chiropractors. But most of the time I did stretch exercises. But until I learned, you know, in mid-'90s, that if I put a hot water bottle down and rolled my back on it, I got the final stages and then I never went to a chiropractor again. Yes.

Q: Can I ask you three questions?

A: Ask me one at a time.

Q: Okay, first one. You talked about the freezing of meat thing. But one of my concerns, which has also come up, is the quality and the availability of good meat. If a hunter, I'm going to go and kill a deer, I'm going to get a whole lot of meat.

A: I'll just stop you right there. I'll answer your question because I know where you're going. So when I got a deer the last time, you know what I did? I cut the meat in strips, put it in big jars. Do you have those half-gallon jars? There you go, half-gallon jars like that. Put the strips of meat, I coated them with coconut oil, just basted them with coconut oil while they were still cool. I refrigerated them a little bit so they would chill and then the coconut cream would adhere to them and harden. You can also do it with olive oil. I just don't like the taste of olive oil so much. Pardon? Coconut oil. Coconut cream ferments. So let me tell you, your meat will be fermented and exploding all over the place. So you coat it with that and you put some coconut oil, olive oil on the bottom and then you start stuffing in there so there's no air space and the coconut or olive oil has completely filled and there's no air. I did some in 2000 and it's still good. It's still good. I take one jar out a year just to make sure to see how well it is. Got one more jar so it'll be nine years next year for my last one and it's perfectly good.  No, no, no, not in the fridge. Keep it out of the fridge.

Q: And it's not high meat.

A: Not high meat. Not any portion of it has been high. Not even the center has been slightly fermented. Now there was, I wrote in my book about, it was in that milk report, about that scientist who dipped raw meat into kefir and fermented milk and then put it in and he kept it for ten years. So some of the Arab nations do that. They'll coat it with fermented milk, kefir, yogurt and then maintain their meat for months that way without refrigeration. So, let me catch this one first. Yes?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Cheese and honey and a good diet. Lots of milk. Sip on that milk. Make sure it's not cold. And gain a lot of weight. Go ahead.

Q: You talk in your book about sprouted, raw sprouted grains for, particularly a guy who had knee injuries. Is that something that you still promote for joints and rehabilitation?

A: No, I don't. No. Joints usually, keep the cheese and honey and also just meat. Meat's very good for that. Meat with, grate a little cheese with it. With the meat that will help that. A little bit of honey with that. And the hot water bottles are so important for any kind of joint problem. But if the knee problem, now 90% of arthritis and rheumatism is caused by Crohn's disease. Crohn's disease is where the stomach mucus lining is very thin, your own digestive acids are getting through and digesting the intestinal wall. The intestinal wall is getting very thin and when you eat it causes ripping of the gut, so you have leaky gut. It means undigested foods getting into your gut and sends it to the knees first for digesting. 90% of arthritis and rheumatism is caused by leaky gut. Crohn's disease. And when you see these big knees getting worse and worse and you see people getting hip and knee replacements, it's because of the leaky gut 90% of the time. So you correct that and the knee problems stop overnight. Yes.

Q: My question is about honey. I don't remember which book it was, but I remember reading, you talked about how they say, you know, don't give honey to young children or infants. And you also said that a very, very small percentage of infants are actually allergic to honey. How do you know the difference, if you're giving them the honey, if you know if it's an allergy or if it's just detoxing them?

A: Well, usually infants won't have that kind of detox from the honey. So I say in the book, just give them a drop, you know, of honey, one or two drops of honey in six ounces, four ounces of milk. And you'll know if they get diarrhea within an hour or 45 minutes of that. They're, let me tell you, an allergy is a detox, a detox is an allergy. So they're going to be detoxing, but a lot of people don't want to deal with that and it makes them afraid. So I would say go ahead and give them the honey in those minute amounts and let the liver and the pancreas, which is usually what's detoxifying sometimes, and it's the bowel that's detoxing and the honey's creating it, because it provides the enzymes for them to break down the milk proteins properly and the fats for cleansing and healing. Because a lot of women who are nursing their children shouldn't be nursing. A cow's been on a raw diet all of its life. A cow and a goat, those milks are much better than a mother's milk, unless the mother was raised in a tribe that was eating raw milk all their lives. Women hate to hear that from me. But a lot of women, and I just had a Chinese woman last week that said, you know, you're right, my husband said I've got to stop breastfeeding, because every time I breastfed my child they got a rash. And then we started feeding them other milk, raw milk, then the rashes stopped. And then I'd go back to feeding them and the rashes would start again. And she said, I didn't believe it from my husband, but now I know that it's true from you. I said, too bad you didn't believe your husband, because that baby would be in a lot better shape today. So I'm not saying, you know, that the honey will never be an allergy directly, but it is just like people are never allergic to raw milk. But it will help them clean old casein and milk sugars out of their body, as if they were allergic to the fresh, raw milk. But it's the old toxic proteins and sugars that have been stored from the pasteurized milk already in the body that they're detoxifying. So I say in those people, you have maybe four ounces a day for about three months, get through that so it won't be a heavy detoxification, and then you won't show allergies to the raw milk. Does that answer your question enough? Yes, thanks. Okay, good. Yes?

Q: What's your opinion on vacuum sealing meat?

A: On what?

Q: Vacuum sealing.

A: Vacuum sealing meat is fine, but just remember anything in plastic, you're going to have to scrape. When I get something in plastic, immediately I take a flat butcher's knife, and I scrape the meat off, and I dump that, and I bury it so no animal will eat it, put it in my compost pile in a section where there aren't worms or anything like that, scrape it off because there will be plastics that get into that meat on the surface. Okay? Yes?

Q: Are all meats created the same, like is ground chuck as good as other meats, or not?

A: Well, the hunter tribe said that the tougher meats are best, created the most solid muscle and the tougher muscle, so they went for brisket, you know, which is heavy, fatty, hard meat. So, chuck is better than, let's say, a sirloin. A sirloin is, I mean, than a tenderloin. A tenderloin is all soft meat. In fact, the Eskimos won't eat tenderloin. They threw it to the dogs with the bones. The bones toughen that meat for them. And here we pay, what is it, $27 a pound for it? And it's dog food. So the tougher stuff the better. But if you really like a taste like I do, I eat sirloin more than anything, and it's in between meat, it's not too hard, it's not too soft. Not too tough, not too soft, but it has the sweetest flavor. It has more permeated fat throughout the muscles, so there's more fat that's actually in the blood and throughout the muscle tissue. It's more evenly distributed, as if it were in chicken or any kind of fowl, where the fat is more circulated through all the tissues evenly, and there aren't a lot of striations of fat throughout the muscles. Yes.

Q: Say in a ribeye steak you have those big hunks of marble in that fat. How would you compare a hunk of that fat to like cow butter? Like as far as the contrast?

A: Well, when you eat animal fat, it's not as concentrated. The body can use it rapidly like an egg. Butter takes longer to digest and permeates a lot more, and it's much more concentrated in fat than meat fat is. When I was in China in January, in December, and in Laos, they have pigs, wild pigs that they breed, small. You know, not fatty and all this, but when you slaughter them, the fat gets like this thick on the skin. You've got a hard fat that you have to beat in order to eat it, and then the next layer of fat, you can just chew it. It's scrumptious and fantastic. The meat is out of this world. I was eating three pounds a day. I couldn't stop eating it. I didn't want to go to the tribes, you know, because I go to those places to visit the tribes, the primitive tribes, to see how really primitive they are. Boy, is that a bunch of bull. They've destroyed every one of those tribes that I've been to. They clear cut Laos, Luang Namtha. They advertise it as the green state of Laos. They've got something like 60 to 80 natural hill tribes of Indians, you know, native Chinese and Laotian Indians, all throughout there. And every one that I visit, they clear cut 85% of the state, planted rubber trees in place everywhere. It's not ecologically sound. They've destroyed all of their natural habitat. So it is absolute bullshit that it is a green state and that they're preserving the natural habitat and life of the native Indians. It's an outright fraud. It's a lie. And when I went there to one of the farthest, I had to hike three miles. I had to go right to, you know, ten miles from the Chinese border. I had to hike three miles back to visit this tribe. And when I got there, little boys from the age of about four to twelve, boom boom for food, boom boom for food, sex with babies for food. All the girls were gone. There were only two little girls. One was seven and one was nine. They had sold all the little girls off. And this is a hill tribe way back, supposed to be preserved. I was shocked, I was stunned, I was angry, I was everything that I didn't want to be. I expected to find every hill tribe in sound, you know, that was said that they were preserved in sound order, not one of them. And I visited at least a hundred in the past five years and I haven't found one that was still preserved in its natural state, not one. So where was I going with all that? I'll sucks another egg. I'll have it back in a minute.

Q: My battery just died.

A: Mine died and that died. How many mini-consults do I have to do?

Q: I think eight.

A: Eight? Okay, that's going to take eighty minutes or somewhere around eighty minutes, so we're going to have to go pretty quickly.

Q: We've got a quarter to eight.

A: Yeah, so I'm going to have to end the, you know, it's all Q&A for now.

Q: You only went an hour and a half over.

A: So anyway, that fat was the most delicious fat there is.

Q: But you do eat pork.

A: Pardon?

Q: You do eat pork.

A: Oh yeah.

Q: Really?

A: If they're raw and organic. I eat them from my own farm all the time. So that fat, the animal fat does not preserve your constitution as well as butter does. I could go a whole day on a stick of butter, but I can't go a whole day on a pound of fat. 

[audio cut]

A: Okay, the left, the left ovary is about 25% fat and about 20% protein deficient. That works for you very well. The left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. This one is cold, so it's mineral deficient. The right side, I mean left side of the pancreas is about 30% alive. It's okay. The right thyroid is very good. Parathyroid is okay, but the waterlogged tonsil area is okay. The left, I mean the right ovary is a little waterlogged, but it's okay. The right adrenal gland is also a little waterlogged, but it's okay. The right side of the pancreas is about maybe 15, 18% alive, so that's getting a little low. The left thyroid is very weak. Parathyroids are okay. Tonsil area is poor. Put a vial all over your system. So you drink some carrot juice in the afternoon, maybe one or two days a week. Have about 4 ounces of carrot juice with 2, maybe 3 tablespoons of coconut cream, 2 1⁄2 tablespoons of dairy cream, and about 2 tablespoons of honey. Sip that juice in the vial from your system. Also in your vegetable juice, have about 20% of it carrot, and maybe about 20% of it celery. And about 40% of it cucumber puree, and then 10% parsley, and 5% cilantro, and 5% zucchini. If you find that wax on your zucchini, peel it. It looks like you have a lot of good red blood cells, so you have a tendency to be over-acidic, so white meats are better than red. I would say probably 70% white meats, 30% red. If you feel anxious and irritable, stay away from red until you get over it. Fruits. Honeydew melon, as long as you can get it on the green side, and you don't go, and part of it, you know, an inch, inch and a half away from the vine is better. It's a real sweet stuff, it's good for that. Of course, with lots of fat. Berries are very good for you. Also, you have some solvents, like, you know, formaldehyde or chlorine in your system. So have like a half of a green mango with one kiwi, a tablespoon of lime juice, one and a half tablespoon of honey, and about four tablespoons of coconut cream. Take three quarters of a tablespoon of dairy cream, and mix, blend that all together. It's going to taste wonderful, but take half an hour to eat it. Be sure you'll eat a piece of cheese before you go. Okay? That's in the afternoon. Remember, always the fruit meal is in the midday. Somewhere between 1.30 and 4.30. Okay.

Q: Why am I turning to leather on these two toes?

A: Because you're detoxing a lot of compounds out your feet.

Q: Okay.

A: Everybody collects a lot of heavy metals, toxic substances that have been cauterized and don't flow easily. That's because they're not ionically or electrolyte-bound, so they stay in the feet. That's why we have calluses and all those other impairments in the feet. It could take 10, 15 years.

Q: And also, I go through periods with a lot of sinus drainage, and that makes me cough a lot. And it's even in the wintertime.

A: Then I would suggest you eat more cheese to help draw it out, detoxing from the brain, lower the amount of honey a little bit. That'll help. But you just have to deal with it draining. Who's next? Okay. Okay, relax your hands, let them fall limp. When you put your hands in my hands, just let them completely go limp. The left ovary is about 25% protein deficient, but it's functional. The left adrenal gland is pretty waterlogged, but it's functional. Very cold, so you're very mineral deficient. You need to eat the cheese and the honey together a lot. It's going to help your system to bring your body temperature back up. Were you a vegetarian for a very long time?

Q: For a while, about four.

A: Twelve years?

Q: No, not that long, five years.

A: No?

Q: No.

A: Your body's reacted like it's been in 12 years. People who do that vegetarian stuff when they're in their teens or 20s aren't as affected by people who go to a fully vegetarian diet later. The left side of the pancreas is about 60% alive. That's very good. The left thyroid's in good shape, parathyroid's okay, tonsil area poor. The right ovary is very waterlogged and about 30% protein deficient. The right adrenal gland is also waterlogged and about 30% protein deficient. The right side of the pancreas is about 25, maybe 28% alive. That's a little poor. Also waterlogged, so you drink way too much water. The right thyroid is okay, parathyroid's okay, tonsil area very poor. Very poor circulation in your intestines and your intestines are turning into beef jerky. Drying out in your abdomen. So you need that moisturizing formula heavily. So you do that every day. You have moisturizing formula. And for the best results of the moisturizing formula, spread it out 2, 3, 4 times a day, break it up. Always have some with your meat meals, have some during the night, maybe before you go to bed. But in some ways spread it out. So you're giving yourself some of those important lubrication nutrients, moisturizing nutrients all throughout your 24 hours. And you especially need it. You might even make one and a half batches. And have like every 3 hours, maybe 3, 4 tablespoons every single hour to help your system. Because when you do that, you stop digesting. You're just going to waste away. Red blood cell count is pretty high. White blood cell count is a little low. You have more of an acidic condition, so red meat should be on the low priority. Maybe 40% at first, and I would say after about 18 months lower to maybe 30% or 20% of the diet. Mainly white meat. Berries, you've got so many heavy metals all through your body. So dark berries, raspberries, a mixture of those with your coconut cream, a little bit of dairy cream, a little bit of butter. I'm sure you know that. So I'd stick mostly with berries. Also, since your intestines are drying, custard would be good for you. Have that two days a week. So you get berries five days a week and custard two days a week. Put about a tablespoon and a half of coconut cream in your custard. You have lots of lymphatic congestion throughout your system, but you need to gain about 15 pounds before you start doing those lymphatic baths. You can do the 30-minute baths. They'll get it out of your connective tissue. But the long baths, you need to gain about 10-15 more pounds before you start doing those. Otherwise, you'll have a lot of symptoms, a lot of vomit, a lot of diarrhea, a lot of problems with it.

Q: Constipation.

A: Your body wants to hold on to your fecal matter. You get every morsel it can of nutrients. So what you can do is you take two to three tablespoons each of butter, coconut cream, and dairy cream. About a quarter to a half a teaspoon of honey. Mix all that together in a little jar. You immerse it in hot water until it gets up to a little above body temperature. Right before you go to sleep, you take a bulb of syringe and you inject that in your rectum. Let it stay in there, don't let it go. And it'll feed your E. coli from the back end so they won't hold on to the fecal matter so much. You may need to do that every three to five days.

Q: And will that cause me to have bowel movements? What do I do about having bowel movements?

A: Don't expect bowel movements if your body's holding on to everything you eat. No, just want to make sure you're fed okay.

Q: Okay, and don't worry about bowel movements. Just let my body do whatever, and if it goes a week, two weeks...

A: It doesn't matter, as long as it's not building up into a knot. And if you're putting that, you know, the suppository in there with good fats, you're not going to have that problem. Just remember, the older the fecal matter is, the easier it is for the E. coli to break down. So it's holding on to everything it can when you're just kind of drawing it in. So don't be concerned with it. It can cause a little headaches if you're not moving some of those toxins and the body's reabsorbing toxins along that were in the fecal matter. But if you're eating cheese and you're having that fat, you'll be able to have bowel movements, even though they might be small.

Q: Okay, great, thank you.

A: Who's next? Who's next on the list? Call out the next three so we know who. Good idea.

Q: All righty.

A: Who was there? That was number two.

Q: Page four, five. All right. Cheryl, Monica, and Al.

A: Cheryl?

Q: Cheryl Schwartz?

Q: Yeah.

Q: All right, Monica, you're next.

A: Al and then Ken. Al Franken.

Q: We've got to keep it a secret.

A: The left ovary has about maybe 8% scar tissue. It's in pretty good shape. The left adrenal gland is waterlogged, but it's okay. A little mineral deficient because of all the water. The left side of the pancreas. This is about 70% alive and only 50% functioning. The right thyroid is waterlogged. Parathyroid is waterlogged. Tonsil is in very poor condition. The right ovary is in very good shape. It's a tiny percent waterlogged. The right adrenal gland is about 10% waterlogged. It's in good shape. The right side of the pancreas. It's about 35% alive and functional. It's still okay. Right thyroid is pretty good. Parathyroid is good. Tonsil area is good. Tremendous amount of lymphatic congestion. About 30% of your excess weight is water retention. Completely unutilizable. You have very little fat. It's like your fat molecules are swollen with water. They're eating the excess water. Fat molecules aren't meant to eat water. Phagocytes are eating toxins and other organic tissue, not water. Your fat cells are eating water. So 30% of that weight on you is water. It's not fat. Eggs will also help you get rid of excess water weight. Eating by themselves. Causes a lot of thirst. Causes a lot of dryness in the mouth. So you put coconut cream, butter, something on your lips, honey on your lips to keep from sucking more water. You want to sip that sport drink a little at a time. Put that coconut cream, butter, the primal facial body care cream, some fat on your lips and all around. That's what you're drying. They'll say you're dehydrating.

Q: Well, I drink so much water because I work out so much.

A: Well, you don't need that. You have some pretty severe lymphatic congestion all over here. All of these glands from here. These aren't too bad. But all of these here and all of these down here are really jammed. So hot baths you can start with right away and be ready. You're exercising isn't going to melt those and get them to the temperature to get rid of them. I don't care how hot you feel. The body cools itself inside and keeps it around 100 degrees even during exercise. You need to get to 102. Fruit wise, watermelon core and watermelon rind and outer section but not the core. Also help you remove the water. Tomatoes, good fruit for you. Pineapple for the lubrication, I mean for the lymphatic detoxification that's in the book. Pineapple formula, coconut cream. Those are what I would do throughout the week. You have a lot of some kind of industrial solvent in your intestinal area. It could be a lot of formaldehyde or chlorine or something like that. 

Q: Chlorinated water. 

A: Yeah, that's inhaling, it's getting into your stomach. Also for you a half of a green mango with about one and a half kiwis. It's a big kiwi, it's about a medium size, one and a half. With about five tablespoons of coconut cream. One tablespoon of dairy cream. And about a half a teaspoon of butter. And about three tablespoons of honey. Blend all of that together. And if you work out in the afternoon, that's what you sip on throughout your workout. And also your sport drink that I gave out.

Q: What if I work out in the morning?

A: Well, have that. You just sip a drink, sip your sport drink. 

Q: Okay.

A: A little bit of milk is fine. Meat-wise, you need right now probably 40% red meat. About 60% white. Lots of eggs.

Q: Did you record that?

A: Oh, it's on here. If you buy this from David.

Q: It is not.

A: Oh, it's not on there.

Q: Okay.

Q: I'll remember. I'll remember.

Q: She's behind you now.

A: Okay. Who else next? You can jump into the seat when it's free.

Q: Yeah, here, get under that.

A: No, I've got an old recorder. I usually put the recorder on this. I just want them standing around. Ready? Let your hands go limp. Left ovary. She's in good shape, but she's got her industrial compounds on there. Did you use cleaning compounds a lot, or were you around something industrial? Chlorine?

Q: When I grew up, you know, my dad bought DDT.

A: Oh, so that's what it was. So that's what it is. The left adrenal gland is also cold, so you need the honey and butter. Bring in that to mineralize yourself. The left side of his pancreas is about 50, 55% alive. That's okay. The left thyroid is waterlogged. It's okay, fair. The parathyroids are okay, tonsil area is very poor.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Ripped them all. So the right ovary is just slightly waterlogged. It's in good shape. It's a good temperature. It's not mineral deficient like the left side is. The right adrenal gland is a little waterlogged, but it's okay. The right side of the pancreas is about 20% alive. It's getting low. Right thyroid is in pretty good shape. A little scar tissue there. The right thyroid and parathyroids are a little low, slow. And the tonsil area is very poor. You have very poor circulation everywhere. So you have arterial congestion. So I suggest that you have that sport drink. And I suggest that you write it down. You have a whole tablespoon of vinegar in it. And I suggest you have another teaspoon and a half of vinegar with the first vegetable juice of the day. You don't have to put it in all of the juice. You can just separate two ounces. Put the vinegar in that, down that, and drink the rest of your juice. You can do it that way. If you like the taste of vinegar, like some people do, then you put it in the whole juice and enjoy it in the whole juice.

Q: Okay, so you add a tablespoon?

A: In the morning when it's one and a half teaspoons.

Q: Okay.

A: In the sport drink it's a tablespoon.

Q: Okay.

A: That will help start breaking down the plaque in the walls and the congestion. Okay. Also your arteries are thick, not just with congestion, but with toxicity. Like leather. I'm surprised you didn't develop thrombosis. So you're on the way. Well, the vinegar should stop it. The vinegar in conjunction with those other foods.

Q: Right, right, right.

A: Not by itself. It will do damage. Remember, vinegar by itself and without the proper foods will rip your body apart. Dissolve your body. So you have to make sure it's what I tell you to do. I've done too many dissolution experiments with people and with animals. Vinegar can be a nasty substance. It's one of those delicate medicines that I'm using. And I've tried to stay away from it for all these years. But when we have arterial congestion, plaquing, there's no way around it. Also, I'm using it on tumors now. So it does help get rid of cancer and tumors. Digest it and apply it topically. I've got raw apple cider vinegar, only that. No other kind of vinegar. I don't care if it's from grapes or what. You have a lot of solvents, also, at the right side of your body. So you need half of a green mango with a kiwi, and about 3 1⁄2 tablespoons of coconut cream, about 3⁄4 of a tablespoon of dairy cream, and about 1⁄4 teaspoons of butter, and about 1 1⁄2 tablespoons of honey. Blend that all together. With you, I'd like you to put about 2 ounces of water, natural sparkling water. Blend that all together, and then sip that for at least 20 minutes period. It usually is incredibly delicious, but you cannot let that desire to drink it all at once, because it's going to irritate your kidneys. I want it to get into the system, sort of pulling out the industrial solvents in your body. Meat-wise, you need a lot of red meat, probably 60-70%, and the rest white meat. Probably for 4-6 years, and then you can cut down the red and add more white. Of course, you may need a lot of red for a very long time. Fruit-wise, I would suggest several things. You have a lot of lymphatic congestion, so most of your lymphatic congestion is stuck under your skin. And the lymphatics are congested, so you need to do those 30-35 minute baths every day for several months before you get into the long ones. You need to clean out your connective tissue before you start having the lymph system dump more into the connective tissue. You need to clean out that waste first. And pears are also good for you, you know, green pears with the coconut cream and other fats. In fact, I would have that mango mixture two days. Just make sure it's three days apart.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: He was born in Huntsville, Alabama. And I was born in Denver, Colorado.

Q: I'll be just a minute.

Q: Peter, come on.

A: Peter's next.

Q: Hi, I'm Peter.

A: I didn't see you here earlier. 

Q: No, no, I just came for this part.

Q: I'm married to that guy.

A: Okay, terrific. Have you at least read the book?

Q: Yes.

A: Okay. All right. I don't read anybody unless they've ever been to, you know, a workshop or at least read the book.

Q: Okay.

A: Okay, relax your hand.  The left testicle is about probably 25% scar tissue. It's really leathery. You know, it's lipidating in there. The left, it's like turning into your teste. The left teste is turning into leather. The left adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. The left side of the pancreas is also hardening. So you have sclerosis all over the place. So probably about 25%, 30% maximum of your left side of your pancreas is alive. The left thyroid is okay. Parathyroid is very weak, very watery. The tonsil area is very poor. The right teste is only about 5% leathery. That's still a good teste. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. The right side of the pancreas is maybe 10%, 15% alive. That's getting near diabetes. The right thyroid is in good shape. Parathyroid is in very good shape. Tonsil area is atrocious. You have signs of sclerosis all over. What did you do for a living?

Q: I'm a lawyer.

A: Now you're retired. That's not normal for an attorney. Where have you been? Did you grow up on a farm or anything?

Q: He worked for three years in [unintelligible] with farmers.

A: Oh, there you go. They were aerial bombing that whole area for six years. So that's where you got all that stuff. Because this created a sclerotic situation in your entire body. So with your vegetable juice, you need to eat about 30% celery, about 20% carrot, 40% cucumber puree, and about 10% cilantro. Once in a while you can substitute some of the cilantro for parsley. I suggest that you have one and a half teaspoons of vinegar with three vegetable juices a day. About eight ounces the first time, twelve ounces the second time, four ounces the third time. So you're going to have three cups of juice a day, not a lot. And you need a teaspoon and a half of vinegar, raw unpasteurized apple cider vinegar, with each juice. It doesn't matter the quantity of juice that you're having, but that's how much vinegar you need. You need to start dissolving and hardening dead cells that have been killed by those particles. Now, I'd also like you to eat about a teaspoon of cheese ten minutes before, and when you finish, a tablespoon of coconut cream to make sure you bind those poisons as the vinegar starts dissolving. All throughout the day, I'd like you to have like a sugar cube-sized cheese every hour to make sure you're absorbing those, because they'll just do more damage. That's what's causing all over your body, hardened tissue, it's a sclerotic condition caused by chemicals. So, they're farming-type chemicals that you have. That's why I thought you were around farmers.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, your red blood cells are very damaged, but you've got all this growth hormone, so you've got a protection there. But you need tremendous amounts of that. You need to put on, I know you think you might be heavy, but you need to put on about another 20, 25 pounds, so you can absorb all these chemicals for about the next 12 to 13 years. So, they don't turn you into MS. They give you a major sclerotic condition, like the testes. And this is the adrenal gland. Your pancreas is going quick. The liver, the liver is going into it too. You know, you could be dead in six or seven years if you don't do something about it. I'm not a god, but I've seen this kind of advancement before. So, it's my educated guess. If you want to test me and try it, stay where you are, you can do that. We'll see. Let's see if he's dead in six years. I don't suggest you do that. After you gain at least another 15 pounds, start melting some of that hardened fat that goes to those chemicals. This is blocking your lymphatic system. So, your lymphatic system is not cleaning you. It's hardening too. So, once you gain about another 10 pounds, 15 pounds, start taking those long lymphatic baths. Get a hot tub with a meter. It's 102 degrees. Get a Hayward sand filter. No chlorine in it, nothing else. Let the algae grow all around in the hot tub. Scrape it out and use it as a mulch every, you know, three to six months. With a Hayward sand filter, that water will stay crystal clear. If you've got municipal water, you might need to put a little vinegar in it, you know, once in a while. So, that's what you should be in. Because that algae growing in there will pull metals and toxicity out of your tissue directly. So, it's a good thing to have in your hot tub. I let my algae get rug thick. Then I cultivate it and put it in my compost. Plants love it. You see all this white splotchiness? That's all lymphatic congestion. Lymphatic, the lymph system is completely congested to the very artery of it. To the very vein of everything. And it just plugs from a lot of vegetable oils, hydrogenated oils, and these chemicals that are in your body. Meat-wise, you want to mostly go for fish in this kind of condition. If you have red meat, you're more likely to have more acidic conditions. If [unintelligible] the tissue will be utilized that less. So, I would say 60-70% fish, seafood, and the rest. Maybe 5-10% red meat only. Just keep the liver and the pancreas, you know, alive and healing to some extent, and the rest fat. Fruit-wise, I suggest about 3 days of custard, and 4 days of the pineapple mixture with coconut cream. And you'll find that in the lymphatic formula when you take the baths. There's pineapple, coconut cream, a little bit of cream, and a little bit of butter with that. Well, let me give you a formula. How tall are you?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Okay, I suggest you have 3 quarters of a cup of pineapple, about 3 1⁄2 to 4 tablespoons of coconut cream, 3 quarters of a tablespoon of dairy cream, and a whole teaspoon of butter. Blend all that together. You could add also about a teaspoon of honey. Take about 15 minutes to drink that 20 minutes, and don't drink in less than 15 minutes, and then get into a hot tub. You do the hot tub 2 days a week long, and then every day you do a 30-35 minute that you're not going to move... You're going to start moving stuff out of the connective tissue, where a lot of it is dumped and hardened. If we're not taping this, can I take this off? Oh, you are now. Make up your mind. Tape, make up your mind. Okay. For you, the mangoes, Kiwi solution would work right now. It would detox too much. Also, you could have dark berries. Blueberries, blackberries, blueberries, poison berries. With the same mixture that you have in your pineapples, you're just having 3 quarters to a cup of berries instead of the pineapple. Okay. You're welcome. You're next.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: He's in Alabama. Oh, we get along fine. His children got after him about 4 years ago. They read the book. He didn't read the book, but his children read the book. He said, Dad, you've got to stop that. He stopped it. Good. Relax your hands. Let them go completely limp. The left testis is about 25, maybe 30 percent scar tissue. The rest is okay. It's warm. It's functional. The left side of the pancreas, I mean the left adrenal gland is very waterlogged. You drink too much water, but that's okay. The left side of the pancreas is about 60 percent locked. That's very good. That thyroid is very waterlogged and dissolved. Parathyroid is safe. The tonsil area is very waterlogged. Oh, there we go. Thank you. Say ah.

Q: Ah.

A: It's all scar tissue and mangled.

Q: Oh yeah, lots of penicillin.

A: That's probably about 10 percent of what the size should look like. It's a strip of lumpy scar tissue. On the right side, there's nothing. It looks like it was just scraped out. It just deteriorated. So this right testis should be okay. The right side of the pancreas, probably only about 10 percent alive. That side is diabetic, this side isn't, so this side is healthy, but you're getting close to diabetes. But on this diet, we don't have a lot of sugars, we don't eat cooked foods, so the pancreas doesn't have to work hard, even if it's in bad shape. Right thyroid is excellent, parathyroid is excellent, tonsil area atrocious, scabs of lymphatic congestion. So your lymphatic congestion is almost worse than our friend here. You need to gain 30 pounds, 40 pounds, and start moving that stuff out, melt it out of your system. You need two lubrication formulas a day, you need to space it out, six times a day, you have a sixth of it at a time, you need to constantly re-lubricate your body. When you're drying out just because you have no fat, he's drying out with chemical compounds. I would say three days of custard, the papaya, the egg, the butter, and the honey, you're getting a little bit of the lemon in the lubrication formulas, that keeps you down on the fruits. Raspberries and coconut cream would be good for you, so I'd suggest about, how tall are you?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Then have about three quarters of a cup of raspberries with about three and a half tablespoons of coconut cream after six months, it's supposed to be four tablespoons of coconut cream, about one tablespoon of dairy cream, no matter how much coconut cream is in there, and about half a teaspoon of butter. You can blend that together to like a parfait or you can whip the cream and have the berries all in it. The berries, all these berries have to be organic, so if you can't get fresh organic berries, you get frozen organic berries. Fruit can be frozen, it doesn't matter. Anything else is a problem. When you make ice cream, you have to eat it right away. It's said in the book you can push it twenty-four hours, but it's not a wise idea if you have dryness like this in your system. Also you've got a tremendous amount of bile in your system, so you need to have like six ounces of carrot juice two days a week in the afternoon as a fruit meal, as a substitute for a fruit meal, with four tablespoons of coconut cream, about two and a half tablespoons of dairy cream, and three tablespoons of honey, and that's somewhere between one-third and four-thirty, and you sip it, take about twenty-thirty minutes to sip it, that'll help start pulling out the bile. Now you're going to turn very orange from it. It's not the carrot juice, it's the bile reacting with the carotene.

Q: I think I've been drinking it too fast, I've been having seven a day, with apples and green apples.

A: No, bad thing to do. It's going to rip the fats out of your body. Apples rip fats out of the body, it's one of the reasons in the Bible they were a deadly fruit. Fruit of evil, because they stripped the body of fat, so stay away from apples. Apples strip the body of fat, do not do it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, those are toxins that aren't bound in the fat, and they'll cause pigmentation loss, because it actually damages the skin. Well, those are scars, eventually, you know, you change that, it takes a lot of years. You need a lot of fat in your body so you can stop it from happening.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's in the book. Yeah, either before or after the index. You're very welcome. Next! You've still got all this bile in your system.

Q: Yeah, I know, I know. My system doesn't work.

A: You had it so deep in your system, to your bones.

Q: Oh, really? Because I thought it was doing good.

A: You are? I mean, every year I see you, you get better, but there's more bile.

Q: Okay, well, we'll get rid of it.

A: Maybe you're creating a poor bile, because, well, it's your liver that is producing it. It's pretty dry. So, are you eating the lubrication formula again or not?

Q: Not.

A: Cream? No, lubrication formula for the liver. Remember the cream taxes the liver too much.

Q: Butter, coconut cream?

A: Yes, but the lubrication formula with the lemon with the butter.

Q: Okay.

A: And the egg, very important, the whole combination. Well, you don't like that lubrication formula? You're lazy? When are you going to do it? When you make it first thing in the morning and you have it throughout the day, sip it here and there. [unintelligible] Okay, let's see how your glands are doing now. So the left testis is still maybe 10% scar tissue, a little hardened. Left adrenal gland the same, in an okay shape. Left side of the pancreas, do you lift weights or anything?

Q: Yes.

A: How much?

Q: How much weight?

A: No, how much do you work out, an hour a day, 30 minutes, 15 minutes?

Q: It's a special workout, let's say 30 minutes a day.

A: Okay, I'm just trying to figure out how much of this is muscle and how much is hardening of the pancreas. Probably about 35-40% of the pancreas is alive. Left thyroid is pretty good, parathyroid is fair, tonsil area poor. The right testis, probably 20% hardened, you really need to do that lubrication formula. The right adrenal gland is in pretty good shape. Right side of the pancreas is only about 15% alive. Right thyroid is very good, parathyroid is okay, tonsil area is very good. Still have a lot of lymphatic congestion, so you're doing your baths? Hot baths? You need to start doing hot baths. At least 30 minutes a day, maybe 1-2 a week, around 102 degrees, start moving that out. Now most of your lymphatic congestion is all on your back and spine. You have back problems?

Q: No. I have, [unintelligible].

A: Well that's still valid if you have any condition back there at all. So that's where your lymphatic congestion is most severe. So melt that out of there, get that moving. Still, you're still eating a lot of red meat.

Q: Yeah.

A: No, I said last year you cut your red meat down to 40% and you white to 60%. Still having a little too much red meat. Now what that's causing is a little bit of acidity in the nerves. And some people who develop that develop palsy or St. Vitus disease. You know where you get trembles and shakes. Well, are you going to chance it or are you going to do something about it?

Q: I'm doing something about it.

A: And have less red meat. Get it down to 40% of red meat and 60% white. Pears, raspberries, papaya, watermelon. Fruit you should concentrate on. Not the very sweet center of the watermelon. Well, you're certainly utilizing your water properly. It doesn't seem like any excess water is storing. So you're doing well there. You're doing well. Your skin is so much better. Your blood cells are so much healthier. White blood cells, you've got a lot of bile. [unintelligible]

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, no, I'm sorry. Let me do that. There's all this bile. I have about 25, no, do it this way. A third carrot, a third celery. Well, make it 30% carrot, 30% celery, 30% cucumber puree. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, but now I want you to peel it and do a puree to get collagen.

Q: Okay.

A: Then you do the carrots and it's going to taste different.

Q: I don't mind the taste. It gives you work. You're ready to make juice, but now you're asking for an extra project.

A: [unintelligible] Oh, you're juicing each one at a time? You're not juicing for three days?

Q: I juice them all at once.

A: For three days or for the whole day?

Q: I juice the whole week.

A: Oh, you juice the whole week. Wow, that's kind of long.

Q: I know.

A: So some of that juice is pretty fermented by now?

Q: Yeah, it's perfect.

A: Yeah, really?

Q: Yeah, it's perfect.

A: All right, good. Then, yeah, blend that. Not that bad. That's going to take you, if you do it all for a week, it's going to take you another 20 minutes.

Q: Too much work. I juice every day.

Q: You should do that.

A: And then, you know, 5% cilantro and 5% parsley.

Q: [unintelligible] Every other day we do coconut cream in there.

A: Honey in there. No, no honey. It's supposed to be honey.

Q: I didn't, okay.

A: Two tablespoons of honey in that.

Q: In the carrot juice?

A: In the carrot juice, yes. With the coconut cream and the dairy cream.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Apple cider vinegar, did I put that in there to help dissolve more?

Q: [unintelligible] I questioned that last time.

A: Well, let's put the vinegar in the other juice and don't put it with the carrot.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The other juice, yeah. Not the carrot juice by itself. I'm afraid you're going to eat your liver.

Q: I'll put a little salt in the carrot juice.

A: You don't have adrenal exhaustion.

Q: [unintelligible]. Okay, so now you're saying apple cider vinegar. How much apple cider vinegar?

A: I'd say about two teaspoons a day in one of your juices.

Q: Oh, just one?

A: Yeah, one of your juices. If you have that sports formula, you have from one to three teaspoons.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: What? It tastes wonderful. Some people get more thirsty and they need water.

Q: You listen to this diagnosis, you'd think I was in pretty bad shape. I've been doing this for six or seven, eight years now.

A: He's doing pretty good.

Q: I'm doing pretty good.

A: You're doing pretty good.

Q: I know.

Q: Al, would you see the lovely lady right here?

Q: What's that?

Q: She wants to talk to you.

Q: Did you pay yet or no?

Q: Yeah, I paid you $115. Now, she told me $105. I corrected her. I corrected her to add $10 more. You don't remember that conversation?

Q: I do now.

Q: I think you ought to change your diet. You ought to be sucking some eggs here. Really, you ought to suck a couple eggs.

A: It closes at 10. The door of the store closes at 10. The left ovary is about 50% protein deficient and about 80% starved. The left adrenal gland is very waterlogged, very mineral deficient. But it's in fine condition, but chemically it's not balanced. The left side of the pancreas is about 50% alive, very good. Then the left thyroid is very poor. Parathyroid is fair, tonsil area okay. The right ovary is about 35% protein deficient and about 5% scar tissue and very waterlogged. The right adrenal gland is somewhat waterlogged, but OK, mineral deficient and cold. The right side of the pancreas is about 20% alive, OK. The right thyroid is fair, parathyroid is fair, tonsil area atrocious. Atrocious means it's not functioning at all. You probably don't have them. Usually when you're this flat, you're all dissolved. That guy at least had a little bit of tissue, the scar tissue. But on the other side, [unintelligible]. On the left side of the pancreas, you have a lot of different minerals, especially on the left side of the pancreas. You need a lot of dark berries, blueberries, blackberries, and boysenberries. About three quarters of a cup is about four, three and a half tablespoons of cream. About half a tablespoon of dairy cream. And about half a teaspoon of butter. You mix those together.  Other fruit that would be good for you would be custard. It helps your intestines, got a very dry intestinal tract. Almost turning to leather on the left side. Small intestines. You're so fat deficient everywhere. Right side of the body probably has about 60% of what it needs. On the left side, you're 80% fat deficient on the left side of the body. Creates a heck of an imbalance. So usually what that means is you have a lot of tendency to, you know, be crippled later in life on one side if you don't take care of it. Kidneys are very dry. [unintelligible] Red blood cell count is okay. White blood cell count is okay. It's okay for you, it's okay. I have a man who was diagnosed with leukemia 12 years ago. He came to me with the leukemia. And I said, okay, what is your problem? He said, I'm fine. I'm asymptomatic of leukemia. I said, what are you doing today? He says, in the morning I run about seven miles a day because I'm a marathon runner. He has four doctorates. He speaks French and other languages fluently. A brainy guy. Absolutely no symptoms of leukemia. He naturally has a 10 red blood cell count. And man should have 14 to 16 according to the Pharmaceutical industry. And his is 10, 11 maximum. His white blood cell count is off the chart, 80,000. Okay. Asymptomatic. So I said, you know, you could eat red meat if you like. He said, I don't like red meat. I said, fine, eat white meat. No leukemic symptoms at all. 12 years, still none. His system is correct for that. So low red blood cell content, high white blood cell content, perfect for him. You look like you have the same, you know, kind of ratio. Low red side. I mean low white. Not for you, it's a proper amount. Whatever you have, it's a balanced amount.

The thing I'm concerned with is all this bile. You can see the drying internally caused more drying of the system here like on the left side. It's starting to de-lipidate and become hard like cirrhosis. You have lymphatic congestion all over the place, but there's nothing you can do about it except to take 35 minutes baths until you gain about 40 pounds. I don't know if you're going to do that. That's entirely up to you. You do need the moisturizing formula. I suggest you make one and a half of them a day, and you break it up into seven parts that you're having about every two hours. You have maybe two to three tablespoons for every two to three hours, two and a half hours. It doesn't matter what else you're having at the time. If you have that, maybe two to three tables with that. If you have depending upon the size of eggs, it's determined in quantity. So whatever you have left, however much it is, you have that. So once you gain weight, you can have more pineapple. Like a pineapple, once a week, with a little bit of cream in the butter and dairy cream, small amounts. Meat-wise, I suggest 50-50, 50 red, 50 white, good balance for you. Bone marrow will help you get healthier quicker. So you have some bone marrow, let's say, about a tablespoon of bone marrow with meat. As often as you can. Vegetable juice, I'm going to suggest about 35% celery, about 15% carrot, about 40% cucumber puree, and 10% parsley. I suggest you have 8 oz., 12 oz., and 4 oz. in that order. Vinegar would be good for you, but not until you gain at least 10 more pounds. Okay?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, that mostly comes from not enough fat in the body. If you're eating, you know, one and a half lubrications, moisturizing formulas in a day, it could take you a couple of years to resolve that. Like I say, when you have a hardening, you don't form proper nucleus. You want more mucus, you have more milkshakes. When the egg and the milk are together, a lot of that cream is going to build strong mucus. It's going to pull those toxins out. Otherwise, you're going to have dryness and poisons are going to go to the mucus to be relieved. You're not going to have enough mucus. You're not going to be able to sleep.

Q: She's coming behind you.

A: How many more after this?

Q: Three.

A: Three after this or three in total?

Q: What you asked. Four total including that.

A: All right. The left ovary is very waterlogged. Very cold and mineral deficient. You need honey and cheese together. Pull that back together. Were you here for the workshop? Where were you sitting? Oh, way back there. The left adrenal gland is also very waterlogged. The right side of the pancreas is probably a good 50% alive, maybe 45% alive, but also waterlogged. [unintelligible] Do you use oils?

Q: Oils? What do you mean?

A: Young's oils or any of the distilled oils? Aromatherapy or anything? Because you have skin that looks like it's been purified by distilled oils all over the system. It's kind of a very acrid fluid in your system. You drink a ton of water.

Q: I drink a fair amount of water.

A: Yes, you do.

Q: A ton of water.

A: A ton of water for your body. You shouldn't be having more than probably two tablespoons of water a day for your system. The right and left thyroid is also waterlogged, but it's okay. The parathyroid is in very good condition. The tonsil area is very poor. The right ovary is very waterlogged and slightly mineral deficient. The right adrenal gland is probably 40% scar tissue. It's still functioning, though. The right side of the pancreas is about 45% alive. That's pretty good. The right thyroid is fair. The parathyroid is pretty good. Tonsil area, okay. Now, this white splotching everywhere, that's lymphatic congestion. So, everything's congested all over your system. So, you need those long hot baths. They'll melt it and get it out of your system. You've got the perfect weight to do it. The problem is that probably 35% of your weight is water weight. It's not even fat. I'm not quite sure if you'll be overweight enough to handle toxicity once you do the baths. Do the sport formula and eat a lot of eggs to get rid of that water toxicity. Use coconut cream, butter on your lips, make sure because that's what's going to dry. On your tongue, just a little bit of fat, okay. Fruits, cantaloupe is good, small amounts, cream with it, butter with it is okay too. Pears, green pears are okay. Slightly yellow is okay too. With your coconut cream every day, maybe three tablespoons of coconut cream, one tablespoon of dairy cream, about a quarter, about a bean size of butter is okay. Raspberries also would be very good for you to help get rid of a lot of toxicity. So about a half a cup at a time with the same amount of coconut cream, dairy cream and butter. Meat-wise, very little red meat. So you've got all this irritation that comes from something. So the red meats can irritate your tissue. You're going to have more swelling, you're going to have more dryness, you're going to think you need more water because of it. So it would be better if you ate white. So red meats can cause that problem in your kind of condition. You've got excessive acidity. So your person needs to eat a lot of white meat, 70% white meat, 30% red meat. Never eat red meat alone. If you're going to eat red meat, at least have it with egg or fish or something. An egg. So it's not too acidic. Even sip a little milk if you're going to have a big red meat meal.

Q: And stay away from it.

A: Mostly. 30% of your meat meal could be red meat. And you need the moisturizing formula, absolutely. Split yours up into thirds. A third with each meat meal and a third alone. Moisturizing formula. Vegetable juice I'm going to suggest about a little high, 40% carrot, 30% celery. That much carrot. That much carrot. You've got too much bile in your system. And the amount of celery that I've given you with it will counter. So you're having 40% carrot, 30% celery. About 20% cucumber puree and then 10% parsley. I suggest first juice in the morning, 8 ounces and then two 4 ouncers. 

Q: What about the collards or kales?

A: You can do 5% of your juice that way if you want. Just cut down the parsley from 10% to 5%, but never over 5%. Remember those are herbs that will cause detoxifications in your body. You better be ready for it. I would say 4 days a week eat pears for your afternoon meal.

Q: Sherry, who's after Hallie Dunn?

A: Did somebody write that stuff for you or is it on tape?

Q: Good. I don't remember at all.

A: Leave your name with David. Did you about getting the tape?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, hi there. You're a very attentive man. You were taking notes and very there with me the whole time. All of the day. Okay, who else is here?

Q: Bill.

A: The left testis is very waterlogged and about 25% protein deficient. The left adrenal gland is a little waterlogged but in pretty good shape. The left side of the pancreas is about probably 25% waterlogged and it's all in the surrounding tissue, not in the actual glands. But about probably 45 to 50% of that gland is alive. That's pretty good for what we need on this diet. The left ovary is very waterlogged and very protein deficient. Are you a vegetarian at this time? I'm not sure you're digesting the proteins properly. The left parathyroids are okay. The tonsil area is fair. A little scar tissue hardening in the throat and on the left side. The right testis is also very waterlogged but in pretty good shape. Probably about 10% protein deficient. The right adrenal gland is very waterlogged. Probably about 20% protein deficient. The right side of the pancreas is only about 15% alive, so that's getting a little low. The right thyroid is pretty good. Parathyroid is pretty good. Tonsil area is very, very fine.

Q: On the right side of the tonsil area?

A: It's like you have a lot of industrial solvents on the right side of your body. Or formaldehyde. Pardon?

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, not necessarily. I find in women it stores on the left side of the body, and men on the right side a little bit more. Well, I suggest that you have half of a green mango with a kiwi. You could have one and a half kiwis with that. So have a half of a mango, about one and a half kiwis. I mean, if they're large kiwis we just want the normal medium sized kiwis, so it's one and a half. Have a tablespoon of lime juice with that. Half a tablespoon of lemon juice. Two tablespoons of honey. Four tablespoons of coconut cream. A tablespoon of dairy cream. And about a pea-sized amount of butter. Blend all that together. Sip that over a twenty-five minute period. Have cheese right before you drink it. And then another tablespoon after you finish it with the last sip. Just to have a little bit more coconut cream in there. Forget the coconut cream, you have enough coconut cream in there. Have another sugar cube-sized amount of cheese going in. Just to absorb those solvents. The other days of the week, a lot of dark berries, blueberries, blackberries, and boysenberries. With about three and a half to four tablespoons of coconut cream. Four is probably a better amount for you. One tablespoon of berry cream. And about half a teaspoon of butter. And no honey at all. And that should be about three days a week. And then two days a week have raspberries. Once in a while if you want to have half raspberries, half blackberries, half blueberries, you could do that. So you have the solvent remover, which is the mango. I'd only do that once a week. And then one day of the penicillin destroyer, because you get penicillin all over your body, causing complications. So I'd like you to have three and a half tablespoons of each of lime juice and coconut cream. Destroy penicillin. In the afternoon. Have about two and a half tablespoons of honey, a tablespoon, maybe two teaspoons of lemon juice. Blend all that together and pour that into about three ounces of sparkling water. It could be San Pellegrino or my favorite is Apollinaris. And just pour that, not the mixture, but the water into the mixture. Just foam up a little bit. Take about 20 minutes to drink it. Meat-wise, I suggest that you eat 50-50 red to white, pretty evenly balanced. For your vegetable juice, I'm going to suggest about 25% carrot, 25% celery, about 40% cucumber puree, and 5% cilantro and 5% parsley. But only 5% and we'll take it out a little at a time. In a couple of years, maybe in three, three and a half years, you could raise it to 10% cilantro. But you need to be on this diet. And you look like somebody who needs to be busy, at least with your hands. You need to make sure that... If you're in anxiety, you're not exercising enough. I want to tell everybody, if you need exercise and you're too lazy or too tired to do it, 20 minutes of singing is worth an hour on a treadmill. If you don't sing well, go in the bathroom or a closet. And sing away. Get rid of it. Take a look at your opera singers. They have to have tremendous amounts of fat to regulate the breathing and the sound the way they do. Look at Mick Jagger. Heavy, strong voice, skinny as a rail because he doesn't eat enough. It burns everything up, but you see what singing does to the body. You know, even though he uses a mic for most of his volume, he's still up there intensely singing for that skinny, weak person. Okay. Alright?

Q: Thank you.
