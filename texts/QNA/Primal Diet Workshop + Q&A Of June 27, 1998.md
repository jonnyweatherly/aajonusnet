A: Hi, my name is Aajonus Vonderplanitz, and I was a fellow who was dying of terminal blood and bone cancers, which is multiple myeloma. Stomach cancer, it began with that. And I reversed it, just with eating food, no supplements, anything like that. For those who haven’t, has everybody read my book, or is there some who haven’t? Okay. I was a very sickly child. I grew up in an abusive household with a brother who pretty much abused me every day. And the tremendous amount of stress was a leech on my entire nutritive system, the enzymes and the hormones. So I grew up very weak. I could not play sports. By the time I was ten, I had peritonitis, which is usually a terminal infection in the intestines. Bleeding usually. Mine was bleeding. It was misdiagnosed as appendicitis. And while the doctors were there, they thought that they would take the appendix out anyway, just in case it would cause me problems later. Because they don't have a clue what it's for. They'll take something. And then I was diagnosed with juvenile diabetes by the time I was thirteen. And started on insulin within a year. Thank you.

Q: You're welcome.

A: By the time I was fifteen, I came down with angina pectoris so badly that I would pass out in class. It would arrest my breathing. The pains were so sharp that my left arm would collapse and I'd fall to the floor. And usually they just left me lying there for about twenty minutes on the floor. Until I came out of it because there was nothing they could do. They ran EKGs, EEGs, everything. And they basically thought it was psychosomatic. Anything that they cannot diagnose or register has become psychosomatic. Anyone see this film called Safe? Interesting film. Joanne Moore, Julianne Moore, plays the lead. And it's about a woman who has a lot of health problems. All of a sudden she becomes chemically very sensitive. She's around any household chemical, her nose starts bleeding instantly. Symptoms all of a sudden hit all at one time. She became so allergic. Doctors could not register or diagnose anything, so they said it was psychosomatic. This is pretty prevalent right now. I had it back when I was about 15 years old. If my mother got anything with ammonia on it, I'd have a seizure, an angina attack. It's not really a seizure because it didn't involve the brain, but it would black me out like a seizure did. The intensity of the pain. By the time I was 19, I had developed an ulcer. That became tumorous through the treatments. The treatment was, of course, eating lots of chalky anti-acid solution called Maalox. Going through a couple of bottles of that a week, I ended up with a tumor on that ulcer. So they decided to perform a vagotomy pyloroplasty on me. Which means that they went and severed the vagus nerves to the stomach so I would not secrete any hydrochloric acid. Which means that basically I would not be able to digest anything anymore. And of course they said anything raw definitely would not be able to handle so never eat any raw foods. The surgery created even more tumorous matter. The incision, which is from here to here, became chelated. Which means it's a tumor but without the malignancy because it doesn't reflect cancer hormones and cancer tissue, cancer cells. But it got to be about two inches, inch and three quarters to two inches in diameter, varying up and down. And about a half inch to three quarters of an inch thick. All the way through to my stomach. They irradiated that to stop the growth. And of course all radiation in this area affected my spine. And it affected my bone marrow all over and I ended up with multiple myeloma which is cancer of the blood and bone. And they said, oops, now we have to go in and poison you. They didn't say poison you, we have to go in and give you chemotherapy which means we will kill the cancer cells and you have a better chance of living. So I endured that for about three months and learned that it was poison. Because every time I went through a chemotherapy session I was vomiting for days, blood, everything. Could not hold anything down.

By the end of that three months I said, that's it, you guys are definitely killing me. I'm sure I had a better chance before and now I doubt that I have a chance. The chance for multiple myeloma is about 0.01% of people survive multiple myeloma. It's the worst cancer there is. When I stopped the chemotherapy I was pretty much an invalid. I couldn't leave the toilet for more than five minutes without a diaper. I was chronically fatigued. I usually crawled to the bathroom on my hands and knees. I crawled to the kitchen to get anything. I crawled around the house. People had to get things for me. There was a fellow who was a volunteer at the hospice. Those wonderful people who make you die as comfortably, help you die as comfortably as possible. He came over with a little booklet, must have been 80 to 86 pages, about this woman who had cured herself of cervical or uterine cancer by eating a gallon of carrot juice a day. I balked at it, thought how ridiculous. I read it and tried it. And I had been born with dyslexia and severe autism. I really didn't learn to communicate with other children until I was in my mid-teens. Mainly because I could not read. If I looked at the printed page, I got vertigo. And I'd instantly want to vomit. So I actually could not read and I was ridiculed all through childhood. So I cheated my way through school. By being able to copy symbols. So I'd look at somebody's paper and copy those symbols. I had not a clue what they meant. But I could copy the symbols. It made me a great artist. A visual artist. I made a lot of money as a visual artist. It was really handy. But when I drank the carrot juice, and here I'm 21 years old, given a few months to live. When I drank the carrot juice, the dyslexia disappeared. The nausea went away. I could look at a printed page and it would be stable. So I went out and bought about $110 worth of books. And in 1969, that was a lot of books. I did nothing in that six weeks but read. And it was phenomenal. Of course I had to use the dictionary a lot, because there's a lot of words I didn't understand. You know, in the written form. Sometimes I'd look up the pronunciation of the word, and I'd say, oh, I know that word. And I pretty much could figure it out because I was pretty intuitive as a child. I knew what people meant, even though I didn't know language very well. So anyway, the dyslexia went away, and I could read, and I read, and read. And mainly on nutrition. The carrot juice did not put my cancers in remission. But they certainly helped my brain and nervous system function well. And the more I got into diet, I read other people who had cured themselves of macrobiotic diet... That's a good thing to cure yourself of, is a macrobiotic diet. Cured themselves of cancer on a macrobiotic diet. So they thought. 

And it probably did work for some people. And all other types of diets, I took a look at a lot. Named and unnamed. And the frequency of reversal of cancer, any disease, was pretty minimal. In all of them. I needed to get well. So I went to extremes. And I went on a macrobiotic diet for about a year and a half. Strict, to the letter, percentage wise, scale, the whole bit. Something I forgot to mention, I also had psoriasis right before I had cancer. Sores that would not heal. After the treatments, the sores became so severe that my face looked like raw hamburger. When I got acne, and let me tell you, after chemotherapy you have a lot of acne. Because there are lots of poisons that are trying to come out through the skin. Also got bursitis from the chemotherapy and radiation treatments. Has anybody had bursitis? Had experience with it? If you ever had toothaches, put a toothache in a bursa. Bursas are little sacks that feed the joints. And I had it in the feet terribly and I could not walk. UCLA medical team, the experts, the elders said that I would probably never be able to walk again. And I would never be able to wear shoes again. By eating tremendous amounts of raw fat, by figuring out, I went in and I studied physiology and biochemistry. When I needed it and where I needed it. So I studied the bursa. I studied how the fluids were manufactured in the body. And then I went and said, okay, what I need is lots of fats. Raw fats, of course, so all the vitamins and enzymes and everything would be present. None of the minerals would be cauterized and unable to be absorbed or be absorbed. And they wouldn't be glass or hardened substances. So I ate tremendous amounts of avocado and raw butter and raw milks. The bursitis never came back. I experienced it maybe for another ten days and it was gone. I never had it again. I was about 23 or 24 years old. I'm 51 now. So I experimented with a lot of different foods along the way, finding out how to get the body well. Some things aren't as obvious. I could go and say, well, the fluid in the bursa is almost 92% fat. Pretty simple. Eat lots of fats. Some other things were not. Bone problems, because I had cancer of the blood and bones. My marrow was affected and the hard tissue was affected. I had some help with the psychic realm and combining lots of fats with pineapple. And I found that combining that could mend bone breaks and marrow where nothing else could before. The science had never investigated it nutritionally because they seemed to be predominantly focused on having a product to sell or to administer. It's not about helping you get well in a natural way. If it's not lucrative, it's really not fundable because most of your funding comes from pharmaceutical houses and chemical companies who sell the pharmaceutical companies the petroleum products to help make these substances. Just a little divergence here.

There's only one company in the world that manufactures natural supplements and what they do is they have these vats of bacteria and they put a certain substance in and that bacteria reacts with it whether it's vitamin C, whether it's vitamin E, whether it's a mineral, no matter what it is. So it's pre-utilized by the bacteria. Which provides lots of enzymes. However, because some of the steps along the way to bring it to that point are altered, it still damages some of the nutrient value. Then when they dehydrate it, of course, it renders the enzymes inactive again and then feed it to a plant and then eat it. And you'll get a lot of substance... With my research and my lab tests, I didn't do them personally. I paid a laboratory in the San Fernando Valley a lot of money to do the research. And they found that only 2-12% of supplements are utilized. That means that 98-82% of any supplement you're taking can be altered and removed from the system. That's a lot of work. That takes a lot of nutrients. So if you're deficient in a particular area, it's better to find the food which will supply it and then you'll utilize as much as you need within that food, substance and source, without the toxicity.

Q: How much nutrition is utilized from food?

A: Usually 98% to 92%. Depending upon your digestion, of course. If your small intestine is impacted and the bacteria doesn't grow properly, then of course your ability to absorb and utilize certain nutrients and the quantity or volume of that food will be reduced in accordance with that. So anyway, I experimented and experimented and experimented and I went on a vegetarian diet for six years. Raw food, fruitarian, vegetarian diet. I was a diehard evangelistic one. You were a murderer if you ate meat. And I would let you know it and I would feed you this guilt along with it.

Q: [unintelligible]

[laughter]

A: I can tell. That's why I'm looking at you.

Q: He's preaching to the choir.

A: So I went out... I felt a lot better. I mean it did cleanse me. A vegetarian, fruitarian diet did cleanse a lot of the garbage out of my system. It made me feel better. It provided enzymes. Of course the high amount of sugar made me manic all the time and I thought that was tremendous. You know, because gosh I had all this energy. I was like that's okay. That's happiness. So, after living outdoors for three years and the strenuousness of living outdoors. They say the strenuousness of living in the city psychologically is traumatic and I laugh. I laugh at it because going from temperature change and room factors from let's say 80 degrees in midday down to 30 degrees at night, 27 degrees at night, that kind of change on the body is terrific. You understand very quickly what urination is about, what drinking water is about and what drinking, eating lots of fluid laden foods is all about. Because basically our kidneys, all they do is filter out the red blood cells. They don't filter out anything else. If the kidney had to filter out everything that needed to be filtered out, the kidneys would be the size of your entire body. So the one thing the kidneys do is separate out the red blood cells so you don't die, so you don't get anemic. That means all of the proteins, all of the enzymes, all of the bacteria, all of the toxins, anything that is in the blood is in the urine with one added, mainly one added factor, ammonia. That's part of the separation factor. So your lung is your blood without a lot of red blood cells with a little bit of ammonia added to it. So that's why those people in India who don't get much meat, they say drink your urine because it recycles your protein, it recycles your vitamins, it recycles everything. So your blood is full of good rich nutrients you can take back in the urine and you'll be a lot healthier. I did experiments with that. People did fasts for up to 31 days drinking just water or just urine, one or the other. The people who drank just water became very anemic, very weak, chronic fatigue by the end of the 31 day fast, 30 to 31. The people who drank the urine maintained about a third more weight than the people who drank just the water. None of them were fatigued, none of them had the ringing in their ears and the high blood sugar problems when they went back on the food. So urine is basically blood without the red blood cells, so it's very concentrated and very nutritious.

Q: Did they drink only urine or did they drink any water?

A: Only urine, only urine.

Q: Did they drink all their urine?

A: Yes, all their urine. Their breath was horrendous, but they were healthier. But these are part of the experiments. I'm just sharing some of the experiments that I put in the book with you, since most of you have read it. At the end of that three years of living outdoors, which was very strenuous, my multiple myeloma resurged again. My joints were in incredible pain, my bones. I was weak again. I could barely take care of myself, so I decided to die. I went out to an old Indian burial ground to fast myself to death. I had fasted up to 41 days before this, so I knew it was going to take a long time to kill me. I was not going to drink my urine, I would only drink water, so that it would be quicker. There were some coyotes in the canyon, and they befriended me and introduced me to eating raw meat. I thought that they were doing it to kill me, to give me a fast death. In my family, my father is an inventor, my mother is an RN, I have eight aunts and uncles who are RNs, three uncles who are doctors, well, two are now dead, only one is living, and he lives on Medicare because he cannot function anymore. These are doctors. Because I was raised in that kind of intense academic environment, they always taught me to be afraid of bacteria. So they always warned me that never touch a wild rabbit, especially during the spring and summer season because it contains a bacteria that will kill a human being. So when I took this rabbit, I thought for sure it was a quick way to death. You know, maybe a little painful from what was described to me with lots of intense cramping and diarrhea, but so what? I'd been through that before with the chemotherapy. It couldn't be any worse than that, and this will surely kill me. So I hadn't eaten meat in six years, almost six years and three months. So I picked up that rabbit and I ate it, and of course it came right back up because I had all the guilt to go through, you know, about killing animals and defying nature and spirituality and all of that. So it came back, so I psyched myself up and I said, no, I'm not going to suffer anymore, this is it. So I psyched myself up to eat that rabbit, and I sat down eating it, and it was nauseating, it was terrible, I kept wanting to vomit. But I had good training from my parents because they'd say, eat that, eat that, eat that, eat that, you cannot leave the table until you eat that. And everything that I ate, especially cooked vegetables, made me want to vomit. Peas and broccoli especially. Brussels sprouts too, oh my God. And I had to wash it down with milk, and sometimes if I were so sensitive that day, I'd have to spit it in the milk and hope it didn't go off to the side so anybody could see it, and then I'd dump it down the sink later. But they made me stay at the table for sometimes an hour and a half while they went and watched TV to eat the stuff. I was used to that, so when I got the rabbit, I took that early training and forced myself to swallow. The more I ate, all of a sudden it started tasting phenomenal. And I started eating, I ate three and a half pounds of that young jackrabbit, probably a year old, about seven and a half pounds. 

So I ate three and a half pounds of it, then the coyotes ate the rest of it, and I went back to my campsite to die. So I laid down, and I'd had some near-death experiences before, and I'd left my body, and I knew the euphoria of it. Went all the way through the tunnel, which was to me the sun. And this is the way I felt when I laid down after eating the rabbit. I was leaving my body, I felt so great. I woke up the next morning, still there, still in my body, and feeling energetic. And I thought, uh-oh, something as really weird is happening. My parents and all the science and even the biology professor told me about that toxic, deadly, wild rabbit. I'm having no cramps, no intestinal problems at all. I feel pretty good, probably had the first good night's sleep of my life with no nightmares. I'm wondering what the hell is going on. It took me three days to realize it was the rabbit, eating it raw. So then I killed rattlesnakes. I was walking along and a dog on me and there was a rattlesnake. I thought, oh, I'll eat him. So I stepped on his head, it was a sidewinder. I stepped on his head, I picked him up, I remembered how the Indians did it. Picked him up by the tail and I slinged him around and I popped the head off and the head goes flying off. And it worked. It worked. So I skinned it and ate it. And it does not taste like chicken. It tastes like fish. And it is very hard. And you have to cut it like carpaccio in very, very thin slices so that you can eat it. But it was quite delicious. Tasted a little like swordfish. So then I started getting eggs and then I went down, you know, goats from a farmer. You know, I started doing chores to get chickens and started eating all of these things that were taboo. They were non-spiritual. That would be, that would damn me forever. And I was getting well. And I went back to Los Angeles to spread the word. And they said, you're out of your mind. You have really lost it this time. And basically I lost most of my friends. And then I had to start a whole new network. And plus I had to experiment with what I was doing over a long period of time. Because who knows, those germs could get me later. All those E. coli, all those salmonella, trichinosis, the campylobacter, certainly we got to get them. They'll get you. So I went through years and years and years being terrified of what I was eating. What it was going to do to me in the long run. But with all of the support that the actual results gave me encouraged me to do it. So I was neurotic, you know, like most of us, not knowing what to do, wanting to do it, not knowing what to do. So I was doing it, afraid, doing it, afraid, doing it, afraid, constantly. After 20 years I realized, hey, I don't have any reason to be afraid. Think about it, you had your vagus nerve cut, you had no hydrochloric acid dumping into there. So it's not the hydrochloric acid destroying those bacteria that are preventing you from having a problem, which everybody has been saying. Sometimes I'm slow. I could have relaxed much earlier. It wouldn't have taken me 20 years to relax about it. Now I say, give me the bacteria. You don't want it, I'll take it.

Give me rotten meat, I'll eat it. They basically would get you well, quickly. The Eskimos, when I was there, they took caribou and they beat it into a mince. Then they weighed it, weighed it and weighed it on seal blubber and then buried it six inches under the ground. And they let it sit there for five to six weeks, sometimes seven, waiting for it to stink. And when it stunk for a half a mile, it was ready. And that's how they told it. There was a certain point where they buried it and there was a certain marker, a landmark, that said if it stinks this far, it's ready. And they treated it like cookies. And there was enough E. coli in that to kill five herds of elephants, according to science and medicine. Didn't give me diarrhea, didn't affect them. It created this incredible body warmth that never left. They would do it in the fall, early fall, late spring, I mean late summer, and it would take them all through the season. That bacteria would make them thrive with body heat. It would be fabulous. They would take fish, and they would rot it. So the salmonella was incredible. And that was candy to them. The children ate it as candy. They stunk. The breath was horrible. But they were the happiest people in the world. And every book, whether they were a doctor or a scientist, anthropologist, archaeologist, has said they were the happiest people that they had ever met. And then I hear this, everybody says, but they live such short lives, 38 to 52. I said, well if you ate all of your food frozen, you'd probably have that problem too. Because of all the enzymes that are destroyed from freezing. However, before the white man came, before the British, the Americans, and the Russians came, they basically ate 100% raw. When the British brought over their cauldrons, sold it to them, then they started cooking. Back in about the early 1900s, they had developed to cooking 40% of their foods. They still didn't get any diseases, degenerative diseases. The first case of cancer was 1934. The natives, the Indians, Eskimos who lived in the colonized areas, the British colonies, or the American colonies, or the Russian colonies, who had access to and ate the breads and sugars, started developing dental caries in the 1860s. That was their first case of cavities, 1860s. Because of that they had no degenerative diseases, lived 99% on animal matter. Most of it raw.

Q: What was the stinking breath about? Do you think it's just...

A: Bacteria. It's bacteria.

Q: They didn't have any dental problems.

A: It was not dentine at all. It was not the decaying of teeth. It was the bacteria that has that foul odor that's in the intestines. That flows through the blood because your blood flows through the intestines. It leaves off gasses and of course you expel it. Like I say in the book, 90% of halitosis is what you eat. It's what's in here, not what's in the mouth. So, meats became a focus for me. Of course for that 20 years I did it slowly and gradually. I ate maybe raw meat twice a week. Whether it was chicken, fish, snake or beef or lamb, buffalo, whatever it might be. And that was in 1976, September of 76 that I had the rabbit experience. In 81 I ate a poison mushroom, the death cap. No one has survived who has eaten it. I ate 15 times the amount to kill a person my size. It made me an invalid for three and a half years. I crawled on my elbows wherever I had to go. And it was pretty horrific. The only way that I knew that I could recover was to eat tremendous amounts of fat to protect my body and liver as much as possible. I accidentally ate it, it was deformed. You can identify an Amanita mushroom because it grows out of a cup right at the dirt line. Well, something had mutated or deformed this bunch of Amanitas and the cap was an inch under the ground. And I just moved it around to see if it were right there. Other than that, it looks like a perfectly edible mushroom. So I, when researched it, found it was the death cap. And every book that I read said death usually comes within 10 days and it's welcome. And they weren't kidding. The amount of pain that I went through was tremendous. Every hour on the hour, for 20 minutes, my body would go into muscle spasms. I mean, cheek, ears, everything turned into a knot. I looked like one curled up knot. Like that. And Owanza, who was with me at the time, who I was helping her through cancer, just saw these knots all over me and she just started to panic. And I said, no, if I'm going to die, I'm going to die. I'm going to die on my terms. If I go to the hospital, I will be dead tonight. So the only way I'm going to get through this is on my own. So, I did something very, very brazen. If you go to a medical professional and say, don't eat anything that's taxing on the liver. Stay away from fats completely. Let's just, I refeed you with lots of sugar. So I did just the opposite. I took a stick of butter and a banana and I ate them. Six to eight times a day. That's one and a half to two pounds of raw unsalted butter a day I ate. And within about ten days, I was only chronically fatigued. Most of the pain and spasms were gone. Ninety percent of my liver was destroyed and sixty-five percent of my red blood cells. I was alive. The only person on earth known to be alive after eating that much death cap. In fact, those who had eaten one-fifteenth of what I had, only forty percent of the people who ate one-fifteenth of what I had, had survived. So I made it. Lots of raw fats.

So that started me thinking on the tremendous amount of raw fats that were necessary. I was experimenting with fats, with different kinds of diseases, the ones that I thought that would work better, and ate a lot more protein. So in 1982 I started eating raw meats every day. My health started improving very rapidly. I, up until April, the most exercise I had done in nineteen years was this and roller skating once every six weeks on Venice Beach for an hour, an hour and a half. All of this is from eating raw meat. Before I went on any diet whatsoever, when I was a child, they called me fatty Arbuckle. I was very fat. And then when I developed diabetes I got very skinny. I could never keep on muscle weight and I had the regular Jewish type diet which was lots of starch and carbohydrates. So I looked like a pear when I was fatty Arbuckle and very unattractive. I keep this frame right here by doing no exercise. And when I used to have to look like this, I'd have to exercise 4 hours a day every other day. Now with raw meat you don't have to. I had one client, Tony Plana. He's an actor. You've probably seen him a lot. He plays minor roles a lot on TV. He played the Davison role in El Salvador. When he came to me he was 25 years old, hooked on cocaine. He had been a real Casanova up to that time. Sex drive went out the window. And that was part of his magnetism, feeling that sexual prowess. So he was reduced as a personality to this timid little individual. And he had always had a teenage body that never matured or developed. Put him on raw foods, got him off of cocaine easily, doing great. And when I started eating raw meat on a daily diet, I suggested that he also eat raw meat on a regular basis, daily basis. Within two years, his body was all of a sudden full, just like, you know, he'd been working out a lot. He loved it. And then he went to getting better and better roles in films. Until he was, you know, aside Robert Redford in, I forgot what that movie was, what's that little island down there? Cuba. Cuba. And he got that role, and that was because he looked better. He looked stable. He looked more powerful. And this is just by eating raw meats and all raw foods. But that increased. Now I had him eating raw foods from 1977 to 1982 with only eating raw meats a couple of times a week. When he started eating it every day, within two years he was fully matured and developed. And he was already, what, 32 when he started eating raw meats on a daily basis? So by the time he was 34, his body was able to develop because it got the proteins it needed. Finally, after 20 years of experimenting with all these foods, I felt, hey, I'm onto something here. So I sat down and spent five years writing the book called We Want to Live. And I thought, okay, I'm not going to bore anybody with a lot of facts and a lot of information about nutrition in a sterile way, I'd write it in story form, tell my story, tell other case examples within the story. And when I finished that, my editor said, you can't do this.

You can't give that information and not give at least some clues how people can help themselves with this diet. You can have people upset. So I wrote volume two of the book. That took me longer than volume one. It took me almost three years to write the second part. It covers over 200 common diseases and thousands of remedies, raw food remedies, to reverse those conditions. I want to caution everybody that Rome wasn't built in a day and when you reconstruct something it takes time to disassemble it, to reassemble it. So even though your ailments may seem to get better right away, it still takes a long time to completely reverse and heal. Let me give you an example. I had the radiation that affected my spine up until a month ago, the furthest I could bend my back... Because it cauterized. That radiation is like a high temperature element that causes light clay to fuse and become hard. It does that to the bones. So, I'd always been restricted on bending back this far, as far as I could bend back after the chemotherapy, I mean the radiation. I went through a spinal meningitis about a month ago, started a month ago. Also meningitis, so I had spinal meningitis and meningitis. Now, the doctors will freak you out and say, if you have meningitis or spinal meningitis, you'll be like Polio, you'll be crippled, you'll be stupid for life. So, if I listen to them, I'll poison myself with lots of antibiotics to kill that bacteria, the meninges, and then what happens? I'll be well, of course. It doesn't work like that, does it? So, I completely ignored them. I went through spinal meningitis and meningitis for 19 days. I was crippled in bed for 2 days. I could barely move. The pain was excruciating all throughout my spine, down to my knees, coughing up tons of mucus. I had a beach towel that I filled with mucus for that 19 days, and got rid of lots of poisons in that time. And then all of a sudden I said, well, now I've got the test. Did I get better or did I get worse? Did I get stupid? And now I can go back that far. That's a tremendous arch where I wasn't able to do it before. I could strain and only get that far before. So the disease is a cure, as long as you're feeding yourself properly. Don't be afraid of pneumonia, don't be afraid of meningitis, don't be afraid of gonorrhea, don't be afraid of any of those. It just means that you have toxicity in that area of your body, and it will help it remove. Now to prove that, I had my, in certain circumstances, I had the cases of polio, a person with polio in there. As long as her polio, myelitis was prominent and a high amount of it in her blood, she healed. As long as she was with the medical profession and taking... 

[audio cut] 

A: ...people got well. When the bacteria went low, people did not progress. So the lab person did some experiments with the byproducts in the body when the bacteria levels were high. Found that normally if somebody has an area of their body that requires a dissolution of tissue, your body forms solvents from fats and alcohols that your body will make from carbohydrates. Take those solvents and it will dissolve that tissue or that debris. The byproduct of that is almost identical to turpentine. Highly toxic in the body. They used to give turpentine for certain conditions, which is like giving strychnine to help poison the condition out of your system. Basically what that does, it poisons the system so it stops that detox in that area because they have to deal with that poison that's going into the body. Hold on a minute. [sips] When the bacteria was present, that turpentine-like substance was minuscule, yet the same amount of dissolution of tissue occurred. If parasites were involved, there was hardly any toxicity at all as a by-product of the parasites eating that decaying tissue. Their excrement was one hundredth less toxic than that solvent by-product turpentine in the system. So, you've got parasites? Give them to me. I'll take them. I like parasites. I like bacteria. I'll take them all. And like I said, because I had the vagotomy pyloroplasty, which means they severed the vagus nerve to my stomach, I had no hydrochloric acid. The hydrochloric acid is not your savior from bacteria, as the doctors and nurses like to postulate. E-coli, salmonella, trichinosis, campylobacter, all of those that they're pointing the finger at, it's like pointing the finger at the vulture and the crow and the worms. They didn't create that decaying tissue that they're eating. They didn't kill that animal, that creature that they're eating. They're preventing the planet from becoming a gaseous, toxic cesspool. So pointing the finger at those bacteria and those parasites is absolutely absurd. If you have decay in your body, let them do the work. Stop eating the things that are creating decay in your body. They require the bacteria and the parasites that don't go along with feeling good. And nobody, if they're going through a major detox, is going to feel well. But that's all part of the process of getting well. I tell everybody, your body is like New York City. It's been around a long time. It needs re-plumbing. It needs, you know, re-everything. So you take it apart piece by piece and you put it back together piece by piece. It takes a long time. I really keep getting healthier every year. I'm 51 now. It's fantastic. It doesn't stop. I know that I still can be healthier. When I can bend back and touch the floor, I'll know that I've gotten to where I want to get, health-wise. So healing and regeneration is a lifetime process. But it's better to go toward health than to go away from it. So it's your choice.

Q: You were talking about major detoxifications that look like diseases. Well, if a person was, say, 80% raw, let's say they were doing an occasional cooked meal still, how would they know whether it was something clearing out, like a retracing, or...

A: Or something that they're eating in that 20%.

Q: Right, exactly.

A: Well, when something is deep-seated, a pathological condition in your body, that's from a long time ago. Let's say you're getting nauseous, low in energy, even fatigue for a period of time, that can be from what you're eating at present. If you're eating 80%, your body has enough nutrients to keep up with any amount of toxicity that's going to be created, so it won't cause degeneration unless you're poisoning yourself with something real serious, like salt, too much salt, or too much of any drug, chemical that can damage the system.

Q: So in general, if it's not like a really bizarre thing coming out, then you look more towards the 20%.

A: Yeah.

Q: Like if it's fatigue or something.

A: Right, yeah, or nausea, or irritability.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's just best to do that because the amount of toxicity that's formed from raw fats is tremendous. The lipid oxides that are formed, and they're carcinogenic when they collect in a body for 40 to 60 years. And you have the protein toxins that are formed from your cooked meats, too. So it's basically true. Cooked meats, I mean, meats are all poison when cooked. But when they're not cooked, they're just the opposite.

Q: On the Ebola, which basically, I guess, liquefies the organs before the body dies, what transpires in that process?

A: Well, I haven't directly studied it, so I'll just have to theoretically approach the question. Ebola is similar to, from my limited investigation of it, similar to the mushrooms come from mycelium. Very similar to that. Mycelium is, or Ebola is mycelium of the human system. Mycelium in plants goes around and melts dead roots. Ebola can go through your system and cause a melting of all tissues that have hardened, like cirrhosis of the liver or multiple sclerosis. A lot of people have a lot of drying networks of veins that have actually blocked and built up and hardened, you know, just like your colon can become impacted. And the veins and arteries and systems and capillaries are so blocked that they actually close off. And your body will grow veins in and around. If Ebola gets in there, from what I understand, it can melt all the old tissue. But if what you have in your body is nothing healthy, you're going to melt your whole system. Anywhere where there's decaying or hard tissue. Of course, again, the end product of Ebola is less toxic than any other kind of solvent, body solvent related toxicity. It is still tremendous. So Ebola is not, that I would not, I would stay away from that bacteria until you got really well. Yes.

Q: And what causes people, you know, we've had cases of people getting E. coli, getting sick and dying and undercooked meat, and these children in the swimming pool.

A: They're pointing the finger at the wrong thing. Like that 124 or 125 people with the Jack in the Box incident, that meat was cooked.

Q: That's right.

A: It was cooked, it was not raw.

Q: Wasn't it undercooked though?

A: You can say undercooked. E. coli, according to science, is destroyed at 197 degrees. 179 degrees. Something like that. Incapacitated. If you take a hamburger as thick as Jack in the Box makes it, and you throw it on the grill for as long as they do it, even 15 seconds, it reaches that temperature. Unless it's frozen. It doesn't make any difference. It's cooked at a high enough temperature that it's not going to be the same. Now if you take that hamburger that you've cooked, and let's say it's a little raw in the center, and you let it sit for 24 hours, that E. coli that forms is not a natural E. coli. It's like me taking a herd of elephants, burning the hell out of them, and watch them stampede. They will wreak havoc. Because they're no longer a stable, balanced creature. So it will storm through the body. Raw E. coli is not a problem. If it were, the Eskimos and the cavemen would have been dead, and man would never be around. E. coli is 99% of the bacteria in your intestines. Without it, you could not manufacture your B vitamins, nor synthesize your amino acids. You would have no immune system without the E. coli in your colon. They are just wanting to point the finger at somebody, other than the chemicals, other than the process of your cooking foods. They're about manufacturing. The medical profession is about drugging. They're not going to point the finger at themselves, the creators of it. They're going to point the finger at anything natural that they can. It's like, let's say you go into Beverly Hills. There's been a big robbery, and there are a bunch of black people on the street. Who do you think is going to get blamed? That's basically what the medical profession and science are doing. They're just pointing the finger at the vultures, the crows and the worms.

Q: Then what's making...

A: People sick?

Q: Yeah.

A: The toxicity it collects from cooked foods or from chemicals, preservatives, pesticides. Let's say you get a pinhead worth of chemicals, let's say preservatives, in a week's period. To a system that has no good immune system, that can cause a poisoning of a particular area of the body. Let's say in the liver or the intestines. Let's say it destroys all of that tissue for about the circumference of a quarter. Once that decay goes underway, E. coli, Salmonella, Campylobacter, depending upon the tissue there, is going to thrive on that tissue. But you don't blame the bacteria that eats up the decay. It's not the fault of the bacteria, it's what caused the decay in the system. And they're not looking at that at all. And yet if you look at the work of Pottenger, you know, with the cats and with humans, feeding them cooked, feeding them raw, great tissue health with raw, disease and eventual extinction on the cooked. And my work bears out the same stuff, the same results. That it's cooked foods and chemicals that are poisoning people, that are causing these reactions, and they're just blaming it on the bacteria. I mean, why does syphilis come out? Why does polio, myelitis come out? If you observe that tissue, it's because that tissue is having a problem, there's a decay in that tissue. So why then is the bacteria the problem? It's not. Yes?

Q: It's on another topic. Red meat, I've heard about phosphorus and about creating acidity in the body and thus pulling calcium from the bones, which is of major concern to women in osteoporosis.

A: In cooked meat, that is very true. Raw meat, it's not.

Q: So there have actually been tests on this, real rigorous science that shows that this is the case with cooked meat?

A: Well, I don't know what you call rigorous. If you talk about a university doing it...

Q: Control group?

A: Yes. Studies have been done on animals. If you look at Pottenger's work with the 900 cats, you'll see that all of the bones and organs, there was no leaching at all of any of the tissues, including the bone, the cartilage, or the tendons. Any of the animals received completely raw meat. The control groups that ate either some pasteurized milk or some cooked meat, or some condensed milk, the different control groups that he experimented with, there was bone disintegration, degeneration in every one of those. But in the raw group, there was none.

Q: Okay, nothing has been done with humans?

A: Well, he did. He did. He was an M.D. to get away with it.

Q: And so we found the same results?

A: The same results, yes. And Price, Dr. Price, who was a dentist, traveled all over the world studying different cultural groups. And because he was a dentist, that's where his focus was on the teeth and the bones, and what groups had osteoporosis and what groups had dental caries and which didn't. Now, he didn't focus on raw and cooked. He focused on indigenous people's diet. If they changed their diet, they had problems. But it was mainly toward cooking more and processing the foods more. But I've seen that... let me give you an example. Fella was 56 years old, has maybe nine teeth left in his mouth and they all have extensive decay in them, all loose, hanging there. Been a vegetarian for about 15 years, 16 years, maybe 17 years, 15 to 17 years. Went on this raw diet, lots of raw meat. And it's a difficult thing because this guy lives in a house that's vegetarian. So he's not allowed to bring his meat in. He has to go buy it, put it in the cooler, go out in his car and eat it. His teeth have stabilized, they're not moving around anymore in his mouth, and he doesn't have all the pain unless he eats something with salt in it, like lots of cheese with salt in it. Salted cheese, even if it's raw. It causes him some dental problems. In my situation, I was supposed to lose all of my teeth by the time I was 24. My mother lost hers by the time she was 32. My teeth, after chemo and radiation, my gums bled. All I had to do was go like this and it bled. My teeth were just hanging. I could just move any of them like this. They wanted to pull all of them. I said, don't you get near me. When I started eating the meat on a regular basis in 82, all the red disappeared. My teeth became stable. Not only once in a while will I have a certain detox because I had a lot of mercury fillings, and that mercury poisoning is a problem. So sometimes when I go to a mercury detox, I can tell it's mercury detox because I'll start tasting the mercury and start getting nauseous. During that time I may have a little loose tooth or a little abscess in the gum. And I should have lost all my teeth, you know, what, 16 years, 17 years ago. And the meat stopped it. I have all of my own teeth.

Q: Just one other question. Is this more of a healing type of diet if you're in a problem situation? Or is this a real maintenance, continued health situation that really just is good for all conditions at all times, at all times of your life?

A: Okay, to my experience it's the latter. It's good for all conditions.

Q: Who are on this diet, that there are numbers? I'm sort of a scientist, so I like to see numbers.

A: Okay, that's good.

Q: Are there people who, it's just not testimony, but folks who have, like you, have been on the diet for a long, long time, and you can actually see changes over a period of time?

A: How much time?

Q: Five years?

A: Oh, plenty. Probably around 3,000. Some as far back as 20 years. Like Owanza, who I mention in the book, she had 63 tumors in her body when she came to me. I was young into it. You know, this was '81, right before I ate the poison mushroom, so I wasn't eating meat every day. And she came in the door, and she was only 35 years old, had a 13-year-old boy at home, a young husband, and she was just white, and her flesh hung. Like that, 35 years old, you know, it looked like she was 60. Although she was a vegetarian for 14 years, and her face looked young, but the rest of her body didn't. And she shook like this. When I opened the door, I said, Oh my God, I can't help this person. And it worked. So many times I've said, It will not work for this person. It will not work for this person. And it did. The only people now, and there are some people that have come and said, It's going to work for this person, and it didn't. All those people had extensive medical therapies. Chemo, radiation, or surgery of some sort. And finally, just this last year, I ran across some research by Hardin B. Jones, who was Emeritus Medical Physicist and Physiologist at Berkeley. And he concluded in the late 70s, or mid and late 70s, from his research of cancer, the cases that refused, the individuals who refused any kind of therapy, lived an average of 12 years. Those who received either chemotherapy, radiation, or surgery, or all three, or any combination, lived an average of three and a half years. So when they tell you that they are going to extend your life, they are absolutely lying, whether they realize it or not. And they are very miseducated, very educated by the pharmaceutical industry, who is selling a product. Most doctors really don't know the truth, because they stay stupid purposely. They don't want to know. And this is published information. Hardin B. Jones went before quite a few court cases and through the legislature and testified on all of that document, which he documented for like 23 and 28 years for different particular systems, and said that medical treatment should be avoided at all costs. It will shorten your life by three times.

Q: So I'm thinking about toxins and chemicals in meat. Do you use organic meat? Do you think that's important?

A: Organic meat is always better, because if the animal has had to use its fats to deal with toxicity, that means that it's not going to be available for us. My lab tests, when I was doing them about 13 years ago, on the difference between organic meat and non-organic meat, found that in the organic meat, there was a lot more fats and proteins utilized. In the individuals who ate inorganic meats, there was a lot more fat combined with toxins. The body knew enough not to release those, not to digest it. It was almost as if the body passed it to the body whole, undigested. We were very impressed with that, and we ran that one six times in a two-year period. So I would say that that research was done starting 13 years ago and was ended about 10 years ago. So that research existed for the amount of pollution that was in those animals now, I mean then. What it is now, and from what I understand, the extent of pollution that's being fed back to cows now is increased probably by two-fold. Back then it was probably 2%. Now it's like 8% to 10%. So going back and doing the tests now, I don't know how they would be. And my lab guy died last year. To get somebody who's knowledgeable and who can go through and knows what to look for, I don't know where I'm going to find it. I have one fellow up in this area, Doug Haller, that may be able to help, a brilliant scientist. He's trying to get a team of people together. So we're going to see. So I would say organic is always better. But I've been eating inorganic because I've been traveling around and camping in the Sequoias. That's why I'm here. I thought I'd drop by and say hello. Yes?

Q: I wonder if you would share what your diet is like right now.

A: On this trip or in general?

Q: No, in general.

A: In general, I am going to say that I eat when I feel like eating and I eat what I feel like eating at the time. So I'm pretty instinctive. During meningitis, when I was going through that, I was less instinctive and more intellectual. Maybe I'm just too anal retentive. Because I know certain facts, I say, I subvert my own instincts and say, no, you're not going to have that, you're going to have this. Because I know that this will work. And then I give my body what it wanted later or at another time of the day. Basically though, I've evolved to a diet which is during the fall and winter and early spring, one piece of fruit a day. Very little carbohydrate. I have a tendency to get manic if I have more than that. A little too high. When I was a vegetarian it was great because I thought it was leading me to spirituality. But now that I know that it diffuses and confuses my thinking. And I had a tremendous amount of difficulty. I like to diverge, you know. In my talks, as you see, I'll pull out this element. But here we bring it back, before I could never find my way back. You know, and bring it right back to where I wanted it. So, I limit my...

Q: Just to clarify, when you say fruit...

A: Sweet fruit.

Q: Sweet.

A: Sweet or acid fruits. Anything with high carbohydrate.

Q: Like avocado, tomato would not be...

A: No, those would be different. I'm talking about sweet fruit. Sweet or acid fruit. Anything with high sugar content. I limit that to one a day. And I always eat it with a fat to slow it down. Now, it doesn't... Not everybody has to go along with that, but anybody who has a sugar problem, I suggest that they do it. Diabetes, hyperglycemia, any type of sugar problem. Mania, do it. Have fat with it. Slow it down so it doesn't cause the brain problems.

Q: If you're making a smoothie with a banana, you make sure to put some butter, raw butter or some raw oil.

A: You've already got the eggs.

Q: The eggs as well.

A: Eggs is a tremendous amount of cholesterol. It's not a problem. I try to eat from one to three pounds of meat a day. There are days when I won't eat any meat, but it's very rare anymore. When I was more acidic, throughout my tissues and I wasn't as clean, I couldn't eat as much meat. It would make me nauseous. It would repulse me. This is where I'm evolved to now. That doesn't mean anybody can get to that overnight. Some people can. They progress health-wise very quickly.

Q: How important really are the vegetables? Have you found?

A: Pardon?

Q: How important really are the raw vegetables?

A: Whole vegetables?

Q: I'm not craving them, and maybe I should.

A: Raw whole vegetables?

Q: Yeah.

A: Well, what I've found over the years is that they will prevent an appetite for meat. Raw meats. Any type of meat, really. Because the human digestive tract starts off in an acid solution in the stomach. It's 80% acid through the small intestines and almost 100% acid in the colon. A vegetarian animal takes 48 hours, two to four stomachs, and 60 times the enzymes, or 60,000 times the enzymes to disassemble the cellulose molecule to digest vegetation. In a human body, less than half of all of that. So what happens is, we just secrete all these alkaline fluids eating whole vegetables as it goes through. And when it reaches the sigmoid colon, it's not even half digested. So what happens is, those alkaline fluids neutralize the acid bacteria that will digest the foods that you need, the meats. So you won't be able to digest them properly, so you're repulsed by them. So I say stay away from whole raw vegetables.

Q: So if you ended up basically raw meat, raw butter and honey, occasional piece of fruit, you'd probably be okay?

A: Yeah, basically yeah, definitely.

Q: Because I'm doing that more and more, and I'm not real domestic anyway, who wants to do the salad things you think you should?

A: Yeah, no, it's harmful basically, unless you have an impacted colon, an impacted small intestine, that could utilize that little bit of alkalinity, maybe in a salad once every day, or once every two or three days, just enough to neutralize some of that over acidity.

Q: Are you getting the vitamin C from the meat then?

A: There's vitamin C in everything.

Q: Okay.

A: And plenty, you don't need, if you're on a cooked diet, you need tremendous amounts of all those vitamins. When you're on a raw diet, you don't need a lot. However, there's lots of vitamins and lots of elements, enzymes, minerals that you need as a supplement, and you can get them in vegetable juice. What happens is the vegetable juice goes in and alkalizes the stomach for a short period of time, but because of all the vagus nerve going through the stomach, your body can acidify itself in 10 seconds. So the vegetable juice is absorbed by the time it hits the end of the duodenum, so it doesn't interfere with the intestinal tract at all. It alkalizes the blood and takes care of all those acids that are being dumped into the blood, into the lymph system from the body, removing toxicity, all those toxic acids from cooked foods or from damage, chemical or bruising or anything. Yes?

Q: How do you get over the psychological barrier of sinking your teeth into raw flesh?

A: If you stay away from whole vegetables, it'll take care of 75% of the repulsion. If you drink vegetable juices, eat lots of fat, you're going to find that you have an easy way of eating it. It's much more palatable. It's that eating the whole raw vegetables that causes the problem. It destroys, neutralizes the acid bacteria in your colon and that adjusts your whole body, saying, can't handle me, makes me a little more repulsed. If you eat it and you can't digest it, what will you do? It's putrefying in the intestines. Then you have lots of bacteria that want to go to work to detox you. So what are you going to end up with? Diarrhea, all kinds of problems. Now, about 12% of people who go on this diet, it changes in my exposure to people, it changes because the more people I'm exposed to, the tests change. But right now it only says about 12% of everybody who starts on a raw diet, that includes raw meat, has what's called a bacterial food poisoning. It's not a poisoning, it's an intense detox. Now, a lot of the lab tests, most of them proved that the liver was heavily detoxed when you finally got meat proteins to be able to allow the liver to cleanse. So what does it do? It dumps those toxins into the bowels, and they're highly toxic, highly acidic, and they can burn and damage the intestinal walls. So the body floods foods in there, and you have diarrhea, you have nausea, you have all those so-called bacterial food poisoning problems. But people who aren't on raw meat diets have those too. So every time they point at the guy who eats raw meat, or any kind of raw meat, whether it's fish or whatever, they say, he got that at the sushi bar. Well, what about the guy who's not eating raw meat? They have it more frequently than people who are on a raw meat diet. It's a terrible prejudicial perspective. But not something to worry about. Anyway, to finish that question. What was the question now? I need some honey. Oh, the psychological. Stay away from the whole vegetables. Because they'll cause a problem. For those of you listening to this not seeing me, I just put some honey in my mouth, that's why I mumbled. Also, parsley juice will help increase your appetite for meat. Pineapple will help increase your appetite for meat. Not an over abundance of pineapple, but a little bit every day will help increase your appetite for it.

Q: My experience was just the willingness to try it and then to see how it felt in my body, and how I was shocked.

A: That's how most people can do it, but you have to understand, some people are so compromised in their digestive tract with their bacteria, that they actually get repulsed when they taste it, when it goes into their mouth. The body is telling them, not a good thing to do right now. And I found that removing whole vegetables from the diet within two weeks to a month, they're really into the meat, and they stop eating the vegetables. Now, I have one woman who's a health professional, who now partially survives, but she had a difficult time on the diet. She had to have that raw salad every day, or else she's going to get constipation. Had to have it. Now, her husband was completely on the diet, not eating the vegetables, whole vegetables, only the juice. Great. The guy with chronic fatigue, he's a stockbroker, lots of high pressure, everything's easy for him now. Guy with strength, developed muscles, without having to exercise, a different person entirely. And his wife, who's the health professional, is having all this difficulty because of all the brainwashing. She didn't have the whole salad, she was going to be constipated. So as long as she had the whole salad, it was going to interfere with bacteria. And what is feces? 80-90% bacteria. It acts like, it builds and grows and grows, and it becomes like a sponge. So it takes that little toxic matter that would be like a bullet, like a rock in your system, and aerates it into a substance that's easy to move through. That bacteria is destroyed, you end up with constipation. So, she'd eat the salad every day and destroy that bacteria, that acid bacteria that would help blow up the feces. She had constipation. Finally after a year and three months I said, listen Marilyn, you've got to dump it, you've got to stop, just try it. I don't care if you suffer constipation for a week, put some butter up there, inject some melted butter up there, anything you can do to make it easy to go and see what happens. Two weeks her constipation was gone. Gone. 

Q: So it's not the fiber that does it, it's the... 

A: If you're on a cooked diet, the fiber helps as a broom. It'll whish all that toxic substance, it's all melted matter. It's just, it's like dust, you know, made into food substances that you eat. And cooked meats that are so highly toxic, it helps to move them through faster because there's nothing to digest it well so it sits. 

Q: So the diet of primarily the protein and the butter, the fats...

A: Fats, right. 

Q: ...is, keeps the bacteria as high as possible. And that in itself is what keeps them going through.

A: If you eat too much cheese, you know, you might have a little problem. Without butter or without avocado or something else.

Q: Maybe, you know, I also wanted you to kind of finish your diet that you got into the meat.

A: So daily fruit. I eat tremendous amounts of fat and I eat fat almost every time I eat. I learned that from the Eskimos. They eat... 50% of their diet is fat. When I was doing my experiments with health, if you make 50% of your diet fat, you heal 5 times faster.

Q: Now this amount, or in calories, this is actual amount?

A: This is actual physiological amount. Yes.

Q: I have a question. Is it okay to eat the fat on the meat? Raw. The raw fat on the meat.

A: Let me give you an example. I have clients all over the world who cannot get better. I say, even better than butter, get the meat from the fat. I mean the fat from the meat, eat it. It's easier to eat. It's already been assimilated through an animal's body in a way that constitutes into tissue. Butter is like, butter is a little different. The calf has to take it and deal with it. They make it into fat within their body. They feel healthier. It's easier to digest than the butter or the cheese and works a lot quicker.

Q: Wouldn't the toxins go into the fat?

A: Yeah, but like I said, the fat still passes through.

Q: Right, right. It's like the fat is both protecting you and getting rid of toxins.

A: Right, yeah.

Q: Interesting.

A: So then I eat, I eat fat with everything, a tremendous amount.

Q: So what kind of fat?

A: Well, it depends. When I get raw cream, I'm going through a tremendous amount of raw cream. I love raw cream. Sixteen ounces a day, raw cream. You know, pint. I'll still have a little butter. Maybe half a stick. Or an avocado. I eat lots of, I eat very fatty meats.

Q: Half a stick of butter a day?

A: A day.

Q: If you have the cream.

A: We're talking a day.

Q: If you have the cream.

A: If I have the cream.

Q: If you don't have the cream...

A: Right, if I don't have the cream right now and I'm traveling, and I've got my raw butter in my cooler.

Q: Do you do more butter?

A: I'm going through almost a pound a day.

Q: And you do that...

A: But I'm exercising, which I'm not used to. I'm not used to, I've got a girlfriend over here that loves to exercise. Come on, let's go hiking, let's go hiking. I'm used to taking a nap. That's my exercise. Now we're going to exercise.

Q: What about that olive oil, [unintelligible], flax oil, cold pressed?

A: They're great solvent makers. But they will not stabilize or make you strong. 99% is made into solvents. So remember that. If you want to detox all the time, eat those oils often. If you just want to stabilize and get healthy and well, stay away from those oils.

Q: They're more of the animal fats.

A: Correct. Because then you'll do a little of everything.

Q: And everything you just said you could mix with the raw honey, right? The cream, the butter.

A: Unheated honey, not raw honey. Unheated honey.

Q: Unheated.

A: Unheated honey.

Q: I found some honey today at the grower's market that was kept in a hot room from 80 to 90 degrees.

A: That's fine. As long as it doesn't go over 104, 105. 104 really.

Q: You mentioned your liver was 90% destroyed in the early 80s. What's happened with that?

A: It's all well. No pain. Nothing. I digest fine. I'm going through a pound of butter a day. I can go through 16 ounces and more of fat a day. It just handles it like that.

Q: Do you have any perception of a rejuvenation on that?

A: Oh, yeah. It's completely... I can tell it's completely. Completely restored.

Q: The fats don't collect in your arteries? There's no cardiovascular problems?

A: Well, only when you cauterize a cholesterol molecule, it no longer has an exchange of ions. It's like if I take clay. You know how malleable it is? That's the way fat is, raw. Once you heat that clay, it's no longer porous. It no longer exchanges moisture. It no longer can swell, change shapes. It is solidly placed in that shape. And it's a different shape. So the higher temperature you get, you can get it into glass. So when you heat a cholesterol molecule or fat that can be made into a cholesterol, you've got a hardened substance that in 20 to 40 years in the body will be completely solid, because there's no exchange of ions, will completely be solid and it's made up of a lipid that hasn't lubricated any of your veins or arteries. That area is going to harden and crack. When it's raw, it always stays fluid at the human body. If that lipid is utilized for 90 years, it does not change.

Q: Would someone in the tropics eat the same way as someone in this temperature climate?

A: That's an interesting question. In South America, in the area, they eat tremendous amounts of fats to cool themselves. And there are people who say, you know, if you're in a hot, you know, a cold climate, that's where you eat the fats. It's a coolant for a body temperature, you know, heating, you know.

Q: And what you're also saying is basically we're carnivores.

A: Yes, basically.

Q: In the tropics, no matter where we are.

A: Our digestive system shows. When I was in Moorea, which is the island right next to Tahiti, they would take raw meat or raw chicken or raw fish, and they'd dice it. They'd take coconut, and they'd wring out the fat. If it's an old, mature, hard, meaty coconut, they'll shred it and wring out the fat. And they'll take a half of a lime, which is an acid fruit, and they'll mix that with the coconut cream, dice some tomato, which is acid, again, mix it with the fish or the chicken, and dice up some of the head lettuce, regular iceberg lettuce, which has the great opiates in it. And because it is almost a neutral vegetable, it's not highly alkaline. They call it a waste lettuce. I don't know why they call it a waste, because it doesn't have all the chlorophyll of other ones, it doesn't have all the vitamin E. It's got other substances, which are wonderful. They make that into a mix, and it's so delicious. It's all raw. The chicken and the fish are all raw. It's all raw. Phenomenal.

Q: Where?

A: In Malaya.

Q: The lime juice has a tendency to marinate most of the meat.

A: It truly starts pre-breaking down the meat.

Q: That's exactly what you just described at a friend's house. So what does the lime juice do?

A: It kind of marinates the meat. It starts breaking it down a little ahead of time. Exactly as your body would do inside.

Q: That sounds good.

A: It's delicious. It's incredible. I mean, I eat it three times a day. I've never heard of that recipe. So I was eating it three times a day there.

Q: All that good food [unintelligible].

A: Yes.
