A: So rather than starting off with some kind of diatribe, I’m going to go around starting with you.

Q: My brother-in-law worked in a factory all his life. He’s got‥ 

Q: Speak louder.

Q: Wait, let′s get it on. 

Q: So I have a brother-in-law, he′s like in his mid-sixties. He′s got silicosis. He worked in a General Motors factory for thirty-some years. And of course the doctor told him that he can′t get any better, he′s going to keep getting worse. What can he do?

A: His brother-in-law worked in a factory and got glass shavings all in his lungs and throughout the body. Of course it goes into the lungs initially [unintelligible] in the lungs, in the sinuses. It′s called silicosis and it′s a ridiculous name for it. They should just called it glass because it′s not just silicone. And there′s no real way to dissolve them. The body can′t dissolve it. Because when they make glass, they take sand and they heat it at such a high temperature, about 1600 degrees, to get it to turn it into glass. And there′s no way to melt it down. So the only thing he can do is force himself to have flus and colds, have lots of milkshakes, so he′ll bring it up with mucus. And usually the mucus from that kind of detoxification comes out pretty gray. It′s sometimes red there'll be bleeding, stuff like that. But the best thing he can do is cause himself lots of colds and flus and bring it out with mucus. And eating lots of foods in my We Want to Live book that gets rid of scarring. So look under scarring and there′s like the papaya and olive oil and things that break down scar tissue. You should eat those with coconut cream. Coconut cream, anytime you want to have something, fruit, fruit is always a cleanser. Always a cleanser. It doesn′t do anything else but cleanse. It either cleanses by turning acids into alkaline or neutralizing acidic compounds into a neutral substance. Or it causes alcohol to break substances down to remove them from the body. Coconut cream has many properties. It has a lot of water-soluble fats, not just oil-soluble fats. Coconut cream is 80% fat, but only 7-8% is oil, which is oil-soluble fat. The rest of that fat, which is 72%, is water-soluble fats that are rare to get in anything, except for animal fats, especially chicken and fish. So coconut is the only place you can get that in the fruit world. So that is the fruit to eat so it can get into the nerves, it can get into any part of the body and protect it as you're detoxifying with the alcohols. It also makes good solvents along with the alcohol clean out the body. Now I always say, have a little animal fat with it, so you're protecting your nerve cells a little bit better.

Q: How do you cause, you said, cause yourself colds and flus, how do you do that?

A: By eating lots of milkshakes. And smoothies, you know, orange and any kind of fruit, have more smoothies than milkshakes. Once you get into the colder fluid, then you only have one smoothie a day and one or two milkshakes. But to onset a flu or a cold, you can have only smoothies, three smoothies a day if you want a force it. 

Q: You mentioned olive oil, is that better than flax oil?

A: Flax is very acidic, you know, I only recommend flax oil for people with cancer. I'd say people don't eat flax.

Q: Olive oil is better than flax oil?

A: Well, any oil will help break down scar tissue, because it's 90% cleansing. When you have an animal fat, they're anywhere from 40 to 60% nutrifying, cleansing and stabilizing, and only partially detoxifying. Any pressed oil, even if it's coconut oil, not coconut cream, is 90% detoxifying. And you can cause yourself to go into too much detoxification and cause yourself all kinds of symptoms. They won't be controlled. Your body's going to go into fatigue. Your body's going to have to spend its nutrients and energy on remedial effects of the detoxification. So it's always better to no more than a tablespoon of oil a day for detoxification. If you're already heavy into detoxification, don't get near oil. Stay away from oil.

Q: Even olive oil?

A: Pardon?

Q: Olive oil?

A: Olive oil, same. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes. Some years ago, two years, perhaps one year ago, I began having... I am quite a good walker. And then all of a sudden, somebody began telling me that my...

Q: Your ankle?

Q: Yes, my ankle began swelling. And then I had difficulty walking. I was a very good walker. [unintelligible]. But I thought, I don't know what to do.

A: Well, I wouldn't know without looking into your eyes. I couldn't tell what's storing in your legs. Most people will store a lot of lactic acids as they get older. They have less and less ability because they're not eating good food. They don't have much nutrients in them at all. If they're cooked, especially if they're processed. So, as it starts accumulating lactic acids, the by-product metabolism starts accumulating. It causes blockages in circulation, and then the body has to swell to expand. The veins, the arteries, everything will have to swell to expand to accommodate that. And people will have very large swellings because of that. And to relieve it, you have to eat things like coconut cream with pineapple, coconut cream with banana. Those are the best. Or whey with some kind of fat, also coconut cream. Dairy cream isn't very good for that because dairy cream causes a lot of swelling. Not in a bad way, it's good for the nerves, but it can cause too much at one time. So you have a little bit of that, but a lot of butter.

Q: So you're saying that a lot of butter is good for that?

A: A lot of butter is good for that. Cream, small amount. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes, I had asthma as a child, and I...

A: And you didn't like it.

[laughter]

Q: And I smoked for 35 years, then I stopped about 20 years ago, but my lungs have not repair themselves. How do I repair my lungs? I still have trouble sometimes walking across the floor.

A: Okay, now you had asthma either from a vaccine or you were a swimmer.

Q: No, I had polio.

A: Okay, so you had treatment for polio, which caused your asthma.

Q: No, I didn't...

A: No?

Q: I had polio when I was five. I had no symptoms, except...

A: Everybody has polio.

Q: Everybody?

A: Everybody has poliomyelitis in their system.

Q: Why is that?

A: Poliomyelitis is a virus which means you have a way, a chemical way, of detoxifying the nervous system. See, polio became really big in the 50s. Why? Canned food. All of the metals in the food poisoned the nervous system, the spinal cord. So people were getting all kinds, you know, because in 47 is when, 45 is when canned foods really became big as soon as the war ended. And it was my understanding from the elitists who run the world, especially the king and queen of England, who owned 70% of all the food production in the world, they pushed every country into World War II so that they could initiate canned foods. That was the whole purpose of them creating World War II. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Canned foods. Canned foods came out and became a big thing because it was a good thing to eat the same thing that your soldiers were eating. Eat canned foods. That was the whole issue. Stupidity. But people bought it. So everybody was eating canned foods. My mother loved it because all she had to do was open a can and throw it in. She didn't have to cut up the vegetables. She didn't have to do anything. So she loved it. So we lived on that stuff. So that's why polio was really big in the 50s. 

Q: I had it in '49.

A: So it only took you two years to get it. But a lot of people had it with no symptoms. Other people had it with terrible symptoms.

Q: I had symptoms later. I developed arthritis and asthma, headache.

A: But that doesn't come from polio. That's a myth. That's still from extended... When your nervous system has had enough, guess where it goes next? It goes to your lungs and your sinuses. The metal poisoning. That's why they had all of that tonsillitis. What also happened? Polio and tonsillitis. The tonsils protect the brain. They keep chemicals from getting into the brain, including metals from canned food, processed food. So what happened? They were overloaded all of a sudden. Now we have pesticides, inorganic fertilizers, and canned and processed food with lots of preservatives, metallic metals in the preservatives. We were all inundated with it, and still today. People have tonsillitis. Children have tonsillitis all the time because of all of that. And it could have been from vaccines too that was the final onslaught of your emphysema or your asthma. But because of your smoking, it's going to be very difficult to reverse it. Because when you smoke, you're cooking vegetable oil at 700 to 1250 degrees. So it makes them a hard tar, so they crystallize in the body. If you've ever seen an autopsy of a smoker, unless they are an alcoholic along with it, they will have crystals all over. If you're an alcoholic, the alcohol breaks down those fats while they're still, while they first come into the body, and your alcoholics don't have that kind of a problem. That doesn't mean if you're a smoker you become an alcoholic. You actually just don't smoke. They're very hard crystals. Vegetable oil in the human body crystallizes anyway, because an herbivore has a body temperature of 101 to 105 degrees. They keep vegetable oil solvent at that temperature. In the human body, at 98.6, vegetable oils will harden if they've been made part of the body. If you put it in intracellular fat, something like that, it will cause hardening. So to get that to melt down, you have to take hot baths, 102, 105, 110 degrees, every day for a long time to get rid of them. You can sleep with hot water bottles and have two of them under your armpits and tent your chest over with a silk blanket. And it allows for good perspiration exiting. Usually cotton will hold on to it. You'll be really wet. Silk allows it, the perspiration, to breathe and let go. So you'll be heating that up. You need to cook those lungs at only 105 degrees to start melting to get it out of there. And also you can take green tobacco. You have to find a farmer. I've got some Amish farmers who grow tobacco. So my patients who have been smokers will get the green tobacco, juice it, ferment the juice, and then take a drop or two or three a day to help break it down. Because the alcohol from that tar will react on the tar that's already hardened in the [unintelligible].

Q: You can't find that around here, can you?

A: No, I have a source. You just have to get the product list. And in the back, it tells you how to make it on the ninth page of the product list.

Q: I have it.

Q: Thank you.

A: OK, good. Do you have a question?

Q: I have a chemtrail.

A: Oh, wait a minute, no redheads.

[laughter]

Q: Good, Diane, good, Diane.

Q: I have a chemtrail question. Where does that stuff hit the ground when you see... I presume these are real clouds today, the sky's blue, but when you see all those chemtrails, does it come down the same day?

A: It's falling constantly.

Q: Really?

A: If we had more humidity, it would stay suspended longer, but we don't have a lot of humidity here, so it's constantly raining, constantly. And they start spraying it over Oxnard and over me in Malibu, so I can't even go outside because it's right above me.

Q: So it's not like it's okay on a day like today, but when you see them, you go in the house and turn on your HEPA filters?

A: Yep, absolutely.

Q: Yeah.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yeah, I won't answer that question because I go into it in my newsletters.

Q: In what?

A: What to do about the chemtrails, because it's a little involved, so I wrote it in one of the newsletters last year, two years ago. You subscribe online, and it's only like $85 a year, you know, and whoever joins gets all the back editions until 2006.

Q: Isn't that great? Isn't that great?

A: Yeah.

Q: So it's not like one day it would be better to be out than another day? It's just all the time following?

A: All the time following. If you're in, you know, a place where there's high humidity, like in Long Beach right now, or in Santa Monica, in Venice area, you've got the smog, the fog that comes in, it will stay high. As soon as the fog's gone, it starts raining.

Q: Wow.

Q: But what about a day when it's totally clear and there's no chemtrails in the air? You don't see any, is it still falling?

A: There's nothing there.

Q: Huh?

A: There's nothing there. If there's no chemtrails, it's not falling.

Q: Oh, okay, so then it's not falling.

Q: That's what I was saying, yeah. Is there, like, the day that you see the big chemtrails, or the day after?

A: It always falls on that day unless there's heavy rain.

Q: Okay.

A: Before.

Q: Yeah.

A: And there's lots of moisture in the air.

Q: Okay, that was my question. Is it safer some days than others?

A: It won't hang out for more than 24 hours. That's why they spray every day.

Q: Oh, really? They spray every day?

A: Yeah. They spray every day.

Q: Wow.

A: They did. They used to when Bush was in office. Now that Obama's in office, they do about half as much as they used to.

Q: Yeah, it's way less now.

A: But it's not because Obama's in office. It's because a lot of people are starting to complain.

Q: See? They're coming out. They're coming out.

A: Kathy, great help for us.

Q: Thank you. I just say this one guy's going to come. He's going to speak on our Morgellons. It's June 19th on a Saturday at 2 p.m. If any of you want to come and hear his story, how it began, how he's contacted, and what he's doing about it, and how he feels about the whole situation. And what he's doing to combat whatever. Carnicon.com has a good website. What Morgellons looks like. They have these fibers. It just keeps coming out of your skin. It crawls.

A: Well, they put all kinds of stuff in there. I've even analyzed the dropping because I'm so close to the sky. And I put a piece of paper down on a platform on my back porch to see what was falling. And there were fibers. They were the finite... It takes a high electronic microscope. My microscope broke down, so I don't have it. But it's so expensive to fix. It showed eggs, parasite and insect eggs in it. You know, in this material. It's actually wet and put on sticky on this stuff you breathe and inhale. So then they've got insects breeding in your body, in your lungs, in your sinuses. So these people are having insects that are coming through the skin attached to these fibers. And that's what morgellons is. Some people say morgellons, tomato, tomato. I like morgellons for some reason.

Q: Also, we're doing our air testing.

A: They've got barium in it, they've got aluminum, they've got all kinds of things. Fluoride is the latest thing. They pound pretty heavy in it. And you have to look at it. What does aluminum do? Aluminum destroys the zeta potential, which is the ability for nutrients to remain suspended in fluid. So it's like you put liquid aluminum in a fish tank, what happens to the fish? Hit the bottom, they can no longer swim. And that's what happens in the brain and the nervous system. That's why Alzheimer's is elevated highly when there's lots of aluminum in the brain. Then you have fluoride. What does fluoride do? Hitler used fluoride, or Hitler's scientists used fluoride to make animals docile. They could give it to cobras, and they could give it to very aggressive rats that they would corner, and it would turn them into docile little animals. And you could bite them. You have another animal that's ferocious in there, eat them to pieces, and they wouldn't fight back. So that's what they were feeding to all of their prisoners in Auschwitz and everywhere, fluoride. That's why they want it in every household in everybody's water system on the planet. And it's the NSA, the federal government, which is pushing it heavily and forcing these cities, saying, we're not going to give you our federal benefits unless you put the fluoride in the water. And, of course, your politicians want money coming in. So they go, OK, we'll poison everybody, we'll put fluoride in the water so we can have more money. And that's the whole game of politics. So that's what they're bombarding. And in one of my newsletters, I talk about what you eat to help relieve it, to help protect you from the damages of it. As far as the fibers, it's not easy to get rid of.

Q: There's no way to attack those who began that?

A: You've got the military. And the military is the most ferocious, hungry beast in the world. Even Eisenhower, I was only like 10 years old when he said it, when he left office. And he said, in his last, in his departing speech, he said, our greatest enemy is the military-industrial complex, because they don't make money unless there's war. This president, who was a five-star general of the military, became president and said this. Because as he was in president, he couldn't stop. He knew what caused war. He knew that we didn't need it. And he couldn't stop it because of the industrial complex. So, they want the money.

Q: Does your car air conditioner help keep it out of your car when you drive a lot?

A: It does, if you have a HEPA filter inside. Most cars are equipped with a filter, or you can order them with a filter. And you can change over the filter about every six months. My Prius has it. I made sure that it had it when I bought it. It was an option when I bought mine. I don't think it's an option now. I think it's almost in every car, except for the really cheap cars.

Q: Do you have the filter in the air conditioner?

A: No, it's any kind of air circulation system.

Q: What I want to add to this, please, because we're going to be doing our air testing. We're going to be doing four different districts, Montebello, Tujunga. He's in Tujunga. I'm on the west side. And then there's Long Beach, San Pedro, which CJ said she'd be doing, her friend. And then once we get one month of air running that filter outside, then we're going to gather that, the test, and take it to a lab. And then we have to write a 12-page executive summary. We're going to send it down to the LA County Board of Supervisors to be put on their agenda, because we want to be heard down there. And this is what basically we're going to have. If there's a big enough cry, if we've got, let's say, there are 13 million people in Los Angeles County now, if we can get 10% of that, it would be great. Even just 1 million people to protest. And the Board of Supervisors would have no choice but to tell the military you can no longer dump in our region. See, it takes people. People, and you've got to get out there, and that's what we're doing. LosAngelesChemtrailsMeetup.com. We're going to meet on Thursday. Next week our protest, which we're going to hand out tabling on the ground for handing out information. And that's what it's all about, is getting the word out, and let those people get more word out. It's going to have to be a routine, grassroots, they told me.

Q: Kathy's going to lead our revolution.

A: Pardon?

Q: Kathy's going to lead our revolution.

[laughter]

Q: I don't, I don't say that. My life is already, I don't, I don't say that. Yeah, chemtrails.

A: Okay, we need to carry on. Do you have a question?

Q: I just got your book two days ago.

A: Okay.

Q: And the fact that you can have all this butter and coconut cream, which I've been on, and everybody's [unintelligible], you're going to get fat on this coconut cream. I just love it. It's fascinating because two days I started on the fat and I have a familiar trembling. There are 15 children in my family and we all tremble a little bit.

A: Yeah, it stops very quickly usually.

Q: It stopped and I wasn't feeling trembling all over. And the fact that you can eat all this butter because I love it. I love it. But I don't know the proportions yet. I have to get your second book.

A: The second book, yeah. It's on page 41.

Q: [unintelligible] I haven't had meat in over a year. 

A: 40 and 41 in the recipe book.

Q: In this book, the first one.

A: The recipe book.

Q: So that's what I have to balance out. But I love this idea of creams and butter.

A: It's wonderful. Tasty.

Q: Yeah, and it's, you know, I lived in France most of my life so we had steak tartare. Which is raw meat.

A: Good. And raw egg.

Q: Yeah.

A: Good for you. Okay, do you have a question?

Q: I couldn't hear what she said about the trembling. 

A: Oh, she had trembling and she has 15 brothers and sisters and they almost all have trembling. And just two days eating the coconut cream and the butter stopped her trembles.

Q: Is that the essential tremors?

A: It's called familial trembling.

Q: The what?

Q: Familial. Familial trembling.

A: Familial means family-oriented. Genetic. It's not genetic. It's just bad diet.

Q: But, you know, I never had canned food growing up. My parents had [unintelligible]. And we had wonderful food. My father had an acre and he grew his own... And they were maniacs.

A: And he didn't use pesticides?

Q: No.

Q: And where does it come from?

A: It probably was you all had a system that reacted to the vaccine toxicity.

Q: Probably. But he would fight the system. And they thought he was mad. You know, so many times he came to school and said, my children do this and this and this. And he was known to be, you know, against the system.

A: Unusual.

Q: Yes. He ate wonderful food. We had raw honey because he had bees.

Q: And they shouldn't have had something like that.

A: But there had to be a chemical reason. You know, usually mercury causes that kind of damage. Yes, vaccine. Usually when mercury binds with, usually they don't couple together, the formaldehyde and mercury. But in some people it does. And people who cause tremors, people who have, say, vitreous disease, any kind of trembling, tremors, is all usually a combination of some industrial solvent and mercury. It could be fluoride, formaldehyde, even chlorine can do it. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes. I still have two, so I'm going to have to choose one for you. If you have any kind of inflammation in your body, does that mean you can't have any kind of dairy cream?

A: I don't know who told you that.

Q: I thought you said that a little bit earlier.

A: No, I said small amounts of cream.

Q: You can have small amounts of dairy cream.

A: Small amounts of dairy cream. Yeah. Then mostly butter. But if you've got a neurological problem, you have to have more cream. Cream is more important.

Q: Yeah.

A: Only cream will fully nutrify the nervous system, butter will not. Butter will take care of maybe 80% of the fat needed in the brain and nervous system. Only cream will give you 100% of the fats that are necessary in the brain and nervous system. But it only takes a small amount. Two tablespoons other than what you're having in milk a day is all that's necessary, unless you have a neurological disorder. If you have polio, you'll probably need two ounces a day, four tablespoons, plus milk.

Q: So that will also help the tremor thing?

A: Yes. For her, the coconut cream will do it for a while, but then it won't work. Then it will take the raw cream to do it. 

Q: If I could find it in New York.

A: Well, in Bergenfield, there's a co-op there in Bergenfield. It's at the Blue Dragon Martial Arts Center. So you call them, tell them that Aajonus has told you to call, and there's a club there that gets food every two weeks.

Q: And that's in Manhattan?

A: No, right across the George Washington Bridge in Bergenfield. Bergenfield, New Jersey. There are some other clubs in New York City, but I'm not familiar with them.

Q: Blue Dragon what?

A: Blue Dragon Martial Arts Academy.

Q: Why do you think there's a thyroid epidemic in this country?

A: There's no such thing as a thyroid epidemic.

Q: Everybody has a thyroid problem.

A: That's what the pharmaceutical industry wants you to believe. Also, like they tell you that thyroid has to do with you losing hair. Do you know how many people lose hair because they don't have the active thyroid? Very few. But they knew that men and women are so vain that all you have to do is tell them the thyroid problem will cause them to lose hair. And who's going to take thyroxine?

Q: Everybody.

A: Everybody is going to take it because they don't want to lose hair. It's got nothing to do with hair loss. Endocrine gland system is an emergency only system. It's for emergency purposes. If you're attacked, adrenaline runs and you can run or you can fight. Fight or flight. Only time adrenaline should be used. If you fall out of a tree when you're swinging around like a monkey in a tree and hit the ground and lost your wind and you stop breathing and your heart stops, what kicks in? What gland do we have that's multiplied by six? The thyroid. You've got two thyroid glands and four parathyroid glands. What is so important in the body that you have to have a backup for the backup for the backup for the backup for the backup? The lungs and the heart. That's what controls it. The thyroid. There's nothing to do with hair. It doesn't have to do with acne. It doesn't have to do with adrenaline flow. This is what the pharmaceuticals, they put all this nonsense in your head so that you'll be taking all these chemicals. And people do. They'll go to a doctor. They'll go to a pharmacy. They'll get all these things because they're advertised like that. And people aren't educated to understand. The thymus right here is for protecting your digestive tract. So you have all of these glands which are for emergency purposes only. Now everybody who's eating cooked foods in this polluted environment is in an emergency circumstance. They need tons of fat to deal with the poison. So what is it mainly hormones made of? 60% to 70% fat, sometimes 80% fat. So you've created all these hormones to deal with the toxicity because you're in an emergency circumstance. But that's not what it was intended for. If you're on a good diet like me, you should have no thyroxine. You should have no adrenaline in your body. You shouldn't have anything unless it's necessary. The fats that you eat should make the proper energy. 100 years ago, 200, 500 years ago, you had people doing heavy farm work without good equipment. That's all the fancy equipment we have now. And they worked hard in the fields. You can't get anybody to mow their lawn with a push mower anymore. They'll die from just pushing a push mower over grass. And I remember when I was a kid, the grass would be this high on the farm, and we'd have to be out there pushing it over this. And that was a lot of effort. People would have heart attacks now. So you have to take a look at the bullshit that we're all fed. You eat the proper nutrients. Your body will make the fats to give you lots of energy. Now, John over there, you know, he's doing push-ups and getting into security and stuff like that. So I thought, well, I'm going to start doing push-ups too. So I started doing rapidly, and he says, you've got no muscle. But I've got fat in my tissues. I don't look like it, but I'm 18% body fat. That's seven times more than most athletes. I mean, 7% more than most athletes. So think about that. The raw fats, if you're filled with raw fats for so many years, it takes 40 years to get rid of all the old fats.

Q: How many years?

A: 40 years.

Q: Oh, wow.

A: So I've been eating raw foods since 1972. I've had no cooked fats. Okay, so in two more years, I will be completely free of large fat molecules. When you cook a fat, it swells. The molecule swells anywhere from 1 to 50 times its normal size, depending upon the fat. Now, your coconut oil, your olive oil, those swell the least. That's why they say they're good for cooking. You take pig fat, what happens? Take the rind of a pig fat, that thing will be this thin and all of a sudden it's swelled this big. So you see these pork rinds in these packages? That was little bitty thin fat, now it's huge fat, large fat, immense fat. So that happens when you cook fat. So I'm concentrated with all this microscopic fat in my body that utilizes and creates energy very little, very easily. So I can do massive amounts of exercise and I don't exercise. I sit on my computer. I'm not a person who has activity rings in my body, so I wasn't meant to be an active person. A lot of people have a lot of activity rings in their bodies which tells them that they have to be high energy, high activity people. I'm not one of those, yet I can do immense amount of exercise. When I go to Philippines and I climb the mountains, I'm winded for one day. The next day I'm up there with the 20 year olds. And all the 30's and 40's and 50's are way down the hill. And it takes me, I can get used to exercise very rapidly because I've been on the raw diet so long, eating raw fat. I imagine if I had been on, I didn't start eating raw meat on a daily basis until 82. So you can imagine what it's going to be like when I reach that 40 year period for having been on the diet, eating raw meat on a daily basis for 40 years. I'll be, who knows what I'll be able to do at that point.

Q: What did you originally say about the hair loss?

A: I didn't say anything about the hair loss, I just said that the thyroid had nothing to do with hair or hair growing or hair loss.

Q: Is the person's question about hair loss?

A: No.

Q: [unintelligible] was hypothyroid since I was 15. And it got bald somehow when I was 30 something. But I lost half of my hair.

A: Well, they said that low thyroid causes hair loss. Now they're saying that any kind of anything will cause hair loss. But if you had a hyperthyroid, you had too much hormones in your body. So it probably made you very active. You weren't getting the proper fats in your body. Hyper is high thyroid. You had hypo? That's just loss of fat. Not enough fat. Now you don't have a problem with that. You have enough fat on you.

Q: I don't know. I guess.

A: Yeah, it's good. Even if it's bad fat, it's protecting.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it wasn't good fat. You weren't metabolizing your fats properly. Well, some people can digest cooked fats to a great extent. If you lost hair, you weren't assimilating some very important fats to get to the skin.

Q: You know, Aajonus, if they also say that, like, if you have hypothyroid, that it can be a weakness in the thyroid, or they also say that it's the Hashimoto's thyroiditis, which is where your own immune system becomes autoimmune and it attacks your thyroid.

A: Do you know how much bullshit all that is?

Q: Oh, my God, there's so much literature.

A: They leave up all these intricate little scenarios and get you to believe them. And they sound so intelligent, but they have nothing to do with reality. You have to understand, these scientists get paid a lot of money to come up with bullshit for the pharmaceutical industry to make money.

Q: On the 40-year cycle of detoxifying the cooked fats in the body, is there a way to speed that up, like the hot tubbing or something like that?

A: Yeah, hot tubbing is the only way you can do it, speed it up. However, you can get it to come out too fast, and your lymph system won't be able to handle some very toxic stuff. So you have to control it. You've got a lot of fat on you, so no problem. If somebody is slender, too slender, even you're a little bit too slender, you start having it, and you're way too slender. I know you're much heavier than you've ever been. If you had seen her when I saw her 15 years ago, you know, it was like a...

Q: Twiggy.

A: Twiggy, yeah. So you can't do intense baths like... I have people doing intense baths, you know, hour and a half a day, 110 degrees, for three months. But these people have enough fat on them to handle it. And it works.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: If you think you're going to have poisons come out of your body that don't have the fat to stop them from damaging your cells...

Q: Do you recommend going up to 110 times?

A: Yeah, only because I've had a few people experiment going that high. Even somebody... well, the first one that did it was a mistake.

Q: You?

A: No, he was 67 years old when I asked him to start doing it. And I said, you know, go by the book for the temperature and have that pineapple mixture that I said. Get in the book for lymphatic baths. But have an hour and a half, you know, two days a week. And he didn't hear the two.

Q: Is it okay? Is it every day?

A: Two days a week. So he called me three months after that. He lives in Bangkok. And he said, you know, I still have no energy on the couch... He's retired. A couch potato. All I do is watch TV, eat, take the hot baths, and sleep. And he said, it's been three months I've been doing these hot baths. I said, well, maybe you need to increase the number, you know, from two to three. He said, wait a minute, I do them every day. So he was doing 90-minute baths every day. He was doing 90-minute baths every day at 110 degrees. And I said, oh, my God. I said, it says in the book 101. He said, no, it doesn't. So I looked in the book. There was a typo. The 101 came out to 110. But I said, OK, stop doing it. I was afraid that he had lots of damage done and everything. And guess what? Three weeks later, he had so much energy, he started an international stem cell company. And he's running three of them now, and he's 74 years old. I was with him three months ago in Bangkok. I stay at his condo when I'm there with him and his wife. And he works side-by-side with me 14, 16 hours a day.

Q: Is that the divergence of going from 105 to 110?

A: Oh, it is. It can make a big difference, and it did for him. I mean, it's phenomenal.

Q: So what was the prep before the bath?

A: It's in the book, under lymphatic baths.

Q: Can a regular bath do the same thing?

A: No. A regular bath isn't hot enough.

Q: There's a length factor, though, right?

A: Pardon?

Q: There's a length factor on the bath. After like an hour and a half is the max you can deal with, other than some kind of other damage to the red blood cells or something?

A: No, you just won't move for the rest of the day.

Q: Does the body have to be completely submerged the whole time?

A: No, you're not going to be able to get it completely submerged. But, you know, if you...

Q: I mean, I can be as hot as I can in my regular bathtub, but it's not 110 degrees, right?

A: Well, you can certainly get it to 110 degrees. You just take a thermometer and you put it in and find out...

Q: I guess you set the hot water heater on really high, is that it?

A: Yeah, and what I used to do when I didn't have a hot tub, I'd fill scalding hot water about probably 150 degrees to the... not scalding hot, but hot enough to burn the tissue. To halfway in the tub, I'd let it sit for 10 minutes to heat up the entire tub. Then I would put lukewarm water in it and then fill it up. Because if you heat the tub first, it's going to take longer to cool the water. It'll take 20 minutes to cool the water.

Q: Where do you get that scalding hot water heater?

A: Yeah, you just turn up the hot water heater, and you only turn on the hot water.

Q: But you live in an apartment building, you can't do it. It's going to connect the other person up above you. They're connected, but...

A: Not usually. Your apartment building is the old type apartment building. You've got a hot water heater for each one, unless...

Q: No, we don't have an each one. Everyone is on one heater.

A: Oh, they changed it over?

Q: Yes.

A: Okay. Well, then go there and turn it on hotter. And just leave a message at everybody's door, the hot water is hotter.

Q: Okay.

A: And, you know, then what I do is after 20 minutes, when we get down to about 103, 102, then I would let two inches of the water out. And when I got down to the last half inch, I would turn on only the hot water. I'd tunnel the cold water to go right down the spout with my hands. As soon as it got hot, I'd release it and then put the plug in and then move the water around. Then you've got to let it get real hot. Put the two inches back in, scalding hot water again. And then I would stay in there another 20 minutes before I had to do it again. Now that I have a hot tub, it's the same temperature all the time. It's easy that way. Okay, we've got to move on because we're going to get very late here.

Q: Ebrahim, do you have a question?

A: After 10 and a half years, I was able to master my diet. And I've been 100% or 99% the way you asked me to do it. I do about 3 pounds of butter a week, 1 pound of sour cream, 10 eggs a day. And how long will it take for my stomach to become flat?

Q: Well, after 40 years.

A: [unintelligible] probably 30 years.

Q: Oh, I have this one.

A: Yeah, I was that size for, you know, 30 years. You know, now I'm trim. I just can't get much bigger. I can still get up to a 27-inch waist. I can't get up to the 36-inch waist. I can't get up to 38 like I used to. But I have to really work hard at it now. I have to sit down and eat cheese and honey and butter until it's coming out of my ears to gain enough weight now. But I don't need it like I used to. You know, all the fat in my body is pretty clean fat. So it takes a while. Most women, if they're relatively clean and they haven't had cesarean, take 12 to 15 years. If they're under 40 years old. If they're over 40, it can take 20, 22, 23 years. Men, for some reason, take longer. And my theory is women have more fat in the first place. They've got 25 to 30% fat. They have anywhere from 7 to 18% fat. It's not enough fat to protect them. So they need more fat longer than most women do.

Q: So we're not going to see any difference as we go along? Do we have to wait 20 years to see a difference?

Q: A lot of years.

A: You're going to go in and out of detoxification. You're going to feel different. You're going to look better. Your skin's going to look better. Everything. It's just a gradual thing. It's like, if you take a bottle of, let's say, something very toxic, antifreeze, a glass bottle, and you break it in your house, and it eats into your linoleum floor, and it eats into your lower part of the cabinet, and it eats into the wood in your dining table and your chairs, how long is it going to take you to clean that up? You're eventually going to have to tear up the linoleum. That's another job you're going to have to either remake or sand down the legs of the wooden table. It takes time. Your body is made of live cells. It's not mechanical like a floor and furniture. So it's got to relive itself. And each offspring gives some of that toxicity to their offspring for five generations on an optimal diet, according to Howell and Pottengers work with animals. It takes five generations to become optimal from being sick. And for us, five generations of cells, seven, seven and a half a year, seven to seven and a half years for each cycle, each generation to replace every cell and the bones, forty years. Forty years. So think about that. You have to be patient. I still have twelve years to go. And I'm very happy. I'm sixty-three years old, you know. And I can do just about anything. I got poisoned terribly a year ago in April. And I recovered from it almost completely. 

Q: What was the poison?

A: I was abducted in the Philippines and given three injections of some kind of poison. It was right after I was the first one to go on the international airwaves and talk about the swine flu and how it was a hoax in 76 because I was involved in it then. And I told them where to go to get the research. There was a rap group in England that picked up on that. They made a video called Just Say No to the Vaccine. And they got my voice in there several times saying the only way you can get swine flu is if it's injected. So I screwed up their $8 trillion business because everybody in the world picked up on that. So they came after me to teach me a lesson. They were going to try to do it subdued so I would know about it. And they came in my hotel room when I was asleep. They intoxicated me and injected me. I just happened to wake up. My body was strong enough. I woke up. Here's these two American-looking or Caucasian men above me and very stout-looking, like CIA guys. They were a little bit buffier than most, not like James Bond, but buffier guys, like Dolph Lundgren, somebody like that. And when I woke, I had a hypodermic hanging from this arm and two on the bed right next to me. And I had this cloth that was down on my chin. Obviously, it had come off. And they pulled it right back over my face. And I was out in a moment. It was odorless. They have an anesthetic that's odorless. So it put me out. When I woke in the morning, I just thought it was a bad dream until I started to move. And I was sore and achy in every joint and muscle. I was nauseous. I started vomiting. And there were three holes in my arms, swellings just like vaccines. So I think that they gave me the swine flu vaccine. And were going to say, they're going to catch me at one airport because I'm always flying. Well, I get in an airport two days a week. So they can keep track of where I go, you know, if I use credit cards or anything like that. They're going to stop me at an airport and say, see, this guy is sick. We're going to pull him aside. He's got swine flu. But I caught them, and I knew what to do about it. So I couldn't find shark, but I found the stingray. The stingray is very high in ammonia. Shark and stingray will elevate two times every 24 hours in ammonia. And ammonia can arrest and detoxify those kind of chemicals. So I was vomiting and having headaches and dizzy spells passing out for about a week. And then it started coming out. Within 24 hours it started. I had scars all over. I got bullet hole scars. It was coming out like this all over. All from that. All over. So I've got these, mostly on this leg, but I've got them on this leg. I've got them on my back and shoulders. And you can still see the gray, the aluminum and the mercury. I had shavings taken, aluminum and mercury. And I had my hair analyzed about, I had it analyzed, luckily, a month and a half before that happened. And about, I guess it was six months after. And the elevation of everything that's in vaccine was high in that analysis. But I pulled through. I didn't know I was going to pull through. I didn't tell anybody about it until I knew I was pretty much through.

Q: What [unintelligible] did you eat from the stingray?

A: I ate the meat.

Q: Oh, OK. 

A: Yeah, the meat of it.

Q: Raw?

A: Yeah, of course.

[laughter]

Q: Is that part of like a jellyfish?

A: Pardon?

Q: Stingrays are like jellyfish?

A: No, they're flat animals. You can look it up. OK, yes, question. 

Q: By drinking raw dairy and cheeses and so on, I recovered from a click that I had.

A: In your hip?

Q: In my hip, and it took me about seven years. A lot of milk. And recently I've been recovering from deteriorating discs in my spine. I had to get traction, a lot of traction, and now I'm starting to recover. And I'm wondering what nutrition might help the recovery.

A: Speed it up. Cheese, honey, and butter 30 minutes, 35 minutes after a meat meal. And you have to eat a lot of it.

Q: Cheese, honey, and butter after a meat meal?

A: If you wanna speed it up. Anybody who's got osteoporosis, you have at least, you know, about two ounces of cheese. That's a lot of cheese at one time. And you have half that amount of butter with it and a sixth that amount of honey. You have like one tablespoon of honey for one ounce of butter, two ounces of cheese.

Q: One sixth.

A: Pardon?

Q: One sixth.

Q: One sixth.

A: One sixth. So it's one tablespoon of honey. 

Q: So that would be twice a day if you had two meat meals a day.

A: Pardon?

Q: That would be twice a day if you had two meat meals a day.

A: Well, for his condition, I would say yes. If you just have osteoporosis overall, you could do that concentration. But with your weight, it will cause massive amount of weight quickly. So... It will cause massive amount. So I would say do it once a day if you're going to do that. But he could do it twice daily if he wants to speed up the healing in his back. And after about 30 days, cut it down to once a day. After 30 days, cut it down to once a day only. Proportion, two ounces of cheese, one ounce of butter, one tablespoon of honey. You can make it into a cheesecake. That's the way a cheesecake, well, usually a cheesecake is equal amount of cheese to butter. But you just make it a little different. And it's like cheesecake.

Q: Can you overdo [unintelligible]?

A: You can overdo anything. The body can't assimilate. Your liver can only make so much bile a day to handle so much fat. You have a gallbladder that allows you to do massive amounts, but it's not going to hold up if you're eating too much.

Q: What would be the ideal?

A: I've given the ideals in my books. It says three ounces of honey a day, if you're eating honey alone, is about the good amount that you should have. And butter, it depends upon the individual, and I tell you how much for the size of person. So it's all in there. Okay, you didn't get your question, did you? 

Q: Me?

A: Yeah, do you want a question?

Q: I already had one. Do you want another one?

A: You're okay. Do you have a question?

Q: I was just at your place, and one of the things you said was to eat the raw butter with part of the... I can't even look at raw butter unless it's mixed with something else. It makes me nauseous.

A: Mix butter with butter. I mean honey. Mix butter with butter.

Q: Okay, so the formula you gave me and everything, if I just add butter to the other piece of it...

A: Right. Mix a little honey in it.

Q: But the thing I find out about the honey is that it really does make me gain weight.

A: Well, you can only just put enough to taste.

Q: The texture? I mean, I really can't... All your mixes, your drinks, you know, the lubrication and all that, that's fine. It has enough other stuff in it that I can handle the texture. But the texture of butter, I don't know what it is. I can't say, okay, I'm going to do it, I'm going to do it. It's like, no, you're not going to do it. 

A: Well, then just reduce the ingredients in the lubrication, the moisturizing formula.

Q: You cut down the butter in that, if you recall.

A: No, you don't cut, well, if you're not going to have the butter, you know, by itself then you're going to have to boost the butter and the moisturizing formula back up.

Q: So just put it back basically the way it was because I can't do that.

A: Yep, but you'll have to do. Just be slower.

Q: What about the goat butter? Would that be possible?

A: Goat, sheep butter would be the best if you can get sheep butter. But goat butter is fine.

Q: But I mean in terms of...

A: I don't know. You say it's texture. Goat butter is going to have the same texture. I can always eat butter on something.

Q: Like in the old days when I ate bread, I would put butter on bread and that was fine. But the butter, I don't know what it does. I don't know. And I tried to change my psyche in meditation.

A: I'd say that you probably have a low bile production. So put a hot water bottle down near your gallbladder. It's probably not working very well. Remember, the gallbladder does not make bile. The liver makes the bile and stores it. The gallbladder, all it does is deliver the bile to the intestines and stomach.

Q: So the weight gain that I have, that I can't seem to get that 10 pounds down, you know, I changed some of the things you said to change, but the butter, I mean, I still feel like I'm... I don't know what it is. I still feel like I'm putting it on or not taking it off, and I don't know... 

A: Well, just keep an eye on your weight and see.

Q: Okay. And the other thing was the milk. I tried that 4 ounces, and I can't handle that much. My body doesn't digest so I switched to 2 ounces and 2 ounces.

A: Okay, that's fine.

Q: Okay, I mean, I guess it would be smaller.

A: Yeah.

Q: It's enough protein to get me through the night. The 2 ounces and 2 ounces, because it just...

A: Well, like I say, if you can't do that, then make a milkshake, and then have 2 ounces or 3 ounces of the milkshake and 3 ounces of milkshake. Because 2 ounces of milk isn't going to give you enough protein to go 5 hours.

Q: Okay. Right.

A: Okay?

Q: Thank you.

A: Do you have a question? 

Q: I've tried your diet 2 times, a couple of months at a time. And I have a lot of food allergies, which prevents me from both dairy products and eggs.

A: Well, a lot of people say they do my diet. Are you doing it the way it says in the recipe book on page 40, 41?

Q: Yeah.

A: Uh-huh.

Q: I get so much mucus from all the dairy that it's good.

A: Yeah, but the mucus, if you're forming mucus...

Q: It's good.

A: See, that doesn't cause mucus. Dairy does not cause mucus. Your body makes mucus. If you have toxicity in your lung, throat, sinuses, and in your eyes, you're going to have to have a lot of mucus to cleanse it.

Q: Yeah, but all my life, certain foods I eat, I produce mucus. Even vegetables, like tomatoes.

A: Well, the body will use that as a detox center for some people.

Q: Yeah, but what can I do about it?

A: Well, like I say, it's a good thing. Just go through it and let the body clean that first. It won't last forever.

Q: I had it for 45 years.

A: Yeah, but you weren't on a raw diet for 45 years. Most people who have that reaction, most I've seen it last is 18 months.

Q: And then the mucus goes away.

A: All of a sudden it goes down because you've cleaned out these tissues enough. So then you'll only produce that kind of mucus when you go into a major detox or a dumping of a cold or a flu.

Q: I'm still going through a lot of it.

A: You go through your cold and flu. I pray for them. I had my first three-and-a-half-week one probably in ten years, probably because of the injections that I was given. And I filled a bath towel, not a beach towel, but a regular bath towel of mucus every day. For three weeks. It was wonderful.

Q: Because it carries out the toxins.

A: It carries out the toxins. So here, all that shit that was injected into me that went into my brain, because it's mainly metals in a vaccine, so all that stuff that went into my brain and my lungs were coming out. I was coughing up and spitting out and blowing out gray mucus. We're not talking about light gray. We're talking about major gray matter, which is metal in the mucus. If I didn't have that mucus ability to dump, I wouldn't be clean. That mucus is a good thing.

Q: Another thing that happened when I tried to die was that my heart rate, my heart started beating after a couple of days very, very hard, which [unintellgible] to sleep.

A: That's usually because you have very loose, heavy metals, especially mercury.

Q: And I've noticed that if I eat a high-fat diet in general...

A: Yeah, you start cleaning out, so the heart has to pump fast so those don't settle in the heart. And if it moves the blood faster by pumping hot faster, the blood will move faster. And when it moves that fast, the only place it can store is in the intestines. And it dumps into the intestines. If you're eating cheese, it'll take it out. So you can lower that heart rate by just eating the cheese and helping pull it out of your intestine. 

Q: I ate a lot of cheese. That's why I had to stop the diet.

A: But you don't stop. Just don't be afraid of it. It's not going to hurt you.

Q: [unintelligible] awake all night.

A: The nerves detoxify at night. You won't be able to sleep at night. I say it in my book, too. You're not going to sleep between midnight and 5.30 in the morning. Because you're detoxing your nerves. You have to sleep... 5.30 you go to sleep. You get up at 7.00. You get home from work. You go to sleep at 8.00 and get up at midnight, 1.00. That's your schedule. And you have that kind of a detox. 

Q: If he's having a hard time [unintelligible].

A: It depends on the individual. If he's going through a nerve detox, that isn't going to help. It may soothe his body, make him feel better, but that doesn't mean he can sleep. If the body sleeps during the...

Q: How long should something like this go on for?

A: The worst I've seen it go on is for... Where is she? There you are. How long has your been going on?

Q: I mean I have both. I mean, I have the irregular heart rate.

A: Right.

Q: So...

A: We call hers a dancing heart. So, it goes off and on.

Q: I've been on the diet for seven and a half years. So, it's like I've had a lot of detox. And I bend, I mean, I lean naturally, so I feel everything that happens in my body. So, I mean, I definitely can identify with the... I've had the pounding heart, I've had the irregular heart rate. I was having it every week. Like, I would go through... I mean, it was just like there was a martial arts, you know, expert in my heart. Just boom, boom, boom, boom. I mean, it was awful. It was so, so scary. And, um, it would be boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.

Q: How long was it going on for?

Q: And it would not let up for, like, 15 to 24 hours. And then it would just drop. It was just like, I mean, it would just be steady beat, but it was beating really fast. And I'd have it every seven to eight days, it was so predictable. And it would happen just like that. I'd be calm, I'd be eating something, I'd be feeling happy. Boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop boop. And all of a sudden it would start doing that. And I'm like, I have a history of athleticism, so I've always like, prided myself on cardiovascular endurance. So anyway, it was very, very scary. And so Aajonus helped me a lot. He said, trust your body, trust your body. You know, your body's trying to keep the toxins away from your heart. And so then I actually started increasing my meat, and I started doing the bath, and I started doing the clay. And I went through a period of 34 days, and I had nothing. And then I started getting constipated, so I went off of all that, and the heart thing came right back. So, for now, I bet you're [unintelligible]. But I can definitely tell you, I feel very happy, and I feel I have a lot of energy. I'm a very loving person. I just love the diet. It has helped me in so many ways, and it has not been easy. And I've really had to go through a lot.

A: Any skinny person will always have a lot of trouble.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: The heart gets to clean. The whole body gets to clean. And the heart pumps fast, so the toxins don't store in the heart muscles. Because, remember, the heart is 80% fat, like the liver. It's the most concentrated protein of any part of the body. The heart and the liver are always working. So, with that high rate, with the low fat level, the heart can't afford to have anything store in it, because it can cause a cramp, a Charley Horse and that's a heart attack. So, when your heart's beating fast, it's beating hard for a purpose. It's not an allergy to the food that you're eating, unless it's a toxic thing that you're eating.

Q: [unintelligible] heart beats hard because of the high fat.

A: No, that's a lie.

Q: No, I agree [unintelligible].

A: Yeah, because the fat causes detoxification. It's not the fat directly that's doing it. The body isn't saying, you can take, in a person who's clean, they can eat fats until the cows come home. I can eat them until the cows come home. My heart doesn't beat like that anymore. But I had heart attacks from the age of 15 and a half to the age of 22 from my last polio vaccine. As soon as I started eating all that fat, within probably a month, two months, I had no more heart attacks. But I had to deal with that increased heart rate on a daily, hourly basis. When I used to just get the cramps and the heartbeat hard, you know, once a day, once every other day. But when I started eating all that fat, it happened every day for almost two and a half months. You need to go through it. You've got to trust your body. If you're eating the right food, there's nothing on this diet that can cause an allergy that's poisonous to the body, even if you have the worst body in the world. It has all the vitamins, all the nutrients, everything's in it. It's proper for the body. Nothing can cause it. What is damaging is what's already in the body. And when it moves, it becomes toxic again. It becomes dangerous unless there's enough fats to arrest it. People who are too thin, that's why I keep saying in my book, you've got to get fat if you don't want symptoms. If you want to reduce your symptoms to 20%, get fat. If you want to look good and you want to suffer, stay skinny. It's your choice.

Q: It's not easy to get fat. It is extremely difficult to get fat.

A: No, I know how to get you fat fast.

Q: I was really skinny. Do you remember when you first saw me? In three months, I gained the 40. You said you need to gain 40 pounds. In three months on your diet, I gained 40 pounds.

A: That's because I told you exactly what to eat.

Q: Right, and that's my puzzle. How come they're not getting weight and I did?

A: Because they haven't come to me and they haven't been doing the diet that I gave them. 

Q: You don't try until you know. You don't know until you try.

Q: I eat like a horse. I mean, my friends are like, you're not going to eat anything...

A: Well, you won't eat the butter and cheese and honey because you get constipated.

Q: I wish I got constipated.

[laughter]

A: See, you're more fortunate.

Q: But I still have the weight.

A: Yeah, but you don't have her kind of symptoms either. This poor girl's on the phone with me several times thinking she's going to have a heart attack.

Q: Well, I do get the heart palpitations.

A: Yeah, but they're not like... See, when you're skinny, every little bitty movement's, like, you know, intense. Because when you have fat, you can buffer the amount of information that goes to the brain. If you don't have it... If you don't have it, you're going to have more symptoms.

Q: Are you saying that she should live through the constipation?

A: [unintelligible] way to handle it. What you do is you take three tablespoons each of coconut cream, dairy cream, and butter. A quarter teaspoon to a half a teaspoon of honey. You mix it together in a four-ounce jelly jar. You put it in a bowl of hot water. Get it melted. You do this all right before you go to sleep. Take a bulb syringe. You get on all fours. You bark like a dog. Put it back there. And you insert it and give it in. You're going to feed the E. coli through the back end. You see, your body, when it's so toxic, will use up all the good fat before it gets to the bowel. Every time it gets to the bowel, the poor E. coli are getting bad, toxic fat that are being cleaned out of the body and very little good nutrients. And people who have constipation are very slow. The E. coli is starving. So you feed it from the back end, directly, and those E. coli will be happy. You'll feel happier. E. coli is the main bacteria that breaks the fats down and the protein molecules into the finite form to feed the brain and the nervous system.

Q: Is that in the book?

A: No, that's on the newsletters. In the newsletters, yeah. Because the book was rewritten in 2005. I'm learning stuff all the time, so I don't stop experimenting.

Q: What was the recipe again, please? Coconut cream, butter, and cream.

A: Coconut cream, butter, dairy cream. Three tablespoons of each. One quarter to one half teaspoon, that's a teaspoon of honey, or a small amount, yes.

Q: I brought [unintelligible].

A: Okay, he's got some dairy here if somebody wants some. Okay, Steve.

Q: I just recently had a flu about three weeks ago, and it lasted about a week.

A: I'm sorry, it only lasted a week.

Q: But ever since then, I've had this really dry cough that seems to come from really deep within, and I don't know how to get rid of that. I eat a lot of raw eggs, I have a couple smoothies.

A: Are you having the lubrication formula every day?

Q: Yeah, every day.

A: Then I would boost it to two. What happened was, you probably stopped a little too quick, or you weren't eating enough milkshakes during the flu.

Q: I always had two a day.

A: You had two milkshakes a day?

Q: Yeah.

A: And one smoothie?

Q: Yeah, pardon me, one, but it was two. Two smoothies, one milkshake.

A: Okay. Like I say in my recipe book for the cold and flu, two milkshakes a day, one smoothie.

Q: Okay.

Q: What kind of a smoothie is that?

A: That is the proper amount. So you didn't get everything cleaned out yet.

Q: What kind of a smoothie?

A: And it stopped. Just remember that when you have a cold or a flu, it is the end of a long detoxification. All the stuff that's collected in your tissues is now going to dump. You're going to dump mucus. You're going to dump all kinds of things. You may vomit, diarrhea. That is the end of getting rid of a lot of stuff. You could have been detoxing for a year and a half before it dumps. If you're lucky, you'll have several a year. 

Q: What kind of a smoothie are you talking about?

A: It's in the book. The fellow way back there, I forgot your name. I'm sorry. No question? Okay. Yes.

Q: I live in a condo on the third floor. Two of our bedrooms overlook the alley in the back of the building. Right in front of one of the bedrooms is a large wooden pole with transformers in there. [unintelligible]

A: Well, what they do is they'll throw off electromagnetic fields for up to 20 feet.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It shouldn't get over... It shouldn't get over... It cannot sleep at one over one, one milligauss. They say it takes three milligauss to alter, to negatively alter the molecular structure of an animal cell. It depends upon the wiring, the equipment, how old it is, how new it is, and whether it's wired properly and if it's grounded properly and if it sets a good ground. So you have to get a meter. And I talk about it in one of my newsletters last year. So you buy that meter and you just – well, you can get a cheaper meter. The meter that I suggest there is a tri-field meter that registers radiation, two levels of radiation, several levels of electromagnetic fields, of pure electrical and electromagnetic field. So there's a lot of things you can measure with it. You'll get a cheap one for $35, at radio shack, to register electromagnetic field. And you put it there. And I tell you, if it's high, I would change your bedroom to somewhere else. Well, yeah, just put it in the bedroom where it isn't high.

Q: About that, I heard this necklace that you have, and it doesn't protect you.

A: Half a gauss, that's all it reduces. Those things that go on a telephone, it reduces it by half a milligauss. Half a milligauss. If you're looking at, let's say, 12 milligauss, or 7 to 12 milligauss are coming into a bed, and you reduce it by half a milligauss, that's not much.

Q: So do those things work on the phones and computers and all that?

A: Well, you have to know. You take your meter and see how far away you have to be from your computer. If you've got a desktop, you put it like three feet away from you.

Q: I have a guy that knows how to go around the house and check for EMFs if anybody wants to. He can stop by and ask me.

A: But by the time you pay him, you know, that's what I did.

Q: No, he goes on a sliding scale... Oh.

A: I hired a guy to come in and do mine. So I wouldn't have to hire him again, I made him sell me his equipment before he left my house. So I've been using it all these years. If I had to use it, it would have cost me thousands of dollars. Instead, it cost me $160. 

Q: I'm going to put it back on the We Want to Live site. When this newsletter first came out, I had them available at a little bit of a discount. I'll put them back on the site. Give me a few days.

A: So...

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, there's nothing to reduce it. They say that aluminum will reduce it. You'd have to have an aluminum sheet, I think, about a half inch thick over that entire wall.

Q: Lead?

Q: What do you get back? 

A: I don't think lead does. It's supposed to do for radiation. Radiation of a radiation beam, like for an X-ray, but electromagnetic field radiation, they say it's aluminum. Now, I've seen in a radiation laboratory that does X-rays, a woman accidentally left the lead plate over the place it was to be X-rayed, and it took an almost identical X-ray, even with the lead over it. So, it's rather bullshit, too. So, they lie out their teeth to get you to do anything they want you to do. Medical profession is the most corrupt industry in the world, besides politics.

Q: [unintelligible] aluminum to handle the EMF?

A: That's what they say. That's what people who work in the electrical field tell me. I haven't experimented with it, so no. I don't have time. I'm dealing on a biological level most of the time. Okay, do you have a question?

Q: Yes. Peeing slowly. Remedy?

A: It depends. You could have stones.

Q: What did he say?

A: He has trouble urinating. Slow urination. It could be that your urethra wasn't like that as a child, or is it just developed?

Q: No, it's just been in the last few years.

A: Okay.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Well, it could be that you have a kidney stone, I mean, a bladder stone. And a bladder stone can get huge. Like, I started developing a bladder stone when I was about probably three to six years old, the urologist said, because I had the biggest one in history. Literally. It was this big. My stone was this big.

Q: From what? I mean, at three years old, it's [unintelligible]?

A: No, no. Kidney stones, bladder stones, come from collections of minerals, cauterized minerals, that are highly magnetic. And they usually become highly magnetic from vaccines. So I got a lot of vaccines at a very young age, especially tetanus. And a lot of electromagnetic mercury in tetanus shots. So I started developing that stone. And usually it takes them just a few minutes to break up a stone with a laser electrical current. It took him two hours to break mine down. He said the entire center was mercury, a ball of mercury. And it was so hardened from being in there for 53 years. 53 years. 

Q: Tetanus shots. What do they have tetanus shots for? 

A: Tetanus shots. 

Q: I know, but what do they give tetanus for?

Q: If you step on a rusty nail.

Q: I'm just saying, yeah.

A: Getting lockjaw from rust is the most absurd factor in the world. Rust is a fungus, yes. But you would have to have a phenomenal amount in your body, and your lymph system would not be working at all. You wouldn't have any white blood cells operating to help you. So it's almost impossible to get. If you had a large piece of rusty that was rusted pretty much through, lodged in your body, you might be able to develop it, but it's doubtful. How many cases of lockjaw and tetanus are in the world?

Q: Not much.

A: You never hear because there's one in a million. And it's mostly from taking iron supplements as a child. Mothers taking iron supplements because the doctor says take iron supplements. They're telling you to take rock, iron rock. We don't assimilate iron rock. What's it going to do if it gets locked in the body? It's going to rust. It's going to oxidize. Those are the people that get lockjaw. It isn't from a puncture wound. But the medical profession gets a lot of people to take tetanus shots. How many tetanus shots are given a year for that one out of a million? I know about 60 million in this country. Sixty million a year tetanus shots are given. There are 300 million people. Think about that. You go on an automobile accident, you go into a hospital, the first thing they give you is a tetanus shot. They don't ask you, they give it to you. You have a bicycle accident, you have a cut, you've got a child that goes in there. Automatically they get a tetanus shot. They don't ask you, they give it to you. It is standard procedure.

Q: Is there anything you can do about that?

A: Oh yes, you go in there. I have a card that I carry that says I refuse all drugs and anything unless you need to put a limb back on me. You can only use a local, anything. No tetanus shots, no anything else. 

Q: Where do you get that card?

A: I made it up, I typed it up and I came up with it.

Q: So you said there are other things that could cause this problem besides the bladder stones?

A: Yeah, well it's a collection of toxic minerals in the body. Your body doesn't handle them properly.

Q: What's the prostate? All these guys have these prostate problems.

A: You're giving me questions that are outside of that.

Q: No, I don't...  But I thought that's what he was talking about.

A: No, he's talking about a bladder. I mean, peeing slowly. So when you heat the body, it allows for the expansion. Now what would happen is you may have a lot of toxins in your urethral wall. And that's swelling. And the way to do that is put a hot water bottle at night between your penis and your scrotum. And cover the area and let it cook. Then you have a hot dog.

[laughter]

A: That will help the area relax and detoxify. Yeah. Oh, you can put a relish on it. Roger, do you have a question? 

Q: Yes. Is there anything that I could eat for Paget's disease?

Q: For what?

Q: Paget's. P-A-G-E-T-S. Paget's disease.

A: Paget's disease. I'm not recalling what that is off hand.

Q: Well, it's a bone disease, and you get it from a fall. The doctors say there's nothing they can do about it. 

A: Well, that's because they don't know shit about health.

Q: I know. That's why I'm asking.

A: Like I told you out there, you need to eat the cheese, the butter, and honey together. And that will repair any bone problem. Also, what you want to do if you've got a bone problem like that from an injury, you're not making the proper fibers to grow the bone properly. So you need pineapple two, three days a week. Then all you need is the honey, butter, and cheese together. Okay? Do you have a question?

Q: You may have already answered it in part. For years I've been taking mega doses of magnesium in order to have bowel movements. And since being on the diet, I've stopped taking it, but I'm having problems with constipation. None of the remedies in your books have done anything.

A: Then you need to feed your body in the back. You don't have true constipation. Your body's holding up the nutrients to try to get everything from it.

Q: Yeah. And so how often?

A: Because the older and longer it is, the more bacteria builds up in the fecal matter. So it holds on to it, trying to get everything it can. So you just put, you know, every two, three, seven days, it depends upon your body. Your E. coli could be very happy with very little, or they may want a lot. It depends. If you've taken magnesium a long time, taking magnesium by itself, the reason you have movements is because it is highly toxic. It destabilizes calcium in the body. It causes osteoporosis terribly. So you'll shit well and lose your bones.

Q: And magnesium does that?

A: Yes, yes. So it's a great imbalance. You need half magnesium to calcium. And if you put all this magnesium in the body, you're going to draw all this calcium out of your body. And it's going to start leaching it out of your bones.

Q: Put the two together.

A: It doesn't make any difference. It's rock. We don't eat the rock. You just feed the E. coli from the back end.

Q: What about [unintelligible]?

A: Once it's dried, it is a rock. It's no longer food. Any dried food is then a plant food. It's not a human food. That's why the American Indians, the North American Indians and Eskimo, they would take meat, and they would dry it out, and they would beat it into a flour, and then beat it until it became a flour, and then they would mix lard with it, and bake it in the sun and make these hard cakes. It's dried good food, right? No, they knew it's lacking in enzymes, it would leach a lot of nutrients from the body. Half of it is only digested properly. So they would carry it only in emergencies if they couldn't get good food, couldn't hunt, and they would make a 90-pound block.They still do in northern Canada and all throughout Alaska. It's called pemmican. If they don't eat it, they bury it. They do not eat it. Now all that rich food that took them so long to make, they don't eat it because it's not the quality of food that's best. Anytime you dehydrate a food, it is no longer active in enzymes. Your body's going to have to rebalance and replace, not as badly as it does with cooked food, because in cooked food, you create contaminants. When you dehydrate food, you lose nutrients. In cooking food, you've destroyed most of your nutrients, and you've got toxins, at least 32 toxins, that I address in my recipe book. Okay? Do you have a question?

Q: I have a question. I've been maybe for the last... I'm not really really into the raw diet, but I do some. And then I noticed I was peeing brownish. I have no symptoms of anything?

A: Everybody should be peeing dark orange or brown. All animals pee that color. If you're not peeing that color, you're drinking too much water.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: That's why, you should see mine. All animals. You collect their urine, they're all dark. No animal except humans who drink all that water have clear pee. And then you're really toxic if you're peeing out clear. Because you've diluted everything. You've diluted all the nutrients in your blood.

Q: Oh yeah because it looks heavy too.

A: All of that remaining fluid from the blood should be rich in nutrients. Not all water. There should be very little water in there.

Q: So you'd be very fatigued if you were eroding everything.

A: Correct. You can get fatigued. And about the stone, in case he has a stone, we need to find out first. Yeah, what you can do, well, just put the hot water bottle under there. And have the formula that I have for getting rid of stones in the book.

Q: And the laser?

A: Well, he doesn't have to have that. It's probably a small stone. You know, I started so young with mine, I never knew it existed until I was 53 years old. Ten years ago. No, I was 56 when it happened. So, seven years ago. And let me tell you, I've always had slow urine because of that. The stone, I didn't know it was a stone. It never caused me any pain. And all of a sudden, at 56 years old, it started causing pain. And I was having to lift my leg like a dog to pee. Because it would move the stone aside so I could pee. But when it was, you know, when it was just sitting in there, it was hitting the urethra. And it started getting particles on it, it was scabbing. And that's what was causing the pain. And the pain was mainly at the end of the penis, not back under. So I didn't know what was going on. So I found a urologist that did ultrasounds and not x-rays. And he took the one, he couldn't believe it. He had to do it and keep looking at it because it was the biggest thing he ever saw. And I was talk of the whole office. Biggest stone in history. I have the pictures, too.

Q: Because the laser doesn't really harm you.

A: Pardon?

Q: The laser doesn't harm you.

A: Well, they can. It can cut right through your urethra. It can cause all kinds of problems. They have to be very slow and delicate with it. But the thing is that I wasn't going to have them give me any gas or put me out. I was going to say give me a local. And I saw that tube was this big that they stick up your penis. This big. And you've got this little bitty hole. I said you put me out. There's no way you're going to get that up in me. Without being out.

Q: Shit.

A: Oh, I was peeing like a horse when that came out. I mean, it was my whole life. My mother used to slap me. Come on, what's taking you so long to pee? Because it would take me three minutes before the pee would flow. And then it would be really slow. My mother would get so frustrated when I was a little boy. Because, you know, she had to wait for me to pee and she had three other boys waiting. You know, so I always used to get angry and slap me sometimes. Like I had a choice. So here I was, 56 years old, peeing like a horse. It was great.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: White or clear?

Q: White.

A: White, that means you're not digesting fats. So your liver isn't working properly. You're drinking too much water. Do you have a question?

Q: Yes. Well, you've answered questions I didn't know I had. And also you've answered some that I did have. I have a question, but I'd like to say something first. When I met with you four years ago, it was just a good start for me. You gave me so much to chew on. It's been four years. And one of the most significant parts of the healing process for me, and I'm about 120 degrees from where I was, has been as I've regained my health, I've also gained a lot of emotional maturity and courage. And that's very significant because we need that, especially at this time when we're being assaulted from all sides. And so I would just encourage everybody to not be afraid. I've heard others talking about the worries that they have when they're out of condition. And what you say is just trust your body. I do trust my body.

A: Well, you've got the extra weight, too, so you're not going to have the symptoms like they have.

Q: Yeah, but when I saw you at that time, I was 45 pounds lighter. 

A: Yeah, I remember.

Q: I developed a love affair with butter, and I'm just really grateful for that. Butter and honey and cheese, that's what I ask everyone. Anyway, the question I had was, you said you fly a lot, and you're flying most recently. I'm very concerned. My family wants to fly. I won't fly anymore, but they want to fly back to the Midwest. And I've heard they're going to start incorporating or implementing the backscatter x-rays. Do you have anything to say about that?

A: I take a doctor's letter with me for my patients. I write a letter for you, and it says that you cannot... They have to hand-check you. So that's worked every time I've gone through the scanner. I've given a letter, they pass me around through the magnetic rather than the radiation. And they take my food and hand-check that most of the time. So it doesn't have to go through the little bitty x-ray machine that looks through your carry-on luggage. But the food can pass through that one because it's pretty mild. You do not want to put any food in your check-in luggage. There's a huge x-ray that's worth about 100 doses of an x-ray. 

Q: [unintelligible]

A: No, the hand, the luggage check-in, hand-check. I don't let my food, if my food goes through twice, because sometimes I'll go from one country to another, and I have to go through a hand-check again or scanner. But that's rare that that ever... It only happened to me twice, I throw the food away. I don't eat it. It goes through twice. It goes through once, I'm good. I'll eat it.

Q: So would you recommend getting rid of your luggage if you fly all the time, maybe after a couple of years?

A: Pardon?

Q: Would you recommend getting rid of your luggage after a couple of years if you fly a lot?

A: Depends on how much metal is in it. They're using hard plastics now. There's not much metal in it. But yeah, let's say there's a lot of metal in it, absolutely.

Q: You get rid of your luggage?

A: Yeah, because it will build up in radiation. The metal will become radioactive.

Q: The cloth luggage is okay?

A: You've got reinforcement in it? If it's plastic reinforcement? Yeah, then that's fine.

Q: What about the personal scanner that they use? That one, the little one.

Q: It's a roller.

A: That's magnetic.

Q: That's no big deal.

A: That's magnetic. That's not radiation.

Q: I have another question. Shipping stuff through UPS, airmail and stuff, they...

A: They don't x-ray anything. They only... They x-ray maybe 0.1% just to make TSA happy.

Q: I was just thinking about Amos and all the shipping he does.

A: If you ship the parcel postal system, the U.S. postal system, you'll get x-rayed a lot. You ship it UPS or FedEx, you know, it will barely ever happen. 

Q: Do it overnight. Do it overnight.

A: Priority mail will get x-rayed. Okay, do you have a question?

Q: Yes. I have a tooth that the filling came out and it's broken in half. And I wanted to know, I know you mentioned about, you know, getting an injection. I don't really want to get the Novocaine. I wonder, could I still handle that pain? I mean, is the Novocaine really necessary?

A: It's never necessary. In fact, it causes hardening of the tissues, even up into the brain. And it causes, it causes, one, they know this. Xylocaine, she said, I've got a broken tooth. I want to have it fixed, but I don't want to have Novocaine. Do I have to have Novocaine? And I'm telling you, the damage that Novocaine and Xylocaine and all of them do, they cause more tooth decay. It's injected into the gum, into the bone, and it actually causes bone damage and gum damage, severe. And it even causes tumors. It causes mouth tumors, jaw tumors, brain tumors, all kinds of stuff. So no, you don't need it. In 1978, I had 16 amalgam fillings in my mouth. I had 8 of them removed one morning and 8 of them removed next morning, 4 hours of drilling each morning. How did you manage? They didn't have the water jet at the time. The water jet cools the bit so it doesn't hurt. Back in those days, there was no water jet. So I had a signal. I tapped the dentist on the knee. I wouldn't hit his elbow. And let me tell you, some of those are very deep and very big, and it got down to the nerve, and sometimes you'd hit the nerve, and it would bleed. But you have to understand that scraping the nerve is no worse than, except for that one split second, millisecond. It hurts. But it's the burning of the tissue that causes the swell. You know, the burn will last for days, the pain of a burn, but a scrape will not. That's the difference. So I had to tap him. Every time the bit got too hot, he'd dip it in a bowl of cold ice water, and then he would go back to drilling again. It took four hours to drill out eight teeth. But I had no novocaine, and I had no xylocaine. I had no number whatsoever, except that I did have a little bit of marijuana that I chewed before I went in. I chewed it and spit it out, just got a little in there, because it does create a little numbness in the mouth. So that's what I did.

Q: It broke, and the filling came out, so I had to get a new one.

A: If you're going to have the whole tooth pulled, you don't need the tooth pulled. You can put a cap over it. So you can have them put a post in it, do a root canal, have them put a post in it and a cap over it. He's going to try to talk you into getting some kind of a metal post to put in there so you can put a tooth on it. It's a lot more toxic. It's better to have your own tooth in your bone until your body rejects that tooth.

Q: What do you do with it?

A: Because it's still your own bone attached to your own tooth bone attached to the jaw bone, the mandible bone. 

Q: Do you put resin to fill in the hole or do you put...

A: Well, once the nerve is out, it won't flow through the tubules anymore.

Q: So you can fill it?

A: Well, what I did was mine... I took some bone, some horn, and I carved them and let them pack calcium around it and put it in there. And then, of course, when you put the cap over the tooth, there's an epoxy on it, but you've got a dead tooth. It's not going to absorb anything. There's no nerve in there to absorb the toxin.

Q: Even though it's broken in half, I can still save it?

A: Absolutely. All of these were broken after my father hit me with a paint can. When I was 16, I broke my teeth right off at the gum line. These are caps. I still have my teeth. These are caps over them, so we can save them.

Q: What material do you suggest putting in the tooth if you have to do a filling where it's not dead?

A: I suggest that people use porcelain [unintelligible], is the best. If it's a facial, use the hard plastic. Okay. Let me get him, please.

Q: Okay. Sometimes I'll have a queasy stomach or a stomach ache. Sometimes after having the cheese and then the egg, and then it's time for the meat.

A: Cheese and egg is a hard... How much space are you leaving between?

Q: Ten minutes.

A: You're still having that problem after ten minutes?

Q: Yeah, and usually after the egg, it'll start to get not very queasy or horrible, but I'm just wondering, like, I usually wait to eat any meat or anything because I'm figuring something's dumping, but should I wait or should I just eat ten minutes after the egg? 

A: Well, I would go ahead and... Well, if something's dumping very heavily, you might wait, you know, five more minutes, maybe 15 minutes. You have 25 minutes to eat that meal from that time that you've taken the egg. So if you waited another 10 minutes or 15 minutes and then ate the meat meal, how long does it take you to eat a meat meal?

Q: It all varies. Like, sometimes I'll take half an hour. Sometimes I'll just eat it really quick. 

A: Okay, when you eat it really quick, it's fine. If you're going to take time and you need to take a break, have a little cheese, wait ten minutes again. You don't have to have another egg. Just wait that ten minutes after the cheese. 

Q: What about some days I just have like a queasy, achy stomach and no appetite, should I just not eat much or should I just say now it's time to eat? 

A: Eat a little cheese and butter all day long to collect the poisons. Anytime you have nausea, toxins are dumping from the stomach lining into your stomach or your intestine, and that causes nausea. The body wants to bring it up. Now when the nausea happens, what happens? It triggers the stomach into making hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid neutralizes a lot of poisons. If you have cheese there, you don't have to manufacture, you don't have to have so much nausea most of the time, and you don't have to have as much nausea. You don't have to experience as much. So the cheese will absorb it and hold on to it. And as long as you don't have honey directly with that cheese, you will not reabsorb those poisons with the nutrients in the cheese. You have to have honey with the cheese to do that, or you have to have pasteurized cheese that's already broken up, or you have to have salted cheese, and then you will reabsorb your poison. So no salt, raw cheese will bind with the poisons and pass out. And when I tell you to replace your bone, your mineral levels, and get your mineral supplement, that's when you eat honey with your cheese. Should it be salted or unsalted? I said if it's salted, you're going to reabsorb your poison. Just remember, salt is an explosive. Besides nuclear weapons, besides plutonium, it's the most explosive mineral we have.

Q: Even Himalayan salt?

A: When you isolate sodium, one block this big is worth an atomic bomb. And that's why they put iodine or potassium chloride with the salt, something like that, so it won't be explosive. Well, what happens in your body, it creates all this breaking down of the food, so it helps you digest your food, not in a nice way. Plus, the sodium gets released in your blood, and these explosions go off all the time. Now, normally a cell, when it eats, it eats a smorgasbord of food. I hear now that the New Age glitch on it, talk is, what is it called, micronutrients or microclusters? I like to call them smorgasbords because I don't want to put it down on that chemical level. Yeah, it may be a nutrient cluster or whatever you want to call it. It is a smorgasbord of nutrients. It's a whole variety of nutrients, and it's 92 to 117 nutrients. Every time a cell eats, that's what it gets. When you have salt in the blood, isolated, the sodium, it explodes and breaks up these smorgasbords, and the cells end up getting a third, a fourth, or only 50% of their nutrients. They're always malnourished. Salt is a toxic, dangerous thing. That decreases your lifespan by more than any other thing. We're supposed to be living to 150. We live 60, 70 years old on the average. Half the life we should be living, and it's mainly because of salt. People were living a long time before they got into salt. When the Jews went into Israel and started using salt on everything, because it would harden so quickly in the desert, they started using salt very often. The bad things started with that, and then the King and Queen of England picked it up, and they made a whole industry of salt.

Q: But the bath is okay.

A: When you're not feeding, you're not ingesting it into your blood, you've got it there working, pulling stuff out. It's different.

Q: Just one last thing on mine, just to be clear on it. While I'm having the queasy, I shouldn't be eating the meat. Just wait till...

A: Wait till you... yeah.

Q: Okay.

A: Just keep eating a little bit of cheese until it stops.

Q: Okay.

A: Because you may be dumping more than you've eaten...

Q: So if I don't eat meat all day because I'm queasy, that's fine. Okay.

A: As long as you're eating at least eggs to get your protein and fats. Yeah, it's okay to do that once in a while, fine. I've done it up to a week.

Q: Really?

A: But by the end of the week, my brain is about gone, even though I'm having all the eggs.

Q: Yes, on the issue of seeds, nuts, and enzyme inhibitors, you say in your recipe book that your formula will neutralize the enzyme inhibitors. I think you're talking about the phytic acid. Everything I have read and heard so far, outside the book, says in order to neutralize...

A: Cook it.

Q: You have to sprout it or ferment it, which was traditionally done. So I'm wondering just how does breaking it up in that mixture neutralize it when other sources say you need to sprout it or change the chemistry that way.

A: Well, you have to understand the sources that are talking about neutralizing the phytic acid are vegetarians. They're not using butter. They're not using honey. Those are animal products. 

Q: I read that from the Western Price article. They use plenty of raw fat.

A: Yeah, but it does... They haven't done the tests then. Because I did the test and the phytic acid wasn't active. It had no activity when it came out of the bowels, and there was no problem with mineral absorption and protein utilization. So that's my experimentation, that's what I heard. You can laboratory shit out the zoo, and what happens in a laboratory, it's like they say, the avidin in the egg white will bind with the biotin in the egg yolk, B vitamins. However, in raw eggs, I have never had that happen. I eat up to 50 raw eggs a day, and I don't have a biotin deficiency. 50 a day, and I've eaten up to that much. I don't eat that much every day, but sometimes that's what I eat, 50 eggs, no meat. So when I do that, I have no biotin deficiency. I've never had a biotin deficiency, and I've eaten at least 100,000 eggs in my lifetime. Raw. So when they've got this scientific bullshit going on in a laboratory, it's got nothing to do with what happens in the human body. 

Q: Okay, so empirically, there was no phytic acid.

A: In the nut formula. No active. So phytic acid, when they find it in a laboratory, it binds with these minerals. It doesn't allow the minerals to be utilized properly, so it causes like a cluster. So that, of course, if you can't digest your minerals, you're not going to digest your fats, you're not going to digest your fats, you're not going to digest your protein. So there's a whole chain reaction from it. However, what they don't look at is that when you sprout it, you have three other enzymes, new enzymes, that act the same way as phytic acid. So there you have three times the amount. What happens if you feed a bird all sprouts? It will die in a week. It can eat the seeds with all the phytic acid galore in it, and the bird won't die. But you feed them sprouts only, and the bird will die. Any animal will get sick if you only feed them sprouts. You can feed them grains all day long, and the deterioration will be slow. You feed them sprouts, and their deterioration will be fast. There is such shallow thinking out there, and that's because it's intended. If you're not sick, they don't make money. Period. That's it. Michael, do you have a question?

Q: If I stay up too late, the following night I can develop a headache, and it will keep me awake the entire night. When [unintelligible] asleep, then I can't do it, because the headache keeps me awake.

A: I didn't hear all of that. I'm sorry.

Q: Often when I stay up too late...

A: What's too late?

Q: Say I stay up too late tonight. 

A: Let's say 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock in the morning.

Q: Usually about 12 o'clock. And the following night I'll try to sleep, but I'll develop a headache. None of your remedies really seem to deal with it. It'll last probably almost till morning. Just what I need to sleep is what I need most.

A: Right.

Q: But I can't seem to do anything with the headache.

A: Just remember, when you keep up for a long period of time, you're doing mostly detoxifying. And if you're not handling your toxins well enough, then the toxins build up. Then when you try to sleep and your body wants to go into a sleep state to do its healing, what happens is it locks the poisons away where there's most fat, and that's the brain. So then you have swelling in the brain. So what you have to do is make sure you take care of that. If you're going to stay up late, you have to eat cheeses. You have to eat butter, something that's going to absorb the poison. It's going to pull them out of your blood so they don't get locked into the brain. Also, when you're up that long, sometimes the nerves can build up. And then when you're heavily into detoxifying the nervous system, between midnight and 5 o'clock in the morning, you've got too much going on in the brain. You can always take hot water bottles and put them on either side of your head. The headache will be worse for 10, 15 minutes. But once the fissures on the skull are relaxed enough and expand, then the headache reduces by 85%. That's going after it directly. But usually my recipes in the book handle the toxicity in the blood. They do not handle it in the nervous system. So, usually the toxicity is in the nervous system. When it's in the brain, like in migraines and in cluster headaches. It's in the nervous system. Those remedies don't work for the nervous system. They'll help a tiny bit. So, you've got to eat a lot of cheese. You've got to eat eggs. You've got to make sure that you don't go to sleep at the time when the nervous system kicks into worse detoxification at midnight, until you get better. Okay.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: I put it in the second-to-last newsletter. Survival Kit. I call it Survival Kit. It's for anything. The Survival Kit is in a newsletter about two or three newsletters ago. I don't remember. Do you have a question?

Q: Gastritis.

A: Gastritis? You're too skinny. What happens a lot of times when you have gas, you have toxins that dump into the intestinal wall, and there's not enough mucus to harness them in the mucus lining. It's almost always on people who are thin, especially people who have Crohn's disease or any kind of inflammatory bowel system. They don't create mucus proper enough to protect the lining. So what happens is the poisons don't get locked into the mucus. They get into the digestive tract where the food is, then your digestive juices mix with those poisons, and it creates gas. The gas that can cause severe pain, can cause diarrhea, can cause headaches. You have to eat cheese until you're relieved. You need to eat a lot of milkshakes to get your mucus producing properly. A lot of people have very thin mucus. When you look at mucus under a microscope, it looks like you're looking at a piece of fabric. It's layers and layers of woven fibers, like this. Layers and layers of it. And if you can see through it, it's not tight. Toxins, even your own digestive acids, can get through. [unintelligible] your intestinal tract, and that's the worst case of Crohn's. So what happens is, when you eat the proper proteins, everything is so tight, nothing can get through. You've got sometimes 80 layers of these mucous fibers protecting your intestines. Especially if you're a sick person, you should have a lot. He probably has 80. Good size. He has a lot of weight there to protect. So you can afford to manufacture a lot of that, a lot of mucus. That's another reason I like people to be that size until they get well. I was that size for 20 years, you know, to get well. And I still, even up to a year and a half ago, I got that big. I had a, you know, 38-inch waist, and I'm only 5'7 3⁄4". I'm 190 pounds. You know, right now I'm 170. So that's 20 pounds more than I am now. It helps to build good mucus. You need lots of milkshakes. And eat cheese to help absorb the toxins so they don't create as much gas.

Q: Do the sugars break down that grid?

A: Oh, yes. They'll eat right into it. Processed sugars eat right into it. They eat so far, yet through the mucus lining, you have villi. You've seen, like, in the oceans, you've got those villi. And you see the fish and the particles going through. And that's the way food goes through the body in the same way. And as the food touches the villi, the villi determines whether there's more hydrochloric acid or other enzymes to break the larger particles of food down so the bacteria can eat it. Eighty to ninety percent of digestion is bacterial. Only ten to twenty percent is enzymatic, digestive juices. So bacteria is your main criteria for digestion. And when you're taking antibiotics and all of that, you have to rely only upon the enzymes and digestive juices. And you don't get a tiny bit of your nutrients because people get very, very weak after having antibiotics. Your body is ninety-nine percent bacteria. You take five days of an antibiotic, you reduce it by one percent. That's reducing one percent of the functions of your whole body. You go two weeks, three percent. They put my mother on, you know, antibiotics for a year and I didn't know about it. All of a sudden they get a call and they said, Mom's going to die, come, she'll be dead in five days. She stopped eating because she couldn't digest. So when I found out, I knew right away what to do. So when I got there, I fed her custards with the papaya to help the enzymes start working again, and the butter, and the honey, and the eggs. Everything very easily digestible. Fed her a half a cup of that in the morning, early morning, like at six o'clock in the morning. At ten o'clock I give her the other half a cup. And she ate three meals that day, full meals. Cooked, of course, but she ate three meals. Fed on, she wouldn't eat but the papaya the next day, because the butter was too much for her, because of the damage from the antibiotics. So I gave her half a cup of papaya every day. She ate three meals a day. She recovered. She's still alive at 91. And she was supposed to die from that five years ago. So you see what antibiotics can do. The major part of the body is bacterial. If you buy into the pharmaceutical industry and medical industries, bacteria is the cause of disease, you have just counted yourself as a disease. Because you're 99% bacteria.

Q: And the sugar in the papaya didn't counter what you were trying to...

A: That is a raw sugar and I put it with fat. There's butter and there's the yolk with all of its fat. So the sugar was harmless. All you have to eat it with the fat, it's in my book. Always eat fruit with fat, always. Unless you've just eaten a big meal of fat. So we've cleared your question. Yes, go ahead.

Q: Manufacturing platelets in the blood makes blood thick.

A: You do not manufacture platelets in the blood. You manufacture the platelets in your bone marrow. They mature in the bone marrow and then enter the bloodstream.

Q: You know, you've seen people who get a stroke, who might be on an otherwise pretty healthy diet, but their blood gets too thick. And what would you say, like in the recommendation section, page 40, 41, you know, there's things to do each day. Well, what kind of natural things could you throw in there that would make it [unintelligible]?

A: Well, beet juice and grapefruit.

Q: So that would be...

A: But almost any fruit, any bland fruit, cucumber, zucchini juice, tomato, any of those will thin the blood. 

Q: Okay, and they all need to be concocted in one way or another, with a fat.

A: No. No, tomato can be eaten alone, cucumber can be eaten all day.

Q: Grapefruit?

A: Grapefruit you need to minimize. That'll be a fast-reacting one, but you don't want a lot of that.

Q: Why tomato? Don't the fruits, don't they need fat?

A: Well, see, there's no high sugar in tomato. It's not high in carbohydrate. And it's high in sodium, so it holds more water, so it will thin the blood. Celery juice will do it too, but that can cause other imbalances if you have too much of it. But cucumber you can eat all day. Tomato you can eat too much. You can get too acidic from eating too many tomatoes. But you have to go on, if your mouth starts getting too raw, then you've eaten too many tomatoes. But there's some people who can eat tomatoes until the cow comes home and not get too acidic. I don't have that luxury. I have to stick with cucumber juice, something like that, celery juice.

[unintelligible]

Q: I try to take it, but none of those things appeal to me. That's probably why.

A: Watermelon? Don't eat the center. Eat only from where the seeds go from the center to where the bottom of the seeds. Eat the pink from all the way down and then the white of the watermelon. Don't eat the seeds up, to the center.

Q: Because it's so much high in sugar.

Q: The seeds are coming down.

Q: Watermelon has salt, doesn't it?

A: Sodium. Like tomatoes, high in sodium. Like avocados, high in sodium. I gotta go around [unintelligible].

Q: You cut it after the seeds?

Q: I'll tell you after.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You can eat meat at night, in the middle of the night. I always say, wake up in the night, eat something. Five hours without eating, your red blood cells eat each other for the protein. You could be 700 pounds, it doesn't make any difference. It doesn't have anything to do with the fat, it's the protein level in the blood. In our toxic society, it's gone in five hours. So the red blood cells start eating each other. Sure shoots the shit out of vegetarianism, doesn't it? All that fasting? Milk has protein in it, milk's fine. So I say wake up, wake during the night. You can wake five hours and go back to sleep for three hours. If you're a hyperactive person and you wake up after five hours and eat, you may not go back to sleep. So wake up after three hours, eat, and then go back to sleep for five. Easy.

Q: Is cheese okay after five hours?

A: Cheese won't be digested, unless you're going to eat it with honey. You can eat cheese and honey and butter together and go back to sleep.

Q: And your vegetable juice in the morning, if it happens to be on the five hours, that won't do it?

A: Yeah, it'll be fine.

Q: Really?

A: Yeah. You eat your cheese first.

Q: And then the veg juice.

A: If you're really hungry, and let's say you're not thinking well, and you've got brain loss from protein, then put an egg in your vegetable juice.

Q: Okay. Yeah, but sometimes my veg juice meal is right at the five hours, and I'm thinking...

A: Well, put an egg in it.

Q: Okay. But by itself, it would be okay?

A: Yeah.

Q: Okay.

A: Unless it makes you hyper. If it makes your heart beat, pound hard, and it makes you nervous, you start shaking, and it makes your high blood pressure, then you put an egg in it.

Q: Okay.

A: Yes?

Q: About six years ago, I had a arthroscopic surgery. I was perfectly healthy to that point. Not on a raw diet. Minor meniscus there. I took it out.

A: So you weren't perfectly healthy. [unintelligible]

Q: It caused an embolism.

A: Embolism.

Q: An embolism to my lung.

A: Uh-huh. 

Q: And I was on Coumadin for about six months, and then all my problems started.

A: Absolutely.

Q: So I started taking some concentrated brain functioning supplement. It was concentrated egg whites. Like lots of it. Then I got onto your diet for about eight or nine months. I didn't do the weight gaining program. I just maintained strictly for eight or nine months, your regular recipe. After that, basically, I mixed it with Hopsin and some Chinese herbs, and I was in good shape for a while. Then basically not too long ago, I had chicken pox. Right before the chicken pox. But I've been suffering from chronic fatigue over the years, no matter what I tried to do. I had a blood circulation problem that occurred from the Coumadin, so it caused me to be looking for diets and special remedies and things. But eventually, I got little red spots on my skin, and then about two or three months later, I got chicken pox. And then about a month after that, I took high antiviral medication, because I was in the doctor's hands in Italy. I didn't know that you're not supposed to take anything. But anyways, eventually from that, this is the antiviral. Oh, I had a back spasm. Muscle spasm in the back that caused a small curve on my spine. And for about nine months, I've had this back spasm that's causing pain, major back pain. And I'm suffering from bloating, chronic fatigue, teeth grinding.

A: Everything you did was one injury after another. Just remember chickenpox is another bullshit disease. Anytime you have an eruption in the skin, it is a toxin coming through the skin. Just like they say swine flu and stuff like that. It has nothing to do with any kind of pig tissue. It doesn't have to do with any kind of animal at all. They just name it an animal tissue to make you afraid of nature. It is a composition of toxicity. Chickenpox comes from vaccines coming through the skin. 90% of all toxins are supposed to leave through the skin. So you're going to have eruptions on your skin. You're going to have pox. Like these, when they came out here. If I didn't have these come out, it would come out all over my body and my skin. And this all started within 24 hours. And it took 3 months, 4 months for me to stop. These were bleeding and oozing. Oozing with stuff that stunk like chemicals, metal, everything that you could think of. And it oozed and pussed for 4-4.5 months before it stopped. But at least I relieved a lot of it out of my body through the proper channels through the skin. But you can see what concentrated poisons can do. Did you see this?

Q: Yeah.

A: Okay, so you can see what it can do. So your pox was a reaction of chemicals. It could have been the Coumadin was the straw that broke the camel's back. I've got too many chemicals, we've got to have a heavy detox here. Whether it's hives or rash, no matter what it is, acne, those are poisons leaving the body. It's not some chicken that caused you a problem. Basically, right now I'm dealing with muscle spasms that last nine months.

Q: I've got pressure behind the eyes with fever symptoms that don't allow me to concentrate very easily. I've got bloating and farting and I'm glad she's playing... But basically, yeah, so I'm looking for remedies. What do I do?

A: Well, you've got multiple problems, and I just can't talk about them all right now, but if you just want to get started, cheese and butter and honey will help you get the minerals to settle things down. But you've got to have clay and milk together and a lot of things, so you'd better call me on that one. Because I would prefer to give you a good diet rather than just give you some remedies that you'll do it not quite right. If you want to get rid of it fast. Because I had back trouble.

Q: What does fast mean?

A: Probably within ten days you can have it under control. That's better than waiting months.

Q: Even though I'm not on your regular diet.

A: Oh, OK. Well, no, it wouldn't work that fast. But if I gave you the diet, I would be giving you my diet. So you would be doing it. OK. Let's see.

Q: OK. Quick question. Longer question. [unintelligible]

A: There are so many things. Avocado and oranges from the book. Avocado and oranges together. Some people can do pineapple and avocado together.Oysters are excellent for that. I had one model from Canada. She ate 128, 6 foot tall. She gained a lot of weight so her agency hated that. She's 6 foot tall and went up to about 260 pounds. She ate 128 oysters. She had a sex drive for 28 days. And her boyfriend loved it. He had to pay for that 128 oysters.

[laughter]

Q: She ate it in one day?

A: One evening, one dinner.

Q: One dinner?

A: Yeah.

Q: Holy Jesus.

A: I got a call and she says, I've already downed two dozen oysters. What's the limit? I said, there's no limit. You can eat as many as you want. Her boyfriend calls me. He says, she just gone through 100. You sure there isn't a limit? She already went through 100? I said, eat as many as you want. You'll enjoy it. And he did. He didn't mind paying the $700.

Q: My main question is, in your book, in your recipe book, everything you've got is, I am severely allergic to eggs.

A: Not at all.

Q: But I've had salad dressings with raw egg white.

A: Yeah, but you're not... You've got salt in that dressing. You've got all kinds of other crap in that dressing.

Q: So are you saying like, drink an egg, you put it in a glass and drink it?

A: Let me show you.

Q: Rocky style.

Q: Aajonus style.

A: Rocky is breaking it into a glass and downing it. I'm so sorry.

Q: Yeah, it's okay. Yeah, I'm alright.

A: So the fat end, the fatter end, this one's almost perfect. Even, but it isn't. This is the fatter end. So what I do is I take an eye tooth, the eye tooth here, which is, you're supposed to have a point on it, but the dentist decided that he wanted to drill, you know, grind mine down. But I take it and I hit it flat. So you damage the bottom without breaking a hole in it. Otherwise you're going to have it dripping down off your hand, onto the floor and everything. This end I hit down on the tooth to make the hole. Now I have a hole. Now, for you, if you have trouble with eggs, you hold it down like this, and you suck gently. Make sure the egg white is liquid, and not slimy, okay? Take that down first. If you drink, if you suck slowly, breaking this allows that membrane in there to move up. It allows the egg white to come out without the egg yolk bobbing up. Okay? So you just keep doing this. Just getting the egg white, gently. If you feel the yolk come up, and stop it up, then you relax it, shake it a little like this, and you free up the egg white, and then do it again. 

Q: So you're saying I'm not allergic to raw eggs?

A: I've never met a person who is allergic to raw eggs. Never. So then when you get to the yolk... Now do you see any residue in there? Nothing. Because I allowed the membrane to collapse.

Q: What about the potential chicken shit on the outside?

A: Perfect. It's good bacteria.

Q: You don't eat it, do you?

A: How many animals go around licking each other's asses to get at the bacteria? Every animal except humans. We're missing out on all the bacteria. I leave it on. In fact, when I go to the farmers, I take out all the eggs with the shit on them. When I'm in Asia. They don't clean their eggs there. And I'll go pick out the one that has the most shit on it.

Q: But you don't eat the shit on the outside.

A: Where I poke it, I'm eating the shit.

Q: Oh, man.

A: Absolutely. Okay. Your question.

Q: I already did.

A: Oh, you did. I started with you.

Q: I have one.

A: Oh, hi Barbara.

Q: I didn't get one.

A: You're the host. You don't get a question. Go on. Oh, yes. We want to thank the hosts, Jim and Barbara.

[applause]

Q: I should say, I have gained weight, and I was diagnosed with cancer. Much worse than anything you've got, I'm sure. And having gained all that weight, I have actually very few symptoms. I have symptoms, but nothing like heart pounding and the stuff you're talking about. So there is something to weight gain, just from a personal point of view.

A: And she has cancer of the spine, so that's severe.

Q: Bone cancer in the spine, in the spinal column. The medical community considered me a corpse long ago. So I just wanted to say that one thing. But anyway, I have many, many symptoms, but they're not scary as [unintelligible]. One of them is, I seem to be coughing a lot during the night. And I'm wondering, is it just a great detox, or is there something in my room? I can't even tell, my intuition fails me at this point.

A: I wouldn't know unless I went into your room and took a look. But usually when you have a spinal problem, you're going to detox through the lungs. You just need to make sure your body is producing enough mucus so it doesn't damage the lungs.

Q: I have two milkshakes during the night.

A: Okay, good.

Q: What's in the milkshake? What do you put in the milkshake?

A: Milkshake recipes are in the book. I've got quite a few milkshake recipes. But it's just egg, milk, cream and honey.

Q: I have a question.

A: Elaine, you haven't got a question. Elena, Elena. Ellen. Elena, Elena. How do you pronounce it?

Q: Elena.

A: Elena, okay. You haven't had a question?

Q: Not yet.

A: Okay. Pretty ladies before you.

[laughter]

Q: Can you talk about the etiology of...

A: Ecology of what?

Q: Tetracycline.

Q: I can't hear the question.

A: She asked about the etiology of tetracycline.

Q: What does etiology mean?

A: The makeup of it, how they make it.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Oh, how to get rid of it. Well, tetracycline is a fungus they use as an antibiotic. It is very similar to gangrene. And you get rid of it with lime juice, and you do the same with any kind of fungus in the body. You use, depending upon the size of the person, about three tablespoons of lime juice, three tablespoons of honey, a tablespoon of lemon juice, and you blend that all together. And then you put that in, you pour that into three, depending upon the size of the person. This is for her. So three ounces of sparkling mineral water, three and a half ounces of sparkling mineral water. You don't pour the water into the mixture, the mixture goes into the water. It's going to foam up a bit, so you want a little larger jar to accompany it. And you sip that over a 15-20 minute period. Don't guzzle it because it's going to rush to the kidneys. You've got to get it into the system. And that will stop any kind of too heavy bacterial detoxification, fungal detoxification, and destroy penicillin. Penicillin is a bird disease, and it's a bird cleanser. Remember, these are not really diseases. Penicillin, in its natural form, is a fungus that birds use to help break down substances that have accumulated in their body if they're somewhat toxic and they've been too active. Let's say when they're flying 3,000 miles, changing climates. In that exercise of doing that, they'll build up with excess carbohydrates from grains. If they're eating mainly seeds along the way and not eating many bugs or animal products, and the birds are vegetarians, they'll build up a lot of that accumulation on a trip like that. They need the penicillin to help break that substance down, and it's a good thing. When they give it to us, they've sterilized it. They've damaged the fungus so it no longer knows when to go into hibernation. All funguses will have cycles. They'll go in and out of hibernation. Cycle maybe nine months, six months to nine months on, three to six months off, depending upon the need in the body. Since we eat grain products, we've eaten all these cooked grain products, we are full of stuff that penicillin lives on and thrives on. So once penicillin gets into your body, it works 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, the whole time you're alive, unless you've been on the primal diet for 40 years. I still have penicillin in my brain. Those are the only spots that I have left in my body besides the prostate gland. It's got some metallic minerals and toxicity, from the irises. So I've still got penicillin working in my brain because I haven't detoxed my brain yet altogether. So I've got two major spots in my brain. A fourth of my brain is still feeding the penicillin. I don't want to stop it. I'm healthy enough I don't need to stop it. I don't need to slow it down. But I find that a lot of people's digestive tracts are in their nervous system where it needs to be tempered. And I need to slow it down. So that's the formula I give them.

Q: How long and how often do you give it?

A: Two, three days a week only. I mean two days a week only. One, two days a week only.

Q: For how long?

A: Because it will destroy good bacteria too if you have it too much.

Q: So days, weeks, months?

A: I would have to look in your eyes and tell.

Q: At least do it for a few days, weeks?

A: Oh, I would do it for probably three months. No more than three months. So for her, I gave hers which was three tablespoons of lime juice, one lemon, three tablespoons of honey, and then the wa... Oh, I forgot also.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Also, two tablespoons of coconut cream and one tablespoon of dairy cream. Now that it's so frickin' delicious, you do not drink it fast. You still gotta drink it slowly. So one, two days a week. It works. Without that much honey, it won't work as well.

Q: No kidding.

Q: That's the same one you gave me for the floor detox, the linoleum.

A: Yeah. No, I know. That one, for the linoleum, it was the mango, the kiwi, it makes a difference.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes.

Q: I had gained 20 pounds in 2 months.

A: You needed it. Did I get everyone?

Q: I didn't get a question.

Q: Yes, you did.

A: Hold on, hold on a second. There's some people that came late. If you haven't paid, please give it to Burton here. 

Q: What are your fees? 

A: $30.

Q: [unintelligible] fees?

A: Oh. Email me and I'll send them to you. optimal@earthling.net. 

Q: What do you think of this?

A: Pardon?

Q: You had a question. I didn't have one.

A: If everybody talks, I can't hear what's going on.

Q: We've still got people with us.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: It's a feed that's not a good healthy feed. I mean, it's a regular dairy feed that they're giving.

Q: They don't play any games on it? [unintelligible] maybe?

A: No, they don't do anything like that. But they do use, they put heavy chlorine in their tanks to clean them. You know, very heavy. Because they have to keep the coliform count down to 10. So there's chlorine in it that's higher than normal.

Q: Organic pastures have to do the same?

A: Organic pastures has to do the same. They're worse now since that law went in. So when you get it at Rawesome, we're getting it from Pennsylvania at Amish Farm. Perfect, yeah. It's the only one I'd get, yeah.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: You know, I'm going to help you back here because I'm going to help adjust you. So just give me a few minutes. All right. Oh, you didn't John? Kathy, hold on. John, go ahead. 

Q: Okay, so this is the subject of massage. Is it a necessity or a luxury? And what is its role in optimum health? 

A: Well, massage always helps people get healthier quicker. Some people have to have very gentle massages if they have a lymphatic problem. So it's got to be like a tickle massage. But massage will always help you get well quicker because it moves things around. If you're going through a heavy detoxification of flu or cold, it's not a good idea to have a massage because then you'll get too many things moving and you already have enough moving.

Q: Okay, and what's its role in terms of muscle development, body building, that kind of stuff?

A: It depends upon the individual, but if they want to build muscle faster, of course, if they can make sure that everything is flowing through, better with massage, that's always more helpful.

Q: Okay, so it's like a circulation thing.

A: Right. It can also help the body relax. It can also get tight knots and congestions and help move them through. Now, a lot of massage therapists will try to break those and work hard to do it. They need to be gently moved because you can break substances. You can cause cutting and lacerations. Most people, you know, I may be different because I've been on this diet for a while. I don't have all the lumps and everything that other people have. So I can handle a hard massage, but I don't like hard massages. But other people need things worked out of them gently. Now, the problem with most massage therapists is they have a technique. Once they learn the technique, the technique's in their head and their sense of what they had when they first started massaging, it was a feel thing. They felt in the body. They were in tune with how much pressure was needed. And then when they learn all these fucking techniques, their finesse with the body is gone. So you have to find a massage therapist who can keep in touch with the feel and not just think about the routines and the activity. You know, the style of the massage.

Q: Massage, is that non-replaceable in some functions?

A: Massage can always be helpful, except when you're already too much into a detoxification. You know, hands-on touch can be a massage. When you're very sick, that's helped me many times. When I couldn't be touched, you know, as far as massage, if somebody was just holding my feet, or holding my shoulders, or just touching my neck, was enough massage to give a change for my body. So massage is always helpful. It just depends on what kind you need at the time. So I've always used massage still. I used to have to go to chiropractors sometimes twice a day when my back was in so much pain when I had cancer. And the cauterized spine was the main problem there from the radiation therapy. So I don't think it's necessary to go to chiropractors unless you need to do it. Because you can always do yoga and stretch yourself out, and that's what I learned to do. But you can't massage yourself and relax at the same time. So that's why you need somebody else to help you. So I've always gotten massages. I get at least one massage a week. And they're very helpful.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Yes, I like leg massage mostly. It can crack the limbs. Let's say you have hardened veins. You have varicose veins. You have any kind of damage. A hard massage can break and cause internal bleeding. You can bleed lymph. You can bleed neurological fluids. You can bleed blood all throughout your tissues, and it will cause more toxicity. So you have to know what your body is. You have to know the system.

Q: [unintelligible]

A: Awful. They're not real. They're not real enzymes. You have to build your own digestive enzymes. So have pineapple. Have papaya. Have things that naturally are concentrated that will help you build natural enzymes.

Q: What about hydrochloric acid?

A: Hydrochloric acid is highly toxic. It is not a biological hydrochloric acid. So you increase beet juice. You increase pineapple. And corn on the cob. Raw corn on the cob. Those will help you build hydrochloric acid. Wait a minute. She's got a question.

Q: You said about the mercury from vaccines. What can you start on to get rid of some of the mercury? I mean, you said you'd stay there.

A: You've got clay.

Q: What should I do with the clay? I have clay with my juice. I have a teaspoon. I have the clay in the morning.

A: You can do it that way. If you're very thin or smaller, you don't want clay in the juice. It's better to have it in milk.

Q: The water clay, it has to be wet.

A: Always have moist clay. Never have dry clay in anything. You make the clay first in a jar until it's like plaster of paris, and then take it from there. If it's five days old, it's best. It can last up to two years without turning black. And even that mold can be helpful.

Q: Could you take it with your milkshake?

A: No. You take it with milk, and you can take it with juice.

Q: I take it with juice every morning.

A: Well, you have the weight. You're okay. 

Q: A half a teaspoon with juice every morning.

A: But if you're on the slimmer side, you have, you know, on the slimmer side, you have the clay with milk and not juice and not water. Nothing like that. 

Q: Do you need the clay mixture for the bath as well when it says a quarter of a cup?

A: Pardon?

Q: When your formula for the bath is a quarter cup of clay, is that also the mixture of clay?

A: No, that can be just the powder. I'm talking about ingesting.

Q: You're supposed to put clay in the bath? You never said that.

A: It's in the book?

Q: Oh, but I just used milk, vinegar, sea salt, the Himalayan salt, and coconut cream.

A: Coconut cream, that's fine. That combination will work. For people who don't have the salt or they don't have the vinegar, then they have to use the clay.

Q: But wet clay?

A: No, you can use dry clay for that.

Q: Two tablespoons of that.

A: Well I use about three in place of the vinegar. So what else did you ask me about?

Q: The mercury.

A: The mercury. Oh, oysters are the quickest way to get rid of mercury. Eating six a day, three at a time, three with each meat meal. Eat them six days a week. The best results I've had is eating three twice daily, six days a week, per year.

Q: Three twice daily.

A: Okay, there we have it folks. We did it.

Q: Yeah, all right.

[applause]

Q: When are you going to start training people to do what you do?

A: It depends on... I'm having trouble with the Thai government. I've already got the land. I've got the first house, my house, built ten days ago. And they stopped me. I got the lake half dug and they've stopped me from finishing that. They're saying that most of my land is forest. Because I'm at the foot of a national forest of a mountain. So they're telling me now that I can't. The people who sold it to me said I could do all this. And I should have gone to the forestry department and checked first. So I have to see what they're going to allow me to do, so I don't know. But if my investor comes through, it would probably be the earliest three years. Because I have to get crops and I have to get animals. Everything set so I've got the exact foods that I need to have people come to the clinic.

Q: It'll be like a college there?

A: Well, it'll be a clinic college.

Q: Where is this going to be?

A: This will be in Thailand.

Q: Oh, not in the Philippines.

A: No, no, that's my personal place, my getaway.

Q: Oh.

Q: Aren't they having political problems there right now?

Q: That's what I heard.

A: But that's in Bangkok.

Q: Where would you be?

A: Only Bangkok. I'm 12 hours drive from Bangkok, far away from Bangkok.  I'm out in the tules where there's no electricity.

Q: Wow. Which is how you like it.

A: Exactly. No road.

Q: How do you get there?

A: I had to add a greater road in.

Q: Really?

A: A mile road to get there. Philippines, I had to do a mile road there.

Q: Are you still going to be able to work on stem cells? Because you went once.

A: I'm never going to do that.

Q: Not you. Somebody else. You could get somebody.

A: Yeah. There's somebody on the diet I talked about earlier. Did all those hot baths.

Q: Yeah.

A: Yeah, he's still working with it.

Q: Guys, I thought we were done.

A: Okay. That's it, folks. Thank you very much.
