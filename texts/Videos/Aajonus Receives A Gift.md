A = Aajonus, H = Host

H: ... maybe shocked. So, um-
You know, you can take what you want to take though. I believe and had... had a lot of benefit with Aajonus' diet and theories. But I hope you enjoy it.
And, I believe you have, because many, many, people have given me very positive feedback.
I'm relieved to receive all your feedback.
And, for that positive feedback, as an expression of it, here's a gift for you from the audience.

A: Thank you. Thank you.

[applause]

A: What?

Woman: It's a box of chocolates. Don't worry. (sarcastic)

A: Oh, I hope so. [laughs]

[laughter]

A: Hershey's Kisses?

H: We're going to McDonald's later if you guys want to join.

[laughter]
