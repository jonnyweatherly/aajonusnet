A: Well, we happen to be the Primal Group. We're raw meat and dairy eaters. And, you can see how pretty fit we are.

K: Yeah. 

A: And that doesn't take anything from anybody else who can be fit in any way that they want to, and that's what the Raw Games are about. It's those people who can be fit in any way they can on a raw.

K: Exactly. Everyone's different. Everyone has their own path and their own individual diet plan that works best for them.
