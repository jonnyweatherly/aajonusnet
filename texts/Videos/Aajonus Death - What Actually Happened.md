Paul: We′re making this video, because people are asking you a lot of questions about Aajonus′s death. And the focus of the video are the two individuals in front of us, which essentially saw Aajonus in the hospital and have a little bit of a journey as far as getting to the hospital. Lucky, who we romantically refer to him as Lucky, Larry Otting. And Wasma, the masseuse of the decade, who′s also Thai, owns the property with Aajonus in Thailand. And were asked by me and potentially other people, maybe other people mentioned it to you, about going to, I′m Paul Kruhm by the way, mentioning to go to see, is this happening? Because, you know, there′s a lot of, he′s a mythical figure in that he had a lot of conversation about people trying to hurt him and things happening and accidents happening and things like this. There was enough, this seemed pretty standard, an accident had happened, we were notified of the accident. These two people went because we kind of wanted verification of that. So, you got the phone call from his girlfriend in the hospital, you knew that something was wrong, and the first person you called was Lucky. And what happened next?

Wasma: So, he just died on that phone and... 

Paul: Did you hear all that?

Wasma: Yeah, I hear when they were pumping, she told me, I'm shocked too, what happened? And that time, I never hear the story because no time to tell the story. She only tell he fall off the house and broken his back and he in a coma. Meanwhile, I went to Bangkok. He sent her to Bangkok to deal with the court thing.

Paul: Because the Thai government was having claim against the property, part of the property, no?

Wasma: No.

Lucky: Because the hospital wanted somebody to identify the bodies, right?

Wasma: No, no, that he sent her for him because he supposed to be in court for that.

Paul: Because there was a discrepancy on the property, the National Park Service.

Wasma: Different story. It's about the machine for...

Paul: Coconut cream?

Lucky: Yeah, coconut cream machine that we paid for and never got.

Paul: Got it. Okay.

Wasma: So at the time he was in a coma in the hospital, not in the coma, that time he's still speaking. And that's why he sent her to go to appear to court for him.

Paul: Right. But all the hospital stuff happened. And then obviously you guys got involved because, you know, you got a phone call from his girlfriend in Thailand.

Wasma: Yeah, she don't know who to tell in that moment because...

Lucky: She didn't know any of it.

Wasma: Yeah, she don't know what to do. Before that, she asking him to email to tell everybody here or whoever. He never do. She even open his computer and email and he never do it. The one he know, the one she know, she said he emailed someone in Japan. Anyone know his friend in Japan? He emailed that guy.

Paul: I don't know that. I could look at his computer to find out who he emailed. Yeah. But I don't know.

Wasma: The last email that she saw, he emailed that person in Japan.

Paul: The bottom line though is that you were on the phone with her when he was passing away.

Wasma: Yeah.

Paul: You essentially told Lucky that he, you know, Lucky's the first phone call. He's passed away. Then it kind of went through the community, people he knew, etc, etc. It did get to me and then you and I at some point had a conversation where I talked to Marilyn and said someone should go to see him to confirm this because we're hearing this and I believe this but it would be the right thing to do. Now, I didn't know how far away that you fly to Bangkok and I didn't know it was literally like, yeah, like traveling North America to get to where he was. But you were the optimal person to go because you speak the language, you're from the country, you know the place.

Wasma: I went one time.

Paul: One time. So you had an advantage over most people.

Wasma: Yeah, and the last time that I saw him too.

Paul: Yeah, he was there.

Wasma: Yeah, he was there.

Lucky: Who knew how to get to the farm when we were at the hospital? Was that you or Pawadee?

Wasma: Pawadee.

Lucky: Pawadee knew how to get to the farm. His farm from the hospital was a long way. He laid there suffering for hours before the hospital ambulance could find him. You had to go through locked gates and he was way back in there.

Wasma: In the woods.

Lucky: In the woods. You had to go through rice fields and locked gates. He owned like 20 acres of rice. Beautiful rice.

Wasma: He still talk. He, you know, giving information, you know, recipe what she make the food for him. He's taking food. He's talking. He a lot in pain. He take pain medication. But after she went, like, you know, went to Bangkok. It have to be, you know, one day, one night to coming back.

Paul: Right.

Wasma: When she came back, that's he already on a coma. She never get a chance to talk to him. He already in a coma after she went.

Paul: So he died, you guys went, you flew to Bangkok, and then you made the journey to where the hospital was.

Lucky: Her brother took us in his car.

Paul: Her brother took you, and then it took you a decent amount of time to even find out where he was in the hospital. Is that correct?

Wasma: Yeah.

Lucky: Yeah, it would have been about two days by the time we found him. Because we spent the night, and then we went into the hospital and found him. Then we went to the farm, and then we went back to Bangkok. Your brother took us out to the farm too, didn't he?

Wasma: Yeah.

Paul: And there were a lot of questions about, for instance, what did happen? I mean, is it an accident? You know, he had a lot of... his perception was there were a lot of people trying to hurt him. But you went to the farm and your, if I understand correctly, your outlook on what you saw was that this wasn't the most well-constructed house in the world. And it made total sense that this was simply an accident and that he'd fallen. You had seen the scene, you had seen the place, you had seen the property.

Lucky: It was a long fall. It was a long fall, like the height of that post right there, at least. So it was 12 feet, 14 feet. The board was still laying there. The rail was still laying on there. It only had one rail. There was no bottom rails, just the one rail on the top. That was it. And when that went, he just went right over it.

Paul: So not very kid-friendly and nothing was secure very well.

Lucky: The nail's only that far into the posts on both sides. I mean, it was very unsafe.

Wasma: Yeah, I even lean... In that night, we have a dinner. That's the night I went there. We have a dinner. I even lean to get the flower from the tree like this, from that rail. I just thought, like, wow.

Paul: You could've fallen.

Lucky: And you think Aajonus would build something so strong, he was always into making it. This was the worst construction I've ever seen, ever. The boards were literally breaking on the pathway out to the lake.

Paul: And during your journey out there, you actually broke them just walking on them.

Lucky: I broke two boards. They didn't fall through, but they cracked.

Paul: Yeah, well, that's not good. So that thing was just a, it was a disaster waiting to happen for anybody.

Lucky: And he had done such sweet things there. He had the most beautiful brown cows, remember those beautiful, the mama and the baby. And he had planted his little pineapple trees all in them out there, and he cleared the land. I mean, it was a hard place to survive in. Nothing I would, I mean, I think about my properties were nothing compared to what he had. And I think that's why he went to the Philippines.

Paul: He liked the Philippines.

Wasma: He put, that's why, because he had that for five years, he stopped putting anything in there. Only the plants, you know, can have, you know, to eat sometimes, you know, just because at the beginning, before he purchased that property, I asked him, what are you planning to get to this property for? So he said he just want to build like a, you know, like a healing space.

Paul: Healing center.

Wasma: Yeah. Healing center.

Jim: Yeah. He even showed me the blueprint.

Wasma: Yeah. He had a growing center. Yeah. And then, you know, growing food here and have good animal milk here. And people can come, like, stay in like a resort.

Paul: Right.

Wasma: Yeah, and maybe I'm just teaching them or maybe I, she's, you know, that time he's, you know, planning, but it doesn't go to the plan. He just stop everything. It's just only the house for he stay over for when he in Thailand, you know.

Paul: So obviously, like, the conversation, this conversation is more about, you know, him passing away. So obviously, you went to the farm, you realize, okay, this is more likely than anything else in the world, an accident. This is not a safe place.

Lucky: No one would have ever been able to get in there and hurt him.

Paul: Yeah.

Wasma: No.

Lucky: They would have never found him.

Paul: It was that hard to do? Literally, unless you would live, unless you had been there, you probably had no shot.

Lucky: You never find it. And there's gates. Remember, we had to have locks on those gates.

Wasma: Yeah.

Lucky: So you couldn't just drive in there. You could have walked, but it was a long walk.

Wasma: I even couldn't remember to get there, to get to the farm from the village.

Lucky: Right.

Wasma: I even get lost. I mean, I would drive past the village to go to the farm.

Lucky: He had a little village right by there, and then you'd go out to his farm. Probably, what, maybe 700, 800 people live there. I don't know. Small village.

Paul: So you realize that, obviously, you get there, you think, okay, this isn't safe. This makes total sense. It's an accident. You've seen his body in Bangkok.

Lucky: Talked to the surgeon.

Paul: Talked to the surgeon, seen the x-rays, seen the medical file, the whole nine yards. We spoke while you were out there, and you confirmed. That's Aajonus, I'm looking right at him. I mean, I've known the guy a billion years. This isn't confusing to me. It's not a guy in a mask. It's not someone they're just saying, yeah, it's not a fingerprint. The guy didn't blow up. He wasn't on fire. That's Aajonus. It's sad. We're all kind of mourning as that goes on, certainly myself included. You come back to the United States, and that's it. We know that after the fact, we know that he was cremated. You paid to do that, as well as his girlfriend did. We know that his body, we know the ashes are left in Thailand. We know they're on the property that he, I guess, still has, kind of. Not sure how to figure that out, yeah. So if anyone's looking for some Thai property that you can never find and probably you'll never get to, I'm sure you can contact Wasma for that. If you want to go visit Aajonus' ashes, which maybe someday I will, if I'm up for the 20-day journey of figuring out where it's at.

Lucky: You'd need somebody to help you get there, you'd never find it. There's no addresses.

Paul: I believe you. So, you know, Jim, I mean, you tell me, is this what you're looking for to try and put this conversation at rest? Because you know, I published his books, I've known him since 1990, I've lived with him, he was literally, just not figuratively, he was literally my dad. And you know, if I can find acceptance in that, because I was one of the first people to say, look, I believe this, but I still would like someone's eyes to see him. I was filming something at the time, or I would have got on a plane myself, I was in communication with the US State Department, I was in communication with the US military trying to help with the US State Department and his local Congress people to try and make sure of all this stuff. It was verified by multiple sources, including people that were his patients, his members and his friends. I don't know what else you want. I mean, what else are you looking for?

Jim: People called me when he died, people emailed me when he died saying what really happened. This is what really happened.

Paul: That's what really happened. So, so I wish it didn't happen, I wish we didn't have to have the conversation I wish he could pop into the frame right now. But no, he's not in Wisconsin or Arizona. Aajonus couldn't keep silent if you paid him a million dollars and gave it to him every week. He would be loud and he would be somewhere in the US Capitol right now screaming, yelling, and wanting everyone to throw him out. So it just makes zero sense that he just had enough of all of us and thought he'd hide someplace. It just makes no sense at all.
