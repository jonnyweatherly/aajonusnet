M: Aajonus, describe a little bit about the importance of raw dairy products in our bodies and, you know, how that helps sustain us and become healthy and overcome states of disease. 

A: Well, in our particular society, it's a little bit more important because we have so many toxins in the body and the body uses high amount of calcium, phosphate, potassium and magnesium, the alkalinizing minerals, to bind with those poisons and neutralize them so they don't damage us internally. Raw milk helps relax and feed the nervous system. Cream from dairy is the only thing that will completely nutrify the brain and nervous system.
