I know I am too late for the year-end holidays but there do not have to be special days to give our children natural, non-toxic toys. So here are a few for the new year and years to come.

Natural Baby (www.NaturalBaby-Catalog.com) has a selection of natural toys and naturally safe products for home and family, such as wooden toys, including first bricks block set, wooden rattles, colorful lacing toys, jump rope, treading beads, potholder loom, truck sets, double stacker and rings,


Natasha Fadeeva's stuffed animals (http://fadeeva.com/animals.html) from Russia are made from all natural wool.
Here are just a few very sophisticated toys:
